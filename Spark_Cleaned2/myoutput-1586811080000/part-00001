'''Hewanorra''', the name given by the native [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]. Part of the [[Lesser Antilles]], it is located north/northeast of the island of [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]], northwest of [[Barbados]] and south of [[Martinique]].

They signed a treaty with the native [[Island Caribs]] in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and the rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West Indies\" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].\n\nRepresentative government came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"GovC\">\n  \"The Saint Lucia Constitution\" (1978-December-20 effective\n  1979-February-22), Government of St. Lucia, December 2008,\n  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1901/made\n</ref> Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction,<ref>[http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/sys-juri/class-poli/sys-mixtes.php Mixed Legal Systems]. juriglobe.ca</ref> meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[English common law]].

The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around 200\u2013400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>\n\nThe more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Io\u00fcanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}\n\n===Early European period===\n[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|c\u00e9dula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.\n\nIn the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16\u201321}}\n\n===French colony===\n{{Main|French West Indies}}\n\nIn 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.<ref name=Statesmen>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}\n\nBoth the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.\n\nIn 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.\n\nIn January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60\u201365}}\n\nA short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.\n\nIn 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>\n\nThe slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.\n\nFrance and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.\n\nThe institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the [[British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship,\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.\n\nCastries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888\u20131890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Saint Lucia (1939\u20131967).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Saint Lucia]] 1939\u20131967]]\nThe best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905.

In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]].

Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, [[celery]], [[thyme]], [[coconut milk]], the very hot [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over [[ground provisions]] or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either saut\u00e9ed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.\n\nOne popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.\n\nDue to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.\n\n===LGBTQ non-acceptance===\n[[LGBT rights in Saint Lucia|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people living in Saint Lucia]] face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT members of the population.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref> Saint Lucia prohibits male-on-male sexual activity, punishing those found guilty with 10 years in jail.

They signed a treaty with the native [[Island Caribs]] in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France fourteen times, and the rule of the island changed frequently (it was ruled seven times each by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \"Helen of the West Indies\" after the Greek mythological character, [[Helen of Troy]].\n\nRepresentative government came about in 1840 (universal [[suffrage]] was established in 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the [[West Indies Federation]]. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state and a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name=\"GovC\">\n  \"The Saint Lucia Constitution\" (1978-December-20 effective\n  1979-February-22), Government of St. Lucia, December 2008,\n  http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1978/1901/made\n</ref> Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction,<ref>[http://www.juriglobe.ca/eng/sys-juri/class-poli/sys-mixtes.php Mixed Legal Systems]. juriglobe.ca</ref> meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[English common law]].

The Arawak are believed to have come from northern [[South America]] sometime around 200\u2013400 [[AD]], as there are numerous [[archeology|archaeological]] sites on the island where specimens of their well-developed [[pottery]] have been found. There is evidence to suggest that the Arawak called the island ''Iouanalao'', meaning 'Land of the Iguanas', due to the island's high number of [[iguana]]s.<ref name=AllAbout>[http://www.allaboutstlucia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=121 All about St Lucia: ''History'']</ref>\n\nThe more aggressive [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] arrived around 800 AD, and seized control from the Arawaks by killing their men and assimilating the women into their own society.<ref name=AllAbout/> They called the island ''Hewanarau'', and later ''Hewanorra'' (Io\u00fcanalao, or \"there where iguanas are found\").{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|p=10}}\n\n===Early European period===\n[[Christopher Columbus]] may have sighted the island during his fourth voyage in 1502, since he made landfall on [[Martinique]], yet he does not mention the island in his log. [[Juan de la Cosa]] noted the island on his map of 1500, calling it El Falcon, and another island to the south Las Agujas. A Spanish [[Cedula|c\u00e9dula]] from 1511 mentions the island within the Spanish domain, and a globe in the Vatican made in 1520, shows the island as Sancta Lucia.\n\nIn the late 1550s, the French [[pirate]] [[Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc]] (known as ''Jambe de Bois'', due to his wooden leg) set up a camp on [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]], from where he attacked passing Spanish ships. In 1605, an English vessel called the ''Oliphe Blossome'' was blown off-course on its way to [[Guyana]], and the 67 colonists started a settlement on Saint Lucia, after initially being welcomed by the Carib chief Anthonie. By 26 September 1605 only 19 survived following continued attacks by the Carib chief Augraumart, so the settlers fled the island.{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=16\u201321}}\n\n===French colony===\n{{Main|French West Indies}}\n\nIn 1664, Thomas Warner (son of [[Thomas Warner (explorer)|Sir Thomas Warner]], the governor of [[St Kitts]]) claimed Saint Lucia for England. He brought 1,000 men to defend it from the French, but after two years, only 89 survived with the rest dying mostly due to disease. In 1666, the [[French West India Company]] resumed control of the island, which in 1674 was made an official French crown colony as a dependency of Martinique.<ref name=Statesmen>[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Saint_Lucia.html World Statesmen: ''Saint Lucia Chronology''] Linked 2014-01-20</ref>\n\n===18th and 19th centuries===\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands}}\n\nBoth the British and the French found the island attractive after the slave-based sugar industry developed, and during the 18th century the island changed ownership or was declared neutral territory a dozen times, although the French settlements remained and the island was a de facto French colony well into the eighteenth century.\n\nIn 1722, [[George I of Great Britain]] granted both Saint Lucia and [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]] to [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu|The 2nd Duke of Montagu]]. He in turn appointed [[Nathaniel Uring]], a merchant sea captain and adventurer, as deputy-governor. Uring went to the islands with a group of seven ships, and established settlement at Petit Carenage. Unable to get enough support from British warships, he and the new colonists were quickly run off by the French.<ref>{{DNB|wstitle=Montagu, John (1688?-1749)|first=Henry Manners |last=Chichester|volume=38}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Seven Years' War]], Britain occupied Saint Lucia for a year. Britain handed the island back to the French at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Like the English and Dutch on other islands, the French began to develop the land for the cultivation of sugar cane as a commodity crop on large plantations in 1765.\n\nIn January 1791, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] sent four ''commissaires'' to St Lucia to spread their revolutionary philosophy. By August 1791, slaves began to abandon their estates and Governor de Gimat fled.  In December 1792, Lt. [[Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse]] arrived with revolutionary pamphlets, and the impoverished whites and free people of color began to arm themselves as ''patriots''. On 1 February 1793, France declared war on England and Holland, and General [[Nicolas Xavier de Ricard]] took over as Governor.  The [[National Convention]] abolished enslavement on 4 February 1794, but St. Lucia fell to a British invasion led by Vice Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|John Jervis]] on 1 April 1794. [[Morne Fortune]] became ''Fort Charlotte''. Soon, a patriot army of resistance, ''L'Armee Fran\u00e7aise dans les Bois'', began to fight back.  Thus started the [[First Brigand War]].{{sfn|Harmsen|Ellis|Devaux|2014|pp=60\u201365}}\n\nA short time later the British invaded the island as a part of the recently broken out war with France. On 21 February 1795 and a group of locals under the nominal control of [[Victor Hugues]] defeated a battalion of British troops at Vieux Fort and Rabot. In 1796, [[Castries]] was burned as part of the conflict. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|General John Moore]] retook Fort Charlotte in 1796 with the [[27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot|27th Inniskilling Fusiliers]] after two days of bitter fighting. As an honour, the Fusiliers' regimental colour was displayed on the flagstaff of the captured fortress at [[Morne Fortune]] for an hour before being replaced by the [[Union Jack]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Trimble|first=Copeland|title=Historical record of the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment from the period of its institution as a volunteer corps till the present time|publisher=William Clowes|year=1876|url=https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog|page=[https://archive.org/details/historicalrecor02goog/page/n83 49]}}</ref> Moore would then participate in British efforts to repress the slave rebels until falling ill of [[yellow fever]], upon which he returned to Britain before 1798.\n\nIn 1803, the British regained control of the island. Many of the rebels escaped into the thick rainforest where they evaded capture and established [[maroon communities]].<ref>''They Called Us the Brigands. The Saga of St. Lucia's Freedom Fighters'' by Robert J Devaux</ref>\n\nThe slavery on the island was continued for a short time, but anti-slavery sentiment was rising in Britain. The British stopped the import of slaves by anyone, white or coloured, when they [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolished the slave trade]] in 1807.\n\nFrance and Great Britain continued to contest Saint Lucia until the British secured it in 1814, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Thereafter, Saint Lucia was considered part of the [[British Windward Islands]] colony.\n\nThe institution of slavery was abolished on the island in 1836, as it was throughout the [[British Empire]]. After abolition, all former slaves had to serve a four-year \"apprenticeship,\" to accustom them to the idea of freedom. During this period, they worked for their former masters for at least three-quarters of the work week. Full freedom was duly granted by the British in 1838. By that time, people of African ethnicity greatly outnumbered those of ethnic European background. Some people of Carib descent also comprised a minority on the island.\n\nCastries' harbour was protected by a system of 60 surrounding forts. Along the top of Morne Fortune there are six military sites, building work by the French started in 1768, and the British completed the work by 1890. They include Fort Charlotte (Old Morne Fortress), the Apostle's Battery (1888\u20131890), The Powder Magazine built by the French in the 1750s, Provost's [[Redoubt]] (1792) built as a lookout point, and the Combermere [[barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cameron|first1=Sarah|title=St Lucia & Dominica Footprint Focus Guide: Includes Fort-de-France ...|date=2013|publisher=Footprint Travel Guides|isbn=9781909268319|page=32|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9MH9AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA32&dq=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=bagshaw%20st%20lucia&f=false|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Saint Lucia (1939\u20131967).svg|thumb|[[Flag of Saint Lucia]] 1939\u20131967]]\nThe best preserved installation is a battery at La Toc Point, completed in 1888 it was not abandoned till 1905.

In 1967, Saint Lucia became one of the six members of the West Indies Associated States, with internal self-government. In 1979, it gained full independence under [[Sir John Compton]] of the conservative [[United Workers Party (Saint Lucia)|United Workers party (UWP)]].

However, with the US, Canada, and Europe in recession, tourism declined by double digits in early 2009. The recent change in the [[European Union]] import preference regime and the increased competition from Latin American bananas have made economic diversification increasingly important in Saint Lucia.\n\nSaint Lucia has been able to attract foreign business and investment, especially in its offshore banking and tourism industries, which is Saint Lucia's main source of revenue. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area, and the government is trying to revitalise the banana industry. Despite negative growth in 2011, economic fundamentals remain solid, and GDP growth should recover in the future.\n\nInflation has been relatively low, averaging 5.5 percent between 2006 and 2008.

Typical essential foodstuffs are potatoes, onions, [[celery]], [[thyme]], [[coconut milk]], the very hot [[Scotch bonnet|scotch bonnet peppers]], flour, and cornmeal. All mainstream meat and poultry are eaten in St. Lucia; meat and seafood are normally stewed and browned to create a rich gravy sometimes served over [[ground provisions]] or rice. The island is also home to the famous fried dough, known by many as a bake or Johnny Cake. These bakes can be served with different sides, such as saltfish which is either saut\u00e9ed or lightly fried along with red, green peppers, onions, and seasoned well. This is the most common way for bake to be prepared, though it can also be served with meats such as stewed chicken or beef.\n\nOne popular Saint Lucian dessert is the pastry called a turnover. The pastry is made with sweetened coconut that is boiled with spices, some sugar, and whatever is satisfying. It is boiled until cooked to a light or dark brown colour; then the mixture is separated into various size portions placed on a rolled out piece of dough. The dough size may vary too depending on how much is desired, and lastly, it is baked in the oven until the colour of the turnover is nicely browned.\n\nDue to Saint Lucia's Indo-Caribbean population, curry is very popular; however due to the blend of cooking styles, curry dishes have a distinct Caribbean twist. Roti is typically served as a fast food meal: the bread itself is very flat (sometimes very thin) and is wrapped around curried vegetables such as chickpeas and potato, seafood such as shrimp and conch, or meats such as chicken, beef, goat, and liver.\n\n===LGBTQ non-acceptance===\n[[LGBT rights in Saint Lucia|Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people living in Saint Lucia]] face legal challenges not experienced by non-LGBT members of the population.<ref>{{cite news |first=Daniel |last=Avery |title=71 Countries Where Homosexuality is Illegal |url=https://www.newsweek.com/73-countries-where-its-illegal-be-gay-1385974 |work=Newsweek |date=4 April 2019}}</ref> Saint Lucia prohibits male-on-male sexual activity, punishing those found guilty with 10 years in jail.
