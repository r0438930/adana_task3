Four wheel [[disc brake]]s were manufactured by [[Girling Brakes|Girling]]. All calipers had three pistons, with larger calipers used in the front. Solid disks were used at first, with vented discs added for the Series II Espada. The steering box was a worm-and-peg type manufactured by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] and mounted at the top front of the chassis, with very long steering column. Power steering would be offered on the Series III Espadas.

Six [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 40DCOE side-draft [[carburator|carburetor]]s were equipped, along with a single [[distributor]] for ignition. Wet sump lubrication was used, with an oil capacity of {{Convert|14|L|gal|abbr=}}. The weight of the engine alone was {{Convert|232|kg|lbs|abbr=}}, or {{Convert|293|kg|lbs|abbr=}} including the transmission.

Most Espadas were equipped with a Lamborghini-designed 5-speed [[manual transmission]] with hydraulically operated clutch.

The suspension system was developed in collaboration with Langen, a German company owned by the suspension component manufacturer Ehrenreich. This system was possibly developed in order to compete with the [[Ferrari 365 GT 2+2]], which was also equipped with self-leveling rear suspension.

Four wheel [[disc brake]]s were manufactured by [[Girling Brakes|Girling]]. All calipers had three pistons, with larger calipers used in the front. Solid disks were used at first, with vented discs added for the Series II Espada. The steering box was a worm-and-peg type manufactured by [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] and mounted at the top front of the chassis, with very long steering column. Power steering would be offered on the Series III Espadas. Series I and II Espadas were originally fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72), while Series II cars used 215/70VR15 Cinturato CN12 tires.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTwin [[fuel tank]]s held {{convert|93|l|gal|0|abbr=on}} of gasoline.

Most Espadas were equipped with a Lamborghini-designed 5-speed [[manual transmission]] with hydraulically operated clutch. The internal components of this transmission were identical to those used in the Miura and Islero, with the transmission casing also shared with the Islero but differing from the Miura, due to that model's transverse mid-engine layout.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nFrom 1974, the Series III Espada could be ordered with a [[TorqueFlite|Chrysler Torqueflite]] 3 speed [[automatic transmission]].

It had the very low nose and gullwing doors of the Marzal, but a front end treatment much closer to the production Espada. An unusual configuration of multiple large side windows was designed, possibly to improve rear 3/4 vision. The engine, transmission and rear differential were all 400 GT units.

The suspension system was developed in collaboration with Langen, a German company owned by the suspension component manufacturer Ehrenreich. This system was possibly developed in order to compete with the [[Ferrari 365 GT 2+2]], which was also equipped with self-leveling rear suspension. According to Lamborghini test driver [[Bob Wallace (test driver)|Bob Wallace]], the Lancomatic suspension was promising but very costly and had significant technical issues, including seal failure due to heat and friction and harsh ride quality.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Lyons|first=Pete|title=The Complete Book of Lamborghini|date=1988|publisher=Beekman House|isbn=|location=New York|pages=106\u2013122|oclc=18937830}}</ref>\n\n===Lamborghini Faena===\n[[File:Lamborghini Faena 1978 seitlich.JPG|thumb|The one-off Lamborghini Faena was based on the Espada.]]\nThe '''Lamborghini Faena''' is a one-off 4-door sedan based on a Series II Espada and built by [[coachbuilder]] [[Pietro Frua]].
