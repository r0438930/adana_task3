However, in the 1970s there were allegations that the RCMP Security Service had been involved in numerous illegal activities. As a result of these allegations, in 1977, Justice David Macdonald was appointed to investigate the activities of RCMP Security Service. The resulting investigation, known as the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP|McDonald Commission]], published its final report in 1981, with its main recommendation being that security intelligence work should be separated from policing, and that a civilian intelligence agency be created to take over from the RCMP Security Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ps-sp.gc.ca/prg/ns/airs/rep1-4-eng.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629115242/http://www.ps-sp.gc.ca/prg/ns/airs/rep1-4-eng.aspx |archivedate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn June 21, 1984, CSIS was created by an [[Parliament of Canada|Act of Parliament]]. At the time it was also decided that the activities of this new agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, should be subject to both judicial approval for warrants, as well as general review by a new body, the [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]], as well as the office of the Inspector General (which was disbanded in 2012). Its ''[[de facto]]'' existence began on July 16 under the direction of [[Ted Finn|Thomas D'Arcy Finn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/about_us/history_artifacts/history/brf_csis_index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624182416/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/about_us/history_artifacts/history/brf_csis_index.asp |archivedate=2007-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nAt first, the main emphasis of CSIS was combating the activities of various foreign intelligence agencies operating in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/hstrrtfcts/rtfcts/index-eng.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601021026/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/hstrrtfcts/rtfcts/index-eng.asp |archivedate=2012-06-01 }}</ref> For example, it has been engaged in investigating economic espionage involving Chinese operations throughout Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=ca90416e-fe77-4b8d-ae59-a4e9f55b6441&k=26688 |title=Government vows to curb Chinese spying on Canada |publisher=Canada.com |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2011-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004005118/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=ca90416e-fe77-4b8d-ae59-a4e9f55b6441&k=26688# |archive-date=2014-10-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While the threat posed by foreign intelligence agencies still remain, CSIS over the years has focused more and more on the threat to Canadian security and its citizens posed by terrorist activity.\n\n==Insignia==\n\nCSIS is one of several  [[Heraldic badges of the Canadian government|federal departments]] (primarily those involved with law enforcement, security, or having a regulatory function) that has been granted a heraldic badge.

The agency may collect information on threats to Canada or Canadians from anywhere in the world. While CSIS is often viewed as a defensive ''security intelligence'' agency, it is not a domestic agency. CSIS officers work partly domestically and most often internationally in their efforts to monitor and counter threats to Canadian security.\n\nThere is a distinction between \"security intelligence\" and \"foreign intelligence\". Security intelligence pertains to national security threats (e.g., [[terrorism]], [[espionage]]). Foreign intelligence involves information collection relating to the political or economic activities of foreign states. Previous law stated that CSIS was only allowed to collect this intelligence  within Canada but with updated law in 2016 they are now allowed to collect That intelligence abroad as well. Since 2016 Most domestic on the ground tasks are handed over to the RCMP.\n\nCSIS has served in many different countries, especially after 9/11. Examples of some of the countries they have served in are: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Mali, Libya, Sudan, Pakistan, Somalia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.       \n\nCSIS is neither a police agency nor is it a part of the military. As an intelligence agency, the primary role of CSIS is not law enforcement. Investigation of criminal activity is left to the RCMP and local (provincial, regional or municipal) police agencies. CSIS, like counterparts such as the [[United Kingdom]] Security Service ([[MI5]]) and the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), is a civilian agency. CSIS is subject to review by the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) as well as other legislative checks and balances. The agency carries out its functions in accordance with the CSIS Act, which governs and defines its powers and activities.\n\nCanadian police, military agencies (see [[Intelligence Branch (Canadian Forces)|Canadian Forces Intelligence Branch]]), and numerous other government departments may maintain their own \"intelligence\" components (i.e. to analyze criminal intelligence or military strategic intelligence). The [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] maintains a Security and Intelligence Bureau to review and analyze overtly acquired information.  The bureau plays a coordinating and policy role. While not an intelligence agency, it is responsible for the security of Department of Foreign Affairs personnel around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stenotran.com/commission/maherarar/2005-05-17%20volume%2011.pdf |title=P:\\Commissions of Inquiry\\Maher Arar\\2005-05-17 volume 11.wpd |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110400/http://www.stenotran.com/commission/maherarar/2005-05-17%20volume%2011.pdf# |archive-date=2011-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, these agencies are not to be confused with the more encompassing work of larger, more dedicated \"intelligence agencies\" such as CSIS, MI5, [[MI6]], or the CIA.\n\nAs Canada's contributor of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence]] to the [[Five Eyes]], CSIS works closely with the intelligence agencies of the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Under the post\u2013World War II [[Quadripartite Agreement (1947)|Quadripartite (UKUSA) Agreement]], intelligence information is shared between the intelligence agencies of these five countries.\n\nPermission to put a subject under surveillance is granted by the [[Target Approval and Review Committee]].\n\n[[Security Liaison Officer]]s (SLOs) of CSIS are posted at Canadian embassies and consulates to gather security-related intelligence from other nations. This information may be gathered from other national intelligence agencies, law enforcement services and other sources. SLOs also assess potential immigrants to Canada for security issues.\n\nCSIS has been named one of \"[[Canada's Top 100 Employers]]\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. for the years of 2009\u20132011, and was featured in ''[[Maclean's]]'' newsmagazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eluta.ca/jobs-at-csis|title=All jobs at Canadian Security Intelligence Service / CSIS &#124; Eluta.ca|website=www.eluta.ca}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Regional===\nCSIS headquarters is located in Ottawa, Ontario and is responsible for the overall operations.

However, in the 1970s there were allegations that the RCMP Security Service had been involved in numerous illegal activities. As a result of these allegations, in 1977, Justice David Macdonald was appointed to investigate the activities of RCMP Security Service. The resulting investigation, known as the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry into Certain Activities of the RCMP|McDonald Commission]], published its final report in 1981, with its main recommendation being that security intelligence work should be separated from policing, and that a civilian intelligence agency be created to take over from the RCMP Security Service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ps-sp.gc.ca/prg/ns/airs/rep1-4-eng.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629115242/http://www.ps-sp.gc.ca/prg/ns/airs/rep1-4-eng.aspx |archivedate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>\n\nOn June 21, 1984, CSIS was created by an [[Parliament of Canada|Act of Parliament]]. At the time it was also decided that the activities of this new agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, should be subject to both judicial approval for warrants, as well as general review by a new body, the [[Security Intelligence Review Committee]], as well as the office of the Inspector General (which was disbanded in 2012). Its ''[[de facto]]'' existence began on July 16 under the direction of [[Ted Finn|Thomas D'Arcy Finn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/about_us/history_artifacts/history/brf_csis_index.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624182416/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/en/about_us/history_artifacts/history/brf_csis_index.asp |archivedate=2007-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nAt first, the main emphasis of CSIS was combating the activities of various foreign intelligence agencies operating in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/hstrrtfcts/rtfcts/index-eng.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601021026/http://www.csis-scrs.gc.ca/hstrrtfcts/rtfcts/index-eng.asp |archivedate=2012-06-01 }}</ref> For example, it has been engaged in investigating economic espionage involving Chinese operations throughout Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=ca90416e-fe77-4b8d-ae59-a4e9f55b6441&k=26688 |title=Government vows to curb Chinese spying on Canada |publisher=Canada.com |date=2006-04-16 |accessdate=2011-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004005118/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=ca90416e-fe77-4b8d-ae59-a4e9f55b6441&k=26688# |archive-date=2014-10-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While the threat posed by foreign intelligence agencies still remain, CSIS over the years has focused more and more on the threat to Canadian security and its citizens posed by terrorist activity.\n\n==Insignia==\n\nCSIS is one of several  [[Heraldic badges of the Canadian government|federal departments]] (primarily those involved with law enforcement, security, or having a regulatory function) that has been granted a heraldic badge.

The agency may collect information on threats to Canada or Canadians from anywhere in the world. While CSIS is often viewed as a defensive ''security intelligence'' agency, it is not a domestic agency. CSIS officers work partly domestically and most often internationally in their efforts to monitor and counter threats to Canadian security.\n\nThere is a distinction between \"security intelligence\" and \"foreign intelligence\". Security intelligence pertains to national security threats (e.g., [[terrorism]], [[espionage]]). Foreign intelligence involves information collection relating to the political or economic activities of foreign states. Previous law stated that CSIS was only allowed to collect this intelligence  within Canada but with updated law in 2016 they are now allowed to collect That intelligence abroad as well. Since 2016 Most domestic on the ground tasks are handed over to the RCMP.\n\nCSIS has served in many different countries especially after 9/11 examples of some of the countries they have served in are: Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Mali, Libya, Sudan,Pakistan , Somalia, Qatar, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates.       \n\nCSIS is neither a police agency nor is it a part of the military. As an intelligence agency, the primary role of CSIS is not law enforcement. Investigation of criminal activity is left to the RCMP and local (provincial, regional or municipal) police agencies. CSIS, like counterparts such as the [[United Kingdom]] Security Service ([[MI5]]) and the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), is a civilian agency. CSIS is subject to review by the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) as well as other legislative checks and balances. The agency carries out its functions in accordance with the CSIS Act, which governs and defines its powers and activities.\n\nCanadian police, military agencies (see [[Intelligence Branch (Canadian Forces)|Canadian Forces Intelligence Branch]]), and numerous other government departments may maintain their own \"intelligence\" components (i.e. to analyze criminal intelligence or military strategic intelligence). The [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] maintains a Security and Intelligence Bureau to review and analyze overtly acquired information.  The bureau plays a coordinating and policy role. While not an intelligence agency, it is responsible for the security of Department of Foreign Affairs personnel around the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stenotran.com/commission/maherarar/2005-05-17%20volume%2011.pdf |title=P:\\Commissions of Inquiry\\Maher Arar\\2005-05-17 volume 11.wpd |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110400/http://www.stenotran.com/commission/maherarar/2005-05-17%20volume%2011.pdf# |archive-date=2011-06-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, these agencies are not to be confused with the more encompassing work of larger, more dedicated \"intelligence agencies\" such as CSIS, MI5, [[MI6]], or the CIA.\n\nAs Canada's contributor of [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence]] to the [[Five Eyes]], CSIS works closely with the intelligence agencies of the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]]. Under the post\u2013World War II [[Quadripartite Agreement (1947)|Quadripartite (UKUSA) Agreement]], intelligence information is shared between the intelligence agencies of these five countries.\n\nPermission to put a subject under surveillance is granted by the [[Target Approval and Review Committee]].\n\n[[Security Liaison Officer]]s (SLOs) of CSIS are posted at Canadian embassies and consulates to gather security-related intelligence from other nations. This information may be gathered from other national intelligence agencies, law enforcement services and other sources. SLOs also assess potential immigrants to Canada for security issues.\n\nCSIS has been named one of \"[[Canada's Top 100 Employers]]\" by Mediacorp Canada Inc. for the years of 2009\u20132011, and was featured in ''[[Maclean's]]'' newsmagazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eluta.ca/jobs-at-csis|title=All jobs at Canadian Security Intelligence Service / CSIS &#124; Eluta.ca|website=www.eluta.ca}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\n\n===Regional===\nCSIS headquarters is located in Ottawa, Ontario and is responsible for the overall operations.
