Released in the United States in 1982 with an R rating, the film influenced many writers in the [[teen film]] genre and spawned two sequels: ''[[Porky's II: The Next Day]]'' (1983) and ''[[Porky's Revenge!]]'' (1985) and a remake of the original titled ''[[Pimpin' Pee Wee|Porky's Pimpin' Pee Wee]]'' (2009). ''Porky's'' was the [[1982 in film#Highest-grossing films (U.S.)|fifth-highest-grossing film of 1982]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954, each boy in a group of  Florida high school students plans to lose his [[virginity]]. They go to Porky's, a [[strip club|nightclub]] in the [[Everglades]], believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. The bordello's proprietor, Porky, takes their money but humiliates the boys by dumping them into the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, Porky's brother, drives them away, but not before he extorts them for the rest of their money, further embarrassing them.\n\nAfter Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually sinking Porky's establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase the group, but the boys make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where local police officers and the high school band meet them. One of the officers, Mickey's older brother Ted, repeatedly damages Porky's car, promising to drop all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys are too young to have been  allowed into Porky's legally, Porky and his brother agree.\n\nIn a subplot, the boys peep on co-ed students in girl's locker room shower, and Tommy, Billy, and Pee Wee see several girls showering. Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a heavier girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap. Infuriated, he drops his pants and sticks his penis through the opening just before female coach Beulah Balbricker (who has a running feud with Tommy) walks into the shower area. Spotting the protruding member, she sneaks up on Tommy, grabs his penis and pulls with all her might. Tommy pulls free and escapes, but Beulah is determined to prove that the offending member (which has a mole on it) belongs to Tommy, going so far as to request that Principal Carter hold a police-type line-up of the boys in the nude so she can identify it. However, Carter balks at her request. As the other basketball coaches laugh, Coach Brackett suggests asking the police to send a sketch artist and hang wanted posters around the school. When this suggestion gets even Carter laughing, Balbricker leaves in a huff. She sneaks out of the bushes to ambush Tommy and actually drags his pants down, but she is pulled off him by police and dragged away screaming that she saw \"it\" and that she can identify its owner. Tommy breaks the [[fourth wall]], saying, \"Jeez!\" to the camera.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Dan Monahan]] as Edward \"Pee Wee\" Morris\n* [[Mark Herrier]] as Billy McCarty\n* [[Wyatt Knight]] as Tommy Turner\n* [[Roger Wilson (actor)|Roger Wilson]] as Mickey Jarvis\n* [[Cyril O'Reilly]] as Tim Cavanaugh\n* [[Tony Ganios]] as Anthony \"Meat\" Tuperello\n* [[Kaki Hunter]] as Wendy Williams\n* [[Kim Cattrall]] as Miss Lynn \"Lassie\" Honeywell\n* [[Nancy Parsons]] as Coach Beulah Balbricker\n* [[Scott Colomby]] as Brian Schwartz\n* [[Boyd Gaines]] as Coach Roy Brackett\n* [[Doug McGrath]] as Coach Fred Warren\n* [[Susan Clark]] as Cherry Forever\n* [[Art Hindle]] as Ted Jarvis\n* [[Wayne Maunder]] as Cavanaugh\n* [[Alex Karras]] as Sheriff Wallace\n* [[Chuck Mitchell]] as Porky Wallace\n* [[Eric Christmas]] as Mr. Carter\n* [[Jack Mulcahy (actor)|Jack Mulcahy]] as Frank Bell\n* [[Will Knickerbacker|Will Knickerbocker]] as The Bartender\n* [[Bill Hindman|Bill Hindman]] as Coach Goodenough\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nBob Clark got the idea to make the film in 1972.

[[James Komack]] directed the third film, ''Porky's Revenge''. Clark based the original ''Porky's'' on actual occurrences at [[Boca Ciega High School]] in [[Gulfport, Florida]], and [[Fort Lauderdale High School]] in the early 1960s, and on a venue called Porky's Hide Away in [[Oakland Park, Florida]].<ref name=\"miami\" />\n\nFollowing the success of ''Porky's'' in [[America]] and [[Europe]], a sequel titled ''[[Porky's II: The Next Day]]'' was released in 1983. The sequel was poorly received by critics, and was less commercially successful than the original. Bob Clark did not want to make another film in the series, so director James Komack made the third and last part of the saga. The film was called ''[[Porky's Revenge!]]'', and was the worst-received of the series both critically and commercially.\n\n==Remake==\nIn 2002, [[Howard Stern]] acquired the [[remake]] rights and has long hoped to produce a remake of the film.

The bonus material for the Blu-ray is the bonus material from the \"One Size Fits All\" Edition that focuses on the [[movie]] itself.

[[James Komack]] directed the third film, ''Porky's Revenge''. Clark based the original ''Porky's'' on actual occurrences at [[Boca Ciega High School]] in [[Gulfport, Florida]], and [[Fort Lauderdale High School]] in the early 1960s, and on a venue called Porky's Hide Away in [[Oakland Park, Florida]].<ref name=\"miami\" />\n\nFollowing the success of ''Porky's'' in [[America]] and [[Europe]], a sequel titled ''[[Porky's II: The Next Day]]'' was released in 1983. The sequel was poorly received by critics, and was less commercially successful than the original. Bob Clark did not want to make another film in the series, so director James Komack made the third and last part of the saga. The film was called ''[[Porky's Revenge!]]'', and was the worst-received of the series both critically and commercially.\n\n==Remake==\nIn 2002, [[Howard Stern]] acquired the [[remake]] rights and has long hoped to produce a remake of the film. The potential remake ran into legal trouble in 2011 when two other production companies stepped forward claiming to own the rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Will a Legal Fight Ensnare Howard Stern's Planned 'Porky's' Remake?
