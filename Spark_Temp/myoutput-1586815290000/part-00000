In 1989, the Antonov Design Bureau set up a holding company as a heavy airlift shipping corporation under the name \"[[Antonov Airlines]]\", based in [[Kiev]], Ukraine and operating from [[London Luton Airport]] in partnership with [[Air Foyle HeavyLift]].<ref name=\"antonov\"/><ref name=\"goleta\">{{cite web |url=http://www.air-and-space.com/Antonov%20An-225%20Mriya.htm |website=Goleta Air & Space Museum |title=An-225 Mriya, NATO: Cossack |accessdate=31 March 2004}}</ref>\n\nThe company began operations with a fleet of four An-124-100s and three [[Antonov An-12]]s, but a need for aircraft larger than the An-124 became apparent in the late 1990s. In response, the original An-225 was re-engined, modified for heavy cargo transport, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines.\n\n[[File:An-225 Mriya.jpg|thumb|Antonov An-225 at [[Gostomel Airport]], [[Ukraine]]]]\nOn 23 May 2001, the An-225 received its type certificate from the Interstate Aviation Committee Aviation Register (IAC AR).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mak.ru/english/kommissions/aviareg/certificates/sertifikati_tipa_na_vozdushnie_suda.html |title=Type Certificates for Aircraft |accessdate=8 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430200431/http://www.mak.ru/english/kommissions/aviareg/certificates/sertifikati_tipa_na_vozdushnie_suda.html |archivedate=30 April 2008  }}</ref> On 11 September 2001, carrying four [[main battle tank]]s<ref name=\"ramAn225\"/> at a record load of {{convert|253.82|t|ST}} of cargo,<ref name=\"FAI_payload_record\"/> the An-225 flew at an altitude of up to {{convert|10750|m|ft|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"FAI_250t_height\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7133 |title=Height record with 250t payload in the FAI database |access-date=2 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104240/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7133 |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> over a closed circuit of {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} at a speed of {{convert|763.2|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"FAI_250t_speed_record\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7131 |title=Speed record with 250t payload over 1000km closed circuit in the official FAI database |accessdate=2 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104236/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=7131 |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Special planes: The Antonov-225 Mriya\">{{Cite journal |url= http://www.eurotrib.com/story/2006/4/8/13392/35796 |title= Special planes: The Antonov-225 \"Mriya\" |publisher=European Tribune |date= 8 April 2006 |postscript=.}}</ref> The hire cost can be $30,000 per hour.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Skyba |first1=Christian Borys / Pictures by Anton |title=The world\u2019s biggest plane may have a new mission |url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20170503-the-worlds-biggest-plane-may-have-a-new-mission |website=www.bbc.com |language=en |date=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe An-225 attracts a high degree of public interest, so much that it has managed to attain a global following due to its size and its uniqueness.
