The portrait was given to the [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] on its foundation in 1856, and it is listed as the first work in its collection.<ref name = \"NPG\">Tarnya Cooper (ed), Searching for Shakespeare, National Portrait Gallery and Yale Center for British Art, Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 54\u201361</ref>\n\nIt has not been possible to determine with certainty who painted the portrait, nor whether it really depicts Shakespeare. However, the National Portrait Gallery naively believes that it probably does depict the writer.\n\n==Authorship and provenance==\n[[File:Title page William Shakespeare's First Folio 1623.jpg|thumb|left|Engraved portrait of Shakespeare by Martin Droeshout, on the title page of the first publication of his works, the ''First Folio'', shows distinct similarities when compared to the oil painting]]\n[[File:Soest portrait of Shakespeare.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Soest Portrait\" of Shakespeare.]]\n[[File:Chesterfield portrait.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Chesterfield Portrait\" of Shakespeare.]]\nIt has been claimed that Shakespeare's friend [[Richard Burbage]] (1567\u20131619) painted the Chandos portrait,<ref name = \"mags\">Mary Edmond, \"The Chandos Portrait: A Suggested Painter\",\n''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 124, No. 948, March 1982, pp. 146-147+149.</ref>  but the first known reference to the painting is in a note written in 1719 by [[George Vertue]], who states that it was painted by [[John Taylor (painter)|John Taylor]], a respected member of the [[Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers|Painter-Stainers' company]] who may also have been the same John Taylor who acted with the [[Children of Paul's]].<ref name=\"cooper54\">Cooper et al., 54.</ref> Vertue refers to Taylor as an actor and painter and as Shakespeare's \"intimate friend\". [[Katherine Duncan-Jones]] argues that 'John Taylor' could have been a misreading of what had originally been \"Jo: Taylor\"; she suggests that this may refer to the actor [[Joseph Taylor (actor)|Joseph Taylor]], who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the older Shakespeare.<ref>[[Katherine Duncan-Jones]], [http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/multimedia/archive/00750/CONTENTS_750590a.pdf \"A precious memento: The Chandos Portrait and Shakespeare's 'intimate friend'\"], ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', April 25, 2014, pp.13\u201315.</ref> \n\nVertue also states that before the Duke of Chandos acquired it, the portrait was owned by Shakespeare's possible godson, [[William Davenant]] (1606\u20131668),<ref name = \"mags\"/><ref name=\"cooper54\"/> who, according to the gossip chronicler [[John Aubrey]], claimed to be the playwright's illegitimate son.<ref>{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Anthony|title=Some Poets, Artists & \"A Reference for Mellors\"|publisher=Timewell Press|year=2005|isbn=1-85725-210-1|page=30}}</ref> He also states that it was left to Davenant in Taylor's will and that it was bought by [[Thomas Betterton]] from Davenant and then sold to the lawyer Robert Keck, a collector of Shakespeare memorabilia.<ref name = \"NPG\"/><ref name = \"mags\"/>\n\nAfter Keck's death in 1719, it passed to his daughter, and was inherited by John Nichol, who married into the Keck family. Nichol's daughter Margaret married [[James Brydges, 3rd Duke of Chandos]]. The painting passed through descent within the Chandos title until [[Richard Temple-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos]] sold it to the [[Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere|Earl of Ellesmere]] in 1848. Ellesmere donated it to the National Portrait Gallery.<ref>Werner Habicht, David John Palmer, Roger Pringle, ''Images of Shakespeare: Proceedings of the Third Congress of the International Shakespeare Association, 1986'', International Shakespeare Association Congress, University of Delaware Press, 1986, p.27</ref>\n\n==Scholarly views==\nA contemporary image of the playwright is the [[engraving]] in the posthumously published [[First Folio]] of 1623, which was created by [[Martin Droeshout]] and was probably commissioned by Shakespeare's friends and family. It is considered likely that the Droeshout engraving is a reasonably accurate likeness because of the use by these close associates and that contemporaries such as [[Ben Jonson]] praised it at the time of the publication.<ref>{{cite book | title=Searching for Shakespeare | first=Tarnya | last=Cooper |author2=Pointon, Marcia |author3=Shapiro, James |author4= Wells, Stanley  | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2006 | isbn=0-300-11611-X | page=48 }}</ref> Since the man in the Chandos portrait resembles the one in the Droeshout engraving, the similarity lends an indirect legitimacy to the oil painting. A further indication of legitimacy is the fact that the Chandos portrait was the inspiration for two posthumous portraits of Shakespeare, one by [[Gerard Soest]] and another, grander one, known as the \"[[:File:Chesterfield portrait.jpg|Chesterfield portrait]]\" after a former owner of that painting.<ref name = \"NPG\"/> These were probably painted in the 1660s or 1670s, within living memory of Shakespeare. The Chesterfield portrait is held by the [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].\n\nIn 2006, [[Tarnya Cooper]] of the National Portrait Gallery completed a three-and-a-half-year study of portraits purported to be of Shakespeare and concluded that the Chandos portrait was most likely a representation of Shakespeare. Cooper points to the earring and the loose shirt-ties of the sitter, which were emblematic of poets (the poet [[John Donne]] and Shakespeare's patron the [[Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Earl of Pembroke]] sported similar fashions). However, she readily acknowledges that the painting's authenticity cannot be proven.<ref name = \"NPG\"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329424549-110427,00.html|title=The only true painting of Shakespeare \u2013 probably|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|date=2 March 2006|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 July 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712221704/http://arts.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329424549-110427,00.html|archivedate=12 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nCooper also notes that the painting has been badly damaged by over-cleaning and retouching. Parts are abraded and some parts have been slightly altered. The hair has been extended and the beard is longer and more pointed than when originally painted.\n\n==Copies==\n[[File:Chandos copy.jpg|thumb|upright|An early copy of the portrait from c.1670, which may give a clearer idea of the original appearance of the beard]]\nIn addition to the Chesterfield portrait, a copy was made at least as early as 1689, by an unknown artist. Many 18th century images used it as a model for portrayals of Shakespeare.\n\nThe painting was engraved by [[Gerard Vandergucht]] for [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]]'s 1709 edition of Shakespeare's works. Another print was made by [[Jacobus Houbraken]] in 1747.<ref name = \"NPG\"/>\n\n==Ethnic interpretations==\nBecause the images of Shakespeare are either doubtful in provenance or lacking expression, no one image seems to reconcile well with readers' imaginations. The relatively dusky features have caused repeated comment, often of a racist nature. [[George Steevens]] said that the picture gave Shakespeare \"the complexion of a Jew, or rather that of a chimney sweeper in the jaundice\".<ref>Schoenbaum, Samuel, ''Shakespeare's Lives'', Oxford University Press, 1991, p.205.</ref> According to [[Ben Macintyre]], \"Some Victorians recoiled at the idea that the Chandos portrait represented Shakespeare. One critic, J. Hain Friswell, insisted 'one cannot readily imagine our essentially English Shakespeare to have been a dark, heavy man, with a foreign expression'.\"<ref>Sunday Times (of London) article by Ben Macintyre, 10 March 2009, \"Commentary: Portrait alleged to be the face of William Shakespeare\" http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article5877544.ece</ref> Friswell agreed with Steevens that the portrait had \"a decidedly Jewish physiognomy\" adding that it displayed \"a somewhat lubricious mouth, red-edged eyes\" and \"wanton lips, with a coarse expression.\"<ref>Louis Marder, ''His Exits and His Entrances: The Story of Shakespeare's Reputation'', Lippincott, Philadelphia, 1963, p.203</ref> According to [[Ernest Jones]], the portrait convinced [[Sigmund Freud]] that Shakespeare was French; \"He insisted that his countenance could not be that of an Anglo-Saxon but must be French, and he suggested that the name was a corruption of Jacques Pierre.\"<ref>Ernest Jones, The life and work of Sigmund Freud, Basic Books, vol.1 1961 p.18.</ref> The Iraqi writer [[Safa Khulusi]] argued that its \"un-English\" look and \"Islamic beard\" was evidence for his theory that Shakespeare was an Arab.<ref>Ferial J. Ghazoul, \"The Arabization of Othello\", Comparative Literature, Vol. 50, No. 1, Winter, 1998, p.9</ref> However, assuming the portrait to be genuinely of Shakespeare, there is no real reason to accept the truth of any such claims. Sixteenth and seventeenth-century Englishmen came in a wide variety of shapes, sizes and complexions, reflecting the mixed ancestry of Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Viking, Norman, Roman, French and many other ethnic sources.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090316213114/http://shakespeareportrait.freehosting.net/index.html \"Website Comparing the Three most likely Shakespeare Portraits\"]\n\n<!-- Site has some possible malware issues, cf.
