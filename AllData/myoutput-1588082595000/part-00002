It has a large white patch on its cheek, brown eyes, and a yellow panel on its wing.\n\n== Description ==\nThe white-cheeked honeyeater is a medium-sized black and white honeyeater, with a long, sturdy bill that curves downwards. It has large bright-yellow tail and wing panels, with a large conspicuous white cheek-patch on a mainly black head. The eye is dark brown. Young birds are duller (brownish) and paler with softer, fluffier plumage. It is gregarious, active and noisy with swift, erratic flight.\nIt is {{convert|16|-|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, averaging {{convert|18|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Its average weight is {{convert|19.5|g|oz|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Similar species===\nThe [[New Holland honeyeater]], ''Phylidonyris novaehollandiae'', is very similar in size, shape and appearance, but can be distinguished by its white eye. Other black and white honeyeaters are much smaller, including the [[crescent honeyeater|crescent]] (''P. pyrrhoptera''), [[tawny-crowned honeyeater|tawny-crowned]] (''Gliciphila melanops'') and [[white-fronted honeyeater]]s (''Purnella albifrons''). Although very similar in appearance, there is not much competition between white-cheeked and New Holland honeyeaters, as they choose different perching sites and have different nesting seasons.\n\n[[Image:White-cheeked Honeyeater cool.ogv|thumb|300px|left| Cooloolah NP, SE Queensland, Australia]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Distribution and Habitat==\nThe white-cheeked honeyeater is endemic to eastern and south-western Australia. It ranges from east of the Great Divide in Queensland through coastal New South Wales, becoming scattered south to Jervis Bay. It also occurs in south-western Western Australia and from Perth northwards to the Murchison River.\n\nThe white-cheeked honeyeater is usually found in moist heathlands, as well as around wetlands, and in forests or woodlands with a heath understorey. Occurring in both temperate and subtropical zones, they are found in parks, gardens and flowering street trees throughout their range. Not afraid of humans and adapting easily to settlement activity, they are sometimes killed by cats.\n\n==Behaviour==\nMostly resident or sedentary, with some seasonal movement at edge of range.\n\n===Feeding===\nWhite-cheeked honeyeaters feed mainly at flowers, in foliage, on bark or in the air, and mainly eat nectar, but also some insects. They often feed in small groups and may feed beside New Holland honeyeaters.\n\n===Breeding===\nWhite-cheeked honeyeaters pair monogamously for the breeding season, which can be at any time of year coincident with nectar availability, though peaking from August to November and March to May.<ref name=Morcombe>Morcombe, Michael (2012) ''Field Guide to Australian Birds.'' Pascal Press, Glebe, NSW. Revised edition. ISBN 978174021417-9</ref>  Males defend breeding territories that can be held for several years. Males aggressively attack other birds of their own and other species during the breeding season, but not familiar birds such as their own mates, relatives and resident neighbours. There is not much competition between white-cheeked and New Holland honeyeaters, as they choose different perching sites and have different nesting seasons. The female builds a cup-shaped nest from twigs, bark, and other plant materials, lined with pieces of flowers (e.g. banksias, isopogons). The nest is placed low in forked branches of trees or shrubs, often close to the ground, but well-concealed in dense foliage or in grass below shrubs and ferns. A clutch of 2 or 3 eggs, each measuring {{convert|21|x|15|mm|in|abbr=on}}, is laid.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> The eggs are whitish buff to pink, splotched with chestnut-red and slate-grey towards the large end.<ref name=Pizzey>Pizzey, Graham; Doyle, Roy (1980) ''A Field Guide to the Birds of Australia''.
