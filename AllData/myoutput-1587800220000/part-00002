The capital was also known as Virakshetra or Viravati (Land of Warriors). Later on, it was known as Vadpatraka or Vadodar\u00e1, which according to tradition is a corrupt form of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''vatodar'' meaning in the belly of the Banyan tree. It is now almost impossible to ascertain when the various changes in the name were made; but early English travellers and merchants mention the town as Brodera,<ref name=painting>{{cite web|publisher=Collect Britain, British Library|title=Hand Painting of Bridge over the River Vishwamitri, near Brodera|url=http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|accessdate=3 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928134532/http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> and it is from this that the name Baroda is derived.

Most notably, from 1705\u20131716, Sardar [[Senapati]] Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Except for a short period, Baroda continued to be in the reign of the Gaekwads from 1734 to 1948. Initially detailed to collect revenue on behalf of the [[Peshwa]] in Gujarat, [[Pilaji Gaekwad]] remained there to carve out a kingdom for himself. Damajirao, who was son and successor of Pilaji Gaekwad, defeated the Mughal armies and conquered Baroda in 1734.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> His successors consolidated their power over large tracts of Gujarat, becoming easily the most powerful rulers in the region.\n\nAfter the Maratha defeat in the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> control of the empire by the Peshwas weakened as it became a loose [[Confederation|confederacy]], and the Gaekwad [[Maharaja]]s ruled the kingdom until it [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to Independent [[Republic of India]] in 1949. In 1802,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> the British intervened to defend a [[Maharaja]] that had recently inherited the throne from rival claimants, and Vadodara concluded a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British that recognised the Kingdom as a [[Princely state]] and allowed the Maharajas of Baroda internal political sovereignty in return for recognising British 'Paramountcy', a form of [[suzerainty]] in which the control of the state's foreign affairs was completely surrendered. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe golden period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Maharaja Sayajirao III]] in 1875.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nVadodara is located at {{coord|22.30|N|73.19|E|}} in western India at an elevation of {{convert|39|m}}.

The capital was also known as Virakshetra or Viravati (Land of Warriors). Later on, it was known as Vadpatraka or Vadodar\u00e1, which according to tradition is a corrupt form of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''vatodar'' meaning in the belly of the Banyan tree. It is now almost impossible to ascertain when the various changes in the name were made; but early English travellers and merchants mention the town as Brodera,<ref name=painting>{{cite web|publisher=Collect Britain, British Library|title=Hand Painting of Bridge over the River Vishwamitri, near Brodera|url=http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|accessdate=3 July 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928134532/http://www.collectbritain.com/personalisation/object.cfm?uid=019XZZ0000455C9U00087000&largeimage=1#largeimage|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=live}}</ref> and it is from this that the name Baroda is derived.

Most notably, from 1705\u20131716, Sardar [[Senapati]] Khanderao Dabhade led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. Except for a short period, Baroda continued to be in the reign of the Gaekwads from 1734 to 1948. Initially detailed to collect revenue on behalf of the [[Peshwa]] in Gujarat, [[Pilaji Gaekwad]] remained there to carve out a kingdom for himself. Damajirao, who was son and successor of Pilaji Gaekwad, defeated the Mughal armies and conquered Baroda in 1734.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> His successors consolidated their power over large tracts of Gujarat, becoming easily the most powerful rulers in the region.\n\nAfter the Maratha defeat in the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] in 1761,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> control of the empire by the Peshwas weakened as it became a loose [[Confederation|confederacy]], and the Gaekwad [[Maharaja]]s ruled the kingdom until it [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] to Independent [[Republic of India]] in 1949. In 1802,<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/> the British intervened to defend a [[Maharaja]] that had recently inherited the throne from rival claimants, and Vadodara concluded a [[subsidiary alliance]] with the British that recognised the Kingdom as a [[Princely state]] and allowed the Maharajas of Baroda internal political sovereignty in return for recognising British 'Paramountcy', a form of [[suzerainty]] in which the control of the state's foreign affairs was completely surrendered. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe golden period in the Maratha rule of Vadodara started with the accession of [[Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III|Maharaja Sayajirao III]] in 1875.<ref name=\"Gaekwad\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nVadodara is located at {{coord|22.30|N|73.19|E|}} in western India at an elevation of {{convert|39|m}}.
