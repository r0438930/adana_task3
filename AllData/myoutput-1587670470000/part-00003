The following summer, the Governor of Nineveh Province was assassinated and most of the Sunni Arab Provincial Council members walked out in the ensuing selection of the new governor, leaving Kurdish members in charge of a predominantly Sunni Arab province. Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister. The largely [[Sunni]] [[Arab]] police collapsed under insurgent attacks launched at the same time Coalition Forces attacked [[Fallujah]] in November 2004.\n\n[[File:Petraeus Combat Action Badge Orders.pdf|right|thumb|Orders awarding the Combat Action Badge to then LTG David H.

''[[The Guardian]]'' quoted an anonymous US diplomat saying \"Mosul basically collapsed after he [Petraeus] left.\" Former diplomat [[Peter Galbraith]] criticized Petraeus's command of the 101st, saying his achievements have been exaggerated and his reputation is inflated.

This newly created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing army, police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II\", at a cost of over $11 billion.<ref>Ajami, Faoud. The Foreigner's Gift (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2006) pages 295\u2013298.</ref>\n\nIn September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses \u2013 not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49283-2004Sep25.html |title=Battling for Iraq |work=The Washington Post |date=September 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |first=David H. |last=Petraeus}}</ref> Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency\u2014or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight \u2013 and while being shot at\". Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former [[Interim Iraq Governing Council]] member [[Ali A.

On January 23, the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge]]\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/world/middleeast/24petraeustextcnd.html |title=General Petraeus' Opening Statement |work=The New York Times|date=January 23, 2007 |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThroughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, [[Multi-National Force-Iraq]] endeavored to work with the [[Iraq|Government of Iraq]] to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population.

Later that year, the local police commander defected to the Kurdish Minister of Interior in Irbil after repeated assassination attempts against him, attacks on his house, and the kidnapping of his sister.

This newly created command had responsibility for training, equipping, and mentoring Iraq's growing army, police, and other security forces as well as developing Iraq's security institutions and building associated infrastructure, such as training bases, police stations, and border forts. During Petraeus's fifteen months at the helm of MNSTC-I, he stood up a three-star command virtually from scratch and in the midst of serious fighting in places like Fallujah, Mosul, and Najaf. By the end of his command, some 100,000 Iraqi Security Forces had been trained; Iraqi Army and Police were being employed in combat; countless reconstruction projects had been executed; and hundreds of thousands of weapons, body armor, and other equipment had been distributed in what was described as the \"largest military procurement and distribution effort since World War II\", at a cost of over $11 billion.<ref>Ajami, Faoud. The Foreigner's Gift (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2006) pages 295\u2013298.</ref>\n\nIn September 2004, Petraeus wrote an article for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in which he described the tangible progress being made in building Iraq's security forces from the ground up while also noting the many challenges associated with doing so. \"Although there have been reverses \u2013 not to mention horrific terrorist attacks,\" Petraeus wrote, \"there has been progress in the effort to enable Iraqis to shoulder more of the load for their own security, something they are keen to do.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A49283-2004Sep25.html |title=Battling for Iraq |work=The Washington Post |date=September 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |first=David H. |last=Petraeus}}</ref> Some of the challenges involved in building security forces had to do with accomplishing this task in the midst of a tough insurgency\u2014or, as Petraeus wrote, \"making the mission akin to repairing an aircraft while in flight \u2013 and while being shot at\". Other challenges included allegations of corruption as well as efforts to improve Iraq's supply accountability procedures. For example, according to former [[Interim Iraq Governing Council]] member [[Ali A.

On January 23, the [[Senate Armed Services Committee]] held Petraeus's nomination hearing, during which he testified on his ideas for Iraq, particularly the strategy underpinning the \"[[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge]]\" of forces. During his opening statement, Petraeus stated that \"security of the population, especially in Baghdad, and in partnership with the Iraqi Security Forces, will be the focus of the military effort.\" He went on to state that security will require establishing a persistent presence, especially in Iraq's most threatened neighborhoods. He also noted the critical importance of helping Iraq increase its governmental capacity, develop employment programs, and improve daily life for its citizens.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/23/world/middleeast/24petraeustextcnd.html |title=General Petraeus' Opening Statement |work=The New York Times|date=January 23, 2007 |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThroughout Petraeus's tenure in Iraq, [[Multi-National Force-Iraq]] endeavored to work with the [[Iraq|Government of Iraq]] to carry out this strategy that focuses on securing the population.
