A year later the format changed to a tabloid and began publishing six days a week as ''The Bedford-Sackville Daily News''. The paper gained a reputation for printing stories that were not covered by its competition, ''[[The Chronicle Herald]]'', some of which were considered sensational. In 1981, Bentley's company moved into downtown Halifax from its suburban base and renamed the tabloid as ''[[The Daily News (Halifax)|The Daily News]]'', while gaining a reputation for hard-hitting stories and expanded sports coverage.\n\nIn 1985 the [[Newfoundland Capital Corporation]] or NCC gained a controlling interest in the paper and purchased Bentley's remaining share in 1987.\n\n==''Frank''==\n\nWith the money received from sale of ''The Daily News'' to NCC, Bentley, along with [[Lyndon Watkins]] and [[Dulcie Conrad]] started a bi-weekly \"gossip rag\" or \"scandal magazine\" known as ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]'' to sell the sensational news coverage that mainstream press was averse to covering. Rare to the industry, the magazine had no advertising and operated solely from its print sales.\n\nThe first issue was published in November 1987 and focused on gossip about the private lives of the rich, famous and politically connected in the [[The Maritimes|Maritime provinces]].\n\nBentley expanded the ''Frank'' franchise to include an [[Ottawa]] edition in 1989 with the help of Michael Bate. This edition quickly outsold its Maritime counterpart, feeding off the void of gossip news in mainstream media in the nation's capital.\n\nBentley followed a successful formula with the magazine, feeding the need for gossip among the powerful, as well as the average citizen. It was often rumoured that each edition was incorporated as a separate legal entity, leaving no assets for potential lawsuits over libel, however there is no proof that this was ever done.\n\nWhile the Maritime edition continued to grow in popularity, the Ottawa edition took off in just a few years, rising from a start of 600 copies to a publishing run of over 16,000 at the height of the [[Brian Mulroney|Mulroney]] years. It was during this time that the Ottawa edition of ''Frank'' brought the magazine its greatest notoriety by satirically running a contest in 1991 inviting young [[Tory|Tories]] to \"Deflower [[Caroline Mulroney]], invoking the Prime Minister's wrath on Bentley and his partners. Mulroney joined several women's groups in denouncing the ad as an incitement to rape, but the magazine maintained that it was commenting on the Prime Minister's perceived habit of using his daughter as a political prop. The magazine also scooped the identity of former Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s love child with [[Deborah Coyne]] in 1991.\n\nBate subsequently bought out Bentley and his other partners to take the Ottawa edition of ''Frank'' independent.\n\nBentley continued with his publication of the Maritime edition of ''Frank'', leading the magazine to several scoops, including the charges of sexual assault against former [[Premier of Nova Scotia]] and Trudeau-era cabinet minister [[Gerald Regan]], in which he was subsequently acquitted.\n\nDulcie Conrad sold her share of the Maritime edition of ''Frank'' in the mid-1990s to Bentley and Watkins. In September 2000, Bentley and Watkins sold an equity stake in the Maritime edition of ''Frank'' to one of the magazine's reporters, Clifford Boutilier.\n\n==''allNovaScotia''==\n\nIn March 2001, Bentley and his daughter Caroline Wood launched an online Monday to Friday business newspaper focusing exclusively on Nova Scotian businesses entitled, ''allNovaScotia''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/subscription-news-site-allnovascotia-expands-to-newfoundland/article28830527/|title=Subscription news site AllNovaScotia expands to Newfoundland| last= Bradshaw | first= James|work=The Globe and Mail|date=February 22, 2016|accessdate=September 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to the ''Frank'' experiment, allnovascotia.com contains a hard-hitting approach to news, however, it focuses exclusively on business-related news and not personal gossip or scandal but does contain scoops on lawsuits and other information not found in mainstream Nova Scotian media.
