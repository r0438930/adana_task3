It was later discovered that the radioactivity levels matched the design, but that the regulations concerning acceptable radioactivity levels had changed. While the United States was preparing its response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the form of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.\n\n===Link 16===\n{{main|Link 16}}\nOn 11 October 2001, the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Cassard|D 614|2}}, four [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft and ''Charles de Gaulle'' were involved in a successful trial of the [[Link 16]] high-bandwidth secure data network.

While the United States was preparing its response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the form of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.\n\n===Link 16===\n{{main|Link 16}}\nOn 11 October 2001, the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Cassard|D 614|2}}, four [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft and ''Charles de Gaulle'' were involved in a successful trial of the [[Link 16]] high-bandwidth secure data network.
