Chidambaram, who was a member of the political committee which monitors the ATV programme, questioned the huge amount of money being spent on submarines with just 4 missile launch tubes. Hence the ATV project team tweaked the Arihant design by adding a 10-metre-long section for four more [[K-4 (missile)|K-4]] SLBMs to be integrated into the boat codenamed S4. After it became evident that the larger [[S5-class submarine|S5 class]] of SSBNs will take more time to develop, an additional unit, codenamed S4*, was sanctioned in 2012 to ensure that the production

Chidambaram, who was a member of the political committee which monitors the ATV programme, questioned the huge amount of money being spent on submarines with just 4 missile launch tubes. Hence the ATV project team tweaked the Arihant design by adding a 10-metre-long section for four more [[K-4 (missile)|K-4]] SLBMs to be integrated into the boat codenamed S4. After it became evident that the larger [[S5-class submarine|S5 class]] of SSBNs will take more time to develop, an additional unit, codenamed S4*, was sanctioned in 2012 to ensure that the production
