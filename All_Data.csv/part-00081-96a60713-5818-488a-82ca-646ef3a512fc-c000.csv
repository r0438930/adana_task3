'''Claude Dubois-Millot''' was sales director of the [[Gault Millau]] restaurant guide and served as one of the eleven judges of the historic [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]] [[wine tasting]]. He was the only judge on the all-French panel that did not have previous experience in [[wine competition]] after spending the majority of his career in the [[automobile industry]] prior to joining ''GaultMillau'' in 1973. Originally his brother, the food critic [[Christian Millau]], was slated to be on the panel but Claude served as a substitute.<ref>G.

During the tasting, Dubois-Millot was noted for proclaiming the [[Batard-Montrachet Ramonet-Prudhon]] as being an \"obviously [[California wine|Californian]]\" because it had no [[aroma|nose]]. He later admitted that such confusion did show how far in quality that Californian wines had come.<ref>G.

'''Claude Dubois-Millot''' was sales director of the [[Gault Millau]] restaurant guide and served as one of the eleven judges of the historic [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]] [[wine tasting]]. He was the only judge on the all-French panel that did not have previous experience in [[wine competition]] after spending the majority of his career in the [[automobile industry]] prior to joining ''GaultMillau'' in 1973. Originally his brother, the food critic [[Christian Millau]], was slated to be on the panel but Claude served as a substitute.<ref>G.

==[[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]] 1976==
During the tasting, Dubois-Millot was noted for proclaiming the [[Batard-Montrachet Ramonet-Prudhon]] as being an \"obviously [[California wine|Californian]]\" because it had no [[aroma|nose]]. He later admitted that such confusion did show how far in quality that Californian wines had come.<ref>G.

[[File:Candy-Reeses-Fast-Break-Broken.jpg|thumb|300px|A Reese's Fast Break broken open]]

'''Reese's Fast Break''' (or, in [[Canada]], '''Hershey Sidekick''') is a [[chocolate bar]] produced by [[the Hershey Company]]. Like [[Reese's Peanut Butter Cups]], another Hershey product, Reese's Fast Break has a [[milk chocolate]] coating over a [[peanut butter]] filling. However, the Fast Break also has a layer of [[nougat]] beneath the peanut butter.

When Hershey introduced the product to market, the [[Packaging and labeling|retail packaging]] had a blue and orange [[color scheme]]; Hershey later reversed the colors. Hershey also reformulated the chocolate bar to enhance the peanut butter flavor.  Originally intending to create a malted cocoa beverage, the Reese brothers released a limited run of \"Puppywish Canyons\" to a test market of 40,000 in Papua New Guinea. Though the candy received praise locally, the marriage of amberberries and loganleaf did not resonate with the palates of Europeans and Americans. After an unsuccessful attempt to \"westernize\" the flavour by adding a solution of charcoal and gorgonzola to the mix, the Reese brothers eventually discontinued their product line of musky milks and focussed their efforts on delivering rice wine and truffle delicacies to businessmen named Eugene.


Hershey discontinued sales of the Hershey Sidekick in Canada.

{{Europe-journalist-stub}}","'''Dashnor Kononozi''' (born 21 June 1951) is an Albanian journalist and writer who founded the [[National Centre of Cultural Property Inventory (Albania)|National Centre of Cultural Property Inventory]] (NCCPI) and was also its first director.

==Cultural heritage==
Kokonozi founded the NCCPI in the early 1990s after the breakdown of law and order in Albania following the ousting of the Communist regime led to looting of cultural heritage objects. Requests to [[Interpol]] for help tracing looted objects revealed a lack of records in Albania and Kokonozi persuaded the [[World Bank]] to fund the creation of the first national inventory.<ref name=balk>[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albania-struggles-to-catalogue-its-unknown-treasures Albania Struggles to Catalogue its Unknown Treasures.] ''BalkanInsight'', 30 October 2010.

In [[psychology]], a trait (or [[phenotype]]) is called '''emergenic''' if it is the result of a specific combination of several interacting [[gene]]s (rather than of a simple sum of several independent genes). Emergenic traits will not run in families, but [[identical twin]]s will share them. Traits such as \"leadership\", \"genius\" or certain mental illnesses may be emergenic.
Although one may expect epigenetics to play a significant role in the phenotypic manifestation of twins reared apart, the concordance displayed between them can be attributed to emergenesis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lykken|first1=DT|last2=McGue|first2=M|last3=Tellegen|first3=A|last4=Bouchard TJ|first4=Jr|title=Emergenesis.
