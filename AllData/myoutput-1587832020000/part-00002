Major projects including building new refineries, pipelines, expanding the national shipping and airlines as well as hosting FESTAC was done during this administration. A number of these national projects were conduits to distribute favors and enrich connected politicians.

The bank acted as a conduit to transfer hard currency for some party members in Nigeria. A few leading officials and politicians had amassed large amounts of money.

Shortages and subsequent allegations were precipitated by [[protectionism]]. After its election, the Nigerian government decided to protect local rice farmers from imported commodities. A licensing system was created to limit rice imports.

Some cite the suitcases scandal which also coincidentally involved then customs leader [[Atiku Abubakar]], who later became Vice President in 1999, and was indicted for various acts of corruption. \"The 53 suitcases saga arose in 1984 during the currency change exercise ordered by the Buhari junta when it ordered that every case arriving the country should be inspected irrespective of the status of the person behind such. The 53 suitcases were, however, ferried through the [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport|Murtala Muhammed Airport]] without a customs check by soldiers allegedly at the behest of Major Mustapha Jokolo, the then aide-de-camp to Gen.
