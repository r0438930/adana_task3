Thus the final Microsoft ''Encarta'' can be considered the successor of the ''Funk and Wagnalls'', ''Collier'', and ''New Merit Scholar'' encyclopedias. None of these formerly successful encyclopedias remained in print for long after being merged into ''Encarta''.\n\nMicrosoft introduced several regional versions of ''Encarta'' translated into languages other than English. For example, the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version was introduced in 1999 and suspended in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/brasil/encarta/ |title=Bem-vindo \u00e0 Microsoft Brasil |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref> The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version was somewhat smaller than the English one, at 42,000 articles.\n\n===Move to the web===\nIn 2000, the full ''Encarta'' content became available on the [[World Wide Web]] to subscribers, with a subset available for free to anyone.<ref name=STROSS />\n\n===Demise===\nIn July 2006, Websters Multimedia, a [[Bellevue, Washington]] subsidiary of London-based Websters International Publishers, took over maintenance of ''Encarta'' from Microsoft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webstersmultimedia.com/WhoWeAre.asp |title=Websters International Publishers \u2013 Who We Are|publisher=Webstersmultimedia.com|access-date=2012-03-13|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322032031/http://www.webstersmultimedia.com/WhoWeAre.asp|archivedate=2012-03-22}}</ref> The last version was ''Encarta Premium'' 2009, released in August 2008.<ref name=\"Encarta2009\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Closure}}\nMicrosoft announced in April 2009 that it would cease to sell [[Microsoft Student]] and all editions of ''Encarta Premium'' software products worldwide by June 2009, citing changes in the way people seek information, and in the traditional encyclopedia and reference material market, as the key reasons behind the termination.<ref name=\"EncartaDead\"/> Updates for ''Encarta'' were offered until October 2009.<ref name=\"EncartaDead\"/> Additionally, MSN ''Encarta'' web sites were discontinued around October 31, 2009, with the exception of ''Encarta Japan'' which was discontinued on December 31, 2009.

The premium editions contained over 62,000 articles and other [[multimedia]] content, such as 25,000 pictures and illustrations, over 300 videos and animations, and an interactive atlas with 1.8 million locations. Its articles were integrated with multimedia content and could include links to websites selected by its [[editing|editors]]. ''Encarta''{{'}}s articles in general were less lengthy and more summarized than the printed version of ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' or the online [[Wikipedia]]. Like most multimedia encyclopedias, ''Encarta''{{'}}s articles tended to provide an overview of the subject rather than an exhaustive coverage and can only be viewed one at a time.\n\nA sidebar could display alternative views, [[essay]]s, journals or original materials relevant to the topic. For example, when reading about [[computer]]s, it featured annals since 1967 of the computer industry. ''Encarta'' also supported [[closed captioning]] for the hearing impaired. A separate program, called ''Encarta Research Organizer'' was included in early versions for gathering and organizing information and constructing a Word document-based report. Later versions included ''Encarta Researcher'', a browser plugin to organize information from ''Encarta'' articles and web pages into research projects. Content copied from ''Encarta'' was appended with a [[copyright]] boilerplate message after the selection. The user interface allowed for viewing content with only images, videos, sounds, animations, 360-degree views, virtual tours, charts and tables or only interactives.\n\nEncarta was originally available for sale on 1 to 5 [[CD-ROM]]s or a [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/1997/04/01/encarta-97-adds-content-extra-cd.aspx|title=Encarta 97 Adds Content, Extra CD|quote=Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia now comes in two versions: the award-winning Encarta 97 Encyclopedia on a single compact disc, and the new two-CD Encarta 97 Encyclopedia, Deluxe Edition.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.microsoft.com/2002/06/27/microsoft-encarta-reference-library-2003-takes-the-work-out-of-homework/|title=Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2003 Takes the Work Out of Homework|quote=The Encarta Reference Library 2003 five-disc CD-ROM and single-disk DVD have an estimated retail price** of $74.95 (U.S.) before a $10 (U.S.) mail-in rebate.}}</ref> Some new PCs were shipped with an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] edition of Encarta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Packard+Bell+ups+the+value+of+its+computers+with+huge+new+software...-a017230846|title=Packard Bell ups the value of its computers with huge new software bundle.|quote=For pure reference, Packard Bell is providing ``Microsoft(R) Encarta(TM) '95,''}}</ref>\n\n''Encarta 2000'' and later had \"Map Treks\", which were tours of geographic features and concepts. Microsoft had a separate product known as ''Encarta Africana'' which was an encyclopedia of black history and culture. It was integrated into the standard ''Encarta Reference'' suite starting with the 2001 version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/aug00/encartaexpandedpr.mspx |title=Award-Winning Encarta Africana Included in Suite for the First Time |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604164331/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/aug00/encartaexpandedpr.mspx |archivedate=2011-06-04 }}</ref> ''Encarta 2002'' and onward feature ''3D Virtual Tours'' of ancient structures, for example the [[Acropolis]]; 2D panoramic images of world wonders or major cities; and a virtual flight feature which allows users to fly a virtual [[airplane]] over a coarsely generated artificial [[landscape]] area. Version ''2002'' also introduced the ability to install the entire encyclopedia locally to the hard disk drive to prevent frequent swapping of discs.\n\n''Encarta 2003'' incorporated literature guides and book summaries, foreign language translation dictionaries, a ''Homework Center'' and ''Chart Maker''. ''Encarta''{{'}}s ''Visual Browser'', available since the 2004 version, presented a user with a list of related topics making them more discoverable. A collection of 32 [[Discovery Channel]] videos were also later added. ''Encarta 2005'' introduced another program called ''Encarta Kids'' aimed at children to make learning fun.\n\n''Encarta'' also included a [[trivia]] game called \"MindMaze\" (accessible through Ctrl+Z) in which the player explores a castle by answering questions whose answers can be found in the encyclopedia's articles. There was also a \"Geography Quiz\" and several other games and quizzes, some quizzes also in ''Encarta Kids''.\n\nFor years, ''Encarta'' came in three primary software editions: Standard, Premium, and Reference Library (price and features in that order). Beginning with ''Encarta 2006'', however, when ''Websters Multimedia'' took over its maintenance, ''Encarta'' became a feature of Microsoft Student. Although it was possible to purchase only the ''Encarta'' encyclopedia separately, Microsoft Student bundles together ''Encarta Premium'' with [[Microsoft Math]] (a [[graphing calculator|graphing-calculator]] program) and Learning Essentials, which provides templates for [[Microsoft Office]]. In addition, the Reference Library was discontinued, absorbed into a newer, more comprehensive Premium package. ''Encarta''{{'}}s user interface was shared with Microsoft Student, and was streamlined to reduce clutter with only a Search box which returned relevant results; however it became no longer possible to simply browse all the encyclopedia articles alphabetically.\n\n===World Atlas===\nThe dynamic maps were generated with the same engine that powered [[Microsoft MapPoint]] software. The map was a [[virtual globe]] that one could freely rotate and magnify to any location down to major streets for big cities. The globe had multiple surfaces displaying political boundaries, physical landmarks, historical maps and statistical information. One could selectively display statistical values on the globe surface or in a tabular form, different sized cities, various geological or man-made features and [[latitude and longitude|reference lines]] in a map.\n\nThe maps contained [[hyperlink]]s to related articles (\"Map Trek\") and also supported a \"Dynamic Sensor\" that provides the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], [[toponym|place name]], [[population]] and [[time zone|local time]] for any point on the globe. ''Encarta'' also generated a visible-light moon atlas with names of major [[list of craters on the Moon|craters]] and hyperlinks. However, it did not include a [[planetarium]], but instead had a small interactive [[constellation]]-only map.\n\nIn addition to database generated maps, many other illustrative maps in ''Encarta'' (\"Historical Maps\") were drawn by artists. Some more advanced maps were [[interactive]]: for example, the large African map for Africana could display information such as political boundaries or the distribution of African [[flora (plants)|flora]].\n\n===''Encarta Dictionary''===\nWhen ''Encarta'' was released as part of the \"Reference Suite\" in 1998 to 2000, Microsoft bundled \"[[Microsoft Bookshelf]]\" with the other programs (''Encarta Encyclopedia 98 Deluxe Edition'', ''Encarta Desk Atlas'', ''Encarta Virtual Globe 98'', ''Encarta World English Dictionary'', and ''Encarta Research Organizer'').\n\n\"Bookshelf\" was discontinued in 2000, and in later ''Encarta'' editions (''Encarta Suite 2000'' and onward), \"Bookshelf\" was replaced with a dedicated ''Encarta Dictionary'', a superset of its printed version, ''The Encarta World English Dictionary'' (later ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary]]'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Bookshelf: Cannot Connect to a Site When You Click Web Link|url=https://ftp|publisher=Microsoft|access-date=April 13, 2020|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815013448/http://ftp//|archive-date=December 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere was some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in \"Bookshelf\" which many found to be a useful reference, such as ''Columbia Dictionary of Quotations'' (replaced with a quotations section in ''Encarta'' that links to relevant articles and people) and an [[Internet Directory]] (although many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist).\n\nPrint versions of ''Encarta'' dictionaries have also been published, including:\n*Encarta World English Dictionary (St Martin's Press, {{ISBN|031222222-X}}/{{ISBN|978-031222222-2}})\n*Bloomsbury English Dictionary\n:*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, {{ISBN|074756243-1}}/{{ISBN|978-074756243-6}})<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/bloomsbury-english-dictionary-9780747562436/ Bloomsbury English Dictionary]</ref>\n*Microsoft Encarta Dictionary: The first dictionary for the Internet age (St. Martin's Paperbacks, {{ISBN|031298362-X}}/{{ISBN|978-031298362-8}})\n*Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary: The First Dictionary For The Internet Age (St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|031228087-4}}/{{ISBN|978-031228087-1}})\n*Encarta Webster's College Dictionary of the English Language\n:*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, {{ISBN|158234510-4}}/{{ISBN|978-158234510-9}})<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/encarta-websters-dictionary-of-the-english-language-9781582345109/ Encarta Webster's Dictionary of the English Language]</ref>\n*Encarta Webster's College Dictionary\n:*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, {{ISBN|1-59691-085-2}}/{{ISBN|978-1-59691-085-0}})<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/encarta-websters-college-dictionary-9781596910850/ Encarta Webster's College Dictionary]</ref>\n\n===Regional versions===\n[[Robert McHenry]], while Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', criticized ''Encarta'' for differences in factual content between national versions of ''Encarta'', accusing Microsoft of \"pandering to local prejudices\" instead of presenting subjects objectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html|title=The Microsoft Way|last=McHenry|first=Robert|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080452/http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html|archive-date=2007-09-27}}, essay by Robert McHenry</ref> An article written by [[Bill Gates]] addressed the nature of writing encyclopedias for different regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm|title=The facts depend on where you are coming from|last=Gates|first=Bill|date=April 6, 1997|work=[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|The Sunday Times]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629032909/http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm|archive-date=June 29, 2012|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:Student07.JPG|thumb|250px|Microsoft Student with ''Encarta Premium 2007'' running on [[Windows XP]].]]\nBefore the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] for information browsing, Microsoft recognized the importance of having an engine that supported a [[multimedia]] [[markup language]], full text search, and extensibility using software objects.  The [[hypertext]] display, [[hyperlinking]] and search software was created by a team of [[CD-ROM]] Division developers in the late 1980s who designed it as a generalized engine for uses as diverse as [[online help|interactive help]], [[document management system]]s and as ambitious as a multimedia encyclopedia.\n\n''Encarta'' was able to use various Microsoft technologies because it was extensible with [[Component-based software engineering|software components]] for displaying unique types of multimedia information.  For example, a snap in map engine is adapted from its [[Microsoft MapPoint|MapPoint]] software.  The hypertext and search engine used by ''Encarta'' also powered [[Microsoft Bookshelf]].\n\n''Encarta'' used database technologies to generate much of its multimedia content. For example, ''Encarta'' generated each zoomable map from a global [[geographic information system]] database on demand.\n\nWhen a user used the [[cut, copy and paste|copy and paste]] function of Microsoft Windows on ''Encarta'' on more than five words, ''Encarta'' automatically appended a [[copyright]] [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] message after the paste.\n\n===User editing===\nEarly in 2005, Gary Alt announced that the online ''Encarta'' started to allow users to suggest changes to existing articles.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7502883/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/encarta-encyclopedia-tests-edit-system/#.Vate6VSjlUQ \"Encarta Encyclopedia Test Edit System\"], 15 April 2005, Associated Press</ref>\n\n<!-- === Chatbot ===-->\n''Encarta''{{'}}s content was accessible using a conversational interface on [[Windows Live Messenger]] via the MSN [[Internet bot|Bot]] \"Encarta Instant Answers\".<ref>MSN screenname: encarta@conversagent.com and encarta@botmetro.net</ref> The bot could answer many encyclopedia related questions directly in the IM window.

However, despite the inclusion of news-related and some supplementary articles, ''Encarta''{{'}}s contents had not been changed substantially in its later years.

Thus the final Microsoft ''Encarta'' can be considered the successor of the ''Funk and Wagnalls'', ''Collier'', and ''New Merit Scholar'' encyclopedias. None of these formerly successful encyclopedias remained in print for long after being merged into ''Encarta''.\n\nMicrosoft introduced several regional versions of ''Encarta'' translated into languages other than English.

The premium editions contained over 62,000 articles and other [[multimedia]] content, such as 25,000 pictures and illustrations, over 300 videos and animations, and an interactive atlas with 1.8 million locations. Its articles were integrated with multimedia content and could include links to websites selected by its [[editing|editors]]. ''Encarta''{{'}}s articles in general were less lengthy and more summarized than the printed version of ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' or the online [[Wikipedia]]. Like most multimedia encyclopedias, ''Encarta''{{'}}s articles tended to provide an overview of the subject rather than an exhaustive coverage and can only be viewed one at a time.\n\nA sidebar could display alternative views, [[essay]]s, journals or original materials relevant to the topic. For example, when reading about [[computer]]s, it featured annals since 1967 of the computer industry. ''Encarta'' also supported [[closed captioning]] for the hearing impaired. A separate program, called ''Encarta Research Organizer'' was included in early versions for gathering and organizing information and constructing a Word document-based report. Later versions included ''Encarta Researcher'', a browser plugin to organize information from ''Encarta'' articles and web pages into research projects. Content copied from ''Encarta'' was appended with a [[copyright]] boilerplate message after the selection. The user interface allowed for viewing content with only images, videos, sounds, animations, 360-degree views, virtual tours, charts and tables or only interactives.\n\nEncarta was originally available for sale on 1 to 5 [[CD-ROM]]s or a [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/1997/04/01/encarta-97-adds-content-extra-cd.aspx|title=Encarta 97 Adds Content, Extra CD|quote=Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia now comes in two versions: the award-winning Encarta 97 Encyclopedia on a single compact disc, and the new two-CD Encarta 97 Encyclopedia, Deluxe Edition.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.microsoft.com/2002/06/27/microsoft-encarta-reference-library-2003-takes-the-work-out-of-homework/|title=Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2003 Takes the Work Out of Homework|quote=The Encarta Reference Library 2003 five-disc CD-ROM and single-disk DVD have an estimated retail price** of $74.95 (U.S.) before a $10 (U.S.) mail-in rebate.}}</ref> Some new PCs were shipped with an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] edition of Encarta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Packard+Bell+ups+the+value+of+its+computers+with+huge+new+software...-a017230846|title=Packard Bell ups the value of its computers with huge new software bundle.|quote=For pure reference, Packard Bell is providing ``Microsoft(R) Encarta(TM) '95,''}}</ref>\n\n''Encarta 2000'' and later had \"Map Treks\", which were tours of geographic features and concepts.

Version ''2002'' also introduced the ability to install the entire encyclopedia locally to the hard disk drive to prevent frequent swapping of discs.\n\n''Encarta 2003'' incorporated literature guides and book summaries, foreign language translation dictionaries, a ''Homework Center'' and ''Chart Maker''. ''Encarta''{{'}}s ''Visual Browser'', available since the 2004 version, presented a user with a list of related topics making them more discoverable. A collection of 32 [[Discovery Channel]] videos were also later added. ''Encarta 2005'' introduced another program called ''Encarta Kids'' aimed at children to make learning fun.\n\n''Encarta'' also included a [[trivia]] game called \"MindMaze\" (accessible through Ctrl+Z) in which the player explores a castle by answering questions whose answers can be found in the encyclopedia's articles. There was also a \"Geography Quiz\" and several other games and quizzes, some quizzes also in ''Encarta Kids''.\n\nFor years, ''Encarta'' came in three primary software editions: Standard, Premium, and Reference Library (price and features in that order). Beginning with ''Encarta 2006'', however, when ''Websters Multimedia'' took over its maintenance, ''Encarta'' became a feature of Microsoft Student. Although it was possible to purchase only the ''Encarta'' encyclopedia separately, Microsoft Student bundles together ''Encarta Premium'' with [[Microsoft Math]] (a [[graphing calculator|graphing-calculator]] program) and Learning Essentials, which provides templates for [[Microsoft Office]]. In addition, the Reference Library was discontinued, absorbed into a newer, more comprehensive Premium package. ''Encarta''{{'}}s user interface was shared with Microsoft Student, and was streamlined to reduce clutter with only a Search box which returned relevant results; however it became no longer possible to simply browse all the encyclopedia articles alphabetically.\n\n===World Atlas===\nThe dynamic maps were generated with the same engine that powered [[Microsoft MapPoint]] software. The map was a [[virtual globe]] that one could freely rotate and magnify to any location down to major streets for big cities. The globe had multiple surfaces displaying political boundaries, physical landmarks, historical maps and statistical information. One could selectively display statistical values on the globe surface or in a tabular form, different sized cities, various geological or man-made features and [[latitude and longitude|reference lines]] in a map.\n\nThe maps contained [[hyperlink]]s to related articles (\"Map Trek\") and also supported a \"Dynamic Sensor\" that provides the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], [[toponym|place name]], [[population]] and [[time zone|local time]] for any point on the globe. ''Encarta'' also generated a visible-light moon atlas with names of major [[list of craters on the Moon|craters]] and hyperlinks. However, it did not include a [[planetarium]], but instead had a small interactive [[constellation]]-only map.\n\nIn addition to database generated maps, many other illustrative maps in ''Encarta'' (\"Historical Maps\") were drawn by artists. Some more advanced maps were [[interactive]]: for example, the large African map for Africana could display information such as political boundaries or the distribution of African [[flora (plants)|flora]].\n\n===''Encarta Dictionary''===\nWhen ''Encarta'' was released as part of the \"Reference Suite\" in 1998 to 2000, Microsoft bundled \"[[Microsoft Bookshelf]]\" with the other programs (''Encarta Encyclopedia 98 Deluxe Edition'', ''Encarta Desk Atlas'', ''Encarta Virtual Globe 98'', ''Encarta World English Dictionary'', and ''Encarta Research Organizer'').\n\n\"Bookshelf\" was discontinued in 2000, and in later ''Encarta'' editions (''Encarta Suite 2000'' and onward), \"Bookshelf\" was replaced with a dedicated ''Encarta Dictionary'', a superset of its printed version, ''The Encarta World English Dictionary'' (later ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary]]'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Bookshelf: Cannot Connect to a Site When You Click Web Link |url=https://ftp |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815013448/http://ftp// |archivedate=August 15, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThere was some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in \"Bookshelf\" which many found to be a useful reference, such as ''Columbia Dictionary of Quotations'' (replaced with a quotations section in ''Encarta'' that links to relevant articles and people) and an [[Internet Directory]] (although many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist).\n\nPrint versions of ''Encarta'' dictionaries have also been published, including:\n*Encarta World English Dictionary (St Martin's Press, {{ISBN|031222222-X}}/{{ISBN|978-031222222-2}})\n*Bloomsbury English Dictionary\n:*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, {{ISBN|074756243-1}}/{{ISBN|978-074756243-6}})<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/bloomsbury-english-dictionary-9780747562436/ Bloomsbury English Dictionary]</ref>\n*Microsoft Encarta Dictionary: The first dictionary for the Internet age (St. Martin's Paperbacks, {{ISBN|031298362-X}}/{{ISBN|978-031298362-8}})\n*Microsoft Encarta College Dictionary: The First Dictionary For The Internet Age (St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|031228087-4}}/{{ISBN|978-031228087-1}})\n*Encarta Webster's College Dictionary of the English Language\n:*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, {{ISBN|158234510-4}}/{{ISBN|978-158234510-9}})<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/encarta-websters-dictionary-of-the-english-language-9781582345109/ Encarta Webster's Dictionary of the English Language]</ref>\n*Encarta Webster's College Dictionary\n:*Second edition (Bloomsbury Publishing PLC, {{ISBN|1-59691-085-2}}/{{ISBN|978-1-59691-085-0}})<ref>[http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/encarta-websters-college-dictionary-9781596910850/ Encarta Webster's College Dictionary]</ref>\n\n===Regional versions===\n[[Robert McHenry]], while Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', criticized ''Encarta'' for differences in factual content between national versions of ''Encarta'', accusing Microsoft of \"pandering to local prejudices\" instead of presenting subjects objectively.<ref>[http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html \"The Microsoft Way\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080452/http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, essay by Robert McHenry</ref> An article written by [[Bill Gates]] addressed the nature of writing encyclopedias for different regions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm |title=\"The facts depend on where you are coming from\" |accessdate=2004-09-13 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629032909/http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2012 }}, essay by Bill Gates reprinted in [[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|''The Sunday Times'']] of South Africa, April 6, 1997, archived in 2012 and accessed Jan 9 2014.</ref>\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:Student07.JPG|thumb|250px|Microsoft Student with ''Encarta Premium 2007'' running on [[Windows XP]].]]\nBefore the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] for information browsing, Microsoft recognized the importance of having an engine that supported a [[multimedia]] [[markup language]], full text search, and extensibility using software objects.  The [[hypertext]] display, [[hyperlinking]] and search software was created by a team of [[CD-ROM]] Division developers in the late 1980s who designed it as a generalized engine for uses as diverse as [[online help|interactive help]], [[document management system]]s and as ambitious as a multimedia encyclopedia.\n\n''Encarta'' was able to use various Microsoft technologies because it was extensible with [[Component-based software engineering|software components]] for displaying unique types of multimedia information.  For example, a snap in map engine is adapted from its [[Microsoft MapPoint|MapPoint]] software.  The hypertext and search engine used by ''Encarta'' also powered [[Microsoft Bookshelf]].\n\n''Encarta'' used database technologies to generate much of its multimedia content. For example, ''Encarta'' generated each zoomable map from a global [[geographic information system]] database on demand.\n\nWhen a user used the [[cut, copy and paste|copy and paste]] function of Microsoft Windows on ''Encarta'' on more than five words, ''Encarta'' automatically appended a [[copyright]] [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] message after the paste.\n\n===User editing===\nEarly in 2005, Gary Alt announced that the online ''Encarta'' started to allow users to suggest changes to existing articles.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7502883/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/encarta-encyclopedia-tests-edit-system/#.Vate6VSjlUQ \"Encarta Encyclopedia Test Edit System\"], 15 April 2005, Associated Press</ref>\n\n<!-- === Chatbot ===-->\n''Encarta''{{'}}s content was accessible using a conversational interface on [[Windows Live Messenger]] via the MSN [[Internet bot|Bot]] \"Encarta Instant Answers\".<ref>MSN screenname: encarta@conversagent.com and encarta@botmetro.net</ref> The bot could answer many encyclopedia related questions directly in the IM window. It used short sentences from the ''Encarta'' website, and sometimes displays full articles in the [[Internet Explorer]]-based browser on the right.  It also could complete simple mathematical and advanced algebra problems. This service was also available in [[German language|German]],<ref>MSN screenname: de.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> [[Spanish language|Spanish]],<ref>MSN screenname: es.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> [[French language|French]]<ref>MSN screenname: fr.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>MSN screenname: jp.encarta@botmetro.net</ref>\n\n===Updates===\nEach [[summer]] (in the Northern hemisphere) or [[winter]] (in the Southern hemisphere), Microsoft published a new version of ''Encarta''. However, despite the inclusion of news-related and some supplementary articles, ''Encarta''{{'}}s contents had not been changed substantially in its later years. Besides the yearly update, the installed offline copy could be updated over the Internet for a certain period for free depending on the edition. Some articles (usually about 2,000) were updated to reflect important changes or events. When the update period expired, an advertisement prompting to upgrade to the new version was displayed to the user occasionally.\n\n==Reception==\nThe editors of ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' nominated ''Microsoft Encarta '95'' for their 1994 \"Best Educational Product\" award, although it lost to the CD-ROM adaptation of ''[[The Way Things Work]]''.<ref name=pcgamerusawards2>{{cite journal |date=March 1995 | title=The First Annual ''PC Gamer'' Awards | pages=44, 45, 47, 48, 51 | journal=[[PC Gamer]] | author=Staff | volume=2 | issue=3 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lists of encyclopedias]]\n* [[List of online encyclopedias]]\n* [[List of encyclopedias by branch of knowledge]]\n* [[List of encyclopedias by language#English|List of encyclopedias by language (English)]]\n* [[List of historical encyclopedias]]\n* [[Microsoft Music Central]]\n* [[Reference software]]\n* [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031074236/http://encarta.msn.com |date=October 31, 2009 |title=Encarta }}\n\n{{MSN services}}\n{{Microsoft products|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1993 software]]\n[[Category:American online encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:Discontinued Microsoft software]]\n[[Category:Dutch online encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:Educational software for Windows]]\n[[Category:French online encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:German online encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:Italian online encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:Japanese online encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:MSN]]\n[[Category:Spanish online encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:Windows-only software]]\n[[Category:20th-century encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:21st-century encyclopedias]]\n[[Category:Products and services discontinued in 2008]]\n", "name_user": "Brainulator9", "label": "safe", "comment": "infobox and cite fixes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta"}
