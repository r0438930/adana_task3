In its decision, the court reached back through the history of the multiple failures of Congress and Presidents to ratify agreements with Indian tribes in the 1850s. The Kawaiisu Tribe alleges that the Tejon/Sebastian Reservation was created pursuant to the Act of 1853, pointing to a letter from President Franklin Pierce to the Secretary of the Interior, Robert McClelland, and a subsequent letter from the Secretary to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs for California, Edward Beale, from that same year.<ref name=TejonRanchNotOwnedCVBT/></blockquote>\n\n===Sufficiency of notice===\nAdam Keats, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, said he believed the county had violated the [[California Environmental Quality Act]], or CEQA, with a \"rushed public hearing process.\"<ref name=Enterprise091009/> And Patric Hedlund, the editor of a local weekly newspaper, the [[Mountain Enterprise]], wrote that the draft [[Environmental Impact Assessment#United States|environmental impact report]] on the village was \"15 notebooks, 13 of them 5.5 inches thick, two others adding four more inches, plus two rolls of large maps.
