In 1943, the interior frontispiece art was updated to conform to current 1940s style. In 1950, the dust jacket was revamped as a wraparound jacket, with the picture continuing onto the [[spine (book)|spine]] of the book, and with [[cover art]] by [[Bill Gillies]] that was more in keeping with 1950s style. Gillies' Nancy, modeled after his wife, looks more mature than 16 (her age in the text at the time).

However, the original text, as written by Mildred Wirt Benson (who died in 2002), and the character of Nancy Drew, will not enter the Canadian public domain until January 1, 2053, due to Canada's life-plus-50 years copyright policy.
