Most were [[Indian Removal|removed]] to [[Indian Territory]] in the 1830s, but some remained and became citizens of the state and the United States.\n\nEarly in the 20th century, the first agricultural high school in Mississippi opened in the [[unincorporated community]] of Buena Vista. [[Cully Cobb]], a pioneer of southern agriculture,  long-term farm publisher, and an official of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], was the superintendent of the school from 1908\u20131910.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobb.msstate.edu/cobbfndr.html|title=The Founders of the Cobb Institute of Archaeology|publisher=Mississippi State University |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Mississippi state legislature created Chickasaw County in 1836, following the cession of the land by the [[Chickasaw]] Indians. It was quickly settled by Americans from the east, mainly from the Southern states. By the time of the Civil War, riverfront landings had been developed by the many large cotton plantations worked by [[slaves]], who outnumbered the white residents of the county.<ref name=\"Chickasaw County History\">{{cite web|title=Chickasaw County History|url=http://msgw.org/chickasaw/chickasawcohistory.html|publisher=msgw.org|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe [[American Civil War]] devastated the local economy, completely destroying the plantation-based infrastructure of Chickasaw County. The newly freed slaves had to adapt to the new labor system, in which the white landowners still retained partial control over their lives through the practice of [[sharecropping]]. The economy declined again in the late 19th century, when falling cotton prices reduced both black and white residents to poverty. Farmers eventually began diversifying their crops, and the economy slowly began to improve.<ref name=\"Chickasaw County History\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|504|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|502|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|2.5|sqmi}} (0.5%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=November 3, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:US 45.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 45]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 8.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 8]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 15.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 15]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 32.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 32]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 41.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 41]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 47.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 47]]\n* [[Natchez Trace Parkway]]\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Pontotoc County, Mississippi|Pontotoc County]] (north)\n* [[Lee County, Mississippi|Lee County]] (northeast)\n* [[Monroe County, Mississippi|Monroe County]] (east)\n* [[Clay County, Mississippi|Clay County]] (southeast)\n* [[Webster County, Mississippi|Webster County]] (southwest)\n* [[Calhoun County, Mississippi|Calhoun County]] (west)\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] (part)\n* [[Tombigbee National Forest]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 2955\n|1850= 16369\n|1860= 16426\n|1870= 19899\n|1880= 17905\n|1890= 19891\n|1900= 19892\n|1910= 22846\n|1920= 22212\n|1930= 20835\n|1940= 21427\n|1950= 18951\n|1960= 16891\n|1970= 16805\n|1980= 17853\n|1990= 18085\n|2000= 19440\n|2010= 17392\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=17171\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ms190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

[[Cully Cobb]], a pioneer of southern agriculture,  long-term farm publisher, and an official of the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], was the superintendent of the school from 1908\u20131910.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobb.msstate.edu/cobbfndr.html|title=The Founders of the Cobb Institute of Archaeology|publisher=Mississippi State University |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Mississippi state legislature created Chickasaw County in 1836, following the cession of the land by the [[Chickasaw]] Indians. It was quickly settled by Americans from the east, mainly from the Southern states. By the time of the Civil War, riverfront landings had been developed by the many large cotton plantations worked by [[slaves]], who outnumbered the white residents of the county.<ref name=\"Chickasaw County History\">{{cite web|title=Chickasaw County History|url=http://msgw.org/chickasaw/chickasawcohistory.html|publisher=msgw.org|accessdate=October 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe [[American Civil War]] devastated the local economy, completely destroying the plantation-based infrastructure of Chickasaw County. The newly freed slaves had to adapt to the new labor system, in which the white landowners still retained partial control over their lives through the practice of [[sharecropping]]. The economy declined again in the late 19th century, when falling cotton prices reduced both black and white residents to poverty. Farmers eventually began diversifying their crops, and the economy slowly began to improve.<ref name=\"Chickasaw County History\"/>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|504|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|502|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|2.5|sqmi}} (0.5%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928074019/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_28.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=November 3, 2014 |date=August 22, 2012 |title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files }}</ref>\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[Image:US 45.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 45]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 8.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 8]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 15.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 15]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 32.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 32]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 41.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 41]]\n* [[Image:Circle sign 47.svg|20px]] [[Mississippi Highway 47]]\n* [[Natchez Trace Parkway]]\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Pontotoc County, Mississippi|Pontotoc County]] (north)\n* [[Lee County, Mississippi|Lee County]] (northeast)\n* [[Monroe County, Mississippi|Monroe County]] (east)\n* [[Clay County, Mississippi|Clay County]] (southeast)\n* [[Webster County, Mississippi|Webster County]] (southwest)\n* [[Calhoun County, Mississippi|Calhoun County]] (west)\n\n===National protected areas===\n* [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] (part)\n* [[Tombigbee National Forest]] (part)\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1840= 2955\n|1850= 16369\n|1860= 16426\n|1870= 19899\n|1880= 17905\n|1890= 19891\n|1900= 19892\n|1910= 22846\n|1920= 22212\n|1930= 20835\n|1940= 21427\n|1950= 18951\n|1960= 16891\n|1970= 16805\n|1980= 17853\n|1990= 18085\n|2000= 19440\n|2010= 17392\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=17171\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ms190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 3, 2014}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.
