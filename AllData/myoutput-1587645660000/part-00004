The series stars [[Tiger Shroff]] as Ronnie. Each film starts with a fresh story unrelated to the preceding film's story.\n\n==Overview==\n===''Baaghi'' (2016)===\n{{Main|Baaghi (2016 film)}}\nThe film starts with [[martial arts]] champion Raghav Shetty ([[Sudheer Babu]]) kidnapping Sia Khurana ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) from her film's set in [[Hyderabad]] and taking her to [[Bangkok]]. Sia's father P.P. Khurana ([[Sunil Grover]]) goes to government offices and the police for help but no one is ready to assist them since Raghav is an influential man. Khurana then turns to Sia's ex-boyfriend, Ranveer \u2018Ronnie\u2019 Pratap Singh ([[Tiger Shroff]]).\n\nIn a flashback, Ronnie and Sia meet on a train. Raghav sees Sia at the train station and starts to like her. He tells his men to get information about her. Ronnie visits the martial arts school of a certain Guruswamy in [[Kerala]]. In a letter to Guruswamy, Ronnie's father explains that Ronnie is a ''Baaghi'' (rebel), and asks him to make Ronnie a good human being. Ronnie and Sia fall in love, and Sia gives him a ring she got from her father, asking him to always keep it. Raghav asks for Sia's hand from Khurana, and Khurana is so lost by greed when he sees how much money Raghav offers for Sia. He agrees to hand Sia over to Raghav but when he sees that Ronnie has Sia's ring, he realizes she is in love with Ronnie. He informs Raghav, who decides to kill Ronnie.\n\nRonnie beats up Raghav's men when they manhandle Subbu, a mute little boy Ronnie is close to, only for Raghav to get him arrested later on. Guruswamy tries to persuade Raghav, his son, to stop pursuing Sia, but Raghav poisons and kills him to get him out of the way. Ronnie is heartbroken to hear of Guruswamy's death since he had seen him as a father figure. Khurana then creates a misunderstanding between Sia and Ronnie to separate them, which works and the two-part ways.\n\nIn the present, Ronnie reaches [[Bangkok]] and visits Raghav's fight club, beating the strongest fighter there to get Raghav's attention. The next day, Ronnie breaks into the house of Raghav's right-hand man, Biju, and threatens Biju's wife at gunpoint, forcing him to reveal Sia's location. Finding out she was at the hospital, Ronnie saves Sia and escapes with her under both of them being disguised as a doctor and nurse. The two stop at an island on their way back to [[India]], where Sia discovers her father's deceit when she sees that Ronnie is still wearing her ring. The couple reconciles but Raghav and his men attack them. Biju shoots Ronnie, who falls off a cliff.\n\nRaghav takes Sia back to his place. It is then revealed that Ronnie is alive. It turns out that Biju had used blank bullets in his gun, sparing him as Ronnie had spared his wife's life earlier. Raghav kills Biju when Biju says that he believes Ronnie to be right.\n\nRonnie storms Raghav's building and single-handedly fights off all of the killers and swordsmen in Raghav's employ. He reaches Raghav, who initially overpowers him, but when Raghav reveals that he was the one who murdered Guruswamy, Ronnie becomes enraged and uses Guruswamy's signature moves to kill Raghav. In the end, Ronnie, now happily together with Sia, becomes the new teacher in Guruswamy's school, where a statue of Guruswamy now stands.\n\n===''Baaghi 2'' (2018)===\n{{Main|Baaghi 2}}\nThe film opens with a woman named Neha Rawat who has a sudden attack. On regaining consciousness, she looks for her missing daughter Rhea Salgaonkar. A helpless Neha calls Ronnie Pratap Singh, her former college boyfriend, who is now an [[Indian Army]] [[Para SF]] soldier. The film then shows the time of their introduction to each other.\n\nFour years ago, Ronnie and Neha met in college. Though initially, Neha does not like him, they become friends and he falls in love with her. After proposing to Neha, Ronnie promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble. On their wedding day, Neha's father, Mahendra, suffers a heart attack and then Neha goes to meet him at a hospital. Mahendra, who doesn't like Ronnie, asks Neha not to marry him as he fixed her marriage with his friend's son Shekhar Salgaonkar. On her father's last wish, Neha leaves Ronnie.\n\nBack in the present, at the hotel Ronnie is asked to meet Neha, he finds her frightened, broken and lost. On asking her about her family, Neha reveals that her 3-year-old daughter, Rhea, has been missing since she dropped her at school on Rhea's first school day, where she was assaulted outside the gates and Rhea was taken by kidnappers.\n\nWhen Ronnie asks Neha about Shekhar, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronnie to help her find Rhea. Ronnie remembers his promise and accepts the task to find Rhea.\n\nRonnie goes to rent a car, where he meets and befriends a lump man named Usman Langda. Ronnie and Neha visit the police station where FIR writer Inspector Sharad Kutey acts inappropriately towards Neha. Ronnie beats him up, an action that gets him arrested, but he is subsequently released after Kutey's boss, [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Ajay Shergill, requests for it.\n\nAfter his release, Ronnie questions Neha in her apartment but as suddenly Neha's alcoholic and drug-abusing brother-in-law Sunny, arrives, she tells him to leave. When Sunny goes out, Ronnie asks Neha for his address. He begins to look for clues but everybody he asks claims that Shekhar and Neha had no daughter.\n\nUnable to find Rhea through any CCTV footage, Ronnie meets a police inspector who has photos of Rhea including certificates to prove that Neha is telling the truth. Ronnie then meets Shekhar who tells him that Neha had a miscarriage following an accident. She was diagnosed with PTSD and began thinking that she and Shekhar had a daughter who doesn't exist.\n\nOn hearing Shekhar's tellings, Ronnie asks Neha but she denies it, claiming everyone is against her and insisting she has a daughter. When Ronnie claims she doesn't have a daughter, she asks him to leave which is when he notices the marks of Rhea's height growth on the wall. He starts to doubt his beliefs but is too late as Neha commits [[suicide]], feeling clueless because no one believed her.\n\nThe police reach the spot immediately with [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Loha Singh Dhull. Loha suspects Shekhar. The police find Ronnie using Neha's contacts. After Usman confesses seeing Rhea with Sunny, Ronnie leaves the hotel and finds Sunny, but Sunny is taken into custody by the police. While being interrogated, he attacks Ajay but is shot in the subsequent fight and dies.\n\nFor his next attempt, Ronnie goes to Usman's office where Usman is attacked by the thugs that assaulted him. He beats up the thugs but Usman dies from his injuries. Ronnie takes the phone of one of the thugs, revealing texts about their targets, followed by a photo of himself which was taken in Ajay's home. He realizes that Ajay is the mastermind.\n\nAfter killing an entire army of goons all alone in a secluded forest in Ajay's place in [[Vietnam|Goa]], Ronnie confronts Ajay in his dungeon, who reveals being paid by Shekhar for planning Rhea's kidnapping, as Shekhar hated Rhea. Everyone involved with the family was either killed or bribed into playing along and Neha was being brain-washed so that she would appear insane, as the only person who knew about her daughter's existence.\n\nHaving heard this, Ronnie defeats Ajay in a fight. Loha arrives and shoots Ajay to death. Ronnie gets a glimpse of Rhea before fainting. After regaining consciousness, Loha tells that Rhea is Ronnie's illegitimate daughter. After learning this, Ronnie remembers that time when Neha met him to end their relationship and ended up consummating their relationship four years ago. He sees Neha's spirit telling him that Rhea is the most beautiful thing about their relationship.\n\nLoha tells Ronnie that Shekhar confessed and revealed that he kidnapped Rhea since his doctor declared him sterile, revealing that Rhea wasn't his child. The film ends with Ronnie beginning to live with Rhea and seeing a reflection of the dead Neha sitting behind them.\n\n===''Baaghi 3'' (2020)===\n{{Main|Baaghi 3}}\nUnemployed goon Ranveer \"Ronnie\" Pratap Singh ([[Tiger Shroff]]) lives with his elder brother Vikram ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]). Ronnie rescues Vikram from any bad or dangerous situation. Vikram dislikes to involve himself in fights. Ronnie requests Vikram to take up a police job as their father Charan ([[Jackie Shroff]]) was in the police force years ago.\n\nRonnie secretly punishes goons as Vikram was timid and does not like violence. For this, Vikram rises to fame for his activities and is well received. Vikram had to fly to [[Syria]] for routine paperwork and bids goodbye to his brother. In a video chat, Ronnie witnesses Vikram beaten up by two people and as they kidnap him, Ronnie warns that he will destroy them and the country.\n\nRonnie arrives in Syria along with his girlfriend Siya ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]), who is also Vikram's wife Ruchi ([[Ankita Lokhande]])'s sister. They find out that Vikram was kidnapped by the [[ISIS]] whose leader is Abu Jalal Gaza. Ronnie fights his way through helicopters, tanks and lots of soldiers. Meanwhile, in the base of Abu, Vikram explains to him that whenever he was in trouble he used to scream out Ronnie's name. \n\nAs Vikram screamed Ronnie's name, Ronnie invades the base to save Vikram and meets up him. Abu Jalal imprisons Vikram and Siya. As Ronnie is beaten up, Vikram goes astray and starts fighting the soldiers to Ronnie's surprise. Ronnie executes Abu.\n\n===''Baaghi 4'' (TBA)===\nOn 9 March 2020, [[Ahmed Khan (choreographer)|Ahmed Khan]] said, \"The owner of the film is [[Sajid Nadiadwala]].

Khurana then turns to Sia's ex-boyfriend, Ranveer \u2018Ronnie\u2019 Pratap Singh ([[Tiger Shroff]]).\n\nIn a flashback, Ronnie and Sia meet on a train. Raghav sees Sia at the train station and starts to like her. He tells his men to get information about her. Ronnie visits the martial arts school of a certain Guruswamy in [[Kerala]]. In a letter to Guruswamy, Ronnie's father explains that Ronnie is a ''Baaghi'' (rebel), and asks him to make Ronnie a good human being. Ronnie and Sia fall in love, and Sia gives him a ring she got from her father, asking him to always keep it. Raghav asks for Sia's hand from Khurana, and Khurana is so lost by greed when he sees how much money Raghav offers for Sia. He agrees to hand Sia over to Raghav but when he sees that Ronnie has Sia's ring, he realizes she is in love with Ronnie. He informs Raghav, who decides to kill Ronnie.\n\nRonnie beats up Raghav's men when they manhandle Subbu, a mute little boy Ronnie is close to, only for Raghav to get him arrested later on. Guruswamy tries to persuade Raghav, his son, to stop pursuing Sia, but Raghav poisons and kills him to get him out of the way. Ronnie is heartbroken to hear of Guruswamy's death since he had seen him as a father figure. Khurana then creates a misunderstanding between Sia and Ronnie to separate them, which works and the two-part ways.\n\nIn the present, Ronnie reaches [[Bangkok]] and visits Raghav's fight club, beating the strongest fighter there to get Raghav's attention. The next day, Ronnie breaks into the house of Raghav's right-hand man, Biju, and threatens Biju's wife at gunpoint, forcing him to reveal Sia's location. Finding out she was at the hospital, Ronnie saves Sia and escapes with her under both of them being disguised as a doctor and nurse. The two stop at an island on their way back to [[India]], where Sia discovers her father's deceit when she sees that Ronnie is still wearing her ring. The couple reconciles but Raghav and his men attack them. Biju shoots Ronnie, who falls off a cliff.\n\nRaghav takes Sia back to his place. It is then revealed that Ronnie is alive. It turns out that Biju had used blank bullets in his gun, sparing him as Ronnie had spared his wife's life earlier. Raghav kills Biju when Biju says that he believes Ronnie to be right.\n\nRonnie storms Raghav's building and single-handedly fights off all of the killers and swordsmen in Raghav's employ. He reaches Raghav, who initially overpowers him, but when Raghav reveals that he was the one who murdered Guruswamy, Ronnie becomes enraged and uses Guruswamy's signature moves to kill Raghav. In the end, Ronnie, now happily together with Sia, becomes the new teacher in Guruswamy's school, where a statue of Guruswamy now stands.\n\n===''Baaghi 2'' (2018)===\n{{Main|Baaghi 2}}\nThe film opens with a woman named Neha Rawat who has a sudden attack. On regaining consciousness, she looks for her missing daughter Rhea Salgaonkar. A helpless Neha calls Ronnie Pratap Singh, her former college boyfriend, who is now an [[Indian Army]] [[Para SF]] soldier. The film then shows the time of their introduction to each other.\n\nFour years ago, Ronnie and Neha met in college. Though initially, Neha does not like him, they become friends and he falls in love with her. After proposing to Neha, Ronnie promises to her that he will always help and be with her if she is ever in trouble. On their wedding day, Neha's father, Mahendra, suffers a heart attack and then Neha goes to meet him at a hospital. Mahendra, who doesn't like Ronnie, asks Neha not to marry him as he fixed her marriage with his friend's son Shekhar Salgaonkar. On her father's last wish, Neha leaves Ronnie.\n\nBack in the present, at the hotel Ronnie is asked to meet Neha, he finds her frightened, broken and lost. On asking her about her family, Neha reveals that her 3-year-old daughter, Rhea, has been missing since she dropped her at school on Rhea's first school day, where she was assaulted outside the gates and Rhea was taken by kidnappers.\n\nWhen Ronnie asks Neha about Shekhar, she tells him that Shekhar has been depressed since the kidnap. Neha requests Ronnie to help her find Rhea. Ronnie remembers his promise and accepts the task to find Rhea.\n\nRonnie goes to rent a car, where he meets and befriends a lump man named Usman Langda. Ronnie and Neha visit the police station where FIR writer Inspector Sharad Kutey acts inappropriately towards Neha. Ronnie beats him up, an action that gets him arrested, but he is subsequently released after Kutey's boss, [[Deputy Inspector General of Police|DIG]] Ajay Shergill, requests for it.\n\nAfter his release, Ronnie questions Neha in her apartment but as suddenly Neha's alcoholic and drug-abusing brother-in-law Sunny, arrives, she tells him to leave. When Sunny goes out, Ronnie asks Neha for his address. He begins to look for clues but everybody he asks claims that Shekhar and Neha had no daughter.\n\nUnable to find Rhea through any CCTV footage, Ronnie meets a police inspector who has photos of Rhea including certificates to prove that Neha is telling the truth. Ronnie then meets Shekhar who tells him that Neha had a miscarriage following an accident. She was diagnosed with PTSD and began thinking that she and Shekhar had a daughter who doesn't exist.\n\nOn hearing Shekhar's tellings, Ronnie asks Neha but she denies it, claiming everyone is against her and insisting she has a daughter. When Ronnie claims she doesn't have a daughter, she asks him to leave which is when he notices the marks of Rhea's height growth on the wall. He starts to doubt his beliefs but is too late as Neha commits [[suicide]], feeling clueless because no one believed her.\n\nThe police reach the spot immediately with [[Assistant commissioner|ACP]] Loha Singh Dhull. Loha suspects Shekhar. The police find Ronnie using Neha's contacts. After Usman confesses seeing Rhea with Sunny, Ronnie leaves the hotel and finds Sunny, but Sunny is taken into custody by the police. While being interrogated, he attacks Ajay but is shot in the subsequent fight and dies.\n\nFor his next attempt, Ronnie goes to Usman's office where Usman is attacked by the thugs that assaulted him. He beats up the thugs but Usman dies from his injuries. Ronnie takes the phone of one of the thugs, revealing texts about their targets, followed by a photo of himself which was taken in Ajay's home. He realizes that Ajay is the mastermind.\n\nAfter killing an entire army of goons all alone in a secluded forest in Ajay's place in [[Vietnam|Goa]], Ronnie confronts Ajay in his dungeon, who reveals being paid by Shekhar for planning Rhea's kidnapping, as Shekhar hated Rhea. Everyone involved with the family was either killed or bribed into playing along and Neha was being brain-washed so that she would appear insane, as the only person who knew about her daughter's existence.\n\nHaving heard this, Ronnie defeats Ajay in a fight. Loha arrives and shoots Ajay to death. Ronnie gets a glimpse of Rhea before fainting. After regaining consciousness, Loha tells that Rhea is Ronnie's illegitimate daughter. After learning this, Ronnie remembers that time when Neha met him to end their relationship and ended up consummating their relationship four years ago. He sees Neha's spirit telling him that Rhea is the most beautiful thing about their relationship.\n\nLoha tells Ronnie that Shekhar confessed and revealed that he kidnapped Rhea since his doctor declared him sterile, revealing that Rhea wasn't his child. The film ends with Ronnie beginning to live with Rhea and seeing a reflection of the dead Neha sitting behind them.\n\n===''Baaghi 3'' (2020)===\n{{Main|Baaghi 3}}\nUnemployed goon Ranveer \"Ronnie\" Pratap Singh ([[Tiger Shroff]]) lives with his elder brother Vikram ([[Riteish Deshmukh]]). Ronnie rescues Vikram from any bad or dangerous situation. Vikram dislikes to involve himself in fights. Ronnie requests Vikram to take up a police job as their father Charan ([[Jackie Shroff]]) was in the police force years ago.\n\nRonnie secretly punishes goons as Vikram was timid and does not like violence. For this, Vikram rises to fame for his activities and is well received. Vikram had to fly to [[Syria]] for routine paperwork and bids goodbye to his brother. In a video chat, Ronnie witnesses Vikram beaten up by two people and as they kidnap him, Ronnie warns that he will destroy them and the country.\n\nRonnie arrives in Syria along with his girlfriend Siya ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]), who is also Vikram's wife Ruchi ([[Ankita Lokhande]])'s sister. They find out that Vikram was kidnapped by the [[ISIS]] whose leader is Abu Jalal Gaza. Ronnie fights his way through helicopters, tanks and lots of soldiers. Meanwhile, in the base of Abu, Vikram explains to him that whenever he was in trouble he used to scream out Ronnie's name. \n\nAs Vikram screamed Ronnie's name, Ronnie invades the base to save Vikram and meets up him. Abu Jalal imprisons Vikram and Siya. As Ronnie is beaten up, Vikram goes astray and starts fighting the soldiers to Ronnie's surprise. Ronnie executes Abu.\n\n===''Baaghi 4'' (TBA)===\nOn 9 March 2020, [[Ahmed Khan (choreographer)|Ahmed Khan]] said, \"The owner of the film is [[Sajid Nadiadwala]]. If he decides that we should go ahead with '''''Baaghi 4''''', we will do it. But we will keep the franchise alive definitely.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Director Ahmed Khan hints at 'Baaghi 4', says 'will keep the franchise alive'|url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/hindi/2020/mar/09/director-ahmed-khan-hints-at-baaghi-4-says-will-keep-the-franchise-alive-2114545.html|work=The New Indian Express|accessdate=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 April 2020, while interacting with [[Bollywood Hungama]], [[Tiger Shroff]] said, \u201cYou know I have gotten so many messages and so many calls from people who\u2019ve said they have unfortunately missed ''Baaghi 3'', because of the situation in the world. They were really etching to see but could not, because of all that was happening. So, the only thing on my mind right now is Baaghi, and as you said, I hope they re-release the film.
