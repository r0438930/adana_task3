The album, a single 43-minute track broken into 5 movements, incorporates many different rock elements. The band frequently revisits the song in concert. \n\nOn 13 September 2009, as a special set for the [[Flaming Lips]]-curated [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] New York 2009 in [[Monticello, NY|Monticello]], Boris performed the album in its entirety. They performed the album again at the [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]-curated ATP at [[Minehead]] [[Butlin's]] on 15 May 2010. There is an official DVD released on 2005 and limited to 500 which was released by [[Diwphalanx Records]]. This DVD was originally an unofficial recording of the band performing the entirety of \"Feedbacker\" live in New York and entitled ''[[Bootleg -Feedbacker-]]''. The official DVD release depicts a different member of the band lying in a pool of [[blood]] similar to Wata on the album cover.\n\n== Track listing ==\nOn the LP release the track is split into two parts, one on each side.
