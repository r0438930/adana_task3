Precise spelling aside, the name was first adopted in the 1960s by regional social and political leaders.{{sfn|Shackle|1977}}\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n{{More information|Punjabi dialects}}\nSaraiki is a member of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] subdivision of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. Standard Punjabi and Saraiki (South Punjabi) are mutually intelligible.\n\nIn 1919, [[George Abraham Grierson|Grierson]] maintained that the dialects of what is now the southwest of Punjab Province in Pakistan constitute a dialect cluster, which he designated \"Southern [[Lahnda]]\" within a putative \"Lahnda language\". Subsequent Indo-Aryanist linguists have confirmed the reality of this dialect cluster, even while rejecting the name \"Southern Lahnda\" along with the entity \"Lahnda\" itself.{{sfn|Masica|1991|pp=18\u201320}} Grierson also maintained that \"Lahnda\" was his novel designation for various dialects up to then called \"Western Punjabi\", spoken north, west, and south of [[Lahore]]. The local dialect of Lahore is the [[Majhi dialect]] of [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], which has long been the basis of standard literary Punjabi.{{sfn|Grierson|1919}} However, outside of Indo-Aryanist circles, the concept of \"Lahnda\" is still found in compilations of the world's languages (e.g. [[Ethnologue]]).\n\n===Dialects===\nThe following dialects have been tentatively proposed for Saraiki:<ref>This is the grouping in {{harvtxt|Wagha|1997|pp=229\u201331}}, which largely coincides with that in {{harvtxt|Shackle|1976|pp=5\u20138}}.</ref>\n\n*Central Saraiki, including Multani: spoken in the districts of [[Dera Ghazi Khan District|Dera Ghazi Khan]], [[Muzaffargarh District|Muzaffargarh]], [[Layyah District|Leiah]], [[Multan District|Multan]] and [[Bahawalpur District|Bahawalpur]].\n*Southern Saraiki: prevalent in the districts of [[Rajanpur District|Rajanpur]] and [[Rahim Yar Khan District|Rahimyar Khan]].\n*Sindhi Saraiki: dispersed throughout the province of [[Sindh]].\n*Northern Saraiki, or [[Thali dialect|Thali]]:{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=8}} spoken in the district of [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]] and the northern parts of the [[Thal region]], including [[Mianwali District]].\n*Eastern Saraiki: transitional to Punjabi and spoken in the [[Bar region]] along the boundary with the eastern [[Majhi dialect]]. This group includes the dialects of [[Jhangi dialect|Jhangi]] and [[Shahpuri]].{{efn|This eastern group figures in Wagha's scheme. In its place Shackle's classification has Jhangi and Shahpuri as separate branches.}} Most speakers of those dialects, however, tend to identify with Punjabi rather than Saraiki.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe historical inventory of names for the dialects now called Saraiki is a confusion of overlapping or conflicting ethnic, local, and regional designations. One historical name for Saraiki, Ja\u1e6dki, means \"of the [[Jat people|Ja\u1e6d\u1e6ds]]\", a northern [[South Asia]]n ethnic group; but Ja\u1e6d\u1e6ds speak the Indo-Aryan dialect of whatever region they live in.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Only a small minority of Saraiki speakers are Ja\u1e6d\u1e6ds, and not all Saraiki speaking Ja\u1e6d\u1e6ds necessarily speak the same dialect of Saraiki. However, these people usually call their traditions as well as language as ''Jataki''. Conversely, several Saraiki dialects have multiple names corresponding to different locales or demographic groups. The name \"[[Derawali dialect|Derawali]]\" is used to refer to the local dialects of both [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] and [[Dera Ismail Khan]], but \"\u1e0cerawali\" in the former is the Multani dialect and \"Derawali\" in the latter is the Tha\u1e37i dialect.{{sfn|Masica|1991|p = 426}}{{sfn|Grierson|1919|pp=239ff}}\n\nWhen consulting sources before 2000, it is important to know that Pakistani administrative boundaries have been altered frequently. Provinces in Pakistan are divided into [[Districts of Pakistan|districts]], and sources on \"Saraiki\" often describe the territory of a dialect or dialect group according to the districts. Since the founding of Pakistan in 1947, several of these districts have been subdivided, some multiple times.<!--see for example Nasirabad District-->\n\n===Status of language or dialect===\nIn the context of South Asia, the choice between the appellations [[Dialect#Dialect or language|\"language\" and \"dialect\"]] is a difficult one, and any distinction made using these terms is obscured by their ambiguity.<ref>See {{harvnb|Masica|1991|pp=23\u201327}}.

To the west, it is set off from the [[Pashto]]- and [[Balochi language|Balochi]]-speaking areas by the [[Suleiman Range]], while to the south-east the [[Thar desert]] divides it from the [[Marwari language]]. Its other boundaries are less well-defined: [[Panjabi language|Punjabi]] is spoken to the east; [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] is found to the south, after the border with [[Sindh province]]; to the north, the southern edge of the [[Salt Range]] is the rough divide with the northern varieties of Western Punjabi.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n===Pakistan===\nToday, 25.9 million people from North Sindh, South Punjab, South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Eastern Balochistan province speak Saraiki.\n\nThe first national census of Pakistan to gather data on the prevalence of Saraiki was the census of 1981.{{sfn|Javaid|2004}} In that year, the percentage of respondents nationwide reporting Saraiki as their native language was 9.83.

Geminates occur only after stressed centralised vowels,{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=27}} and are phonetically realised much less markedly than in the rest of the Punjabi area.{{sfn|Shackle|2003|p=592}}\n\nA [[Stress (phonetics)|stressed]] syllable is distinguished primarily by its [[Vowel length|length]]: if the vowel is peripheral {{IPA|/i \u025b a o u/}} then it is lengthened, and if it is a \"centralised vowel\" ({{IPA|/\u026a \u028a \u0259/}}) then the consonant following it is geminated. Stress normally falls on the first syllable of a word. The stress will, however, fall on the second syllable of a two-syllable word if the vowel in the first syllable is centralised, and the second syllable contains either a diphthong, or a peripheral vowel followed by a consonant, for example {{IPA|/d\u026a\u027e'k\u02b0an/}} 'carpenter'. Three-syllable words are stressed on the second syllable if the first syllable contains a centralised vowel, and the second syllable has either a peripheral vowel, or a centralised vowel + geminate, for example {{IPA|/t\u0283\u028a'h\u0259tt\u0259\u027e/}} 'seventy-four'. There are exceptions to these rules and they account for minimal pairs like {{IPA|/it'la/}} 'informing' and {{IPA|/'itla/}} 'so much'.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=28\u201329}}\n\n===Implosives===\nThe unusual for South Asia [[implosive consonant]]s are found in [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], possibly some [[Rajasthani languages|Rajasthani dialects]],{{sfn|Masica|1991|p=104}} and Saraiki, which has the following series: /{{IPA link|\u0253}} {{IPA link|\u1d91}} {{IPA link|\u0284}} {{IPA link|\u0260}}/.\n\nThe \"palatal\" {{IPA|/\u0284/}} is [[denti-alveolar]]{{sfn|Bahl|1936|p=28}} and [[Laminal consonant|laminal]], articulated further forward than most other palatals.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=22}}{{efn|{{harvtxt|Bahl|1936|p=28}} describes its place of articulation as almost identical to the {{grapheme|d'}} [{{IPA link|\u025f}}] of [[Czech phonology|Czech]].}}\n\nThe \"[[retroflex]]\" {{IPA|/\u1d91/}} is articulated with the [[Apical consonant|tip]] or the [[Subapical consonant|underside]] of the tongue, further forward in the mouth than the plain retroflex stops. It has been described as [[post-alveolar]],{{sfn|Shackle|1976|pp=22\u201323}} [[pre-palatal]] or [[pre-retroflex]].{{sfn|Bahl|1936|p=28}} {{harvtxt|Bahl|1936|p=30}} reports that this sound is unique in Indo-Aryan and that speakers of Multani take pride in its distinctiveness. The plain voiced {{IPA|/\u0256/}} and the implosive {{IPA|/\u1d91/}} are mostly in [[complementary distribution]] although there are a few minimal pairs, like {{IPA|/\u0256ak\u0288\u0259\u027e/}} 'doctor' \u223c {{IPA|/\u1d91ak/}} 'mail'.{{sfn|Shackle|2003|pp=590\u201391}}{{sfn|Shackle|1976|pp=20\u201321}} The retroflex implosive alternates with the plain voiced dental stop {{IPA|/d/}} in the [[genitive case|genitive]] [[postposition]]/suffix {{IPA|/da/}}, which takes the form of {{IPA|/\u1d91a/}} when combined with 1st or 2nd person pronouns: {{IPA|/me\u1d91a/}} 'my', {{IPA|/te\u1d91a/}} 'your'.{{sfn|Bahl|1936|p=80}}\n\nA [[dental implosive]] ({{IPA|/\u0257\u032a/}}) is found in the northeastern [[Jhangi dialect]], which is characterised by a lack of phonemic contrast between implosives and plain stops,{{sfn|Wagha|1997|pp=234\u201335}} and a preference for implosives even in words where Saraiki has a plain stop.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=23}} The dental implosive in Jhangi is articulated with the tongue completely covering the upper teeth.{{sfn|Bahl|1936|p=28}} It is not present in Saraiki, although {{harvtxt|Bahl|1936|p=29}} contends that it should be [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] for the earlier language. Its absence has been attributed to structural factors: the forward articulation of {{IPA|/\u0284/}} and the lesser retroflexion of {{IPA|/\u1d91/}}.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Shackle|2003|pp=590\u201391}}\n\nAspirated ([[breathy voiced]]) implosives occur word-initially, where they contrast with aspirated plain stops: ''{{IPA|/\u0253\u02b0\u025b(h)/}}'' 'sit' ~ ''{{IPA|/b\u02b0\u025b/}}'' 'fear'.{{sfn|Bahl|1936|pp=77\u201378}} The aspiration is not [[phonemic]];{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=22}} it is phonetically realised on the whole syllable,{{sfn|Bahl|1936|pp=39\u201340}} and results from an underlying {{IPA|/h/}} that follows the vowel, thus {{IPA|[\u0253\u02b0\u025bh]}} is phonemically {{IPA|/\u0253\u025bh/}}.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=31}}\n\nThe historical origin of the Saraiki implosives has been on the whole{{efn|Saraiki differs for example in the presence of geminated implosives, or the treatment of Sanskrit ''{{IAST|vy-}}'', whose Saraiki reflex {{IPA|/\u0253/}} contrasts with the Sindhi {{IPA|/w/}}.{{harv|Bahl|1936|pp=57\u201364}}}} the same as in Sindhi. Their source has generally been the older language's series of plain voiced stops, thus [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|'''j'''anayati}}'' > Saraiki ''{{IPA|'''\u0284'''\u0259\u0272\u0259n}}'' 'be born'. New plain voiced stops have in turn arisen out of certain consonants and consonant clusters (for example, ''{{IAST|'''y'''ava}}'' > ''{{IPA|'''d\u0292'''ao}}'' 'barley'), or have been introduced in loanwords from [[Sanskrit]], [[Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[English language|English]] (''{{IPA|'''\u0261'''\u0259rd\u0259n}}'' 'throat', ''{{IPA|'''b'''\u0259s}}'' 'bus').

Precise spelling aside, the name was first adopted in the 1960s by regional social and political leaders.{{sfn|Shackle|1977}}\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n{{More information|Punjabi dialects}}\nSaraiki is a member of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] subdivision of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family. Standard Punjabi and Saraiki (South Punjabi) are mutually intelligible.\n\nIn 1919, [[George Abraham Grierson|Grierson]] maintained that the dialects of what is now the southwest of Punjab Province in Pakistan constitute a dialect cluster, which he designated \"Southern [[Lahnda]]\" within a putative \"Lahnda language\". Subsequent Indo-Aryanist linguists have confirmed the reality of this dialect cluster, even while rejecting the name \"Southern Lahnda\" along with the entity \"Lahnda\" itself.{{sfn|Masica|1991|pp=18\u201320}} Grierson also maintained that \"Lahnda\" was his novel designation for various dialects up to then called \"Western Punjabi\", spoken north, west, and south of [[Lahore]]. The local dialect of Lahore is the [[Majhi dialect]] of [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], which has long been the basis of standard literary Punjabi.{{sfn|Grierson|1919}} However, outside of Indo-Aryanist circles, the concept of \"Lahnda\" is still found in compilations of the world's languages (e.g. [[Ethnologue]]).\n\n===Dialects===\nThe following dialects have been tentatively proposed for Saraiki:<ref>This is the grouping in {{harvtxt|Wagha|1997|pp=229\u201331}}, which largely coincides with that in {{harvtxt|Shackle|1976|pp=5\u20138}}.</ref>\n\n*Central Saraiki, including Multani: spoken in the districts of [[Dera Ghazi Khan District|Dera Ghazi Khan]], [[Muzaffargarh District|Muzaffargarh]], [[Layyah District|Leiah]], [[Multan District|Multan]] and [[Bahawalpur District|Bahawalpur]].\n*Southern Saraiki: prevalent in the districts of [[Rajanpur District|Rajanpur]] and [[Rahim Yar Khan District|Rahimyar Khan]].\n*Sindhi Saraiki: dispersed throughout the province of [[Sindh]].\n*Northern Saraiki, or [[Thali dialect|Thali]]:{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=8}} spoken in the district of [[Dera Ismail Khan District|Dera Ismail Khan]] and the northern parts of the [[Thal region]], including [[Mianwali District]].\n*Eastern Saraiki: transitional to Punjabi and spoken in the [[Bar region]] along the boundary with the eastern [[Majhi dialect]]. This group includes the dialects of [[Jhangi dialect|Jhangi]] and [[Shahpuri]].{{efn|This eastern group figures in Wagha's scheme. In its place Shackle's classification has Jhangi and Shahpuri as separate branches.}} Most speakers of those dialects, however, tend to identify with Punjabi rather than Saraiki.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe historical inventory of names for the dialects now called Saraiki is a confusion of overlapping or conflicting ethnic, local, and regional designations. One historical name for Saraiki, Ja\u1e6dki, means \"of the [[Jat people|Ja\u1e6d\u1e6ds]]\", a northern [[South Asia]]n ethnic group; but Ja\u1e6d\u1e6ds speak the Indo-Aryan dialect of whatever region they live in.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Only a small minority of Saraiki speakers are Ja\u1e6d\u1e6ds, and not all Saraiki speaking Ja\u1e6d\u1e6ds necessarily speak the same dialect of Saraiki. However, these people usually call their traditions as well as language as ''Jataki''. Conversely, several Saraiki dialects have multiple names corresponding to different locales or demographic groups. The name \"[[Derawali dialect|Derawali]]\" is used to refer to the local dialects of both [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] and [[Dera Ismail Khan]], but \"\u1e0cerawali\" in the former is the Multani dialect and \"Derawali\" in the latter is the Tha\u1e37i dialect.{{sfn|Masica|1991|p = 426}}{{sfn|Grierson|1919|pp=239ff}}\n\nWhen consulting sources before 2000, it is important to know that Pakistani administrative boundaries have been altered frequently. Provinces in Pakistan are divided into [[Districts of Pakistan|districts]], and sources on \"Saraiki\" often describe the territory of a dialect or dialect group according to the districts. Since the founding of Pakistan in 1947, several of these districts have been subdivided, some multiple times.<!--see for example Nasirabad District-->\n\n===Status of language or dialect===\nIn the context of South Asia, the choice between the appellations [[Dialect#Dialect or language|\"language\" and \"dialect\"]] is a difficult one, and any distinction made using these terms is obscured by their ambiguity.<ref>See {{harvnb|Masica|1991|pp=23\u201327}}. For a brief discussion of the case of Saraiki, see {{harvtxt|Wagha|1997|pp=225\u201326}}.</ref> In a sense both Siraiki and Standard Panjabi are \"dialects\" of a \"Greater Punjabi\" macrolanguage.{{sfn|Rahman|1995|p=16}}\n\nSaraiki was considered a [[Punjabi dialects|dialect of Punjabi]] by most [[British Raj|British colonial]] administrators,{{sfn|Rahman|1996|p=173}} and is still seen as such by many [[Punjabis]].{{sfn|Shackle|2014a|ps=: \"it has come to be increasingly recognized internationally as a language in its own right, although this claim continues to be disputed by many Punjabi speakers who regard it as a dialect of Punjabi\".}} Saraikis, however, consider it a language in its own right<ref>{{harvnb|Rahman|1995|p=16}}: \"the Punjabis claim that Siraiki is a dialect of Punjabi, whereas the Siraikis call it a language in its own right.\"</ref> and see the use of the term \"dialect\" as [[Social stigma|stigmatising]].{{sfn|Rahman|1996|p=175}}\nA language movement was started in the 1960s to standardise a script and promote the language.{{sfn|Shackle|1977}}{{sfn|Rahman|1997|p=838}} The [[Census in Pakistan|national census of Pakistan]] has tabulated the prevalence of Saraiki speakers since 1981.{{sfn|Javaid|2004|p=46}}\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n[[File:Saraiki Poet and intellectual.JPG|thumb|Dr. Ashu Lal, A Saraiki poet and intellectual]]\nSaraiki is primarily spoken in the south-western part of the province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. To the west, it is set off from the [[Pashto]]- and [[Balochi language|Balochi]]-speaking areas by the [[Suleiman Range]], while to the south-east the [[Thar desert]] divides it from the [[Marwari language]]. Its other boundaries are less well-defined: [[Panjabi language|Punjabi]] is spoken to the east; [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] is found to the south, after the border with [[Sindh province]]; to the north, the southern edge of the [[Salt Range]] is the rough divide with the northern varieties of Western Punjabi.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n===Pakistan===\nToday, 25.9 million people from North Sindh, South Punjab, South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Eastern Balochistan province speak Saraiki.\n\nThe first national census of Pakistan to gather data on the prevalence of Saraiki was the census of 1981.{{sfn|Javaid|2004}} In that year, the percentage of respondents nationwide reporting Saraiki as their native language was 9.83.

In parallel to [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] it has additionally developed a set of [[implosive consonants|implosives]], so that for each place of articulation there are up to five contrasting stops, for example:  voiceless {{IPA|/t\u0283ala/}} 'custom' \u223c aspirated {{IPA|/t\u0283\u02b0ala/}} 'blister' \u223c implosive {{IPA|/\u0284ala/}} 'cobweb' \u223c voiced {{IPA|/d\u0292ala/}} 'niche' \u223c voiced aspirate {{IPA|/j\u02b0\u0259\u0260/}} 'foam'.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=18\u201319}}\n\nThere are five contrasting places of articulation for the stops: [[velar]], [[Palatal consonant|palatal]], [[retroflex]], [[Dental consonant|dental]] and [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]]. The dentals {{IPA|/ t t\u02b0 d d\u02b0/}} are articulated with the [[Laminal consonant|blade of the tongue]] against the surface behind the teeth.

The retroflex {{IPA link|\u0273}} is a realised as a true nasal only if adjacent to a retroflex stop, elsewhere it is a nasalised [[retroflex flap]] {{IPA|[\u027d\u0303]}}.{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=23}} The contrasts {{IPA|/\u014b/}} \u223c {{IPA|/\u014b\u0261/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0272/}} \u223c {{IPA|/\u0272d\u0292/}} are weak; the single nasal is more common in southern varieties, and the nasal + stop cluster is prevalent in central dialects. Three nasals {{IPA|/\u014b n m/}} have aspirated counterparts {{IPA|/\u014b\u02b0 n\u02b0 m\u02b0/}}.<!--no example words are given with the aspirated retroflex-->\n\nThe realisation of the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|/\u027e/}} varies with the phonetic environment.

Stress normally falls on the first syllable of a word. The stress will, however, fall on the second syllable of a two-syllable word if the vowel in the first syllable is centralised, and the second syllable contains either a diphthong, or a peripheral vowel followed by a consonant, for example {{IPA|/d\u026a\u027e'k\u02b0an/}} 'carpenter'. Three-syllable words are stressed on the second syllable if the first syllable contains a centralised vowel, and the second syllable has either a peripheral vowel, or a centralised vowel + geminate, for example {{IPA|/t\u0283\u028a'h\u0259tt\u0259\u027e/}} 'seventy-four'.
