This generally consisted of material that was compact and easily transportable and had a widely recognized value. Commodity money was a great improvement over simple [[barter]], in which commodities were simply exchanged against others. Ideally, commodity money had to be widely accepted, easily portable and storable, and easily combined and divided in order to correspond to different values. The main items of commodity money in Japan were [[arrowheads]], [[rice]] grains and [[gold]] powder.\n\nThis contrasted somewhat with countries like [[China]], where one of the most important items of commodity money came from the southern seas: [[Seashell|shells]].<ref name=\"JCM2\" /> Since then however, the shell has become a symbol for money in many Chinese and Japanese [[ideograms]].<ref name=\"JCM2\" />\n\n=== Early coinage ===\n\nThe earliest coins to reach very gay Japan were Chinese [[Ban Liang]] and Wu Zhu coins, as well as [[Ancient Chinese coinage#Wang Mang|the coins produced by Wang Mang]] during the first centuries of the first millennium AD; these coins have been excavated all over Japan, but as Japan's economy was not sufficiently developed at the time, these coins were more likely to be used as precious objects rather than a means of exchange; rice and cloth served as the main currencies of Japan at the time. The first coins produced in Japan are called the ''mumonginsen'' (\u7121\u6587\u9280\u92ad, or 'silver coins without inscription') and the copper alloy ''Fuhonsen'' (\u5bcc\u672c\u92ad, coins made from an alloy of copper, lead and tin) which were all introduced in the late seventh century. These currencies (alongside other reforms) were based on the Chinese system and were therefore based on the [[Chinese units of measurement]]. In modern times the usage of ''Fuhonsen'' has often been interpreted as charms rather than currency, but it has recently been discovered that these copper coins were in fact the first government-made coinage of Japan.<ref name=\"BritishMuseumJapaneseCoins\">{{cite web|url= https://britishmuseum.org/pdf/Catalogue%20of%20the%20Japanese%20Coin%20Collection.pdf|title= Catalogue of the Japanese Coin Collection (pre-Meiji) at the British Museum with special reference to Kutsuki Masatsuna|date=2010|accessdate=11 April 2018|authors= Shin'ichi Sakuraki, [[Helen Wang]], and Peter Kornicki, with Nobuhisa Furuta, Timon Screech, and Joe Cribb|isbn=978 086159 174 9|issn=1747-3640}}</ref>\n\n=== K\u014dch\u014dsen currency system (8th\u201310th centuries) ===\n==== Embassy to the Tang court (630 AD) ====\nJapan's first formal currency system was the ''K\u014dch\u014dsen'' (Japanese: \u7687\u671d\u92ad, \"Imperial currency\").

During the [[Sengoku period]], the characteristics of the future Edo Period system began to emerge. Local Lords developed trade, abolishing monopolistic guilds, which led to the need for large-denomination currencies. From the 16th century, local experiments started to be made, with the minting of local coins, sometimes in gold. Especially the [[Takeda clan]] of [[Kai Province|K\u014dsh\u016b]] minted gold coins which were later adopted by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n[[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi]] unified Japan, and thus centralized most of the minting of large denomination silver and gold coins, effectively putting in place the basis of a unified currency system. Hideyoshi developed the large [[\u014cban]] plate, also called the [[Tensh\u014d (Momoyama period)|Tensh\u014d]] \u014cban (\u5929\u6b63\u5927\u5224), in 1588, a predecessor to Tokugawa gold coinage.<ref>''The Cambridge History of Japan: Early modern Japan'' by John Whitney Hall p.61 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_BrQL4Pn0QC&pg=PA61]</ref>\n\nA common practice in that period was to melt gold into copper molds for convenience, derived from the [[sycee]] manufacturing method. These were called Bund\u014dkin (\u5206\u9285\u91d1), of which there were two types, the small Kobund\u014d (\u5c0f\u5206\u9285), and the large \u014cbund\u014d (\u5927\u5206\u9285).

Regarding diamond{{clarify|date=July 2019}} coins, the ''[[Kan'ei Ts\u016bh\u014d]]'' coin (\u5bdb\u6c38\u901a\u5b9d) came to replace the Chinese coins that had been in circulation in Japan, as well as those that were privately minted, and became the legal tender for small denominations.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n''[[Yamada Hagaki]]'', Japan's first notes, were issued around 1600 by [[Shinto]] priests also working as merchants in the [[Ise, Mie|Ise]]-Yamada (modern [[Mie Prefecture]]), in exchange for silver.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> This was earlier than the first [[goldsmith]] notes issued in [[England]] around 1640.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> The first known feudal note was issued by the Fukui clan in 1661. During the 17th century, the feudal domains developed a system of [[Scrip of Edo period Japan|feudal notes]], giving currency to pledged notes issued by the lord of the domain, in exchange for convertibility to gold, silver or copper.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> Japan thus combined gold, silver, and copper standards with the circulation of [[paper money]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nTokugawa coinage remained in use during the [[Sakoku]] period of seclusion, although it was progressively debased to try to manage government deficits. The first debasement, in 1695, was called the Genroku Recoinage.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n=== Bakumatsu currency (1854\u20131868) ===\n{{further|Bakumatsu}}\nThe Tokugawa coinage collapsed following the reopening of Japan to the West in 1854, as the silver-gold exchange rates gave foreigners huge opportunities for [[arbitrage]], leading to the export of large quantities of gold. Gold traded for silver in Japan at a 1:5 ratio, while that ratio was 1:15 abroad. During the [[Bakumatsu]] period in 1859 [[Peso#1821\u20131897 Mexican dollar|Mexican dollar]]s were even given official currency in Japan, by coining them with marks in Japanese and officializing their exchange rate of three ''\"Bu\"''{{clarify|date=July 2019}}.

In 1868, the government also issued coins and gold-convertible paper money, called ''[[:File:Daijokansatsu notes 1868 Japan.jpg|Daij\u014dkansatsu]]'' (\u592a\u653f\u5b98\u672d), denominated in ''[[Ry\u014d]]'', an old unit from the Edo period, and private banks called ''Kawase Kaisha'' were allowed to issue their own currency as well.

The national banks issued identically designed convertible notes, which were effective in funding industry and progressively replaced government notes. In 1876, an amendment allowed the banks to make the banknotes virtually non-convertible.

This was controlled by the reduction of government spending and the removal of paper currency from circulation. During the Seinan Civil War, an original type of paper money was issued by the rebel leader [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] in order to finance his war effort.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nIn 1881, the first Japanese note to feature a portrait, the [[Empress Jing\u016b]] note (\u795e\u529f\u7687\u540e\u672d), was issued.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Bank of Japan (1882) ====\nIn order to regularize the issuance of convertible banknotes, a [[central bank]], the [[Bank of Japan]], was established in 1882.

They were called Daikokusatsu (\u5927\u9ed2\u672d), and were convertible in silver.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nFollowing the devaluation of silver, and the abandonment of silver as a currency standard by Western powers, Japan adopted the [[gold standard]] through the Coinage Law of 1897. The yen was fixed at 0.75g of pure gold, and banknotes were issued which were convertible into gold.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> In 1899, the National Banks banknotes were declared invalid, leaving the Bank of Japan as the only supplier of currency.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/><gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"280\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Bank of Japan gold convertible yen banknote 1900.jpg|A Bank of Japan gold-convertible yen banknote from 1900.\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== World Wars ====\nDuring World War I, Japan prohibited the export of gold in 1917, as did many countries such as the [[United States]].

This generally consisted of material that was compact and easily transportable and had a widely recognized value. Commodity money was a great improvement over simple [[barter]], in which commodities were simply exchanged against others. Ideally, commodity money had to be widely accepted, easily portable and storable, and easily combined and divided in order to correspond to different values. The main items of commodity money in Japan were [[arrowheads]], [[rice]] grains and [[gold]] powder.\n\nThis contrasted somewhat with countries like [[China]], where one of the most important items of commodity money came from the southern seas: [[Seashell|shells]].<ref name=\"JCM2\" /> Since then however, the shell has become a symbol for money in many Chinese and Japanese [[ideograms]].<ref name=\"JCM2\" />\n\n=== Early coinage ===\n\nThe earliest coins to reach Japan were Chinese [[Ban Liang]] and Wu Zhu coins, as well as [[Ancient Chinese coinage#Wang Mang|the coins produced by Wang Mang]] during the first centuries of the first millennium AD; these coins have been excavated all over Japan, but as Japan's economy was not sufficiently developed at the time, these coins were more likely to be used as precious objects rather than a means of exchange; rice and cloth served as the main currencies of Japan at the time. The first coins produced in Japan are called the ''mumonginsen'' (\u7121\u6587\u9280\u92ad, or 'silver coins without inscription') and the copper alloy ''Fuhonsen'' (\u5bcc\u672c\u92ad, coins made from an alloy of copper, lead and tin) which were all introduced in the late seventh century. These currencies (alongside other reforms) were based on the Chinese system and were therefore based on the [[Chinese units of measurement]]. In modern times the usage of ''Fuhonsen'' has often been interpreted as charms rather than currency, but it has recently been discovered that these copper coins were in fact the first government-made coinage of Japan.<ref name=\"BritishMuseumJapaneseCoins\">{{cite web|url= https://britishmuseum.org/pdf/Catalogue%20of%20the%20Japanese%20Coin%20Collection.pdf|title= Catalogue of the Japanese Coin Collection (pre-Meiji) at the British Museum with special reference to Kutsuki Masatsuna|date=2010|accessdate=11 April 2018|authors= Shin'ichi Sakuraki, [[Helen Wang]], and Peter Kornicki, with Nobuhisa Furuta, Timon Screech, and Joe Cribb|isbn=978 086159 174 9|issn=1747-3640}}</ref>\n\n=== K\u014dch\u014dsen currency system (8th\u201310th centuries) ===\n==== Embassy to the Tang court (630 AD) ====\nJapan's first formal currency system was the ''K\u014dch\u014dsen'' (Japanese: \u7687\u671d\u92ad, \"Imperial currency\").

During the [[Sengoku period]], the characteristics of the future Edo Period system began to emerge. Local Lords developed trade, abolishing monopolistic guilds, which led to the need for large-denomination currencies. From the 16th century, local experiments started to be made, with the minting of local coins, sometimes in gold. Especially the [[Takeda clan]] of [[Kai Province|K\u014dsh\u016b]] minted gold coins which were later adopted by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n[[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi]] unified Japan, and thus centralized most of the minting of large denomination silver and gold coins, effectively putting in place the basis of a unified currency system. Hideyoshi developed the large [[\u014cban]] plate, also called the [[Tensh\u014d (Momoyama period)|Tensh\u014d]] \u014cban (\u5929\u6b63\u5927\u5224), in 1588, a predecessor to Tokugawa gold coinage.<ref>''The Cambridge History of Japan: Early modern Japan'' by John Whitney Hall p.61 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_BrQL4Pn0QC&pg=PA61]</ref>\n\nA common practice in that period was to melt gold into copper molds for convenience, derived from the [[sycee]] manufacturing method. These were called Bund\u014dkin (\u5206\u9285\u91d1), of which there were two types, the small Kobund\u014d (\u5c0f\u5206\u9285), and the large \u014cbund\u014d (\u5927\u5206\u9285).

Regarding diamond{{clarify|date=July 2019}} coins, the ''[[Kan'ei Ts\u016bh\u014d]]'' coin (\u5bdb\u6c38\u901a\u5b9d) came to replace the Chinese coins that had been in circulation in Japan, as well as those that were privately minted, and became the legal tender for small denominations.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n''[[Yamada Hagaki]]'', Japan's first notes, were issued around 1600 by [[Shinto]] priests also working as merchants in the [[Ise, Mie|Ise]]-Yamada (modern [[Mie Prefecture]]), in exchange for silver.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> This was earlier than the first [[goldsmith]] notes issued in [[England]] around 1640.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> The first known feudal note was issued by the Fukui clan in 1661. During the 17th century, the feudal domains developed a system of [[Scrip of Edo period Japan|feudal notes]], giving currency to pledged notes issued by the lord of the domain, in exchange for convertibility to gold, silver or copper.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> Japan thus combined gold, silver, and copper standards with the circulation of [[paper money]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nTokugawa coinage remained in use during the [[Sakoku]] period of seclusion, although it was progressively debased to try to manage government deficits. The first debasement, in 1695, was called the Genroku Recoinage.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n=== Bakumatsu currency (1854\u20131868) ===\n{{further|Bakumatsu}}\nThe Tokugawa coinage collapsed following the reopening of Japan to the West in 1854, as the silver-gold exchange rates gave foreigners huge opportunities for [[arbitrage]], leading to the export of large quantities of gold. Gold traded for silver in Japan at a 1:5 ratio, while that ratio was 1:15 abroad. During the [[Bakumatsu]] period in 1859 [[Peso#1821\u20131897 Mexican dollar|Mexican dollar]]s were even given official currency in Japan, by coining them with marks in Japanese and officializing their exchange rate of three ''\"Bu\"''{{clarify|date=July 2019}}. They were called ''Aratame Sanbu Sadame'' (\u6539\u4e09\u5206\u5b9a, \"Fixed to the value of three ''bu''\").<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, local governments issued their own currency chaotically, so that the nation's money supply expanded by 2.5 times between 1859 and 1869, leading to crumbling money values and soaring prices. The system was replaced by a new one after the conclusion of the [[Boshin War]], and with the onset of the [[Meiji government]] in 1868.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>[[File:Bakumatsu local coins.jpg|thumb|left|Proliferation of local Japanese coinage during the [[Bakumatsu]] period.|395x395px]]<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"280\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Aratame sanbu sadame silver coin 1859 Japan.jpg|A Mexican dollar used as currency in Japan, marked with \"Aratame sanbu sadame\" (''Fixed to the value of three bu'') (\u6539\u4e09\u5206\u5b9a) from 1859.\nFile:Allegory of inflation during the Bakumatsu era.jpg|Allegory of inflation and soaring prices during the Bakumatsu era.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Imperial Japan (1871\u2013present) ===\nFollowing 1868, a new currency system based on the [[Japanese yen]] was progressively established along Western lines, which has remained Japan's currency system to this day.\n\nImmediately after the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, previous gold, silver and copper coins, as well as feudal notes, continued to circulate, leading to great confusion. In 1868, the government also issued coins and gold-convertible paper money, called ''[[:File:Daijokansatsu notes 1868 Japan.jpg|Daij\u014dkansatsu]]'' (\u592a\u653f\u5b98\u672d), denominated in ''[[Ry\u014d]]'', an old unit from the Edo period, and private banks called ''Kawase Kaisha'' were allowed to issue their own currency as well. Complexity, widespread counterfeiting of gold coins and feudal notes led to widespread confusion.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Birth of the yen: New Currency Act (1871) ====\n{{main|Japanese yen}}\nThrough the New Currency Act of 1871, Japan adopted the [[gold standard]] along international lines, with 1 [[Japanese yen|yen]] corresponding to 1.5g of pure gold. The Meiji government issued new notes, called ''Meiji Ts\u016bh\u014dsatsu'' (\u660e\u6cbb\u901a\u5b9d\u672d), in 1872, which were printed in [[Germany]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nSilver coins were also issued for trade with Asian countries who favoured silver as a currency, thus establishing a [[de facto]] gold-silver standard.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/><gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"230\" heights=\"210\">\nFile:First Meiji one yen banknote 1871.jpg|The First Meiji one yen banknote, Meiji Ts\u016bh\u014dsatsu (\u660e\u6cbb\u901a\u5b9d\u672d) from 1871.\nFile:Early one yen banknote front and reverse.jpg|An early 1 yen banknote showing both the front and reverse. National Bank notes, 1873.\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== National Bank Act (1872) ====\nThe National Bank Act of 1872 led to the establishment of four banks between 1873 and 1874, and there were more than 153 national banks by the end of 1879. The national banks issued identically designed convertible notes, which were effective in funding industry and progressively replaced government notes. In 1876, an amendment allowed the banks to make the banknotes virtually non-convertible. These national banknotes imitated the design of American banknotes, although the name of the issuer was different for each.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nSevere inflation broke out with the [[Satsuma Rebellion|Seinan Civil War]] in 1877. This was controlled by the reduction of government spending and the removal of paper currency from circulation. During the Seinan Civil War, an original type of paper money was issued by the rebel leader [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] in order to finance his war effort.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nIn 1881, the first Japanese note to feature a portrait, the [[Empress Jing\u016b]] note (\u795e\u529f\u7687\u540e\u672d), was issued.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Bank of Japan (1882) ====\nIn order to regularize the issuance of convertible banknotes, a [[central bank]], the [[Bank of Japan]], was established in 1882. The bank would stabilize the currency by centralizing the issuance of convertible banknotes. The first central banknotes were issued by the Bank of Japan in 1885. They were called Daikokusatsu (\u5927\u9ed2\u672d), and were convertible in silver.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nFollowing the devaluation of silver, and the abandonment of silver as a currency standard by Western powers, Japan adopted the [[gold standard]] through the Coinage Law of 1897. The yen was fixed at 0.75g of pure gold, and banknotes were issued which were convertible into gold.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> In 1899, the National Banks banknotes were declared invalid, leaving the Bank of Japan as the only supplier of currency.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/><gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"280\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Bank of Japan gold convertible yen banknote 1900.jpg|A Bank of Japan gold-convertible yen banknote from 1900.\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== World Wars ====\nDuring World War I, Japan prohibited the export of gold in 1917, as did many countries such as the [[United States]]. Gold convertibility was again shortly established in January 1930, only to be abandoned in 1931 when Great Britain abandoned the gold standard. Conversion of banknotes into gold was suspended.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nFrom 1941, Japan formally adopted a managed currency system, and in 1942 the Bank of Japan Law officially suppressed the obligation of conversion.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n==Modern yen==\nIn 1946, following the [[World War II|Second World War]], Japan removed the old currency (\u65e7\u5186\u5238) and introduced the \"New Yen\" (\u65b0\u5186\u5238).<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> Meanwhile, American occupation forces used a parallel system, called [[B yen]], from 1945 to 1958.\n\nSince then, together with the economic expansion of Japan, the yen has become one of the major currencies of the world.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_l_h6uHWjbQC&pg=PT37 ''The internationalization of currencies: an appraisal of the Japanese yen'' by George S.
