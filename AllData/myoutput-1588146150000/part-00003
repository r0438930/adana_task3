{"title_page": "Robert Lee Burns", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n[[File:Robert_Lee_Burns_-_court_hearing_2001.png|right|thumb|Robert Lee Burns in 2001 outside a court hearing about his extradition]]\n'''Robert Lee Burns''' (1930/31 \u2013 January 22, 2002) was an American ex-convict and retired house painter from [[Eugene, Oregon]] who in 2001 became the subject of an interstate dispute with respect to whether or not he should be [[Extradition|extradited]] from [[Oregon]] to [[California]] to serve a prison sentence originally ordered in the 1960s.  \n\nThe dispute stemmed from the 1963 murder of a [[California Highway Patrol]] (CHP) officer following a [[bank robbery]] committed by Burns and two other men. Burns was on [[parole]] out of Oregon for attempted robbery at the time. When the CHP officer pulled over the group's [[getaway car]], one of the other men shot and killed him. Although he did not harm the officer personally, under the [[felony murder rule]], Burns was charged with murder. He pled guilty and was sentenced to [[life in prison]] in California. \n\nAfter five years in prison in California, Burns was transferred to Oregon to finish his sentence for the attempted robbery charge, with the expectation that he would be returned to California when that sentence was finished. While imprisoned in Oregon, he rehabilitated himself to such a degree that at the end of his sentence, then-governor [[Robert W. Straub]] refused to return him to California. Burn settled in Eugene under his own name and lived without further incident until California officials began to make efforts to extradite him to California in 2001. He contested the extradition and died at home at the age of 71 before the matter was settled.\n\n== Early life ==\nBurns was born in [[Oklahoma]] during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].
