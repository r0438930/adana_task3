He questions the difference in experiences between Native Americans and Black Americans, saying it came down to Native Americans \"refus[ing] to submit\" to the demands of white people.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/35399/35399-h/35399-h.htm|title=The Negro in the South: His Economic Progress in Relation to His Moral and Religious Development|last=|first=|date=|website=Project Gutenberg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=5 November 2019}}</ref> Through this comparison, he sets up his main point about the economic value of slave labor to the South's economy, where slaves worked as both skilled and common laborers, saying they could use those skills to their advantage. Washington also adds a bit to the end of his lecture regarding the relationship that Black Americans have with Christianity and how that helped them when creating a life after slavery.\n\n=== \"The Economic Development of the Negro Race Since its Emancipation\" ===\nContinuing where he left off on \"the Economic Development of the Negro Race in Slavery,\" Washington states that he wishes to talk about the things that were to Black Americans' disadvantage when creating a life post-slavery.<ref name=\":0\" /> He analyzes the educational disparity between white and Black American children, bringing up his personal experiences at the Hampton Institute (now [[Hampton University]]) and the [[Tuskegee University|Tuskegee Institute]]. Specifically, he focuses on the motivations in what Black American parents wanted out of their children's education, saying there was a transition between valuing skills like farming or household work to more traditional education, which he refers to as \"the book.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThis lecture contains far more anecdotes than his previous one. Washington also briefly mentions the economic costs of teaching, using [[Gloucester County, Virginia]], as an example for this part of the lecture.\n\n=== \"The Economic Revolution in the South\" ===\nIn Du Bois' first lecture, he touches upon similar ideas to Washington's \"The Economic Development of the Negro Race in Slavery\" and \"The Economic Development of the Negro Race Since its Emancipation,\" where Du Bois focuses on slavery as an economic driver of the South. He looks at the changes in the South after Reconstruction, where after dismantling the institution of slavery Southerners tried to keep the [[serfdom]]-like treatment of Black Americans even if slavery was no longer legal. He outlines four points regarding economy (house servant effort, effort in industry, economic elevation through landowning, and Group Economy) that have created the titular economic revolution.<ref name=\":0\" /> Finally, he talks about the migration of Black Americans to other areas.\n\n=== \"Religion in the South\" ===\nDu Bois discusses the ethics of slavery, looking at it through the context of Christianity. He states:<blockquote>If, then, we are to study the history of religion in the South, we must first divest ourselves of prejudice, pro and con; we must try to put ourselves in the place of those who are seeking to read the riddle of life and grant to them about the same general charity and same general desire to do right that we find in the average human being. On the other hand, we must not, in striving to be charitable, be false to truth and right. Slavery in the United States was an economic mistake and a moral crime. This we cannot forget.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>Once again, Du Bois brings up the concept of serfdom, this time going into detail about the parallels between serfdom and slavery in the South. He mentions that religion in the South originally reinforced slavery, where there was a recognized hierarchy in religious practices that were then paralleled in the practice of slavery. This notion was challenged, he says, as abolition sentiments grew stronger and the democratic [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist]] and [[Baptists in the United States|Baptist]] churches spread. Du Bois brings up various anecdotes shared to him by reverends and other Black Americans. He discusses the co-optation of religion by Black Americans, where Northern and Southern Black Americans worshipped in their own way.\n\n== Topics ==\nWhile the four essays all deal with slavery's impact on the South since its introduction, each focuses on a specific aspect, as evidenced in their titles. Both topics, economy and religion, are topics that the two men constantly spoke about during their time as activists.\n\n=== Economy ===\nA prominent part of Washington's ideology was that in order for Black people's situation to improve, they needed a good economic foundation where they needed to work diligently and gain property. His belief was that in focusing on improving their economic situation, or valuing the importance of what he called \"green power,\" they would gain the rights many were fighting a losing battle for.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Booker T.
