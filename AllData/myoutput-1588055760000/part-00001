In case of a virus infection, NAbs can bind to glycoproteins of [[Viral envelope|enveloped viruses]] or [[capsid proteins]] of non-enveloped viruses.\nNeutralizing antibodies can also act by preventing particles from undergoing structural changes often needed for successful cell entry.\nNeutralizing antibodies can block infection post-attachment as well.

B cells display [[B-cell receptor]]s on their cell surface, which is just the antibody anchored to the cell membrane. When the B-cell receptor binds to its cognate antigen with high affinity, an intracellular [[Cell signaling|signalling cascade]] is triggered.
