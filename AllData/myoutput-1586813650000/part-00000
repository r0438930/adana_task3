They subsequently wrote a song and made a documentary about this meeting: ''Looking For Ms. Locklear.'' In an interview on [[The Tonight Show]], they stated that they stayed in during recess because both of them had written swear words on their desks. They stayed in and colored in mythical creatures such as a [[unicorn]], hence their YouTube channel name, Good Mythical Morning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHaLfeVn66w |title=How We Met Song |via=YouTube }}</ref>\n\nAt age fourteen, they wrote a screenplay entitled ''Gutless Wonders'' and began shooting a film based on it.
