It acts upon gastric [[parietal cell]]s, inhibiting the secretion of [[gastric acid]] by [[G-protein coupled receptor]]-mediated inhibition of [[adenylate cyclase]], which leads to decreased intracellular [[cyclic AMP]] levels and decreased [[proton pump]] activity at the [[apical membrane|apical]] surface of the parietal cell. Because other classes of drugs, especially [[H2-receptor antagonists]] and [[proton pump inhibitors]], are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, misoprostol is only indicated for use by people who are both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications. Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of [[gastric ulcer]]ation (e.g. with [[diclofenac]] in ''[[Arthrotec]]'').\n\nHowever, even in the treatment of NSAID-induced ulcers, [[omeprazole]] proved to be at least as effective as misoprostol,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9494149 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199803123381105 | volume=338 | issue=11 | title=Omeprazole compared with misoprostol for ulcers associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

Med. | pages=727\u201334}}</ref> but was significantly better tolerated, so misoprostol should not be considered a first-line treatment. Misoprostol-induced diarrhea and the need for multiple daily doses (typically four) are the main issues impairing compliance with therapy.\n\n===Labor induction===\nMisoprostol is commonly used for [[labor induction]]. It causes [[uterine]] contractions and the ripening ([[Cervical effacement|effacement]] or thinning) of the [[cervix]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440107 |title=Misoprostol and Pregnancy |year=2001 |last1=Wood |first1=Alastair J.

It acts upon gastric [[parietal cell]]s, inhibiting the secretion of [[gastric acid]] by [[G-protein coupled receptor]]-mediated inhibition of [[adenylate cyclase]], which leads to decreased intracellular [[cyclic AMP]] levels and decreased [[proton pump]] activity at the [[apical membrane|apical]] surface of the parietal cell. Because other classes of drugs, especially [[H2-receptor antagonists]] and [[proton pump inhibitors]], are more effective for the treatment of acute peptic ulcers, misoprostol is only indicated for use by people who are both taking NSAIDs and are at high risk for NSAID-induced ulcers, including the elderly and people with ulcer complications. Misoprostol is sometimes coprescribed with NSAIDs to prevent their common adverse effect of [[gastric ulcer]]ation (e.g. with [[diclofenac]] in ''[[Arthrotec]]'').\n\nHowever, even in the treatment of NSAID-induced ulcers, [[omeprazole]] proved to be at least as effective as misoprostol,<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 9494149 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199803123381105 | volume=338 | issue=11 | title=Omeprazole compared with misoprostol for ulcers associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.

Misoprostol-induced diarrhea and the need for multiple daily doses (typically four) are the main issues impairing compliance with therapy.\n\n===Labor induction===\nMisoprostol is commonly used for [[labor induction]]. It causes [[uterine]] contractions and the ripening ([[Cervical effacement|effacement]] or thinning) of the [[cervix]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440107 |title=Misoprostol and Pregnancy |year=2001 |last1=Wood |first1=Alastair J.
