The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] were individual [[sovereign state]]s, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, though both were ruled by James in [[personal union]].\n\nJames was the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland]], and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was compelled to [[abdicate]] in his favour. Four different [[regent]]s governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he [[Succession to Elizabeth I of England|succeeded]] the last [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] monarch of England and Ireland, [[Elizabeth I]], who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known after him as the [[Jacobean era]], until his death. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 1617, and [[style (manner of address)|styled]] himself \"[[King of Great Britain and Ireland]]\". He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and [[British colonisation of the Americas]] began.\n\nAt 57 years and 246 days, James's reign in Scotland was the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign#Scotland|longest of any Scottish monarch]]. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the [[English Parliament]]. Under James, the \"Golden Age\" of [[Elizabethan literature]] and drama continued, with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Donne]], [[Ben Jonson]], and Sir [[Francis Bacon]] contributing to a flourishing literary culture.{{sfn|Milling|2004|p=155}} James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597), ''[[The True Law of Free Monarchies]]'' (1598), and ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' (1599). He sponsored the [[translation of the Bible]] into English that would later be named after him: the [[Authorized King James Version]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rhodes|Richards|Marshall|2003|p=1}}: \"James VI and I was the most writerly of British monarchs.

James inherited his father's titles of [[Duke of Albany]] and [[Earl of Ross]]. Mary was already unpopular, and her marriage on 15 May 1567 to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], who was widely suspected of murdering Darnley, heightened widespread bad feeling towards her.{{efn|Elizabeth I wrote to Mary: \"My ears have been so astounded, my mind so disturbed and my heart so appalled at hearing the horrible report of the abominable murder of your late husband and my slaughtered cousin, that I can scarcely as yet summon the spirit to write about it&nbsp;...

She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate lack of attention to the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk.

[[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] as '''James I''' from the [[Union of the Crowns|union of the Scottish and English crowns]] on 24 March 1603 until his death in 1625. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] were individual [[sovereign state]]s, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, though both were ruled by James in [[personal union]].\n\nJames was the son of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and a great-great-grandson of [[Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland]], and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. James succeeded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was compelled to [[abdicate]] in his favour. Four different [[regent]]s governed during his minority, which ended officially in 1578, though he did not gain full control of his government until 1583. In 1603, he [[Succession to Elizabeth I of England|succeeded]] the last [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] monarch of England and Ireland, [[Elizabeth I]], who died childless. He continued to reign in all three kingdoms for 22 years, a period known after him as the [[Jacobean era]], until his death. After the Union of the Crowns, he based himself in England (the largest of the three realms) from 1603, returning to Scotland only once, in 1617, and [[style (manner of address)|styled]] himself \"[[King of Great Britain and Ireland]]\". He was a major advocate of a single parliament for England and Scotland. In his reign, the [[Plantation of Ulster]] and [[British colonisation of the Americas]] began.\n\nAt 57 years and 246 days, James's reign in Scotland was the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign#Scotland|longest of any Scottish monarch]]. He achieved most of his aims in Scotland but faced great difficulties in England, including the [[Gunpowder Plot]] in 1605 and repeated conflicts with the [[English Parliament]]. Under James, the \"Golden Age\" of [[Elizabethan literature]] and drama continued, with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[John Donne]], [[Ben Jonson]], and Sir [[Francis Bacon]] contributing to a flourishing literary culture.{{sfn|Milling|2004|p=155}} James himself was a talented scholar, the author of works such as ''[[Daemonologie]]'' (1597), ''[[The True Law of Free Monarchies]]'' (1598), and ''[[Basilikon Doron]]'' (1599).

She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate lack of attention to the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk.
