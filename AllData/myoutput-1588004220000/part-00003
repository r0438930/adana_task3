Their name \"Scythians\" comes from [[Greek language|Greek]], \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03bf\u03b9 ''Skuthoi'', meaning the \"archers\", a skill for which they were known and feared. They left a rich cultural legacy, particularly in the form of gold jewellery, frequently found in the \"[[kurgan]]\" burials associated with them. They practised the [[ancient Iranian religion]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=314\u2013315}}\n\nA group of Scythian tribes, the [[Sarmatians]], known as the [[Alans]] (i.e. \"[[Aryans]]\", through a common internal consonant shift, i.e. \"Iranians\"{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315, note 1}}) from the first century onwards, migrated into [[Europe]]. Allied with the Germanic [[Goths]], the Alans penetrated west into [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and other territories under the [[Roman Empire]]. The Romans tried to manage the threat by hiring them as mercenaries in the cavalry, or, particularly in France, by buying them off as landed gentry. Many toponyms in France, such as Alainville, Alaincourt, Alen\u00e7on, and others, testify that they were territorial possessions of Alan families. Alan equestrian culture formed the basis of Medieval [[chivalry]], and thus had a significant role in the development of [[Western Europe]]an culture.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315}}\n\nWhile most of the Scythians assimilated into other ethnic groups by the Middle Ages, the Alans of the [[Caucasus]] maintained a distinct identity and continued to dominate the area, so that the [[Byzantine Empire]] recognised them as an independent allied kingdom. Through their relations with the Byzantines and missionaries from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the south, the Alan aristocracy adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] during the tenth century. This, however, had little effect on the general Alan population, so that the thirteenth-century Flemish traveller [[William of Rubruck]] reported that \"they knew nothing (of Christianity) apart from the name of Christ\". The [[Ossetians]] are the sole modern population culturally and linguistically descending from the Alans, and they have preserved beliefs and rituals likely dating back to Scythian religion, even though through waves of partial [[syncretism|syncretisation]] with Christianity.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=316}}\n\nAfter the conquests of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the Caucasus during the mid-thirteenth century, contacts between the Alans and Eastern Orthodox religious authorities ceased completely, and their superficial Christianisation was stopped. There is evidence that between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, shrines which were apparently built in honour of Christian saints were converted to indigenous Pagan use.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}} The [[Russian Empire]]'s expansion in the Caucasus by the end of the eighteenth century brought with itself Russian Orthodox missionaries who sought to \"re-Christianise\" the Ossetians. Their efforts had had limited success by the time when they were completely obliterated by the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, which introduced the peoples of the Caucasus into the rapid processes of industrialisation, modernisation and urbanisation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Between the traditional and the new religion===\nThe Ossetian people are today split between two states: [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]], a constituent federal republic within [[Russia]], and the neighbouring only partially recognised state of [[South Ossetia]]. The incipient collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1980s triggered projects of identity-building among many of its constituent nations. In Ossetia, as in other nations, this involved the recovery of an \"authentic national religion\" harkening back to pre-Christian times. Ossetian nationalism also played a role, powered by ethnic conflicts for lands and resources with neighbouring peoples in North Ossetia, and for independence in [[South Ossetia]], a territory historically part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], whose status as an independent entity is a matter of international controversy (cf. the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]]).{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=317}}\n\nAccording to [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor Shnirelman]], in the Ossetian case certain traditions had survived with unbroken continuity and were revived in rural areas. This contrasts, and interacts, with an urban and more intellectual movement which elaborated a systematic revived religion associated with ethnic nationalism and with the opposition to both [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] Orthodox Christianity, perceived as foreign, and to [[Islam]], professed by the neighbouring Turkic and Caucasian ethnic groups and by a small minority of Ossetians.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=202\u2013207|ps=: \"Since the turn of the 1980s, a growth of Neo-Paganism has been observed in the Middle Volga region, in North Ossetia-Alaniia, and in Abkhazia. Pagan traditions had never disappeared there completely and, in contrast to the Slavic and Baltic regions, there was no need to invent too much by reference to books, as almost all the resources were intact there. Thus, in these regions, interest in Paganism developed in two different environments: firstly, in the countryside with its unbroken continuity of traditional folk beliefs, and secondly, in the urbanized areas where local, highly secularized intellectuals began to construct a new synthetic religion in order to overcome a crisis of identity. In the latter case, this was a manifestation of local ethnic nationalism resisting Russian Orthodoxy as a \"religion of exploiters\". [...] Contemporary Neo-Paganism is constituted by two different branches\u2014one of a \"bookish\" approach which is artificially cultivated by urbanized intellectuals who have lost their links with folk tradition, and the other, more authentic, is of a rural movement based on a continuity rooted in the remote past. The first dominates among the Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Armenians and can be defined as an \"invention of tradition\", after Eric Hobsbawm (1983). A more complex pattern can be observed among the ethnic groups of the Middle Volga River region as well as among the Ossetians and Abkhazians, where both tendencies are interacting with one another.\"}} According to the scholar Sergey Shtyrkov, intellectual projects for the elaboration of an \"ethnic religion\" for the Ossetians date back to the early twentieth century, and it was with the Soviet atheist anti-religious \"furious fight against Ossetian Paganism\" in the 1950s that the idea appealed once again to Ossetian intellectuals. According to him it was Soviet anti-religious activism to drove ancient local practices from the sphere of \"ethnic tradition\" into the sphere of \"religion\" in the minds of the Ossetian people.{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|pp=239\u2013240}}\n\nThe scholar [[Richard Foltz]] reconstructs the development of Ossetian religion through seven phases: 1. An original Scythian Paganism; 2. a first wave of Christianisation under Byzantine and Georgian influence from the tenth to the thirteenth century; 3. a \"re-Paganization\" during the fourteenth and fifteenth century following the Mongol invasions and the disruption of the contacts with the Byzantines; 4. a partial re-Christianisation during the sixteenth and seventeenth century conducted by Georgian missionaries; 5. a further re-Christianisation conducted by Russian missionaries beginning in the late eighteenth century; 6. enforced [[state atheism]] during the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1991; and 7. a resurgence of \"traditional Ossetian religion\" since the 1980s\u20131990s. According to Foltz, the narrative of the contemporary promoters of Scythian Neopaganism is that the religiosity of the Ossetians maintained a strong underlying continuity while absorbing and adapting superficial influences from Christianity, and to a lesser extent from Islam and neighbouring Caucasian traditions, superficial influences which may be easily stripped away to reveal its essential, distinct \"Iranian character\".{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=320\u2013321}}\n\nSince the fall ofthe Soviet Union, Ossetian politicians have been outspokenly supportive of Scythian Assianism.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=328}} During the 1990s, after the [[1991\u201392 South Ossetia War|clashes between Ossetians and Georgians in 1991\u20131992]], a field besides a sacred grove 30 kilometres to the west of North Ossetia\u2013Alania's capital [[Vladikavkaz]], where the Ossetian hero Khetag was said to have taken refuge from his enemies, was dedicated by the government as a holy site. Since 1994, sacrifices are held at the site with the participation of government officials and community leaders, with activities supervised by the sacerdotal Great Council (''Styr Nykhas''). The ceremony is dedicated to the most important deity, [[Uastyrdzhi]], said to have saved Khetag from his pursuers.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1pp=204\u2013205|2a1=Foltz|2y=2019|2p=328}} Government participation is also seen at the ceremonies organised at the Rekom Temple in [[Tsey]], [[Alagirsky District|Alagirsky]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=328}}\n\n==Writings==\nThe [[Nart saga]]s are regarded as the \"holy writings\" of Assianism, from which some exegetes of the movement, such as Daurbek Makeyev, have drawn [[theology|theological]] doctrines.{{sfnm|1a1=Shtyrkov|1y=2011|1p=240|2a1=Foltz|2y=2019|2p=328}} The scholar [[Richard Foltz]] defines the Narts a \"typical Indo-European heroic epic\".{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=327}} According to Makeyev, who according to Foltz takes an [[essentialism|essentialist]] perspective, \"the framework [i.e., the rituals that actualise the content of the books] is changeable\" and yet \"the meaning is eternal\", and \"the ultimate divine reality is light\", reflecting a theme shared by all [[Iranian religions]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=327}} According to the scholar Sergey Shtyrkov, the Assian exegetes have created \"their own dogma and theological system\", through [[etymology]] and comparison with other [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] traditions.{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|pp=240\u2013241}} Foltz finds this effort to elaborate theological doctrines from traditional texts comparable to similar efforts found in [[Germanic Heathenry]] and modern [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=328}} The artist and architect Slava Dzhana\u00efty has published many books on the Ossetian folk religion, emphasising its philosophical aspects in contrast to the more practical leaning of Makeyev's writings.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=329}}\n\n==Theology and cosmology==\n[[File:North Ossetia.

If a man is able to subdue passions, not putting exclusively egoistic material motives in his actions, he becomes open to the ''Uas'', or its receptacle (\u0443\u0430\u0441\u0434\u0430\u043d, ''uasdan''; good-spell receptacle), a wise noble who perceives the order of God and higher spirits and receives their energy, acting like them by producing good, truth and beauty. On the contrary, if a man's actions are driven by egoistic material ends, ''Dalimon'' and demons own him and he becomes a source of evil, lie and ugliness.<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\n==Practices==\n\n===Rites===\nThe Ossetian calendar has many days dedicated to ceremonies, some of which are performed within the household and others at outdoors sacred spaces. There are sixty fixed celebrations throughout the year. Household ceremonies are centred around the hearth chain (''safa'') which upholds a cauldron, over a fire (the holy element in [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] religions). Communal ceremonies are held at sacred groves or exposed mountaintops.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=323}} According to Shtyrkov, the modern Assian movement tries \"to create a unified ritual system, every tiny element of which has a theological motivation\".{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|p=241}}\n\nOssetian traditional rituals consist in holding a feast (''fyng'' or ''kuvyn'') in honour of a particular deity. The ceremony is led by a \"holy man\" (''dzuary l\u00e6g''), who invokes the deity through the offering of a \"toast\", ''kuyvd'', which also means \"prayer\", towards the sky. [[Beer]] is the substance usually offered in [[libation]], tough it may be substituted by any type of strong liquor. During the ceremony other toasts are made to the other deities, and three ceremonial pies (''ualibakh'') are consumed along with meat from an animal sacrificed for the ritual.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=323}} Communal ceremonies may be accompanied by a circular dance called ''simd''. A distinctive version of the ''simd'' has one circle of dancers standing on the shoulders of another circle of dancers. The [[Nart saga|Narts]] tell that the ''simd'' was invented by the hero Soslan.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=324}}\n\n===Shrines and temples===\n[[File:089 \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0449\u0435.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Rekom Temple in the [[Tsey]] area, [[Alagirsky District]], [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]].]]\nOssetian deities are associated with natural phenomena, and communal ceremonies are usually held at natural shrines, which are often provided with a temple built in wood or stone.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=323\u2013326}} The journalist Alan Mamiev observed that \"Ossetians pray in nature\" and \"every family has its own shrine on their land\".{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=326}} Slava Dzhana\u00efty, who in 1995 reconstructed the Rekom Temple, an important Ossetian shrine destroyed by an accidental fire,{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=328\u2013329}} observed that:{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=326}}\n\n{{quote|Gratefully appreciating the works of nature, the ancient sage did not build gigantic structures that stand out and argue with the environment created by the world's best architect mother nature, just as he did not try to restrict the presence of the Spirit within lxed boundaries.

Therefore, the shrine should not rise above nature or make it ugly; Ossetian shrines are constructed only of local natural materials, and the architectural lines are designed to mimic the surrounding natural features.}}\n\nRuslan Kuchiev, the president of the ''Styr Nykhas'' in 2019, said:{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=326}}\n\n{{quote|It is these sacred places that give us our energy.

Among participants there was Daurbek Makeyev, the head of the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' religious organisation of Assianism. On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' organisation was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because \"what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage\".<ref name=\"Dugin-Assianism\">{{cite web |title=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0414\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d: \u041e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0443 |trans-title=Alexander Dugin: The Ossetian people made it possible for Russia to return to the imperial orbit |date=7 October 2009 |website=iratta.com |url=http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163212/http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-date=26 April 2017}}</ref> Russian Assian resources present the religion as a universal truth \"addressed to the whole world\".<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\n===With Christianity===\nScythian Assian leaders, notably Daurbek Makeyev, have articulated strong positions against [[Christianity]], criticising it for its alien origins, its [[Judaism|Jewish]] origins, and criticising the corruption of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In 2002 and 2007 works he states that the Christian religion breaks the connection of a nation with its own spirit, thus dooming this nation to degeneration and death:{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|p=240}}\n\n{{quote|2002: A person who abandoned his people's God and adopted the alien faith (ideology) from Moses' followers brings damnation not only upon himself and his descendants but upon his whole people and all their lands and possessions. [...] If the people forget their [religious] tradition, it will lose its significance to God and be doomed to extinction.<br/>2007: Moses understood perfectly that to betray some people's God means to break off their roots, to bring about universal debauchery, to loosen traditional values and thereby weaken their ethnic identity and make that people perish. He considered a betrayal of somebody's God as the ultimate crime \u2014 as a crime against the Nation.}}\n\nAt the same time, Makeyev criticises Christianity for its [[anti-environmentalism|anti-environmentalist]] essence, which stems from a theology which separates God from nature, and the sacred from the profane. In a 2019 speech he affirmed:{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=327}}\n\n{{quote|Unlike in Christianity which separates God from his Creation, we take a collective approach where everything is interconnected. [...] They think that only the specilc plot of land on which a shrine sits is holy. [...] They go to Rekom [Ossetia's most important popular shrine] and they treat it as if it were a church, separate from the surrounding area. No one would throw garbage at Rekom itself, but they don't realize that there is no division between sacred and non-sacred land; every place has its resident deity, who will be offended if anyone violates its sanctity.}}\n\nThe movement of Scythian Assianism has attracted strong hostility and complaints from Christian and Islamic authorities. The Russian Orthodox archbishop Leonid in [[Moscow]] sought to silence Makeyev by trying to ban his books as \"extremist literature\", calling on his personal contacts when he was a general in the [[Federal Security Service]]. The Russian Orthodox Church has also been trying to have the Rekom Temple destroyed and a church built in its place, but without success so far.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=331}}\n\n==Demography and institutions==\nThe movement of Scythian Assianism is present in both [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]] and [[South Ossetia]], though it is more widespread in the former.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=318}} Some categories particularly well represented among the believers are the military, hunters, and sportsmen, attracted by the heroic ethics of the Narts, but also intellectuals and artists.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=330}} According to Shtyrkov, the movement \"occupies a visible place in the social landscape of the republic\".{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|p=239}} Scythian Assianism is also popular in Russia and Ukraine among [[Cossacks]], especially those who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs. Some of them identify within the category of [[Rodnovery]], the general \"Slavic Native Faith\".{{sfn|McKay|2009|pp=275\u2013276}} According to Foltz, the movement has become so widespread among the Ossetians that its success is \"unrivalled\" among all [[Neopagan]] religious movements.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=331}}\n\n===Russia===\n* Dzuary L\u00e6gt\u00e6 (\u0414\u0437\u0443\u0430\u0440\u044b \u041b\u00e6\u0433\u0442\u00e6) \u2014 an organisation for the coordination of the Ossetian clergy established in 2016 in [[Vladikavkaz]], North Ossetia\u2013Alania, on the initiative of the public organisation Yudzinad (\u0418\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434);{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n* Ats\u00e6t\u00e6 (\u0410\u0446\u00e6\u0442\u00e6) \u2014 an organisation registered in 2009 in the city of [[Mozdok]], North Ossetia\u2013Alania;{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n* \u00c6ts\u00e6g Din (\u00c6\u0446\u00e6\u0433 \u0414\u0438\u043d) \u2014 an organisation registered in Vladikavkaz in 2009 and related to the Ats\u00e6t\u00e6 community;{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n* Styr Nykhas (\"Great Council\") \u2014 established in 1993 in North Ossetia\u2013Alania.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n===Ukraine===\n* North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire{{sfn|Lesiv|2013|pp=167\u2013169}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rodnovery]]\n* [[Heathenism (new religious movement)|Heathenism]]\n* [[Iranian religions]]\n\n==Citations==\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite article |last=Foltz |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Foltz |title=Scythian Neo-Paganism in the Caucasus: The Ossetian Uatsdin as a 'Nature Religion' |journal=Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture |volume=13 |number=3 |year=2019 |pages=314\u2013332 |doi=10.1558/jsrnc.39114 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338821308 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lesiv |first=Mariya |year=2013 |title=The Return of Ancestral Gods: Modern Ukrainian Paganism as an Alternative Vision for a Nation |series=McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion |volume=2 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP |isbn=077358966X |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite conference |last=Makeyev |first=Daurbek |contribution=\u0410\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 [Assianism and world culture] |year=2007 |title=Traditional Religious Views of Ossetians and Modernity |institution=Ministry of National Affairs and the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania;

The Romans tried to manage the threat by hiring them as mercenaries in the cavalry, or, particularly in France, by buying them off as landed gentry. Many toponyms in France, such as Alainville, Alaincourt, Alen\u00e7on, and others, testify that they were territorial possessions of Alan families. Alan equestrian culture formed the basis of Medieval [[chivalry]], and thus had a significant role in the development of [[Western Europe]]an culture.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=315}}\n\nWhile most of the Scythians assimilated into other ethnic groups by the Middle Ages, the Alans of the [[Caucasus]] maintained a distinct identity and continued to dominate the area, so that the [[Byzantine Empire]] recognised them as an independent allied kingdom. Through their relations with the Byzantines and missionaries from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the south, the Alan aristocracy adopted [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]] during the tenth century. This, however, had little effect on the general Alan population, so that the thirteenth-century Flemish traveller [[William of Rubruck]] reported that \"they knew nothing (of Christianity) apart from the name of Christ\". The [[Ossetians]] are the sole modern population culturally and linguistically descending from the Alans, and they have preserved beliefs and rituals likely dating back to Scythian religion, even though through waves of partial [[syncretism|syncretisation]] with Christianity.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=316}}\n\nAfter the conquests of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the Caucasus during the mid-thirteenth century, contacts between the Alans and Eastern Orthodox religious authorities ceased completely, and their superficial Christianisation was stopped. There is evidence that between the fourteenth and the seventeenth century, shrines which were apparently built in honour of Christian saints were converted to indigenous Pagan use.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}} The [[Russian Empire]]'s expansion in the Caucasus by the end of the eighteenth century brought with itself Russian Orthodox missionaries who sought to \"re-Christianise\" the Ossetians. Their efforts had had limited success by the time when they were completely obliterated by the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, which introduced the peoples of the Caucasus into the rapid processes of industrialisation, modernisation and urbanisation of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Between the traditional and the new religion===\nThe Ossetian people are today split between two states: [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]], a constituent federal republic within [[Russia]], and the neighbouring only partially recognised state of [[South Ossetia]]. The incipient collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1980s triggered projects of identity-building among many of its constituent nations. In Ossetia, as in other nations, this involved the recovery of an \"authentic national religion\" harkening back to pre-Christian times. Ossetian nationalism also played a role, powered by ethnic conflicts for lands and resources with neighbouring peoples in North Ossetia, and for independence in [[South Ossetia]], a territory historically part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], whose status as an independent entity is a matter of international controversy (cf. the 2008 [[Russo-Georgian War]]).{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=317}}\n\nAccording to [[Victor Schnirelmann|Victor Shnirelman]], in the Ossetian case certain traditions had survived with unbroken continuity and were revived in rural areas. This contrasts, and interacts, with an urban and more intellectual movement which elaborated a systematic revived religion associated with ethnic nationalism and with the opposition to both [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] and [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian]] Orthodox Christianity, perceived as foreign, and to [[Islam]], professed by the neighbouring Turkic and Caucasian ethnic groups and by a small minority of Ossetians.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=202\u2013207|ps=: \"Since the turn of the 1980s, a growth of Neo-Paganism has been observed in the Middle Volga region, in North Ossetia-Alaniia, and in Abkhazia. Pagan traditions had never disappeared there completely and, in contrast to the Slavic and Baltic regions, there was no need to invent too much by reference to books, as almost all the resources were intact there. Thus, in these regions, interest in Paganism developed in two different environments: firstly, in the countryside with its unbroken continuity of traditional folk beliefs, and secondly, in the urbanized areas where local, highly secularized intellectuals began to construct a new synthetic religion in order to overcome a crisis of identity. In the latter case, this was a manifestation of local ethnic nationalism resisting Russian Orthodoxy as a \"religion of exploiters\". [...] Contemporary Neo-Paganism is constituted by two different branches\u2014one of a \"bookish\" approach which is artificially cultivated by urbanized intellectuals who have lost their links with folk tradition, and the other, more authentic, is of a rural movement based on a continuity rooted in the remote past. The first dominates among the Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, Lithuanians, Latvians, and Armenians and can be defined as an \"invention of tradition\", after Eric Hobsbawm (1983). A more complex pattern can be observed among the ethnic groups of the Middle Volga River region as well as among the Ossetians and Abkhazians, where both tendencies are interacting with one another.\"}} According to the scholar Sergey Shtyrkov, intellectual projects for the elaboration of an \"ethnic religion\" for the Ossetians date back to the early twentieth century, and it was with the Soviet atheist anti-religious \"furious fight against Ossetian Paganism\" in the 1950s that the idea appealed once again to Ossetian intellectuals. According to him it was Soviet anti-religious activism to drove ancient local practices from the sphere of \"ethnic tradition\" into the sphere of \"religion\" in the minds of the Ossetian people.{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|pp=239\u2013240}}\n\nThe scholar [[Richard Foltz]] reconstructs the development of Ossetian religion through seven phases: 1. An original Scythian Paganism; 2. a first wave of Christianisation under Byzantine and Georgian influence from the tenth to the thirteenth century; 3. a \"re-Paganization\" during the fourteenth and fifteenth century following the Mongol invasions and the disruption of the contacts with the Byzantines; 4. a partial re-Christianisation during the sixteenth and seventeenth century conducted by Georgian missionaries; 5. a further re-Christianisation conducted by Russian missionaries beginning in the late eighteenth century; 6. enforced [[state atheism]] during the Soviet Union from 1921 to 1991; and 7. a resurgence of \"traditional Ossetian religion\" since the 1980s\u20131990s. According to Foltz, the narrative of the contemporary promoters of Scythian Neopaganism is that the religiosity of the Ossetians maintained a strong underlying continuity while absorbing and adapting superficial influences from Christianity, and to a lesser extent from Islam and neighbouring Caucasian traditions, superficial influences which may be easily stripped away to reveal its essential, distinct \"Iranian character\".{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=320\u2013321}}\n\nSince the fall ofthe Soviet Union, Ossetian politicians have been outspokenly supportive of Scythian Assianism.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=328}} During the 1990s, after the [[1991\u201392 South Ossetia War|clashes between Ossetians and Georgians in 1991\u20131992]], a field besides a sacred grove 30 kilometres to the west of North Ossetia\u2013Alania's capital [[Vladikavkaz]], where the Ossetian hero Khetag was said to have taken refuge from his enemies, was dedicated by the government as a holy site. Since 1994, sacrifices are held at the site with the participation of government officials and community leaders, with activities supervised by the sacerdotal Great Council (''Styr Nykhas''). The ceremony is dedicated to the most important deity, [[Uastyrdzhi]], said to have saved Khetag from his pursuers.{{sfnm|1a1=Shnirelman|1y=2002|1pp=204\u2013205|2a1=Foltz|2y=2019|2p=328}} Government participation is also seen at the ceremonies organised at the Rekom Temple in [[Tsey]], [[Alagirsky District|Alagirsky]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=328}}\n\n==Writings==\nThe [[Nart saga]]s are regarded as the \"holy writings\" of Assianism, from which some exegetes of the movement, such as Daurbek Makeyev, have drawn [[theology|theological]] doctrines.{{sfnm|1a1=Shtyrkov|1y=2011|1p=240|2a1=Foltz|2y=2019|2p=328}} The scholar [[Richard Foltz]] defines the Narts a \"typical Indo-European heroic epic\".{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=327}} According to Makeyev, who according to Foltz takes an [[essentialism|essentialist]] perspective, \"the framework [i.e., the rituals that actualise the content of the books] is changeable\" and yet \"the meaning is eternal\", and \"the ultimate divine reality is light\", reflecting a theme shared by all [[Iranian religions]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=327}} According to the scholar Sergey Shtyrkov, the Assian exegetes have created \"their own dogma and theological system\", through [[etymology]] and comparison with other [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] traditions.{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|pp=240\u2013241}} Foltz finds this effort to elaborate theological doctrines from traditional texts comparable to similar efforts found in [[Germanic Heathenry]] and modern [[Hellenism (religion)|Hellenism]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=328}} The artist and architect Slava Dzhana\u00efty has published many books on the Ossetian folk religion, emphasising its philosophical aspects in contrast to the more practical leaning of Makeyev's writings.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=329}}\n\n==Theology and cosmology==\n[[File:North Ossetia.

In ancient Ossetian, the seven days of the week were still named after the seven deities. According to Foltz, \"Ares\" was probably [[Mithra]], and the modern [[Uastyrdzhi]]; he was widely worshipped through altars in the form of a sword planted in a pile of stones or brushwood, a cult perhaps reflected in the [[Arthurian legend]] of the sword in the stone, likely brought to Britain by Alan regiments settled there by the Romans in the first century. The cult of the sword continued among the Alans as late as the first century CE. Herodotus also mentioned an eighth deity worshipped among the Royal Scythians, Thagimasidas, the water god, equated with [[Poseidon]].{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=318\u2013320}}\n\nThe modern Ossetians have preserved the sevenfold-eighthfold structure, though the deities have changed as have their names, which in some cases are adaptations of the names of Christian saints: Uastyrdzhi (whose name derives from \"[[Saint George]]\"), the god of contracts and war (the Iranian Mithra); Uatsilla (\"[[Saint Elijah]]\"), the thunder god; Tutyr (Saint \"Theodore\"), the protector of wolves; F\u00e6lv\u00e6ra (maybe the conflation of \"[[Florus and Laurus]]\"), the protector of livestock; Kurdal\u00e6gon, the blacksmith god (the Iranian Kaveh, Kawa); Donbettyr, the water god; Mikaelgabyrta (conflation of \"[[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel (archangel)|Gabriel]]\"), the fertility and underworld god; and \u00c6fsati, the hunt god.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|pp=320\u2013323}}\n\n===Ethics===\nAccording to Assian doctrines, human nature is the same as the nature of all being. Mankind is a [[macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm within a macrocosm]], or broader context, and the same is true for all other beings. The universe is kept in harmony by ''Uas'' (the good-word), the order of God, the foundation of divine reason and nobility. The deities (''daujita'') form the world according to this universal law, while demons (''uayguyta'') are those entities which act disrupting the good contexts of the deities, and are the causes of illness and death.<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\nThese positive and negative forces also influence humanity's consciousness: A man may take the side of either deities or demons, and this choice will shape this man's life and action. If a man is able to subdue passions, not putting exclusively egoistic material motives in his actions, he becomes open to the ''Uas'', or its receptacle (\u0443\u0430\u0441\u0434\u0430\u043d, ''uasdan''; good-spell receptacle), a wise noble who perceives the order of God and higher spirits and receives their energy, acting like them by producing good, truth and beauty. On the contrary, if a man's actions are driven by egoistic material ends, ''Dalimon'' and demons own him and he becomes a source of evil, lie and ugliness.<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\n==Practices==\n\n===Rites===\nThe Ossetian calendar has many days dedicated to ceremonies, some of which are performed within the household and others at outdoors sacred spaces. There are sixty fixed celebrations throughout the year. Household ceremonies are centred around the hearth chain (''safa'') which upholds a cauldron, over a fire (the holy element in [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] religions). Communal ceremonies are held at sacred groves or exposed mountaintops.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=323}} According to Shtyrkov, the modern Assian movement tries \"to create a unified ritual system, every tiny element of which has a theological motivation\".{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|p=241}}\n\nOssetian traditional rituals consist in holding a feast (''fyng'' or ''kuvyn'') in honour of a particular deity. The ceremony is led by a \"holy man\" (''dzuary l\u00e6g''), who invokes the deity through the offering of a \"toast\", ''kuyvd'', which also means \"prayer\", towards the sky. [[Beer]] is the substance usually offered in [[libation]], tough it may be substituted by any type of strong liquor. During the ceremony other toasts are made to the other deities, and three ceremonial pies (''ualibakh'') are consumed along with meat from an animal sacrificed for the ritual.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=323}} Communal ceremonies may be accompanied by a circular dance called ''simd''.

On that occasion, Dugin praised the revitalisation of Ossetian culture for it having preserved a pristine Indo-European heritage. He discussed the importance of Scythian culture in the development of broader Eurasia, recognising that Scythian culture had an enormous impact on the development of Finno-Ugric, Turkic and Slavic cultures, and despite this European scholars have paid little attention to it so far. Makeyev declared that the ''Ats\u00e6t\u00e6'' organisation was founded for fostering traditional Ossetian religion, but also to share the heritage of Assianism with other peoples, because \"what was preserved in Ossetia is not [merely] Ossetian, but is a worldwide heritage\".<ref name=\"Dugin-Assianism\">{{cite web |title=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0414\u0443\u0433\u0438\u043d: \u041e\u0441\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434 \u0441\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0432\u043e\u0437\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0443\u044e \u043e\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0443 |trans-title=Alexander Dugin: The Ossetian people made it possible for Russia to return to the imperial orbit |date=7 October 2009 |website=iratta.com |url=http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426163212/http://iratta.com/osnews/6555-aleksandr-dugin-osetinskij-narod-sdelal.html |archive-date=26 April 2017}}</ref> Russian Assian resources present the religion as a universal truth \"addressed to the whole world\".<ref name=wacdin.com/>\n\n===With Christianity===\nScythian Assian leaders, notably Daurbek Makeyev, have articulated strong positions against [[Christianity]], criticising it for its alien origins, its [[Judaism|Jewish]] origins, and criticising the corruption of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In 2002 and 2007 works he states that the Christian religion breaks the connection of a nation with its own spirit, thus dooming this nation to degeneration and death:{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|p=240}}\n\n{{quote|2002: A person who abandoned his people's God and adopted the alien faith (ideology) from Moses' followers brings damnation not only upon himself and his descendants but upon his whole people and all their lands and possessions. [...] If the people forget their [religious] tradition, it will lose its significance to God and be doomed to extinction.<br/>2007: Moses understood perfectly that to betray some people's God means to break off their roots, to bring about universal debauchery, to loosen traditional values and thereby weaken their ethnic identity and make that people perish. He considered a betrayal of somebody's God as the ultimate crime \u2014 as a crime against the Nation.}}\n\nAt the same time, Makeyev criticises Christianity for its [[anti-environmentalism|anti-environmentalist]] essence, which stems from a theology which separates God from nature, and the sacred from the profane. In a 2019 speech he affirmed:{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=327}}\n\n{{quote|Unlike in Christianity which separates God from his Creation, we take a collective approach where everything is interconnected. [...] They think that only the specilc plot of land on which a shrine sits is holy. [...] They go to Rekom [Ossetia's most important popular shrine] and they treat it as if it were a church, separate from the surrounding area. No one would throw garbage at Rekom itself, but they don't realize that there is no division between sacred and non-sacred land; every place has its resident deity, who will be offended if anyone violates its sanctity.}}\n\nThe movement of Scythian Assianism has attracted strong hostility and complaints from Christian and Islamic authorities. The Russian Orthodox archbishop Leonid in [[Moscow]] sought to silence Makeyev by trying to ban his books as \"extremist literature\", calling on his personal contacts when he was a general in the [[Federal Security Service]]. The Russian Orthodox Church has also been trying to have the Rekom Temple destroyed and a church built in its place, but without success so far.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=331}}\n\n==Demography and institutions==\nThe movement of Scythian Assianism is present in both [[North Ossetia\u2013Alania]] and [[South Ossetia]], though it is more widespread in the former.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=318}} Some categories particularly well represented among the believers are the military, hunters, and sportsmen, attracted by the heroic ethics of the Narts, but also intellectuals and artists.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=330}} According to Shtyrkov, the movement \"occupies a visible place in the social landscape of the republic\".{{sfn|Shtyrkov|2011|p=239}} Scythian Assianism is also popular in Russia and Ukraine among [[Cossacks]], especially those who claim a Scythian identity to distinguish themselves from Slavs. Some of them identify within the category of [[Rodnovery]], the general \"Slavic Native Faith\".{{sfn|McKay|2009|pp=275\u2013276}} According to Foltz, the movement has become so widespread among the Ossetians that its success is \"unrivalled\" among all [[Neopagan]] religious movements.{{sfn|Foltz|2019|p=331}}\n\n===Russia===\n* Dzuary L\u00e6gt\u00e6 (\u0414\u0437\u0443\u0430\u0440\u044b \u041b\u00e6\u0433\u0442\u00e6) \u2014 an organisation for the coordination of the Ossetian clergy established in 2016 in [[Vladikavkaz]], North Ossetia\u2013Alania, on the initiative of the public organisation Yudzinad (\u0418\u0443\u0434\u0437\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434);{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n* Ats\u00e6t\u00e6 (\u0410\u0446\u00e6\u0442\u00e6) \u2014 an organisation registered in 2009 in the city of [[Mozdok]], North Ossetia\u2013Alania;{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n* \u00c6ts\u00e6g Din (\u00c6\u0446\u00e6\u0433 \u0414\u0438\u043d) \u2014 an organisation registered in Vladikavkaz in 2009 and related to the Ats\u00e6t\u00e6 community;{{sfn|Popov|2016|loc=\u0418\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u0438 / Iranian indigenous religions}}\n* Styr Nykhas (\"Great Council\") \u2014 established in 1993 in North Ossetia\u2013Alania.{{sfn|Shnirelman|2002|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n===Ukraine===\n* North Caucasian Scythian Regional Fire{{sfn|Lesiv|2013|pp=167\u2013169}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rodnovery]]\n* [[Heathenism (new religious movement)|Heathenism]]\n* [[Iranian religions]]\n\n==Citations==\n===References===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* {{cite article |last=Foltz |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Foltz |title=Scythian Neo-Paganism in the Caucasus: The Ossetian Uatsdin as a 'Nature Religion' |journal=Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture |volume=13 |number=3 |year=2019 |pages=314\u2013332 |doi=10.1558/jsrnc.39114 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338821308 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lesiv |first=Mariya |year=2013 |title=The Return of Ancestral Gods: Modern Ukrainian Paganism as an Alternative Vision for a Nation |series=McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion |volume=2 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP |isbn=077358966X |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite conference |last=Makeyev |first=Daurbek |contribution=\u0410\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0430\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430 [Assianism and world culture] |year=2007 |title=Traditional Religious Views of Ossetians and Modernity |institution=Ministry of National Affairs and the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania;
