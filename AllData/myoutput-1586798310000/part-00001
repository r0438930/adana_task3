He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated by his kinsman, Robert Ker, younger of [[Cessford Castle|Cessford]]. He was cousin to [[Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr]], the [[favourite]] of [[James I of England|James VI]]. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king's accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]]. He subsequently was employed by [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], who became his patron through life. Charles mediated the marriage between Sir Robert and the [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Lady Anne Stanley]], daughter of the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]].<ref name=Chambers1840/>\n\nIn 1620, Kerr was involved in a fatal quarrel with Charles Maxwell, who insulted him without provocation as he entered the palace at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. In a duel that followed, Sir Robert killed Maxwell. Even though Maxwell's friends acquitted Kerr of blame, the king's strict rules for prevention and punishment of duels forced him to flee to Holland, where he remained about a year. During his exile, he collected pictures, for which, like his royal master, he had good taste. He eventually presented those he brought back with him to the prince. He was also distinguished by his literary taste<ref name=Chambers1840/> and was a friend of [[John Donne]]. He also lived in [[Whitehall Palace]] and [[Kew]].\n\nOn the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the throne, in 1625, Sir Robert Kerr was made a [[gentleman of the bedchamber]].\n\nHe was [[Member of Parliament|Member]] of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] in 1625, and for [[Lostwithiel (UK Parliament constituency)|Lostwithiel]] and [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1628.<ref name=HoP>http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/kerr-sir-robert-1578-1654</ref>\n\nOn 24 June 1633, when Charles was in Scotland at his coronation, Kerr was elevated to the peerage under the titles [[Earl of Ancram]] and [[Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewton, and Dolphinstoun]]. Previously, his son William, by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Murray of [[Blackbarony]], had married his relative, Anne, [[Marquess of Lothian|Countess of Lothian]] in her own right, and had been, by the king, given the title [[Earl of Lothian]].<ref>David Laing, ''Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, first Earl of Ancram'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1875), pp. xlviii, li.</ref> It was therefore arranged, in the patent granted to Kerr, that his own title should descend to the children of his second marriage.

On the death of Charles, Kerr took refuge in Holland, where he spent the remainder of his days in solitary afflictions and poverty, and died in 1654, in the seventy-sixth year of his age.
