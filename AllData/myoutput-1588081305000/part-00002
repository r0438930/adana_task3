{"title_page": "Debt-trap diplomacy", "text_new": "{{Globalize|date=August 2019}}\n'''Debt-trap diplomacy''' is a term used as criticism of [[foreign policy of China|foreign policy of the Chinese government]].<ref name=\"ps\" /> It claims [[China]] intentionally extends excessive credit to another debtor country with the alleged intention of extracting economic or political concessions from the debtor country when it becomes unable to honor its debt obligations (often [[asset-based lending]], with assets including infrastructure). The conditions of the loans are often not made public and the loaned money is typically used to pay contractors from the creditor country.\n \n== Description ==\nThe term 'Debt-trap diplomacy' is coined after the rising foreign investment of China in other countries. Recently analysts in the English-language media often reference the term with respect to the [[foreign policy of China]], especially under [[Xi Jinping]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] since 2012. Xi has expanded China's [[Foreign policy of Xi Jinping|foreign aid]], infrastructure investment, energy engagement and interconnectedness.  China is a world leader in infrastructure development, having undergone rapid economic growth since its [[Chinese economic reform|reform and opening]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] due to its [[infrastructure-based development]] strategy. This policy is considered debt-trap diplomacy because once the indebted economies fail  to service their loans, they are said to be pressured to support China's geostrategic interests.<ref>{{Cite book|title=China's 40 Years of Reform and Development: 1978\u20132018|last=Garnaut|first=Ross|last2=Song|first2=Ligang|last3=Fang|first3=Cai|date=2018|publisher=Australian National University Press|isbn=9781760462246|location=Acton|pages=639}}</ref> Some commentators, for instance, maintain that China is buttressing [[Political repression|repressive]] regimes in a [[Neocolonialism|neocolonialist]] manner through high-rate loans, with the goal of coercing these countries once they default so that they align with China on key strategic and military issues.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/magazine/a-malaysian-insta-city-becomes-a-flash-point-for-chinese-colonialism-and-capital-flight.html|title=A Malaysian Insta-City Becomes a Flash Point for Chinese Colonialism \u2014 and Capital Flight|last=Larmer|first=Brook|date=2018-03-13|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-12-27|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> China has been accused of requiring secret negotiations leading to non-competitive pricing on projects where bidding must go to Chinese state-owned or linked companies that charge significantly higher prices than would be charged on the open market, and bidding must be closed.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe term has been used to describe China's loan practices with some developing countries.<ref name=\"ps\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-one-belt-one-road-loans-debt-by-brahma-chellaney-2017-01?barrier=accesspaylog |title=China's Debt-Trap Diplomacy |last=Chellaney |first=Brahma |date=2017-01-23 |website=Project Syndicate |access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref><ref name=\"td\">{{Cite web |url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/chinas-debtbook-diplomacy-how-china-is-turning-bad-loans-into-strategic-investments/ |title=China's Debtbook Diplomacy: How China is Turning Bad Loans into Strategic Investments |last=Diplomat |first=Sam Parker and Gabrielle Chefitz, The |date=30 May 2018 |website=The Diplomat |access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref><ref name=\"wp\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/08/27/chinas-debt-traps-around-the-world-are-a-trademark-of-its-imperialist-ambitions/ |title=China's debt traps around the world are a trademark of its imperialist ambitions |last=Pomfret |first=John |date=27 August 2018 |website=Washington Post |access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref><ref name=\"aj\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/09/china-xi-offers-60bn-financial-support-africa-180903100000809.html |title=China's Xi offers $60bn in financial support to Africa |date=3 September 2018 |website=www.aljazeera.com |access-date=2018-09-15}}</ref> Critics of Chinese lending practices allege that many loans associated with China's [[Belt and Road Initiative]] to build infrastructure projects using Chinese contractors in strategically located developing countries are a type of debt-trap diplomacy.<ref name=\"ps\" /><ref name=\"td\" /> Critics in each of the Western,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/how-china-censors-media-it-disagrees-with-australia-2018-6?IR=T|title=How China tried to shut down Australian media coverage of its debt-trap diplomacy in the Pacific|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.usni.org/2018/10/02/panel-chinese-investments-to-boost-trade-come-as-u-s-commercial-shipping-in-decline|title=Panel: Chinese Investments to Boost Trade Come as U.S. Commercial Shipping in Decline - USNI News|date=2018-10-02|work=USNI News|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref> [[Indian media|Indian]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newdelhitimes.com/chinese-diplomacy-bri-and-debt-trap-in-africa/|title=Chinese Diplomacy, BRI and 'Debt-Trap' in Africa|date=8 October 2018|website=www.newdelhitimes.com|publisher=[[New Delhi Times (newspaper)|New Delhi Times]]|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref> and [[Media of Africa|African]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessghana.com/site/news/politics/172338/How-Djibouti-like-Zambia-is-about-to-loose-its-port-to-China|title=Bususiness Ghana - News Politics|website=www.businessghana.com|access-date=2018-10-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2018-10-03-chinas-salami-slicing-takes-root-in-africa/|title=ISS Today: China's salami slicing takes root in Africa|last=|first=|date=3 October 2018|website=Daily Maverick|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> media have also criticised the secretive conditions of the loans as well as their high interest rates.

Recently analysts in the English-language media often reference the term with respect to the [[foreign policy of China]], especially under [[Xi Jinping]], [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] since 2012. Xi has expanded China's [[Foreign policy of Xi Jinping|foreign aid]], infrastructure investment, energy engagement and interconnectedness.  China is a world leader in infrastructure development, having undergone rapid economic growth since its [[Chinese economic reform|reform and opening]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] due to its [[infrastructure-based development]] strategy.
