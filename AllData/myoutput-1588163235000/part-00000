While the [[infidel]] jinn will suffer in the flames, the pious jinn will turn to dust before they touch the flames.

It is clear from the Quran, that the jinn might be thrown into [[Jahannam]] (hell), but does not mention explicitly the presence of jinn in Jannah.  Houris are explicitly described as \"untouched by human and jinn\" indicates, that jinn could enter Jannah, too. Others however, deny the possibility for jinn to enter Jannah, they could merely try to avoid [[hell]]. Accordingly, in the afterlife the fires of hell will be brought forth to the jinn. While the [[infidel]] jinn will suffer in the flames, the pious jinn will turn to dust before they touch the flames.  Other traditions explain, in more detail, the nature of jinn in paradise, such as inverting the invisibility of jinn, thus the jinn will turn into fixed forms, while they can not see humans anymore.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p. 97-99 (German)</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Abu Hanifa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] [[Madhhab|schools jurisprudence]] of [[Sunnism]], the jinn might enter jannah, but, just like angels, they will receive no reward.
