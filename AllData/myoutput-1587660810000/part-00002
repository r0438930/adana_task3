Teasmades generally include an analogue [[alarm clock]] and are designed to be used at the bedside, to ensure tea is ready first thing in the morning. Although crude versions existed in Victorian times, they only became practical with the availability of electric versions in the 1930s. They reached their peak in popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, since when their use has declined, but they are now enjoying a revival, partly as a [[retro]] novelty item.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n\nThe name ''teasmade'' is an example of a [[generic trademark|genericised trademark]], introduced by [[Goblin Vacuum Cleaners|Goblin]] and now belonging to [[Groupe SEB]], but now commonly used to refer to any automatic tea-making appliance. \n\n== History ==\n\nOn 19 September 1891, Charles Maynard Walker published the details of his automatic tea maker, the Early Riser's friend, in Work Magazine (Issue No 131).<ref name=\"WM131\"/> The invention was never patented. Charles was a gas engineer and inventor, born in Bedford, Bedfordshire on 23 March 1846.<ref name=\"Walker\"/>\n\nOn 17 December 1891, Samuel Rowbottom, of 82 Abbey Road, Derby, applied for a patent for his Automatic Tea Making Apparatus, the patent being granted in 1892. It used a clockwork alarm clock, a [[gas ring]] and [[pilot light]]. There is a photograph in existence of Rowbottom displaying his Automatic Tea Maker on an exhibition stand. Although there is no evidence that he commercially produced his tea maker, the concept he invented of using the steam from boiling water to force the water out through a tube into the teapot is still in use today.\n\nOn 7 April 1902, a patent for a teasmade was registered by gunsmith Frank Clarke of Birmingham, England. He called it \"An Apparatus Whereby a Cup of Tea or Coffee is Automatically Made\" and it was later marketed as \"A Clock That Makes Tea!\". However, his original machine and all rights to it were purchased from [[Albert E Richardson]], a clockmaker from Ashton-under-Lyne.\n\nOn 2 May 1932, George Absolom submitted an application for a patent on his invention, an electric automatic tea maker. The patent (number 400672) was passed on 2 November 1933. This invention was manufactured and marketed as the Teesmade.<ref name=\"Teesmade\"/>\n\nThe word \"teesmade\" was initiated by George Absolom Sr and predates the use of the word \"teasmade\" by about four years. George Absolom Sr. applied for a Registered Design using the name Teesmade, but this was not accepted by the Patent Office on the grounds that the unit was not made on the River Tees and that this might confuse the public. After he became ill and confined to his home in Chichester, his wife Blanche-Clementine Absolom took up a lengthy legal battle with the chambers of the Messrs Lovelace and Catwell who represented George Absolom Sr. in his own fight for a patent. Switching lawyers, she turned on her old lawyers for failing to represent her in the fiercer manner. She won the case, despite it dragging on for years due to poor funding on both sides. Geographic trademarks were invariably refused at this time, and indeed the Patent Office passed legislation to forbid them in 1938 (this legislation has since been relaxed). Although the name could not be formally protected, from 1932 onwards George Absolom Sr's son, George Edward Absolom continued to trade as Teesmade Co. Goblin were in no position to object, as the name had the indisputable advantage of prior use.\n\nA similar electric teamaker was patented by William Hermann Brenner Thornton in association with Goblin in 1933, shortly after Absolom's patent.<ref name=\"Thornton-1933\"/>\n\nGoblin's next model, also invented by William Hermann Brenner Thornton, was patented in 1934 and was manufactured from 1936. This was the first tea maker sold under the name Teasmade. A patent sketch of 1934 shows the essential features.<ref name=\"Thornton-1934\"/> A kettle with a tube leading into a teapot was heated by an electric element switched by an alarm clock. The kettle sat upon a spring-loaded pad with a switch, so that when steam pressure pushed the boiling water into the pot, the pad was allowed to rise and cut the power to the element.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Teasmade-machines-at-the-Science-Museum-London-UK.jpg|thumb|Teasmade machines on display at the Science Museum, London (2010)|alt=]]\n\nThe Swan Teasmade D01 made by RBC electronics is no longer in production.\n\nThe Swan Teasmade STM series has been manufactured in China by Swan Products since October 2009, and is being sold in many UK retailers including [[John Lewis (department store)|John Lewis]] and [[Tesco Direct]].
