Early into his international career, he helped the [[Poland national football team|Polish national team]] win [[Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics|the silver medal]] at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Warsaw]], Kowalczyk played his youth football with local Olimpia and Polonez, joining city giants [[Legia Warsaw]] in 1990 at the age of 18. Almost from the very beginning, he was an automatic first-choice; in his weakest [[1990\u201391 Ekstraklasa|season, his first]], he only appeared in 11 [[Ekstraklasa]] games, but was crucial in helping oust [[U.C. Sampdoria]] in [[1990\u201391 European Cup Winners' Cup|the quarter-finals]] of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] by scoring twice in [[Genoa]] for the 2\u20132 draw and qualification for the semifinals 3\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nAfter having started the [[1994\u201395 Ekstraklasa|1994\u201395 campaign]] with Legia (five matches, three goals, another league title), Kowalczyk moved abroad and signed with [[La Liga]] side [[Real Betis]], but was never able to reproduce his previous form. He finished his five-year spell in Spain with [[UD Las Palmas]] in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|second division]], where he also appeared sparingly.\n\nAfter almost one year out of football, Kowalczyk returned to his country and his main club, Legia. In late 2001 he changed countries again, joining [[Cyprus]]' [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]] and netting a career-best 24 goals; after a nearly non-existent second season he finished his professional career in the same country, with [[APOEL FC]], retiring at 32 \u2013 afterwards, he would play in amateur football until 2006, with AZS Absolwent UW Warszawa.\n\n==International career==\nKowalczyk gained 39 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Poland national football team|Poland]], scoring 11 goals. His debut came at the age of 19 on 21 August 1991, against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rsssf.com/miscellaneous/pol-recintlp.html|title=Poland \u2013 Record International Players|publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]]|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nHis biggest international highlight was helping the Olympic squad [[Football at the 1992 Summer Olympics|win silver]] at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]]: he did not score at all in the group stage, but eventually ranked third in the charts at four, three behind compatriot [[Andrzej Juskowiak]].<ref>{{FIFA player|186315}}</ref>\n\n===International goals===\n::''Scores and results table.
