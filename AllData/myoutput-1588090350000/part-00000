In 2018, the museum won the [[European Museum of the Year Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://europeanforum.museum/winners/emya-2018-winners/ |title=EMYA 2018: The Winners |publisher=European Museum Forum |accessdate=19 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe museum was founded in 1989 by [[Sir Terence Conran]]. It was originally located by the [[River Thames]] near [[Tower Bridge]], and later relocated to Kensington.\n\nThe museum operates as a [[registered charity]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Charity Details for Design Museum|url=http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?subid=0&regid=800630|website=Charity Commission|accessdate=10 November 2016}}</ref> and all funds generated by ticket sales aid the museum in curating new exhibitions.\n\n===Shad Thames site===\n[[File:Design Museum.jpg|thumb|The old Shad Thames site of the Design Museum, in 2010]]\nThe museum was originally housed in a former 1940s banana warehouse on the south bank of the [[River Thames]] in the [[Shad Thames]] area in SE1 [[London]]. The conversion of this warehouse altered it beyond recognition, to resemble a building in the International [[Modernist]] style of the 1930s. This was funded by many companies, designers and benefactors. The museum was principally designed by the Conran group, with exhibitions over two floors, and a \u201cDesign Museum Tank\u201d exhibition space out by the waterfront. A large scale sculpture titled Head of Invention by [[Sir Eduardo Paolozzi]] was installed in the area between the museum and the Thames.\n\n===Kensington site===\n[[File:Design Museum, former Commonwealth Institute (geograph 4880684).jpg|thumb|left|The Design Museum]]\nIn June 2011, Sir Terence Conran donated \u00a317.5 million to enable the Museum to move in 2016 from the warehouse to a larger site which formerly housed the [[Commonwealth Institute]] in west London. This landmark from the 1960s, a Grade II* listed building, designed by [[Robert Matthew]]/[[RMJM|Sir Robert Matthew, Johnson-Marshall and Partners]] architects that had stood vacant for over a decade, was developed by a design team led by [[John Pawson]] who made the building fit for a 21st-century museum, whilst at the same time retaining its spatial qualities. Fit-out of the Design Museum's new home was carried out by [[Willmott Dixon]] Interiors.\n\nThe Design Museum opened in its Kensington location on 24 November 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dowd|first1=Vincent|title=Design Museum: A glossy new era and home|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38067532|accessdate=24 November 2016|work=BBC News|date=24 November 2016}}</ref> The move gave the museum three times more space than in its previous location at Shad Thames, with the new [[Swarovski]] Foundation Centre for Learning, 202-seat Bakala Auditorium and a dedicated gallery to display its permanent collection, accessible free of charge.\n\n[[Deyan Sudjic]] succeeded [[Alice Rawsthorn]] as Director of the Design Museum in 2006. In 2016 Alice Black was appointed Co-Director.  In 2019, [[Tim Marlow]] was appointed as Director and Chief Executive.\n\nThe move brought the museum into Kensington's cultural quarter, joining the [[Royal College of Art]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]], [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and [[Serpentine Gallery]].\n\n==Galleries==\n[[File:Design Museum inside top floor.jpg|thumb|View across the top floor]]\nThe top-floor space under the museum roof houses a permanent display, Designer Maker User, with key objects from the museum\u2019s collection. A restaurant, members\u2019 lounge, residency studio and an events and gallery space are also located on the top floor.\n\nOn the first floor, a design and architecture reference library is a resource for students, educators, researchers and designers. It will also include archive material relating to the history of the museum. The Swarovski Foundation Centre for Learning is a suite of learning facilities including a Design Studio, Creative Workshop, two seminar rooms and a Common Room. The Design Museum offices and main reception, a meeting room and a film studio are also located on the first floor.\n\nOn the ground floor, the largest gallery in the new Design Museum showcases a programme of temporary exhibitions. Accessible from both [[Kensington High Street]] and [[Holland Park]], the atrium welcomes visitors and acts as an events space. A main staircase from the atrium gives access to all floors and offers views to the first and second floors and the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]] roof.\n\nA double-height space spanning the two lower levels, Gallery Two hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions dedicated to architecture, fashion, furniture, product and graphic design. The Bakala Auditorium seats 202 people and provide a purpose-designed space for a programme of talks, seminars, debates and public and private events throughout the year. The basement accommodates a collections store, exhibition preparation spaces and a locker area for visitors.\n\n==Award schemes==\nThe Design Museum has an award scheme which [[Brit Insurance]] sponsored from 2003 until 2011.\n\n===Designers of the Year===\n\n*2003 Jony Ive\n*2004 Daniel Brown\n*2005 Hilary Cottam\n*2006 Jamie Hewlett\n*2009 Duarte Ferreira\n\n===Beazley Designs of the Year===\n\nDesigns produced over the previous twelve months worldwide are eligible.
