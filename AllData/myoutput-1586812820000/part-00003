He proclaimed himself as [[King of Afghanistan]] in October 1801 (after the deposition of his brother [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]]), but only properly ascended to the throne on July 13, 1803. In Afghanistan, a blind man by tradition cannot be Emir, and so Shah Shuja\u2018's step-brother Mahmud Shah had Zaman blinded, however not killed.{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=16}} After coming to power in 1803, Shuja\u2018 ended the [[blood feud]] with the powerful [[Barakzai]] family and also forgave them. To create an alliance with them, he married their \"sister\" Wafa Begum.{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=23}}\n\nShuja\u2018 allied Afghanistan with the [[United Kingdom]] in 1809, as a means of defending against an invasion of Afghanistan and [[Punjab Region|The Punjab]] by France.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=7}} In 1809, a British diplomatic mission was sent to Afghanistan, which at the time was to the British a remote and mysterious part of Asia.

He also wrote \"of an olive complexion with a thick black beard ... his voice clear, his address princely.\" Shuja\u2018 wore the [[Koh-i-Noor]] (\"Mountain of Light\") diamond in one of his bracelets when Elphinstone visited him, but rather undiplomatically described Shuja as having a \"vulgar nose\".{{sfn|Husain|2018|p=6}} [[William Fraser (British India civil servant)|William Fraser]], who accompanied Elphinstone to meet Shah Shuja\u2018 was \"struck with the dignity of his appearance and the romantic Oriental awe.\"{{sfn|Dalrymple|2012|p=20}} Fraser also judged him to be \"about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm|spell=in}} tall\" and his skin colour was \"very fair, but dead...his beard was thick jet black and shortened a little by the obliquely upwards, but turned again at the corners ...

When [[Mahmud Shah Durrani|Mahmud Shah]]'s [[vizier]] [[Fateh Khan (vizier)|Fateh Khan]] invaded Kashmir alongside [[Ranjit Singh|Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]'s army, he chose to leave with the [[Sikh]] army. He stayed in [[Lahore]] from 1813 to 1814. During his time in India, Shuja\u2018 was imprisoned and forced to give up the Timur Ruby, Koh-i-Noor and the sister diamond dray-i-nur diamond to Ranjit Singh.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=23}}He escaped from Ranjit's detention at the Mubarek Haveli Lahore for Ludhiana and the East India Company.{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=25}}\n\nFrom 1818 onward, Shuja\u2018 who liked to live in a lavish style with his wives and concubines had collected a pension from the East India Company, which thought he might prove useful one day.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=111}} Shuja stayed first in Ludhiana where he was joined by Zeman Shah in 1821. The place where he stayed in Ludhiana was occupied by the Main Post Office near Mata Rani Chowk and inside it there used to be a white marble stone commemorating his stay there. {{sfn |Husain|2018|p=386}}\n\n=== Exile ===\nDuring his time in exile, Shuja\u2018 indulged his cruelty by removing the noses, ears, tongues, penises, and testicles of his courtiers and slaves when they displeased him in the slightest.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When the American adventurer Dr. [[Josiah Harlan]] visited Shuja\u2018's court in exile he noted that all of Shuja\u2018's courtiers and slaves were missing some part of their bodies as all had in some way displeased their master at some point along the line, to whom they were all slavishly devoted to despite his abuse of them as Harlan noted that there was an \"earless assemblage of mutes and eunuchs in the ex-king's service\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} When Shuja\u2018 went out for picnic with his four wives and the wind blew down his tent, Shuja\u2018 flew into a rage and he had the man responsible for putting up his tent, Khwajah Mika-a slave from East Africa who had already had his ears chopped off-to be castrated on the spot as punishment for not erecting his tent more firmly, much to Harlan's horror.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Shuja\u2018's grand vizier, Mullah Shakur had grown his hair long to cover up that both his ears had been chopped off while he spoke in the distinctive high-pitched voice of a eunuch; Harlan noted he was lucky as the rest of his body was still intact.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Despite or perhaps because he was mutilated, Shuja's grand vizier took a great deal of pleasure in mutilating others and was always inciting his master to have somebody mutilated.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=29}} Harlan noted all of the men around Shuja\u2018 were missing at least one part of their bodies, if not more, and all seemed extremely afraid of their master, who was apt to fly into a rage whenever he did not get his way with anything, and when he was angry, body parts tended to get severed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan commend on \"the grace and dignity of His Highness's demeanor\", observing the sense of power he projected, but also that \"years of disappointment had created in the countenance of the ex-King an appearance of melancholy and resignation.\"{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=30}} Harlan, a man without much military experience and knowledge of [[Pashto]], offered to lead an invasion of Afghanistan to restore Shuja, an offer that led the former monarch to break \"into a poetical effusion in praise of Kabul\" and its gardens, its trees laden with fruits, and its music culminating with \"Kabul is called the Crown of the Air. I pray for the possession of those pleasures which my native country alone can afford\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} When Harlan pressed him on whatever he wanted to accept his offer or not, Shuja\u2018 agreed.{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=32}} Harlan had a tailor sew up an American flag, which Harlan hoisted up in Ludhiana, and started to recruit mercenaries for the invasion of Afghanistan, suggesting that he was working for the U.S. government (which he was not).{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|p=33}} Harlan ultimately grew disillusioned with Shuja, writing he did not view him as the \"legitimate monarch, the victim of treasonable practices\", but rather as \"a wayward tyrant, inflexible in moods, vindictive in his enmities, faithless in his attachments, unnatural in his affections. He remembered his misfortunes only to avenge them\".{{sfn|Macintyre|2002|pp=170\u2013171}}\n\nIn 1833 he struck a deal with Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Punjab: He was allowed to march his troops through Punjab, and in return he would cede [[Peshawar]] to the Sikhs if they could manage to take it. In a concerted campaign the following year, Shuja\u2018 marched on Kandahar while the Sikhs, commanded by General [[Hari Singh Nalwa]] attacked Peshawar. In July, Shuja\u2018 Shah was narrowly defeated at [[Kandahar]] by the Afghans under Dost Mohammad Khan and fled. The Sikhs on their part reclaimed Peshawar.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Restoration of power ===\nIn 1838 he had gained the support of the British and the Sikh Maharaja Ranjit Singh for wresting power from Dost Mohammad Khan. [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], believed that most Afghans would welcome the return of Shuja as their rightful ruler, but in fact by 1838, most people in Afghanistan could not remember him, and those that did remembered him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler whom they absolutely hated.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=112}} During the march on Kabul, the main British camp was attacked by a force of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]]s, of whom 50 were captured.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} When the prisoners were brought before Shuja, one of them used a knife he had hidden in his robes to stab to death one of Shuja's ministers, causing Shuja to fly into one of his rages and to order all 50 prisoners to be beheaded on the spot.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} The British historian Sir [[John William Kaye]] wrote the \"wanton barbarity\" of the mass execution as all 50 prisoners were beheaded strained the campaign, stating the \"shrill cry\" of the prisoners as they waited to be executed was the \"funeral wail\" of the \"unholy policy\" of attempting to restore Shuja.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} Shuja was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839,{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=515}} 30 years after his deposition, but did not remain in power when the British left. Upon being restored, Shuja announced that he considered his own people to be \"dogs\" who needed to be taught to be obedient to their master, and spent his time exacting bloody vengeance on those Afghans whom he felt had betrayed him, making him extremely unpopular with his people.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=121}} He shut himself away in the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul]], and on leaving it he was assassinated by Shuja ud-Daula, at the insistence of his uncle [[Oosman Khan]] on April 5, 1842{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=304-306}}{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=552}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=C.

[[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland]], believed that most Afghans would welcome the return of Shuja as their rightful ruler, but in fact by 1838, most people in Afghanistan could not remember him, and those that did remembered him as a cruel, tyrannical ruler whom they absolutely hated.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=112}} During the march on Kabul, the main British camp was attacked by a force of [[Ghazi (warrior)|Ghazi]]s, of whom 50 were captured.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} When the prisoners were brought before Shuja, one of them used a knife he had hidden in his robes to stab to death one of Shuja's ministers, causing Shuja to fly into one of his rages and to order all 50 prisoners to be beheaded on the spot.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} The British historian Sir [[John William Kaye]] wrote the \"wanton barbarity\" of the mass execution as all 50 prisoners were beheaded strained the campaign, stating the \"shrill cry\" of the prisoners as they waited to be executed was the \"funeral wail\" of the \"unholy policy\" of attempting to restore Shuja.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=117}} Shuja was restored to the throne by the British on August 7, 1839,{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=515}} 30 years after his deposition, but did not remain in power when the British left. Upon being restored, Shuja announced that he considered his own people to be \"dogs\" who needed to be taught to be obedient to their master, and spent his time exacting bloody vengeance on those Afghans whom he felt had betrayed him, making him extremely unpopular with his people.{{sfn|Perry|2005|p=121}} He shut himself away in the [[Bala Hissar, Kabul]], and on leaving it he was assassinated by Shuja ud-Daula, at the insistence of his uncle [[Oosman Khan]] on April 5, 1842{{sfn |Husain|2018|p=304-306}}{{sfn|Moon|1989|p=552}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Buckland|first1=C.
