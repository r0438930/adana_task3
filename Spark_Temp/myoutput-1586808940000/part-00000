However, ''[[Brent (name)|brent]]'' was the middle English for \"burnt\". The name describes the presumed reason for settlement in the part of the Forest of Essex (later [[Epping Forest]]) that would have covered the area, where a major occupation was charcoal burning.\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough a [[Bronze Age]] axe has been found in Brentwood and there are clear signs of an entrenched encampment in [[Weald Country Park]], it is considered unlikely that there was any significant early settlement of the area. At the time, most of Essex was covered by the [[Epping Forest|Great Forest]]. It is believed that despite the Roman road between [[London]] and [[Colchester]] passing through the town, the [[Saxons]] were the earliest settlers of the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |title=Foundation of the Town |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122133853/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |archivedate=22 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe borough was on a crossroads, where the Roman road from [[Colchester]] to London crossed the route the pilgrims took over the [[River Thames]] to Canterbury. A chapel was built in or around 1221, and in 1227 a market charter was granted. Its growth may have been stimulated by the cult of St. Thomas the Martyr, to whom the chapel was dedicated: the 12th-century ruin of [[Thomas Becket]] Chapel was a popular stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. The ruin stands in the centre of the high street and the nearby parish church of Brentwood retains the dedication to St. Thomas of Canterbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-thomas.org.uk|title=Anglican Parish of St Thomas of Canterbury|publisher=St-thomas.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> [[Pilgrims Hatch]], or 'Pilgrims' gate', was probably named from pilgrims who crossed through on their way to the chapel. It is likely, however, that Brentwood's development was due chiefly to its main road position, its market, and its convenient location as an administrative centre. Early industries were connected mainly with textile and garment making, brewing, and brickmaking.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63844&strquery=brentwood%20martyr|title=British History Online : Brentwood|publisher=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, Brentwood was the meeting place for some of the instigators, such as [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. They apparently met regularly in local pubs and inns. The first event of the Peasants' Revolt occurred in Brentwood, when men from Fobbing, Corringham and Stanford were summoned by the commissioner Thomas Bampton to Brentwood to answer as to who had avoided paying the poll tax.  Bampton insisted that the peasants pay what was demanded of them. The peasants refused to pay and a riot ensued as Bampton attempted to arrest the peasants. The peasants moved to kill Bampton, but he managed to escape to London. The rioters then, fearing the repercussions of what they had done, fled into the forest. After the riot the peasants sent word to the rest of the country and initiated the Peasants' Revolt.<ref>Dedman, M., 2012. Peasants were revolting - and they did it right here.

A 'stage' was approximately ten miles, and being about {{convert|20|mi|km}} from London, Brentwood would have been a second stop for travellers to [[East Anglia]]. This has not changed; there is an above average number of pubs in the area - possibly due to the army being stationed at [[Warley Barracks]] until 1958. Some of the pubs date back to the 15th and 16th centuries. Brentwood was also significant as a hub for the London postal service, with a major post office since the 18th century. The major post office on the high street was closed in the 2008 budget cuts; Brentwood residents now must rely on sub-post offices.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1435250/Post-office-closures-Full-list-of-branches.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Post office closures: Full list of branches | date=28 February 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Daniel Defoe]] wrote about Brentwood as being \"...full of good inns, and chiefly maintained by the excessive multitude of carriers and passengers{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, which are constantly passing this way to London, with droves of cattle, provisions and manufactures.\"\n\nThe 'Brentwood Ring', the earliest Christian ring ever to have been discovered in Britain was found in Brentwood in the late 1940s.

However, ''[[Brent (name)|brent]]'' was the middle English for \"burnt\". The name describes the presumed reason for settlement in the part of the Forest of Essex (later [[Epping Forest]]) that would have covered the area, where a major occupation was charcoal burning.\n\n===Early history===\nAlthough a [[Bronze Age]] axe has been found in Brentwood and there are clear signs of an entrenched encampment in [[Weald Country Park]], it is considered unlikely that there was any significant early settlement of the area. At the time, most of Essex was covered by the [[Epping Forest|Great Forest]]. It is believed that despite the Roman road between [[London]] and [[Colchester]] passing through the town, the [[Saxons]] were the earliest settlers of the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |title=Foundation of the Town |publisher=Brentwood-council.gov.uk |accessdate=20 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160122133853/http://www.brentwood-council.gov.uk/index.php?cid=52 |archivedate=22 January 2016 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe borough was on a crossroads, where the Roman road from [[Colchester]] to London crossed the route the pilgrims took over the [[River Thames]] to Canterbury. A chapel was built in or around 1221, and in 1227 a market charter was granted. Its growth may have been stimulated by the cult of St. Thomas the Martyr, to whom the chapel was dedicated: the 12th-century ruin of [[Thomas Becket]] Chapel was a popular stopping point for pilgrims on their way to Canterbury. The ruin stands in the centre of the high street and the nearby parish church of Brentwood retains the dedication to St. Thomas of Canterbury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-thomas.org.uk|title=Anglican Parish of St Thomas of Canterbury|publisher=St-thomas.org.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> [[Pilgrims Hatch]], or 'Pilgrims' gate', was probably named from pilgrims who crossed through on their way to the chapel. It is likely, however, that Brentwood's development was due chiefly to its main road position, its market, and its convenient location as an administrative centre. Early industries were connected mainly with textile and garment making, brewing, and brickmaking.<ref name=\"History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63844&strquery=brentwood%20martyr|title=British History Online : Brentwood|publisher=British-history.ac.uk|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, Brentwood was the meeting place for some of the instigators, such as [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]] and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. They apparently met regularly in local pubs and inns. The first event of the Peasants' Revolt occurred in Brentwood, when men from Fobbing, Corringham and Stanford were summoned by the commissioner Thomas Bampton to Brentwood to answer as to who had avoided paying the poll tax.  Bampton insisted that the peasants pay what was demanded of them. The peasants refused to pay and a riot ensued as Bampton attempted to arrest the peasants. The peasants moved to kill Bampton, but he managed to escape to London. The rioters then, fearing the repercussions of what they had done, fled into the forest. After the riot the peasants sent word to the rest of the country and initiated the Peasants' Revolt.<ref>Dedman, M., 2012. Peasants were revolting - and they did it right here.

This has not changed; there is an above average number of pubs in the area - possibly due to the army being stationed at [[Warley Barracks]] until 1958.

[[Ted Blake]], a long-term Brentwood resident, was managing director of Nissen UK from its inception until shortly before it closed and became a leading figure worldwide in the development of modern trampolining.
