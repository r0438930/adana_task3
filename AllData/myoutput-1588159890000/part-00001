Fay walked out on the series after the first film, ''[[Spotlight Scandals]]'' (1943), and Katzman replaced him with Gilbert's closest friend, [[Shemp Howard]].\n\n===Serials===\nIn September 1944 Katzman was offered a job producing serials for [[Columbia Pictures]], starring with ''[[Brenda Starr, Reporter (film)|Brenda Starr, Reporter]]'' (1945)<ref>NEWS OF THE SCREEN: New York Times 9 Sep 1944: 12.</ref> He followed this with the serials ''[[Jungle Raiders (serial)|Jungle Raiders]]'' (1945) and ''[[Who's Guilty?]]'' (1945). With typical thrift, he produced them on the side, using Monogram's actors and technicians. \n\nThey were followed by ''[[Hop Harrigan (serial)|Hop Harrigan]]'' (1946), ''[[Chick Carter, Detective]]'' (1946) and ''[[Son of the Guardsman]]'' (1947).\n\n===Final Monogram Movies===\nHe continued to produce features for Monogram through 1948.\n\nKatzman's final East Side Kids movies were ''[[Docks of New York]]'' (1945), ''[[Mr. Muggs Rides Again]]'' (1945) and ''[[Come Out Fighting (1945 film)|Come Out Fighting]]'' (1945). The series came to an abrupt end when its star [[Leo Gorcey]] wanted double the usual salary from Katzman. Katzman reacted by pulling the plug on the series. (Gorcey stayed with Monogram, which retooled the series as [[The Bowery Boys]].)\n\nIn November 1945 Katzman replaced the rowdy East Side Kids with [[The Teen Agers]], a wholesome gang of high-schoolers. These were vehicles for singer [[Freddie Stewart (actor)|Freddie Stewart]].<ref>Detective Will Menace Belita in 'The Hunted'\nSchallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times7 Nov 1945: A3. </ref> It was an early example of Katzman's output aimed specifically at a teenage audience. He produced four in total: ''[[Freddie Steps Out]]'' (1946), ''[[Junior Prom]]'' (1946), ''[[High School Hero (1946 film)|High School Hero]]'' (1946) and ''[[Vacation Days]]'' (1948). \n\n==Columbia Pictures==\n===Musicals===\nIn June 1946 Katzman announced he would make his first feature for Columbia, a remake of ''The Last of the Mohicans'' starring Jon Hall.<ref>'LAST OF MOHICANS' TO BE FILMED AGAIN: Katzman, in Columbia Deal, to Star Jon Hall in Remake-- Two Premieres Here Today\nSpecial to THE NEW YORK TIMES..22 June 1946: 25. </ref> However, the first movies he ended up making at the studio were musicals. In August 1946 he signed [[Jean Porter]] to star in ''[[Betty Co-Ed]]'' (1946), made by Katzman's Monogram director [[Arthur Dreifuss]]. The film received excellent reviews, prompting Columbia to ask for three more. Porter left [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which was downsizing, to sign with Katzman. The three musicals were ''[[Little Miss Broadway (1947 film)|Little Miss Broadway]]'' (1947), ''[[Sweet Genevieve]]'' (1947) and ''[[Two Blondes and a Redhead]]'' (1947).\n\nKatzman and Dreifuss then made two films with singer [[Gloria Jean]], who had been a star at [[Universal Pictures]]. Katzman was so pleased by ''[[I Surrender Dear (1948 film)|I Surrender Dear]]'' (1948) that he devoted more time to it, and economized on her other picture, ''[[Manhattan Angel]]'' (1949).<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', Universe, 2005</ref>  These were budgeted at about $140,000 per film. <ref name=\"drop\">{{cite news|title=Hollywood Survey: Sharp Drop in Production Noted -- Still Another Dumas Exploit -- Other Items|author=Thomas F Brady|work=New York Times|date=11 May 1947|page=X5}}</ref> \n\nHe made some sports-themed features starring [[Gloria Henry]], ''[[Racing Luck (1948 film)|Racing Luck]]'' (1948) and ''[[Triple Threat (1948 film)|Triple Threat]]'' (1948), and the musicals ''[[Mary Lou (1948 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1948) and ''[[Glamour Girl (1948 film)|Glamour Girl]]'' (1948). Boxoffice on these pictures declined, and Katzman started focusing on action pictures instead.\n\nDuring this time Katzman continued to produce serials for Columbia such as ''[[Jack Armstrong (serial)|Jack Armstrong]]'' (1947), ''[[The Vigilante]]'' (1947), ''[[The Sea Hound (serial)|The Sea Hound]]'' (1947) with [[Buster Crabbe]], ''[[Brick Bradford (serial)|Brick Bradford]]'' (1948), ''[[Congo Bill (serial)|Congo Bill]]'' (1948) and the outstandingly successful ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948). \n\n===Focus on Action Films===\nIn February 1948 Katzman had signed a five-year deal with screen [[Tarzan]] [Johnny Weissmuller]] to make \"jungle movies\" starting with two films a year for two years where the budgets would be at least $350,000.<ref>SELZNICK TO MOVE OFFICES TO COAST: New York Times 16 Feb 1948: 17. </ref> These turned into the ''Jungle Jim'' series starting with ''[[Jungle Jim (film)|Jungle Jim]]'' (1948)\n\nKatzman continued to make musicals such as ''[[Mary Lou (1948 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1948) and ''[[Glamour Girl (1948 film)|Glamour Girl]]'' (1948) with [[Gene Krupa]]. However the box office performance of Katzman's action movies and serials, particularly ''Superman'' was outstripping those for his musicals and comedies, leading him away from those genres. From 1949 to 1954 he would produce only action fare for Columbia. These were Arabian Nights fantasies (bluntly euphemized by Katzman as \"tits and sand\"), western, action, and prison pictures. He would average ten features a year, producing them in four to ten weeks.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIn October 1948 Katzman signed a seven-year, $4 million contract with Columbia to make four feature films a year through his Kay Pictures corporation, four serials a year via his Esskay Productions, and a ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' [[film series]] starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Italian-Made Feature Stars Patricia Medina; Prison Musical Readied|author=Schallert, Edwin|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 Oct 1948|page=A6}}</ref>. \n\nKatzman allowed a budget of $400,000 for ''[[The Prince of Thieves]]'' (1948), a version of the Robin Hood story starring Hall.<ref name=\"drop\"/> Other action-orientated Katzman product around this time included ''[[The Lost Tribe (1949 film)|The Lost Tribe]]'' (1949), a Jungle Jim movie; the serial ''[[Tex Granger]]'' (1948), ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'' (1949), ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'' (1949) and ''[[Bruce Gentry \u2013 Daredevil of the Skies]]'' (1949); the action thriller ''[[The Mutineers (film)|The Mutineers]]'' (1949) with Hall; the swashbuckler ''[[Barbary Pirate (film)|Barbary Pirate]]'' (1949) and the crime movie ''[[Chinatown at Midnight]]'' (1949).<ref>{{cite news|title=HOLLYWOOD UPSWING: Increased Production Breaks Downward Trend in Employment -- Fox Backs Out|first=Thomas F.|last=Brady|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 April 1949|page= X5}}</ref> \n\n[[Charles Schneer]], who worked for Katzman in the 1940s and 1950s, said the producer:\n<blockquote>Knew everything there was to know about making a movie.  He was a very enterprising fellow, and was enormously intuitive. But, he was a very tough taskmaster and a real skinflint. I managed to get along well with Sam, because I knew what he was and respected what he did. Unfortunately, all his input  was negative. He never contributed anything positive. I would suggest an idea, and he  would knock it down. I would argue with him, but I never got very far. He wouldn't say: 'Do this instead of that.' He would only say: 'Don't do this' \u2014 and I didn't. I certainly learned the value of a dollar from Sam.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|first=Steve|last=Swires|title=Mentor to the Magicks Part One|issue=150|date=January 1990|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-150/page/n56/mode/1up/search/schneer?q=charles+schneer+starlog|page=59}}</ref></blockquote>\nHis Monogram cameraman Robert Cline later recalled \"we did 106 features in six years, working six days a week - an average of 20 to 22 features a year. Those were \"B\" pictures... There was a clever writer in the unit. Sam would pick up a newspaper and say, \"Oh, here's a story.\" He'd give it to the writer and the writer would turn out a script. We'd go all over. We were actually a traveling unit, a very cohesive unit, and I really learned my trade from that experience.\"<ref>AN AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE SEMINAR WITH ROBERT CLINE, ASC\nAnonymous.

Berke specialised in Jungle Jim films such as ''[[Mark of the Gorilla]]'' (1950), ''[[Pygmy Island]]'' (1950), ''[[Captive Girl]]'' (1951) and ''[[Fury of the Congo]]'' (1951). Bennett did serials like ''[[Pirates of the High Seas]]'' (1950), ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950), ''[[Cody of the Pony Express]]'' (1950), ''[[Mysterious Island (serial)|Mysterious Island]]'' (1951), ''[[Roar of the Iron Horse]]'' (1951) and ''[[Son of Geronimo]]'' (1952). Landers handled the other action films like ''[[State Penitentiary (film)|State Penitentiary]]'' (1950), ''[[Revenue Agent]]'' (1950) with [[Lyle Talbot]], ''[[Last of the Buccaneers]]'' (1950) with [[Paul Henreid]], ''[[Chain Gang (1950 film)|Chain Gang]]'' (1950), ''[[Tyrant of the Sea]]'' (1950) with [[Ron Randell]], ''[[The Magic Carpet (film)|The Magic Carpet]]'' (1951) with [[Lucille Ball]], ''[[Hurricane Island]]'' (1951) and ''[[When the Redskins Rode]]'' (1951) with Hall, ''[[A Yank in Korea]]'' (1951) with [[Lon McAllister]]. \n\n[[Richard Quine]], then under contract to Columbia, made one of his first films as director for Katzman, ''[[Purple Heart Diary]]'' (1951); he later did ''[[Siren of Bagdad]]'' (1953) with Paul Henreid.\n\nLew Landers took over direction of Jungle Jim movies for ''[[Jungle Manhunt]]'' (1951) and ''[[Jungle Jim in the Forbidden Land]]'' (1952), and did ''[[California Conquest]]'' (1952) with [[Cornel Wilde]]. [[Fred F. Sears]] started work for Katzman with ''[[Last Train from Bombay]]'' (1952) starring Hall. [[Wallace Grissell]] directed ''[[A Yank in Indo-China]]'' (1952) and [[Sidney Salkow]] directed ''[[The Golden Hawk]]'' (1952) with [[Sterling Hayden]] and ''[[The Pathfinder (1952 film)|The Pathfinder]]'' (1952) with George Montgomery.\n\nBennett continued to make serials like ''[[Blackhawk (serial)|Blackhawk]]'' (1952) and ''[[King of the Congo]]'' (1952), and branched into features such as ''[[Brave Warrior]]'' (1952) with Hall and a Jungle Jim film, ''[[Voodoo Tiger]]'' (1952). (In February 1952 Katzman renewed his options to make more Jim movies.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety185-1952-02/page/n204/mode/1up/search/%22jungle+jim%22?q=%22jungle+jim%22|date=20 February 1952|title=Chatter|page=61}}</ref>) [[Paul Henreid]] returned to Katzman to star in ''[[Thief of Damascus]]'' (1952), directed by [[Will Jason]].\n\nIn July 1952 Katzman announced he would make at least 15 films a year for seven years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Drama: Garson in 'Interrupted Melody;' Bacon-Bergman and Bjork Deals on Fire|author=Schallert, Edwin|work=Los Angeles Times|date=11 July 1952|page=B9}}</ref> In November 1952 this contract was amended so Katzman would make twenty films (seventeen features and three serials).<ref>HOLLYWOOD DEBATE: New York Times (16 Nov 1952: X5.</ref>\n\n[[William Castle]] joined the Katzman group as director in 1953, starting with ''[[Serpent of the Nile]]'' (1953) with [[Rhonda Fleming]] and [[Raymond Burr]]. Castle later wrote in his memoirs that Katzman \"was a smallish man with a round cherubic face and twinkling eyes. Few people in the motion picture industry took him seriously as a producer of quality films, but to me, Sam was a great showman.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=William|last=Castle|title=Step right up! : ...

Sidney Salkow made ''[[Jack McCall, Desperado]]'' (1953) with Montgomery and ''[[Prince of Pirates]]'' (1954) with [[John Derek]]. Spencer Bennet directed the Jungle Jim films ''[[Savage Mutiny]]'' (1953) and ''[[Killer Ape (film)|Killer Ape]]'' (1953). Former Columbia actor [[Fred F.

Fred Sears had a solid hit with ''[[The Miami Story]]'' (1954).\n\n===Transfer to Teen Movies===\nBy the mid 1950s television was making inroads into the action market. The Weissmuller series wound up after ''[[Jungle Moon Men]]'' (1955) and ''[[Devil Goddess]]'' (1955). Serials were gradually phased out, with his last ones being ''[[The Adventures of Captain Africa]]'', ''[[Perils of the Wilderness]]'' (1956) and ''[[Blazing the Overland Trail]]'' (1956). Instead Katzman decided to focus on films that would appeal to the 15-25 age group, which meant more sci-fi, horror, and rock musicals.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIn August 1954 Katzman said he had 14 films lined up, with four more to come, and had assigned four writers to projects: [[Curt Siodmak]] to ''The Creature with the Atom Brain'', Berne Giler on ''Dressed to Kill'', Ray Buffum on a juvenile delinquency story, and Robert E. Kent on a Western.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety195-1954-08/page/n5/mode/1up/search/+%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22loners%22+%22sam+katzman%22|title=Sam Katzman's 4 films|page=6|date=August 4, 1954}}</ref>\n\n''[[Creature with the Atom Brain (film)|Creature with the Atom Brain]]'' (1955) led to a series of science fiction films, such as ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (1955), with effects from [[Ray Harryhausen]]. That was produced by [[Charles H. Schneer]] who had worked with Katzman for a number of years; Schneer and Harryhausen went on to make ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956) for Katzman before Schneer left to form his own unit at Columbia.\n\nKatzman would still make Westerns such as ''[[The Gun That Won the West]]'' (1955), ''[[Seminole Uprising]]'' (1955), ''[[Blackjack Ketchum, Desperado]]'' (1955) and ''[[Duel on the Mississippi]]'' (1955), swashbucklers like ''[[Pirates of Tripoli]]'' (1955) and crime films such as ''[[New Orleans Uncensored]]'' (1955), ''[[Chicago Syndicate (film)|Chicago Syndicate]]'' (1955), ''[[The Crooked Web]]'' (1955), ''[[The Houston Story]]'' (1956), ''[[Miami Expos\u00e9]]'' (1956) and ''[[Inside Detroit]]'' (1956).  He also did the occasional thriller like ''[[Uranium Boom]]'' (1956).\n\nHowever his work had an increasing teenage focus, such as ''[[Teen-Age Crime Wave]]'' (1955) and ''[[Rumble on the Docks]]'' (1956), which were teen orientated crime films. He also started making musicals again, with rock music. \n\nIn 1955, when Columbia wanted to release the first rock-and-roll musical, Katzman reworked elements from his Gloria Jean musical ''I Surrender Dear'' into one of Columbia's biggest hits, ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' (1956) with [[Bill Haley and His Comets]].<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', iUniverse, 2005</ref> This cost $300,000 and earned over $4 million.<ref name=\"may\"/> This was followed by ''[[Cha-Cha-Cha Boom!]]'' (1956), ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'' (1957, again with Bill Haley), ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'' (1957) and ''[[Juke Box Rhythm]]'' (1959, scheduled for Bill Haley but ultimately made with singer [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]]).  \n\nKatzman also produced horror films for the teenage audience, including ''[[The Werewolf (1956 film)|The Werewolf]]'' (1956), ''[[The Man Who Turned to Stone]]'' (1957), ''[[The Giant Claw]]'' (1957), ''[[Zombies of Mora Tau]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Night the World Exploded]]'' (1957).\n\nIn May 1957 Katzman told ''Variety'' that he felt, \u201cA picture that makes money is a good picture \u2014- whether it is artistically good or bad. I\u2019m in the five and dime business and not in  the Tiffany business. I make pictures for the little theatres around the country.\u201d <ref name=\"may\"/> He added that his movies were normally budgeted between $250,000 and $500,000. He said at Columbia he had made 110 pictures, none of which lost money, and the average gross was $1 million. He said at least 40% of the 110 pictures made were still in release.<ref name=\"may\">{{cite magazine |magazine=Variety |date=1 May 1957 |page=17 |url=https://archive.org/details/variety206-1957-05/page/n16/mode/1up |title=$300,000 Picture's Gross Expectancy Same as $1-Mil Film\u2013Katzman}}</ref>\n\n\u201cEvery picture I make now has a selling gimmick aimed at the young audience,\" he said in 1957, and he made car movies, horror stories, science fiction and music.

He did this under a verbal agreement with [[Buddy Adler]] then in September 1960 Robert Goldstein signed him to a three picture contract. These were to be ''Gentlemen Pirates'' written by Mel Levy, a film about Mississippi gamblers written by Jesse Lasky Jr. and Pat Silver, and ''Cypress Gardens'' by Lou Morheim.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety220-1960-09/page/n212/mode/1up/search/%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22sam+katzman%22|title=Sam Katzman on Exhib Vagaries|page=3|date=28 September 1960}}</ref> He said at the time that Hollywood was making too many blockbusters and \"the motion picture business must deal in a saleable product of entertainment at a price the public can afford and not price itself out. of the market.\u201d<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|title=Sam Katzman on Exhib Vagaries|page=30|url=https://archive.org/details/variety220-1960-09/page/n239/mode/1up/search/%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22sam+katzman%22|date=28 September 1960}}</ref>\n\nHe wound up making only one more film at Fox, ''[[Pirates of Tortuga]]'' (1961), a swashbuckler similar to many of the films he made at Columbia. \n\nHe returned to Columbia to make ''[[The Wild Westerners]]'' (1962), a Western, as well as two \"twist\" movies starring [[Chubby Checker]], ''[[Twist Around the Clock]]'' (1961) and ''[[Don't Knock the Twist]]'' (1962). These were scene-for-scene remakes of Katzman's Bill Haley musicals, with almost identical scripts.\n\n===MGM===\nKatzman accepted an offer to move his operation to MGM in 1963. He started with a low budget musical ''[[Hootenanny Hoot]]'' (1963), which led to several more musicals: ''[[Get Yourself a College Girl]]'' (1964) and ''[[When the Boys Meet the Girls]]'' (1965) (a remake of ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]''). MGM also financed three of Katzman's best known movies: two films starring [[Elvis Presley]], ''[[Kissin' Cousins]]'' (1964) and ''[[Harum Scarum (film)|Harum Scarum]]'' (1965), as well as ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), a biopic of [[Hank Williams]] starring George Hamilton. Hamilton later wrote in his memoirs that \"Jungle Sam cracked the whip, whacked the cane and the whole film was in the can right on time. But he gave me free rein creatively and our director... brought in something memorable, and even Sam knew it.\"<ref>George Hamilton & William Stadiem, ''Don't Mind If I Do'', Simon & Schuster 2008 p 182</ref>\n\nIn December 1964 Katzman announced he would make five films that year for MGM in his third year at the studio.<ref>FILMLAND EVENTS: Sam Katzman Begins Busy Year at MGM Los Angeles Times 26 Dec 1964: 19. </ref>\n\nKatzman made the [[Herman's Hermits]] film ''[[Hold On!

Sam Katzman got the call and recruited his 1940s cronies, Arthur Dreifuss and writer [[Hal Collins]], to make ''The Love-Ins'' and ''For Singles Only'' (both 1967)<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', Universe, 2005</ref>\n\n===Final Movies===\nKatzman's final films were produced by his son Jerry.

Fay walked out on the series after the first film, ''[[Spotlight Scandals]]'' (1943), and Katzman replaced him with Gilbert's closest friend, [[Shemp Howard]].\n\n===Serials===\nIn September 1944 Katzman was offered a job producing serials for [[Columbia Pictures]], starring with ''[[Brenda Starr, Reporter (film)|Brenda Starr, Reporter]]'' (1945)<ref>NEWS OF THE SCREEN: New York Times 9 Sep 1944: 12.</ref> He followed this with the serials ''[[Jungle Raiders (serial)|Jungle Raiders]]'' (1945) and ''[[Who's Guilty?]]'' (1945). With typical thrift, he produced them on the side, using Monogram's actors and technicians. \n\nThey were followed by ''[[Hop Harrigan (serial)|Hop Harrigan]]'' (1946), ''[[Chick Carter, Detective]]'' (1946) and ''[[Son of the Guardsman]]'' (1947).\n\n===Final Monogram Movies===\nHe continued to produce features for Monogram through 1948.\n\nKatzman's final East Side Kids movies were ''[[Docks of New York]]'' (1945), ''[[Mr. Muggs Rides Again]]'' (1945) and ''[[Come Out Fighting (1945 film)|Come Out Fighting]]'' (1945). The series came to an abrupt end when its star [[Leo Gorcey]] wanted double the usual salary from Katzman. Katzman reacted by pulling the plug on the series. (Gorcey stayed with Monogram, which retooled the series as [[The Bowery Boys]].)\n\nIn November 1945 Katzman replaced the rowdy East Side Kids with [[The Teen Agers]], a wholesome gang of high-schoolers. These were vehicles for singer [[Freddie Stewart (actor)|Freddie Stewart]].<ref>Detective Will Menace Belita in 'The Hunted'\nSchallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times7 Nov 1945: A3. </ref> It was an early example of Katzman's output aimed specifically at a teenage audience. He produced four in total: ''[[Freddie Steps Out]]'' (1946), ''[[Junior Prom]]'' (1946), ''[[High School Hero (1946 film)|High School Hero]]'' (1946) and ''[[Vacation Days]]'' (1948). \n\n==Columbia Pictures==\n===Musicals===\nIn June 1946 Katzman announced he would make his first feature for Columbia, a remake of ''The Last of the Mohicans'' starring Jon Hall.<ref>'LAST OF MOHICANS' TO BE FILMED AGAIN: Katzman, in Columbia Deal, to Star Jon Hall in Remake-- Two Premieres Here Today\nSpecial to THE NEW YORK TIMES..22 June 1946: 25. </ref> However, the first movies he ended up making at the studio were musicals. In August 1946 he signed [[Jean Porter]] to star in ''[[Betty Co-Ed]]'' (1946), made by Katzman's Monogram director [[Arthur Dreifuss]]. The film received excellent reviews, prompting Columbia to ask for three more. Porter left [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], which was downsizing, to sign with Katzman. The three musicals were ''[[Little Miss Broadway (1947 film)|Little Miss Broadway]]'' (1947), ''[[Sweet Genevieve]]'' (1947) and ''[[Two Blondes and a Redhead]]'' (1947).\n\nKatzman and Dreifuss then made two films with singer [[Gloria Jean]], who had been a star at [[Universal Pictures]]. Katzman was so pleased by ''[[I Surrender Dear (1948 film)|I Surrender Dear]]'' (1948) that he devoted more time to it, and economized on her other picture, ''[[Manhattan Angel]]'' (1949).<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', Universe, 2005</ref>  These were budgeted at about $140,000 per film. <ref name=\"drop\">{{cite news|title=Hollywood Survey: Sharp Drop in Production Noted -- Still Another Dumas Exploit -- Other Items|author=Thomas F Brady|work=New York Times|date=11 May 1947|page=X5}}</ref> \n\nHe made some sports-themed features starring [[Gloria Henry]], ''[[Racing Luck (1948 film)|Racing Luck]]'' (1948) and ''[[Triple Threat (1948 film)|Triple Threat]]'' (1948), and the musicals ''[[Mary Lou (1948 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1948) and ''[[Glamour Girl (1948 film)|Glamour Girl]]'' (1948). Boxoffice on these pictures declined, and Katzman started focusing on action pictures instead.\n\nDuring this time Katzman continued to produce serials for Columbia such as ''[[Jack Armstrong (serial)|Jack Armstrong]]'' (1947), ''[[The Vigilante]]'' (1947), ''[[The Sea Hound (serial)|The Sea Hound]]'' (1947) with [[Buster Crabbe]], ''[[Brick Bradford (serial)|Brick Bradford]]'' (1948), ''[[Congo Bill (serial)|Congo Bill]]'' (1948) and the outstandingly successful ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948). \n\n===Focus on Action Films===\nIn February 1948 Katzman had signed a five-year deal with screen [[Tarzan]] [Johnny Weissmuller]] to make \"jungle movies\" starting with two films a year for two years where the budgets would be at least $350,000.<ref>SELZNICK TO MOVE OFFICES TO COAST: New York Times 16 Feb 1948: 17. </ref> These turned into the ''Jungle Jim'' series starting with ''[[Jungle Jim (film)|Jungle Jim]]'' (1948)\n\nKatzman continued to make musicals such as ''[[Mary Lou (1948 film)|Mary Lou]]'' (1948) and ''[[Glamour Girl (1948 film)|Glamour Girl]]'' (1948) with [[Gene Krupa]]. However the box office performance of Katzman's action movies and serials, particularly ''Superman'' was outstripping those for his musicals and comedies, leading him away from those genres. From 1949 to 1954 he would produce only action fare for Columbia. These were Arabian Nights fantasies (bluntly euphemized by Katzman as \"tits and sand\"), western, action, and prison pictures. He would average ten features a year, producing them in four to ten weeks.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIn October 1948 Katzman signed a seven-year, $4 million contract with Columbia to make four feature films a year through his Kay Pictures corporation, four serials a year via his Esskay Productions, and a ''[[Jungle Jim]]'' [[film series]] starring [[Johnny Weissmuller]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Italian-Made Feature Stars Patricia Medina; Prison Musical Readied|author=Schallert, Edwin|work=Los Angeles Times|date=26 Oct 1948|page=A6}}</ref>. \n\nKatzman allowed a budget of $400,000 for ''[[The Prince of Thieves]]'' (1948), a version of the Robin Hood story starring Hall.<ref name=\"drop\"/> Other action-orientated Katzman product around this time included ''[[The Lost Tribe (1949 film)|The Lost Tribe]]'' (1949), a Jungle Jim movie; the serial ''[[Tex Granger]]'' (1948), ''[[Adventures of Sir Galahad]]'' (1949), ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'' (1949) and ''[[Bruce Gentry \u2013 Daredevil of the Skies]]'' (1949); the action thriller ''[[The Mutineers (film)|The Mutineers]]'' (1949) with Hall; the swashbuckler ''[[Barbary Pirate (film)|Barbary Pirate]]'' (1949) and the crime movie ''[[Chinatown at Midnight]]'' (1949).<ref>{{cite news|title=HOLLYWOOD UPSWING: Increased Production Breaks Downward Trend in Employment -- Fox Backs Out|first=Thomas F.|last=Brady|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 April 1949|page= X5}}</ref> \n\n[[Charles Schneer]], who worked for Katzman in the 1940s and 1950s, said the producer:\n<blockquote>Knew everything there was to know about making a movie.  He was a very enterprising fellow, and was enormously intuitive. But, he was a very tough taskmaster and a real skinflint. I managed to get along well with Sam, because I knew what he was and respected what he did. Unfortunately, all his input  was negative. He never contributed anything positive. I would suggest an idea, and he  would knock it down. I would argue with him, but I never got very far. He wouldn't say: 'Do this instead of that.' He would only say: 'Don't do this' \u2014 and I didn't. I certainly learned the value of a dollar from Sam.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Starlog|first=Steve|last=Swires|title=Mentor to the Magicks Part One|issue=150|date=January 1990|url=https://archive.org/details/starlog_magazine-150/page/n56/mode/1up/search/schneer?q=charles+schneer+starlog|page=59}}</ref></blockquote>\nHis Monogram cameraman Robert Cline later recalled \"we did 106 features in six years, working six days a week - an average of 20 to 22 features a year. Those were \"B\" pictures... There was a clever writer in the unit. Sam would pick up a newspaper and say, \"Oh, here's a story.\" He'd give it to the writer and the writer would turn out a script. We'd go all over. We were actually a traveling unit, a very cohesive unit, and I really learned my trade from that experience.\"<ref>AN AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE SEMINAR WITH ROBERT CLINE, ASC\nAnonymous.

Berke specialised in Jungle Jim films such as ''[[Mark of the Gorilla]]'' (1950), ''[[Pygmy Island]]'' (1950), ''[[Captive Girl]]'' (1951) and ''[[Fury of the Congo]]'' (1951). Bennett did serials like ''[[Pirates of the High Seas]]'' (1950), ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (1950), ''[[Cody of the Pony Express]]'' (1950), ''[[Mysterious Island (serial)|Mysterious Island]]'' (1951), ''[[Roar of the Iron Horse]]'' (1951) and ''[[Son of Geronimo]]'' (1952). Landers handled the other action films like ''[[State Penitentiary (film)|State Penitentiary]]'' (1950), ''[[Revenue Agent]]'' (1950) with [[Lyle Talbot]], ''[[Last of the Buccaneers]]'' (1950) with [[Paul Henreid]], ''[[Chain Gang (1950 film)|Chain Gang]]'' (1950), ''[[Tyrant of the Sea]]'' (1950) with [[Ron Randell]], ''[[The Magic Carpet (film)|The Magic Carpet]]'' (1951) with [[Lucille Ball]], ''[[Hurricane Island]]'' (1951) and ''[[When the Redskins Rode]]'' (1951) with Hall, ''[[A Yank in Korea]]'' (1951) with [[Lon McAllister]]. \n\n[[Richard Quine]], then under contract to Columbia, made one of his first films as director for Katzman, ''[[Purple Heart Diary]]'' (1951); he later did ''[[Siren of Bagdad]]'' (1953) with Paul Henreid.\n\nLew Landers took over direction of Jungle Jim movies for ''[[Jungle Manhunt]]'' (1951) and ''[[Jungle Jim in the Forbidden Land]]'' (1952), and did ''[[California Conquest]]'' (1952) with [[Cornel Wilde]]. [[Fred F. Sears]] started work for Katzman with ''[[Last Train from Bombay]]'' (1952) starring Hall. [[Wallace Grissell]] directed ''[[A Yank in Indo-China]]'' (1952) and [[Sidney Salkow]] directed ''[[The Golden Hawk]]'' (1952) with [[Sterling Hayden]] and ''[[The Pathfinder (1952 film)|The Pathfinder]]'' (1952) with George Montgomery.\n\nBennett continued to make serials like ''[[Blackhawk]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}'' (1952) and ''[[King of the Congo]]'' (1952), and branched into features such as ''[[Brave Warrior]]'' (1952) with Hall and a Jungle Jim film, ''[[Voodoo Tiger]]'' (1952).

Castle later wrote in his memoirs that Katzman \"was a smallish man with a round cherubic face and twinkling eyes.

Sidney Salkow made ''[[Jack McCall, Desperado]]'' (1953) with Montgomery and ''[[Prince of Pirates]]'' (1954) with [[John Derek]]. Spencer Bennet directed the Jungle Jim films ''[[Savage Mutiny]]'' (1953) and ''[[Killer Ape (film)|Killer Ape]]'' (1953). Former Columbia actor [[Fred F.

Fred Sears had a solid hit with ''[[The Miami Story]]'' (1954).\n\n===Transfer to Teen Movies===\nBy the mid 1950s television was making inroads into the action market. The Weissmuller series wound up after ''[[Jungle Moon Men]]'' (1955) and ''[[Devil Goddess]]'' (1955). Serials were gradually phased out, with his last ones being ''[[The Adventures of Captain Africa]]'', ''[[Perils of the Wilderness]]'' (1956) and ''[[Blazing the Overland Trail]]'' (1956). Instead Katzman decided to focus on films that would appeal to the 15-25 age group, which meant more sci-fi, horror, and rock musicals.<ref name=\"may\"/>\n\nIn August 1954 Katzman said he had 14 films lined up, with four more to come, and had assigned four writers to projects: [[Curt Siodmak]] to ''The Creature with the Atom Brain'', Berne Giler on ''Dressed to Kill'', Ray Buffum on a juvenile delinquency story, and Robert E. Kent on a Western.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety195-1954-08/page/n5/mode/1up/search/+%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22loners%22+%22sam+katzman%22|title=Sam Katzman's 4 films|page=6|date=August 4, 1954}}</ref>\n\n''[[Creature with the Atom Brain (film)|Creature with the Atom Brain]]'' (1955) led to a series of science fiction films, such as ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (1955), with effects from [[Ray Harryhausen]]. That was produced by [[Charles H. Schneer]] who had worked with Katzman for a number of years; Schneer and Harryhausen went on to make ''[[Earth vs. the Flying Saucers]]'' (1956) for Katzman before Schneer left to form his own unit at Columbia.\n\nKatzman would still make Westerns such as ''[[The Gun That Won the West]]'' (1955), ''[[Seminole Uprising]]'' (1955), ''[[Blackjack Ketchum, Desperado]]'' (1955) and ''[[Duel on the Mississippi]]'' (1955), swashbucklers like ''[[Pirates of Tripoli]]'' (1955) and crime films such as ''[[New Orleans Uncensored]]'' (1955), ''[[Chicago Syndicate (film)|Chicago Syndicate]]'' (1955), ''[[The Crooked Web]]'' (1955), ''[[The Houston Story]]'' (1956), ''[[Miami Expos\u00e9]]'' (1956) and ''[[Inside Detroit]]'' (1956).  He also did the occasional thriller like ''[[Uranium Boom]]'' (1956).\n\nHowever his work had an increasing teenage focus, such as ''[[Teen-Age Crime Wave]]'' (1955) and ''[[Rumble on the Docks]]'' (1956), which were teen orientated crime films. He also started making musicals again, with rock music. \n\nIn 1955, when Columbia wanted to release the first rock-and-roll musical, Katzman reworked elements from his Gloria Jean musical ''I Surrender Dear'' into one of Columbia's biggest hits, ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' (1956) with [[Bill Haley and His Comets]].<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', iUniverse, 2005</ref> This cost $300,000 and earned over $4 million.<ref name=\"may\"/> This was followed by ''[[Cha-Cha-Cha Boom!]]'' (1956), ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'' (1957, again with Bill Haley), ''[[Calypso Heat Wave]]'' (1957) and ''[[Juke Box Rhythm]]'' (1959, scheduled for Bill Haley but ultimately made with singer [[Jack Jones (singer)|Jack Jones]]).  \n\nKatzman also produced horror films for the teenage audience, including ''[[The Werewolf (1956 film)|The Werewolf]]'' (1956), ''[[The Man Who Turned to Stone]]'' (1957), ''[[The Giant Claw]]'' (1957), ''[[Zombies of Mora Tau]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Night the World Exploded]]'' (1957).\n\nIn May 1957 Katzman told ''Variety'' that he felt, \u201cA picture that makes money is a good picture \u2014- whether it is artistically good or bad. I\u2019m in the five and dime business and not in  the Tiffany business. I make pictures for the little theatres around the country.\u201d <ref name=\"may\"/> He added that his movies were normally budgeted between $250,000 and $500,000. He said at Columbia he had made 110 pictures, none of which lost money, and the average gross was $1 million. He said at least 40% of the 110 pictures made were still in release.<ref name=\"may\">{{cite magazine |magazine=Variety |date=1 May 1957 |page=17 |url=https://archive.org/details/variety206-1957-05/page/n16/mode/1up |title=$300,000 Picture's Gross Expectancy Same as $1-Mil Film\u2013Katzman}}</ref>\n\n\u201cEvery picture I make now has a selling gimmick aimed at the young audience,\" he said in 1957, and he made car movies, horror stories, science fiction and music. He said his pictures are the \u201cbread and butter\u201d pictures of the industry. \u201cI don't get ulcers with the type of pictures I make,\u201d he said.<ref name=\"may\"/> \n\nIn 1957 Katzman made seven films for Columbia, including non-teenage fare such as ''[[Utah Blaine]]'' (1957), ''[[Escape from San Quentin]]'' (1957), ''[[The Tijuana Story]]'' (1957) and ''[[The World Was His Jury]]'' (1957). He announced in December of that year he would double this amount over the following twelve months.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/variety209-1958-01/page/n6/mode/1up |date=1 January 1958 |page=7 |title=Katzman's Columbia 7 in '57 to be Doubled |magazine=Variety}}</ref>\n\nKatzman's later films at Columbia included some teen melodramas ''[[Going Steady (1958 film)|Going Steady]]'' (1958) and ''[[Life Begins at 17]]'' (1958);''[[Crash Landing (1958 film)|Crash Landing]]'' (1958), a disaster film based on [[Pan Am Flight 6]]; a pair of war films starring [[Van Johnson]] shot in Europe, ''[[The Last Blitzkrieg]]'' (1959) and ''[[The Enemy General]]'' (1960); and a drama about trapeze artists, ''[[The Flying Fontaines]]'' (1959).\n\n==Later career==\n===20th Century Fox===\nKatzman signed a deal with [[20th Century Fox]] starting with ''[[The Wizard of Baghdad]]'' (1960), an \"Eastern\" with [[Dick Shawn]]. He did this under a verbal agreement with [[Buddy Adler]] then in September 1960 Robert Goldstein signed him to a three picture contract. These were to be ''Gentlemen Pirates'' written by Mel Levy, a film about Mississippi gamblers written by Jesse Lasky Jr. and Pat Silver, and ''Cypress Gardens'' by Lou Morheim.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|url=https://archive.org/details/variety220-1960-09/page/n212/mode/1up/search/%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22sam+katzman%22|title=Sam Katzman on Exhib Vagaries|page=3|date=28 September 1960}}</ref> He said at the time that Hollywood was making too many blockbusters and \"the motion picture business must deal in a saleable product of entertainment at a price the public can afford and not price itself out. of the market.\u201d<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Variety|title=Sam Katzman on Exhib Vagaries|page=30|url=https://archive.org/details/variety220-1960-09/page/n239/mode/1up/search/%22sam+katzman%22?q=%22sam+katzman%22|date=28 September 1960}}</ref>\n\nHe wound up making only one more film at Fox, ''[[Pirates of Tortuga]]'' (1961), a swashbuckler similar to many of the films he made at Columbia. \n\nHe returned to Columbia to make ''[[The Wild Westerners]]'' (1962), a Western, as well as two \"twist\" movies starring [[Chubby Checker]], ''[[Twist Around the Clock]]'' (1961) and ''[[Don't Knock the Twist]]'' (1962). These were scene-for-scene remakes of Katzman's Bill Haley musicals, with almost identical scripts.\n\n===MGM===\nKatzman accepted an offer to move his operation to MGM in 1963. He started with a low budget musical ''[[Hootenanny Hoot]]'' (1963), which led to several more musicals: ''[[Get Yourself a College Girl]]'' (1964) and ''[[When the Boys Meet the Girls]]'' (1965) (a remake of ''[[Girl Crazy (1943 film)|Girl Crazy]]''). MGM also financed three of Katzman's best known movies: two films starring [[Elvis Presley]], ''[[Kissin' Cousins]]'' (1964) and ''[[Harum Scarum (film)|Harum Scarum]]'' (1965), as well as ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), a biopic of [[Hank Williams]] starring George Hamilton. Hamilton later wrote in his memoirs that \"Jungle Sam cracked the whip, whacked the cane and the whole film was in the can right on time. But he gave me free rein creatively and our director... brought in something memorable, and even Sam knew it.\"<ref>George Hamilton & William Stadiem, ''Don't Mind If I Do'', Simon & Schuster 2008 p 182</ref>\n\nIn December 1964 Katzman announced he would make five films that year for MGM in his third year at the studio.<ref>FILMLAND EVENTS: Sam Katzman Begins Busy Year at MGM Los Angeles Times 26 Dec 1964: 19. </ref>\n\nKatzman made the [[Herman's Hermits]] film ''[[Hold On!

Sam Katzman got the call and recruited his 1940s cronies, Arthur Dreifuss and writer [[Hal Collins]], to make ''The Love-Ins'' and ''For Singles Only'' (both 1967)<ref>MacGillivray, Scott and Jan, ''Gloria Jean: A Little Bit of Heaven'', Universe, 2005</ref>\n\n===Final Movies===\nKatzman's final films were produced by his son Jerry.
