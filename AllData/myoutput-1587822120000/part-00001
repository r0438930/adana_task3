The last Batak king who fought valiantly against Dutch imperialists until 1905 was an Indonesian Shaivite king. The Batak may be mentioned in [[Zhao Rugua]]'s 13th-century ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi|Description of the Barbarous Peoples]]'' (''Zhu Fan Zhi'' {{lang|zh|\u8af8\u8543\u5fd7}}), which refers to a 'Ba-ta' dependency of [[Srivijaya]]. The ''[[Suma Oriental]]'', of the 15th century, also refers to the kingdom of Bata, bounded by [[Pasai]] and the [[Sultanate of Deli|Aru kingdom]].\n\nBased on this evidence, the Batak may have been involved in procuring important commodities for trade with [[China]], perhaps from the 8th or 9th centuries and continuing for the next thousand years, with Batak men carrying the products on their backs for sale at ports.\n\nIt has been suggested that the important port of [[Barus]] in [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] was populated by Batak people.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Malay Frontier: Unity and Duality in a Sumatran Kingdom |last=Drakard |first=Jane |publisher=SEAP Publications |year=1990 |isbn=08-772-7706-0}}</ref> A [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription has been found in Barus which is dated to 1088, while contact with Chinese and Tamil traders took place at [[Kota Cina]], a trading town located in what is now northern [[Medan]] that was established in the 11th century, and comprising 10,000 people by the 12th century. Tamil remains have been found on key trade routes to the Batak lands.\n\nThese trading opportunities may have caused migration of Batak from Pakpak and Toba to the present-day Karo and Simalungun 'frontier' lands, where they were exposed to greater influence from visiting Tamil traders, while the migration of Batak to the Angkola-Mandailing lands may have been prompted by 8th-century Srivijayan demand for [[camphor]].\n\nThe [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo ''marga'' or tribe]] ''Sembiring'' \"black one\" is believed to originate from their ties with Tamil traders, with specific Sembiring sub-marga, namely Brahmana, Colia, Pandia, Depari, Meliala, Muham, Pelawi, and Tekan all of Indian origin. Tamil influence on Karo religious practices are also noted, with the pekualuh secondary cremation ritual being specific to the Karo and Dairi people. Moreover the Pustaka Kembaren, an origin story of the Sembiring Kembaren suggests linkages with [[Pagarruyung]] in [[Minangkabau Highlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Mengenal suku Karo |last=Bangun |first=Roberto |date=2006 |publisher=Yayasan Pendidikan Bangun}}</ref> \n\nFrom the 16th century onward, [[Aceh]] increased the production of [[Black pepper|pepper]], an important export commodity, in exchange for rice, which grew well in the Batak wetlands. Batak people in different areas cultivated either ''sawah'' (wet rice fields) or ''ladang'' (dry rice), and the Toba Batak, most expert in agriculture, must have migrated to meet demand in new areas. The increasing importance of rice had religious significance, which increased the power of the Batak high priests, who had responsibility for ensuring agricultural success.\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Image from page 129 of \"Handbook to the ethnographical collections\" (1910) (14783317945).jpg|thumb|right|Bark book with charms written in native [[Batak script]], 1910.]]\n{{main|Batak languages}}\n{{see also|Batak script}}\nThe Batak speak a variety of closely related languages, all members of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. There are two major branches, a northern branch comprising the [[Batak Dairi language|Pakpak-Dairi]], [[Batak Alas-Kluet language|Alas-Kluet]] and [[Batak Karo language|Karo]] languages, which are similar to each other, and a distinct southern branch, comprising three mutually intelligible dialects: [[Batak Toba language|Toba]], [[Batak Angkola language|Angkola]] and [[Batak Mandailing language|Mandailing]]. [[Batak Simalungun language|Simalungun]] is an early offspring of the southern branch. Some Simalungun dialects can be understood by speakers of Batak Karo, whereas other dialects of Simalungun can be understood by speakers of Toba. This is due to the existence of a linguistic continuum that often blurs the lines between the Batak dialects. Batak dialect still influences the dialects in [[Medan]] city today.\n\nThe Batak possess their own script known as the [[Batak script|''Surat Batak'']].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0834803496 Kozok, Uli, \"Bark, Bones and Bamboo: Batak traditions of Sumatra,\" in ''Illuminations: The Writing Traditions of Indonesia,'' Ann Kumar and John McGlynn, eds., Lontar and Weatherhill, Jakarta (1237).]</ref> The writing has chiefly ceremonial importance within traditional religious ceremonies, and was subject to little change for this reason. It is likely that the Batak people originally received their writing system from southern Sumatra.\n\n==Profession==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Toba Batak prauw met houtsnijwerk op de voorsteven TMnr 60011149.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional boat (circa 1870), photograph by [[Kristen Feilberg]].]]\nThe traditional occupation of the Batak was [[agriculture]], hunting and farming. The great lake of [[Lake Toba|Toba]] provided vast opportunity for freshwater aquaculture since ancient times. Interior rural Batak communities relied heavily on rice farming, horticulture and other plant and commercial crops, and to some extent, acquiring forest products, such as hard wood, plant resin, and wild animals. \n\nThe port of [[Barus]] on the western coast of Batak lands has become famous as the source of ''kapur barus'' ([[camphor]]). In ancient times, Batak warriors were often recruited by neighboring Malay courts as mercenaries. In the colonial era, the Dutch introduced commercial cash crops, such as coffee, ''sawit'' [[palm oil]], and [[rubber]], converting some parts of the Batak land into plantations.\n\nThroughout the history of modern Indonesia, the Batak community has been a significant contributor. Batak people have filled a wide range of occupations, from running modest tire service workshops to serving as state ministers. The modern Batak have gravitated towards professions such as attorneys, bus and taxi drivers, mechanics, engineers, singers and musicians, writers and journalists, teachers, economists, scientists, and military officers.\n\nEven though the Batak are a minority among the Indonesian population (3.58 %; only 8-9 million Batak people out of 236 million according 2010's census), there have been a number of notable Batak that have risen to distinguished positions and careers. Especially in the field of law Bataks have been well represented.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/31491/batak-make-good-lawyers-is-it-true/ |title=Batak Make Good Lawyers, Is It True? |last=Tjahjono |first=Tenissa |date=31 October 2017 |website=Global Indonesian Voices}}</ref> Among others, lawyers like [[Ruhut Sitompul]] and [[Hotman Paris Hutapea]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/world/asia/24hotman.html |title=A Top Indonesian Lawyer May Be Honest to a Fault |last=Onishi |first=Norimitsu |date=24 April 2010 |website=The New York Times}}</ref> are widely known beyond the circle of their legal colleagues, since they have gained star lawyer reputations by handling high-profile cases closely reported by the media.

National heroes such as [[Sisingamangaraja XII]], two Indonesian prime ministers ([[Amir Sjarifuddin|Amir Syarifuddin Harahap]] and [[Burhanuddin Harahap]]), speakers of the parliament ([[Zainul Arifin|Zainul Arifin Pohan]]), one vice president ([[Adam Malik|Adam Malik Batubara]]), governor of the central bank ([[Darmin Nasution]]), one attorney general ([[Marsillam Simanjuntak]]), and many cabinet ministers (such as [[Malam Sambat Kaban|M.S. Kaban]], [[Tifatul Sembiring]], [[Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan]]), as well as leading military generals and officers ([[Abdul Harris Nasution]], [[T. B. Simatupang]], [[Maraden Panggabean]]) are also showing their influence in Indonesian history and politics.\n\n==Society==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De bekende Karo-Batak schaker Si Narser met zijn vrouw Karolanden Noord-Sumatra TMnr 10005391.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A Batak couple, circa 1914\u20131919.]]\n\nBatak societies are [[patriarchy|patriarchally]] organized along clans known as [[Marga (Batak)|''Marga'']]. A traditional belief among the Toba Batak is that they originate from one ancestor \"Si Raja Batak\", with all ''Margas'' descended from him. A family tree that defines the father-son relationship among Batak people is called ''[[tarombo]]''. In contemporary Indonesia, the Batak people have a strong focus on education and a prominent position in the professions, particularly as teachers, engineers, doctors and lawyers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Kinship and Family Organization |last=Farber |first=Bernard |date=1966 |publisher=Wiley}}</ref> Toba Batak are known traditionally for their [[weaving]], [[wood carving]] and especially ornate stone tombs.\n\nBefore they became subjects of the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] government, the Batak had a reputation for being fierce warriors. Today the Batak are mostly Christian with a Muslim minority. Currently the largest Christian congregation in Indonesia is the [[HKBP]] (''Huria Kristen Batak Protestan'') Christian church. The dominant Christian [[theology]] was brought by [[Lutheran]] [[German people|German]] missionaries in the 19th century, including the well-known missionary [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]]. Christianity was introduced to the Karo by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Calvinist]] missionaries, and their largest church is the GBKP (''Gereja Batak Karo Protestan''). The [[Mandailing]] and Angkola Batak were converted to Islam in the early 19th century during the reign of Minangkabaus [[Padri War|Padri]].<ref>Luckman Sinar (Tengku), The History of Medan in the Olden Times, 1996</ref> A significant minority of Batak people do not adhere to either Christianity or Islam, however, and follow traditional practices known as the ''agama si dekah'', the old religion, which is also called ''perbegu'' or ''pemena''.<ref>Sibeth, p. 86.</ref>\n\n=== Dalihan Na Tolu ===\n''Dalihan Na Tolu'' (three-legged furnace) is the philosophy of life of the Batak people.

His description parallels that of Marsden in some important respects, however von Kessel states that cannibalism was regarded by the Batak as a judicial act and its application was restricted to very narrowly defined infringements of the law including theft, [[adultery]], spying or treason. Salt, red pepper and lemons had to be provided by the relatives of the victim as a sign that they accepted the [[verdict]] of the community and were not thinking of [[revenge]].<ref>Von Kessel, O., \"Erinnerungen an Sumatra,\" ''Das Ausland,'' Stuttgart (1854) 27:905-08.</ref>\n\n[[Ida Laura Pfeiffer]] visited the Batak in August 1852 and although she did not observe any cannibalism, she was told that: \n:\"[[Prisoners of war]] are tied to a tree and beheaded at once; but the blood is carefully preserved for drinking, and sometimes made into a kind of pudding with boiled rice. The body is then distributed; the ears, the nose, and the soles of the feet are the exclusive property of the [[Rajah]], who has besides a claim on other portions. The palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, the flesh of the head, and the heart and liver, are reckoned peculiar delicacies, and the flesh in general is roasted and eaten with salt.

Significant numbers of Batak have migrated in recent years to prosperous neighbouring Riau province.\n\nTo the south of North Sumatra are the Muslim Minangkabau of [[West Sumatra]], while to the north there are various Muslim Acehnese peoples.\n\n==Traditional Batak religion==\n[[File:Batak-village 09N9400-01.jpg|left|thumb|Batak village on Samosir island.]]\nThe various Batak cultures differ in their pre-colonial religious ideas as they do in many other aspects of culture. Information about the old religious ideas of the [[Mandailing]] and Angkola in southern Batakland is incomplete, and  very little is known about the religion of the [[Pakpak people|Pakpak]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]] Batak. For the [[Toba people|Toba]] and [[Karo people|Karo]] on the other hand the evidence in the writings of missionaries and colonial administrators is relatively abundant. Information on the traditional forms of Batak religion is derived mainly from the writings of [[Germans|German]] and Dutch missionaries who became increasingly concerned with Batak beliefs towards the end of the 19th century.<ref>Sibeth, p. 64.</ref>\n\nVarious influences affected the Batak through their contact with Tamil and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] traders and settlers in southern Batakland, and the east and west coast near Barus and [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]], in particular the large [[Padang Lawas temple complex]] in Tapanuli. These contacts took place many centuries ago and it is impossible to reconstruct just how far the religious ideas of these foreigners were adopted and reworked by the Batak. It is suggested that the Batak adopted aspects of these religions, specifically Mahayana Buddhist, [[Shaivism|Shaivist]], and [[Tantra|Tantrist]] practices<ref name=tradebatak /> within their own customs.<ref>H. Parkin, ''The Extent and Areas of Indian/Hindu Influence on the Ideas and Development of Toba-Batak Religion and Its Implications for the Christianization of the Toba-Batak People of North Sumatra.''

Traditional religions are not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional religions are increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak religion are still practised alongside Christianity.\n\n===Creation myths===\n[[File:Batak Puppenspieler.jpg|thumb|right|Puppeteers of [[Toba Batak people]] with a [[Sigale Gale]] puppet, [[Sumatra]].]]\n\nThere are many different versions in circulation. These were formerly passed down through oral tradition but have now been written down in the local languages. There are also large collections of Batak tales collected by European scholars since the mid-19th century and recorded in European languages, mostly Dutch.<ref>Much of this section is derived from Stohr, W. & Zoeta Jadider, P. (1965) \"Die Religionen Indonesiens.\" ''Die Religionen der Menschheit,'' vol. 5:1, Stuttgart.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld [[dragon]] ''Naga Padoha''. The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. All the surviving [[myths]] record that at the beginning of creation stands the god ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon''. His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the \"beginning of becoming\". The creation of everything that exists can be traced back to him. ''Mula Jadi'' lives in the upper world which is usually thought of as divided into seven levels. His three sons, ''Batara Guru'', ''Mangalabulan'' and ''Soripada'' were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by ''Mula Jadi''. Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to ''Mula Jadi'' in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. ''Mula Jadi'' begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of ''Mula Jadi'' there is another god, ''Asiasi'', whose place and function in the world of the gods remains largely unclear. There is some evidence that ''Asiasi'' can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods.\n\nThe ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon ''Naga Padoha''. He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of ''Mula Jadi''. As ruler of the underworld ''Naga Padoha'' also has an important function in the creation of the earth.\n\nWhat all the six gods so far mentioned have in common is that they play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive any sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of [[sacrifice]] are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.<ref>Leertouwer, L.\n(1977) ''Her beeld van de ziel bij drie Sumatraanse votken.'' Doctoral dissertation in Theology. Groningen, p. 177.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of ''Batara Guru'', ''Sideak Parujar'', who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband,\nthe lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world which at that time was still just a watery waste. She refuses to go back but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion ''Mula Jadi'' sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. ''Sideak Parudjar'' was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of ''Naga Padoha'', the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and threatened to be utterly destroyed. With the help of ''Mula Jadi'' and by her own cunning ''Sideak Parudjar'' was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of ''Naga Padoha'' up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever ''Naga Padoha'' twists in the fetters an earthquake occurs.\n\nAfter the lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, ''Sideak Parujar'' marries him. ''Sideak Parujar'' becomes the mother of twins of different sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their [[incestuous]] union.\nThe couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of [[Lake Toba]], and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, ''Si Raja Batak'' is one of their grandchildren.<ref>Sibeth, p. 65.</ref>\n\n===The ''tendi'' cult===\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Carved bone calendar and almanac.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A 20th century carved bone of a [[Porhalaan]] Batak calendar.]]\nIn the religious world of the Toba and Karo Batak the gods and the creation of mankind are far less significant than the complex concepts connected with the ''tendi'' (Karo) or ''tondi'' (Toba) and the ''begu''. Probably the most useful translations of these terms are \"life-soul\" and \"death-soul\". A person receives his \"life-soul\" (''tendi'') from ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon'' before he is born. The [[destiny]] of the individual ''tendi'' is decided by the ''tendi'' itself before birth. Various myths are woven around manner in which the ''tendi'' choose their destiny from ''Mula Jadi''. Warneck, a missionary and for a long time superintendent (''ephorus'') of the Batak Church, recorded two particularly expressive myths in his major work on Batak religion.<ref>Adapted from Warneck, J. (1977) ''Tcba-Batak: Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch.'' The Hague.</ref> What is significant is that the ''tendi'' themselves are responsible for their idiocy:\n\n:\"''Mula Jadi'' presents him with all kinds of things to choose from. If the ''tendi'' asks for ripe eggs, then the person whom he animates will be a poor fellow; if he asks for flowers, then he will live only a short time; if he asks for a hen, the person will be restless; rags indicate poverty; an old mat, lack of fame; a gold piece, wealth; plate, spear, medicine pot indicate that he will become a great chief or understand magic arts.\"\n\n:\"With ''Mula Jadi'' in the upper world is a mighty tree called ''Djambubarus''. ''Mula Jadi'' has written on all its leaves. On one leaf is written 'many children', on others 'wealth' or 'respect' and so on. 'Contemptible life', 'poverty', 'wretchedness' are also written on the leaves. All the possible different fates of the person are entered on the leaves. Every ''tendi'' that wishes to descend to the middle world must first ask ''Mula Jadi'' for one of the leaves. Whatever is written on the leaf chosen by him will be his destiny in the middle world.\"\n\nAmong the Karo and the Toba there are sometimes widely diverging versions of where the ''tendi'' dwells and how many ''tendi'' there are. According to the Toba a person has seven ''tendi''. The second ''tendi'' is found in the [[placenta]] and [[amniotic fluid]] of the new-born baby, and accordingly the afterbirth is given special attention after the birth of a child. It is usually buried under the house, is called ''saudara'' (brother) and is regarded as the person's guardian spirit. Similar ideas about the afterbirth are also found among the Karo, who also bury the placenta and amniotic fluid under the house and regard them as two guardian spirits (''kaka'' and ''agi'') who always remain close to the person.<ref>Westenberg CJ, (1982) ''Aanteekeningen omtrent de godsdienstige begrippen der Karo-Bataks.'' BK141:208-53</ref>\n\nAll Batak regard the loss of ''tendi'' as signifying a great danger for \"body and soul\". ''Tendi'' can be separated from their owners through inattentiveness, or as a result of black magic by a ''datu'' with evil intentions. In other words, the ''tendi'' is not tied to the body; it can also live for a time outside the body. The final loss of the ''tendi'' inevitably results in death. There are a variety of ideas about where exactly in the body the ''tendi'' dwells. It is present to a particularly high degree in certain parts of the body, especially the blood, the liver, the head and the heart. Sweat too is described as rich in ''tendi''. It is believed that illnesses are connected with the absence of ''tendi'', and the bringing back of the ''tendi'' is a main method of healing. The Karo, for instance, have gifts, called ''upah tendi'' (''upah'' = wage, payment, gift), which they give to their ''tendi'' so that their ''tendi'' stay with them. These gifts may consist of a knife, a gong, a particular piece of clothing, a water buffalo or a small holy place. The gifts are carefully cared for in order to keep the ''tendi'' satisfied.<ref>Kipp, RS,\n1974 \"Karo Batak Religion and Social Structure.\" ''Berita Kajian Sumatra''(Sumatra Research Bulletin), University of Hull 3,2:4-11.</ref>\n\n''Tendi'' love the sound of the ''surdam'' (a bamboo flute). If a ''tendi'' has abandoned the body of a patient, the playing of the ''surdam'' in the ''raleng tendi'' ritual can contribute to the ''tendi'' returning to the body of the sick person. It must be emphasized that only the ''datuk'' are in a position to interpret and influence people's ''tendi'' correctly. If their endeavors are unsuccessful, then clearly the ''tendi'' has chosen another destiny for itself.<ref>Sibeth, P. 87.</ref>\n\n===Death cult===\n[[File:Batak totem 09N9443.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Batak [[Totem pole]].]]\n\nAt death the ''tendi'' leaves the human body through the fontanelle and the \"death-soul\" (''begu'') is set free. It is thought that the ''tendi'' vanishes and after the death of any human being only the ''begu'' continues to exist. The Batak believe that the ''begu'' continue to live near their previous dwelling (in a village of the dead which is thought to be situated not far from the\ncemetery) and that they may contact their descendants. Bad dreams, particular misfortune and such like may be signs that the ''begu'' of an ancestor is not satisfied with the behavior of its descendants. Any individual can attempt to pacify an enraged ''begu'' by means of food and drink offerings and prayers. If this does not work, a ''datu'' or a ''guru'' must be called in.<ref>Kipp, 1974, p. 11.</ref> The ''begu'' are not immortal, since death also rules in the land of the dead: a ''begu'' dies seven times before it is changed into a straw and finally becomes earth.<ref>Sibeth, p. 69.</ref>\n\nThe Batak believe that three categories of ''begu'' exist.<ref>Westenberg, p. 221.</ref> The ''bicara guru'' are the ''begu'' of stillborn babies or of babies who have died before teething. It is possible to turn ''bicara guru'' into guardian spirits if misfortune has befallen the family of the child shortly after its death. With the help of a ''guru sibaso'', the ''bicara guru'' can be made the family's guardian spirit for which a shrine is provided and to which sacrifices are regularly made. Once a year the ''bicara guru'' is accorded a special feast, preceded by ritual hair washing.\n\nThe ''begu'' of members of the family who have had a sudden death (''mate sada-uari'') can also act as guardian spirits for the family. They include the victims of accidents, suicides, murder victims, or people struck by lightning. A shrine is built where they are venerated and where sacrifices are made. A third category consists of the ''begu'' of dead virgins (''tungkup''). Their graves, called ''bata-bata'' or ''ingan tungkup'', are maintained for a long time by their relatives.\n\n===Burial traditions===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een stenen sarcofaag in een Toba Batak dorp TMnr 60045329.jpg|thumb|left|A stone sarcophagus in a Toba Batak village.]]\n\nBatak [[burial]] traditions are very rich and complex. Immediately after death various ritual actions are performed to make the ''begu'' understand that from now on its world is separate from that of its kin. Symbolically this is done by reversing the mat on which the corpse is laid out so that the body lies with its head at the foot of the mat. Thumbs and toes respectively are tied together and the body is rubbed all over with [[camphor]] and its orifices stopped with [[camphor]], then it is wrapped in a white cotton cloth. During this ''perumah begu'' ceremony a ''guru sibaso'' declares to the ''begu'' of the deceased that it is definitely dead and must take leave of its relatives.\n\nWealthier families have their coffins (Karo: ''[[pelangkah]]'') made of the wood of the ''[[kemiri]]'' tree (''[[Aleurites moluccanus]]''), carved in the shape of a boat, its bow decorated with the carved head of a [[hornbill]], or a horse, or a [[mythical beast]] known as a [[Singa (mythology)|singa]]. The lid is then sealed with [[resin]] and the coffin may be placed in a special location near the family's house until a reburial ceremony can take place. Families that are not wealthy use simple wooden coffins or wrap the body in a straw mat.\n\nThe corpse is carried a few times round the house, usually by women, and then to the [[cemetery]] with musical accompaniment from the ''[[gondang]]'' orchestra and the continual firing of guns. At any crossroads the corpse is put down and eleven people go around it four times to confuse the ''begu''. It is hoped that the ''begu'' will then be unable to find its way back to the village. When the funeral procession arrives at the cemetery the grave is dug and the corpse laid in it, flat on its back. Care is taken that the head lies towards the village so that, in the unexpected event that the body should get up, he or she will not be looking in the direction of the village. The bodies of ''datuk'' and those who have died from lightning are buried sitting up with their hands tied together. The palms of the hand are tied together and [[betel]] placed between them.<ref>Kipp, 1974, p. 9</ref>\n\n===Reburial===\n[[File:Batak Tombs.JPG|right|thumb|Batak ''tugu'' on the island of [[Samosir]], Lake Toba, December 1984.]]\n\nThe burial tradition includes a reburial ceremony in which the bones of one's ancestors are reinterred several years after death. This secondary burial is known among the Toba Batak as ''mangongkal holi'', among the Karo as ''nurun-nurun''. In a ceremony lasting several days the bones of a particularly honored ancestor and those of his descendants are exhumed, cleaned, mourned and finally laid to rest again in a bone house known as a ''tugu'' or ''tambak'':\n:\"On the morning of the first day of the festival the graves in the cemetery are opened and the bones of the ancestors that are still there are removed. The unearthing of the skulls is presented as especially moving. The bones are collected in baskets lined with white cloth and then ritually cleaned by the women using the juice of various [[citrus]] fruits. The exhumation and cleaning of the bones is accompanied by the singing of laments. The bones are kept in the baskets in the ''tugu'' until the next morning, when the remains are wrapped in traditional cloths (''[[ulos]]'') and transferred from the baskets to small wooden coffins. After long speeches and a communal prayer the coffins are nailed down and placed in the chambers of the ''tugu''. A feast consisting of meat and rice follows and traditional dances are performed.<ref>Simon, A. (1982) \"Altreligiose und soziale Zeremonien der Batak.\" ''ZjE'' 107:177-206.</ref>\"\n\nIn ancient times these [[sarcophagi]] were carved from stone or constructed from wood and later brick. Nowadays they are made of cement or concrete. Large and very ornate ''tugu'' can be seen around Lake Toba and on the island of [[Samosir]].\n\nOne motive for the reburial ceremony appears to be to raise the status of the ''begu'' of the deceased. Traditional Batak beliefs hold that the dead occupy a hierarchical status similar to the social position they held in life. This means that a rich and powerful individual remains influential after death, and this status can be elevated if the family holds a reburial ceremony. A rich descendant can advance a ''begu'' to the status of a ''sumangot'' by means of a great ceremony and a ''horja'' feast which can last up to seven days. In antiquity a vast number of pigs, cattle or even buffalo were slaughtered at such festivals, and the ''gondang'' orchestra provided an accompaniment.\n\nThe next level up from the ''sumangot'' is the ''sombaon'', who are the spirits of important ancestors who lived ten to twelve generations ago. To raise a ''sumangot'' to a ''sombaon'' requires another great festival, a ''santi rea'', often lasting several months, during which the inhabitants of the whole district come together. These powerful ancestor spirits offer protection and good fortune to their descendants, but the ceremony also serves to establish new [[kinship]] groups descended from the ancestor thus honored.<ref>Stohr, p. 197.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Batak medicine===\n[[File:Mme Sitorus Dukun.jpg|thumb|left|Madame Sitorus, a well-known Toba ''guru sibaso'' who practiced in [[:id:Laguboti|Laguboti]] in 1984. She is consulting a paperback edition of the [[New Testament]] in lieu of a ''[[pustaha]]''. On the shelf are components of herbal remedies. In front of her is a [[kaffir lime]] in a bowl of water, a form of divination used to locate lost items or people.]]\n\nIn traditional Batak society ''datuk'' (animist priests) as well as ''[[gurus]]'' practiced [[traditional medicine]], although the former were exclusively male. Both professions were attributed with supernatural powers and the ability to predict the future. Treatments and healing rituals bear some resemblance to those practiced by [[dukun]]s in other parts of Indonesia. Following the Christianization of the Toba and Karo Batak in the late 19th century, missionaries discouraged traditional healing and divination and they became largely [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] activities.<ref>Sibeth, p. 98</ref>\n\nBoth ''datu'' and ''guru'' healers also practiced [[divination]] by consulting a ''[[pustaha]]'', a handwritten book made of wood and bark in which were inscribed recipes for healing remedies, incantations and songs, predictive calendars, and other notes on magic, healing and divination written in ''poda,'' an archaic [[Batak script|Batak shorthand]]. According to Winkler,<ref>J. Winkler, ''Die Toba-Batak auf Sumatra in gesunden und kranken Tagen,'' [The Toba Bataks of Sumatra in Sickness and in Health] (1925), pp. 79-224.</ref> there were three categories of ''[[Pustaha]]'' based on the purpose of their usage:\n:1. '''Protective Magic''', which includes diagnosis, therapy, medicinal mixes which have magical properties, such as [[amulets]], ''parmanisan'' (love charms), etc.\n:2. '''Destructive Magic''', which encompasses the art of making poison, the art of controlling or utilizing the power of certain spirits, calling the ''pangulubalang'', and the art of making ''dorma'' (magical formulas for causing a person to fall in love).\n:3. '''Divination''', which involves [[oracles]] (words of the gods), the wishes of the spirits, commands from the gods and from the spirits of the ancestors, and an [[almanac]] or calendrical system (''porhalaan''), and [[astrology]] to determine auspicious days and months to accomplish certain actions or goals.<ref name=\"V7177\">Voorma, pp. 71-77.</ref>\n\nThe ''datu'' or ''guru'' consulted the ''[[pustaha]]'' when presented with a difficult problem, and in time this became in itself a ritual. When missionaries began to discourage traditional healing and [[augury]] the [[Bible]] may have been adopted by some ''gurus'' in place of the ''[[pustaha]]''.<ref name=\"V7177\"/>\n\nAmong the most important healing ceremonies performed in Toba and Karo communities is that of recalling the ''jinujung,'' or personal guardian spirit. According to Toba and Karo [[cosmology]], each person receives a ''jinujung'' in childhood or at [[puberty]] and they keep it for life unless they are unfortunate enough to lose it, in which case they will fall ill. In order to call the ''jinujung'' back, a female ''guru'' (''guru sibaso'' in Karo) goes into a [[trance]] and  the ''jinujung'' will enter into her and speak through her mouth. At this time the sick person or the family can negotiate ritual payment to entice it to return.<ref>Sibeth, p. 68.</ref>\n\nTraditional healers are not powerful enough to cure illness due to the loss of a person's ''tendi'' (this falls under the jurisdiction of the ''datuk''), however they do play a role in communicating with ''begu'' and influencing their behavior.<ref>Sibeth, p. 67.</ref>\n\n===Malim===\n[[File:Book of Wizards Batak Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|A magic book or ''[[Pustaha]]'' used by ''datu'' or ''guru'' (wizards) of the [[Toba Batak people]], [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] as seen in the [[State Museum of Ethnology]], [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].]]\n{{Main|Parmalim}}\n{{Other uses|Pemena}}\nMalim is the modern form of the Batak Toba religion.

Over time Mandailing Islam, has been brought closer to the predominant Southeastern [[Shafi`i]] school of Islam as a result of Mandailing discourse with other Islamic practitioners and the practice of [[hajj]], although traditional elements remain, such as dividing inheritance among all children, a Mandailing rather than Islamic practice. Islam caused the decline in importance of marga, with many Mandailing abandoning their marga in favour of Muslim names, much less so among the Angkola to their North.\n\nThe advent of Islam also caused the relegation of the datuk to a medicine man, with traditional rice-planting ceremonies and other such remnants of traditional culture deemed incompatible with Islam. The 'pasusur begu', a ceremony invoking ancestors to aid the community, was also suppressed. Other aspects of adat were however tolerated, with the Mandailing Islamic ideology placing adat on the same level as Islamic law, as in contrast with the Minang practice of placing Islamic law above adat. In more recent times, learned Islamic scholars (ulama) studying abroad, have suggested that many traditional Mandailing practices, such as the 'Raja' hereditary leaders, were in conflict with Islam, being indicative of 'pele begu'. The Islamist ulama were in conflict for authority with the Namora-Natora, the traditional village legal practitioners, who were influenced by adat as much as Islam.\n\nChristian missionaries had been active among the northern Mandailing from 1834 onwards, but their progress was restricted by the Dutch government, who feared conflict between newly converted Christians and Muslims. In addition, the lingua franca of the government was Malay, associated with Muslims, as were government civil servants, creating the perception that Islam was the religion of modernity and progress. Missionaries determined that resistance among the Muslim Mandailing to Christianity was strong, and the missionaries abandoned them as 'unreachable people', moving north to evangelize the Toba.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, nearly all Mandailing and Angkola were Muslims. Despite this, the Dutch administration marked them as part of the Bataklanden, and therefore heathen or Christian. This perception was an inaccurate one, and many Mandailing strongly rejected the 'Batak' label.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html |title=The Mandailings in their own terms |website=Mandailing.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725172658/http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html |archive-date=2011-07-25 |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-10-09}}</ref> Abdullah Lubis, writing in the 1920s, claimed that while the Mandailing followed Batak marga practice, they had never followed the Batak religion, and that the Mandailing people pre-dated the Toba, having acquired marga directly from 'Hindu' visitors. In the Dutch census, the Mandailing objected strongly to being listed in the census as 'Batak Mandailing'. Mandailing in Malaysia (who migrated in the years following the Padri war), had no such objection to their being deemed 'Malays', and indeed Malaysian Mandailing retain little of their distinct identity, partly due to a British colonial policy of rice-land ownership restrictions for all but Malay-speaking Muslims, and the disapproval of 'Batak' Muslim practices by the existing Malay Muslim population.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:AHNasution1951.jpg|thumb|upright|right|150px|[[Abdul Haris Nasution]], General of the 2) Fransiska Sinaga, the Sales Executive in Informal Batam branch [[Indonesian Army]]]]\n{{Main|List of Batak people}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n*[[Batak architecture]]\n*[[Batak cuisine]]\n*[[Malays in Singapore#The Batak|Batak in Singapore]]\n*[[Marga (Batak)]]\n*[[Museum Huta Balon Simanindo]]\n*[[Proto-Malay]]\n*[[Tunggal panaluan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Batak}}\n{{NIE Poster|Battaks}}\n*[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1485-16 The family tree of the Batak languages, from Ethnologue.com]\n*[http://www.silaban.net/category/artikel-batak/ Many articles about Batak in Indonesian language, from Silaban Brotherhood]\n*[http://www.technocraft.org/tuansihubil/tarombo.htm Tarombo Tuan Sihubil.

The last Batak king who fought valiantly against Dutch imperialists until 1905 was an Indonesian Shaivite king. The Batak may be mentioned in [[Zhao Rugua]]'s 13th-century ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi|Description of the Barbarous Peoples]]'' (''Zhu Fan Zhi'' {{lang|zh|\u8af8\u8543\u5fd7}}), which refers to a 'Ba-ta' dependency of [[Srivijaya]]. The ''[[Suma Oriental]]'', of the 15th century, also refers to the kingdom of Bata, bounded by [[Pasai]] and the [[Sultanate of Deli|Aru kingdom]].\n\nBased on this evidence, the Batak may have been involved in procuring important commodities for trade with [[China]], perhaps from the 8th or 9th centuries and continuing for the next thousand years, with Batak men carrying the products on their backs for sale at ports.\n\nIt has been suggested that the important port of [[Barus]] in [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]] was populated by Batak people.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Malay Frontier: Unity and Duality in a Sumatran Kingdom |last=Drakard |first=Jane |publisher=SEAP Publications |year=1990 |isbn=08-772-7706-0}}</ref> A [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscription has been found in Barus which is dated to 1088, while contact with Chinese and Tamil traders took place at [[Kota Cina]], a trading town located in what is now northern [[Medan]] that was established in the 11th century, and comprising 10,000 people by the 12th century. Tamil remains have been found on key trade routes to the Batak lands.\n\nThese trading opportunities may have caused migration of Batak from Pakpak and Toba to the present-day Karo and Simalungun 'frontier' lands, where they were exposed to greater influence from visiting Tamil traders, while the migration of Batak to the Angkola-Mandailing lands may have been prompted by 8th-century Srivijayan demand for [[camphor]].\n\nThe [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo ''marga'' or tribe]] ''Sembiring'' \"black one\" is believed to originate from their ties with Tamil traders, with specific Sembiring sub-marga, namely Brahmana, Colia, Pandia, Depari, Meliala, Muham, Pelawi, and Tekan all of Indian origin. Tamil influence on Karo religious practices are also noted, with the pekualuh secondary cremation ritual being specific to the Karo and Dairi people. Moreover the Pustaka Kembaren, an origin story of the Sembiring Kembaren suggests linkages with [[Pagarruyung]] in [[Minangkabau Highlands]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Mengenal suku Karo |last=Bangun |first=Roberto |date=2006 |publisher=Yayasan Pendidikan Bangun}}</ref> \n\nFrom the 16th century onward, [[Aceh]] increased the production of [[Black pepper|pepper]], an important export commodity, in exchange for rice, which grew well in the Batak wetlands. Batak people in different areas cultivated either ''sawah'' (wet rice fields) or ''ladang'' (dry rice), and the Toba Batak, most expert in agriculture, must have migrated to meet demand in new areas. The increasing importance of rice had religious significance, which increased the power of the Batak high priests, who had responsibility for ensuring agricultural success.\n\n==Language==\n[[File:Image from page 129 of \"Handbook to the ethnographical collections\" (1910) (14783317945).jpg|thumb|right|Bark book with charms written in native [[Batak script]], 1910.]]\n{{main|Batak languages}}\n{{see also|Batak script}}\nThe Batak speak a variety of closely related languages, all members of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]]. There are two major branches, a northern branch comprising the [[Batak Dairi language|Pakpak-Dairi]], [[Batak Alas-Kluet language|Alas-Kluet]] and [[Batak Karo language|Karo]] languages, which are similar to each other, and a distinct southern branch, comprising three mutually intelligible dialects: [[Batak Toba language|Toba]], [[Batak Angkola language|Angkola]] and [[Batak Mandailing language|Mandailing]]. [[Batak Simalungun language|Simalungun]] is an early offspring of the southern branch. Some Simalungun dialects can be understood by speakers of Batak Karo, whereas other dialects of Simalungun can be understood by speakers of Toba. This is due to the existence of a linguistic continuum that often blurs the lines between the Batak dialects. Batak dialect still influences the dialects in [[Medan]] city today.\n\nThe Batak possess their own script known as the [[Batak script|''Surat Batak'']].<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0834803496 Kozok, Uli, \"Bark, Bones and Bamboo: Batak traditions of Sumatra,\" in ''Illuminations: The Writing Traditions of Indonesia,'' Ann Kumar and John McGlynn, eds., Lontar and Weatherhill, Jakarta (1237).]</ref> The writing has chiefly ceremonial importance within traditional religious ceremonies, and was subject to little change for this reason. It is likely that the Batak people originally received their writing system from southern Sumatra.\n\n==Profession==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Toba Batak prauw met houtsnijwerk op de voorsteven TMnr 60011149.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional boat (circa 1870), photograph by [[Kristen Feilberg]].]]\nThe traditional occupation of the Batak was [[agriculture]], hunting and farming. The great lake of [[Lake Toba|Toba]] provided vast opportunity for freshwater aquaculture since ancient times. Interior rural Batak communities relied heavily on rice farming, horticulture and other plant and commercial crops, and to some extent, acquiring forest products, such as hard wood, plant resin, and wild animals. \n\nThe port of [[Barus]] on the western coast of Batak lands has become famous as the source of ''kapur barus'' ([[camphor]]). In ancient times, Batak warriors were often recruited by neighboring Malay courts as mercenaries. In the colonial era, the Dutch introduced commercial cash crops, such as coffee, ''sawit'' [[palm oil]], and [[rubber]], converting some parts of the Batak land into plantations.\n\nThroughout the history of modern Indonesia, the Batak community has been a significant contributor. Batak people have filled a wide range of occupations, from running modest tire service workshops to serving as state ministers. The modern Batak have gravitated towards professions such as attorneys, bus and taxi drivers, mechanics, engineers, singers and musicians, writers and journalists, teachers, economists, scientists, and military officers.\n\nEven though the Batak are a minority among the Indonesian population (3.58 %; only 8-9 million Batak people out of 236 million according 2010's census), there have been a number of notable Batak that have risen to distinguished positions and careers.

National heroes such as [[Sisingamangaraja XII]], two Indonesian prime ministers ([[Amir Sjarifuddin|Amir Syarifuddin Harahap]] and [[Burhanuddin Harahap]]), speakers of the parliament ([[Zainul Arifin|Zainul Arifin Pohan]]), one vice president ([[Adam Malik|Adam Malik Batubara]]), governor of the central bank ([[Darmin Nasution]]), one attorney general ([[Marsillam Simanjuntak]]), and many cabinet ministers (such as [[Malam Sambat Kaban|M.S. Kaban]], [[Tifatul Sembiring]], [[Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan]]), as well as leading military generals and officers ([[Abdul Harris Nasution]], [[T. B.

His description parallels that of Marsden in some important respects, however von Kessel states that cannibalism was regarded by the Batak as a judicial act and its application was restricted to very narrowly defined infringements of the law including theft, [[adultery]], spying or treason. Salt, red pepper and lemons had to be provided by the relatives of the victim as a sign that they accepted the [[verdict]] of the community and were not thinking of [[revenge]].<ref>Von Kessel, O., \"Erinnerungen an Sumatra,\" ''Das Ausland,'' Stuttgart (1854) 27:905-08.</ref>\n\n[[Ida Laura Pfeiffer]] visited the Batak in August 1852 and although she did not observe any cannibalism, she was told that: \n:\"[[Prisoners of war]] are tied to a tree and beheaded at once; but the blood is carefully preserved for drinking, and sometimes made into a kind of pudding with boiled rice.

For those who do not know the lineage will be considered as a strayed (''nalilu'') Batak. Batak people are required to know their lineage or at least the ancestors of which the family name ([[Marga (Batak)]]) and the related clans (''dongan tubu'') came from.

Information about the old religious ideas of the [[Mandailing]] and Angkola in southern Batakland is incomplete, and  very little is known about the religion of the [[Pakpak people|Pakpak]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]] Batak. For the [[Toba people|Toba]] and [[Karo people|Karo]] on the other hand the evidence in the writings of missionaries and colonial administrators is relatively abundant.

These contacts took place many centuries ago and it is impossible to reconstruct just how far the religious ideas of these foreigners were adopted and reworked by the Batak. It is suggested that the Batak adopted aspects of these religions, specifically Mahayana Buddhist, [[Shaivism|Shaivist]], and [[Tantra|Tantrist]] practices<ref name=tradebatak /> within their own customs.<ref>H. Parkin, ''The Extent and Areas of Indian/Hindu Influence on the Ideas and Development of Toba-Batak Religion and Its Implications for the Christianization of the Toba-Batak People of North Sumatra.''

Traditional religions are not officially recognised, and accordingly traditional religions are increasingly marginalised, although aspects of the traditional Batak religion are still practised alongside Christianity.\n\n===Creation myths===\n[[File:Batak Puppenspieler.jpg|thumb|right|Puppeteers of [[Toba Batak people]] with a [[Sigale Gale]] puppet, [[Sumatra]].]]\n\nThere are many different versions in circulation. These were formerly passed down through oral tradition but have now been written down in the local languages. There are also large collections of Batak tales collected by European scholars since the mid-19th century and recorded in European languages, mostly Dutch.<ref>Much of this section is derived from Stohr, W. & Zoeta Jadider, P. (1965) \"Die Religionen Indonesiens.\" ''Die Religionen der Menschheit,'' vol. 5:1, Stuttgart.</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of time there was only the sky with a great sea beneath it. In the sky lived the gods and the sea was the home of a mighty underworld [[dragon]] ''Naga Padoha''. The earth did not yet exist and human beings, too, were as yet unknown. All the surviving [[myths]] record that at the beginning of creation stands the god ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon''. His origin remains uncertain. A rough translation of the name is the \"beginning of becoming\". The creation of everything that exists can be traced back to him. ''Mula Jadi'' lives in the upper world which is usually thought of as divided into seven levels. His three sons, ''Batara Guru'', ''Mangalabulan'' and ''Soripada'' were born from eggs laid by a hen fertilized by ''Mula Jadi''. Two swallows act as messengers and helpers to ''Mula Jadi'' in his act of creation. Their functions vary in the different versions. ''Mula Jadi'' begets three daughters whom he gives as wives for his three sons. Mankind is the result of the union of the three couples. Besides the three sons of ''Mula Jadi'' there is another god, ''Asiasi'', whose place and function in the world of the gods remains largely unclear. There is some evidence that ''Asiasi'' can be seen as the balance and unity of the trinity of gods.\n\nThe ruler of the underworld, i. e. the primeval sea, is the serpent-dragon ''Naga Padoha''. He too existed before the beginning and seems to be the opponent of ''Mula Jadi''. As ruler of the underworld ''Naga Padoha'' also has an important function in the creation of the earth.\n\nWhat all the six gods so far mentioned have in common is that they play a minor role in ritual. They do not receive any sacrificial offerings from the faithful and no places of [[sacrifice]] are built for them. They are merely called on in prayers for help and assistance.<ref>Leertouwer, L.\n(1977) ''Her beeld van de ziel bij drie Sumatraanse votken.'' Doctoral dissertation in Theology. Groningen, p. 177.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the earth and of mankind is connected mainly with the daughter of ''Batara Guru'', ''Sideak Parujar'', who is the actual creator of the earth. She flees from her intended husband,\nthe lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', and lets herself down on a spun thread from the sky to the middle world which at that time was still just a watery waste. She refuses to go back but feels very unhappy. Out of compassion ''Mula Jadi'' sends his granddaughter a handful of earth so that she can find somewhere to live. ''Sideak Parudjar'' was ordered to spread out this earth and thus the earth became broad and long. But the goddess was not able to enjoy her rest for long. The earth had been spread out on the head of ''Naga Padoha'', the dragon of the underworld who lived in the water. He groaned under the weight and attempted to get rid of it by rolling around. The earth was softened by water and threatened to be utterly destroyed. With the help of ''Mula Jadi'' and by her own cunning ''Sideak Parudjar'' was able to overcome the dragon. She thrust a sword into the body of ''Naga Padoha'' up to the hilt and laid him in an iron block. Whenever ''Naga Padoha'' twists in the fetters an earthquake occurs.\n\nAfter the lizard-shaped son of ''Mangalabulan'', the husband the gods intended for her, had taken another name and another form, ''Sideak Parujar'' marries him. ''Sideak Parujar'' becomes the mother of twins of different sexes. When the two have grown up their divine parents return to the upper world leaving the couple behind on the earth. Mankind is the result of their [[incestuous]] union.\nThe couple settle on Pusuk Buhit, a volcano on the western shore of [[Lake Toba]], and found the village of Si Anjur Mulamula. The mythological ancestor of the Batak, ''Si Raja Batak'' is one of their grandchildren.<ref>Sibeth, p. 65.</ref>\n\n===The ''tendi'' cult===\n[[File:The Childrens Museum of Indianapolis - Carved bone calendar and almanac.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A 20th century carved bone of a [[Porhalaan]] Batak calendar.]]\nIn the religious world of the Toba and Karo Batak the gods and the creation of mankind are far less significant than the complex concepts connected with the ''tendi'' (Karo) or ''tondi'' (Toba) and the ''begu''. Probably the most useful translations of these terms are \"life-soul\" and \"death-soul\". A person receives his \"life-soul\" (''tendi'') from ''Mula Jadi Na Bolon'' before he is born. The [[destiny]] of the individual ''tendi'' is decided by the ''tendi'' itself before birth. Various myths are woven around manner in which the ''tendi'' choose their destiny from ''Mula Jadi''. Warneck, a missionary and for a long time superintendent (''ephorus'') of the Batak Church, recorded two particularly expressive myths in his major work on Batak religion.<ref>Adapted from Warneck, J. (1977) ''Tcba-Batak: Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch.'' The Hague.</ref> What is significant is that the ''tendi'' themselves are responsible for their idiocy:\n\n:\"''Mula Jadi'' presents him with all kinds of things to choose from. If the ''tendi'' asks for ripe eggs, then the person whom he animates will be a poor fellow; if he asks for flowers, then he will live only a short time; if he asks for a hen, the person will be restless; rags indicate poverty; an old mat, lack of fame; a gold piece, wealth; plate, spear, medicine pot indicate that he will become a great chief or understand magic arts.\"\n\n:\"With ''Mula Jadi'' in the upper world is a mighty tree called ''Djambubarus''. ''Mula Jadi'' has written on all its leaves. On one leaf is written 'many children', on others 'wealth' or 'respect' and so on. 'Contemptible life', 'poverty', 'wretchedness' are also written on the leaves. All the possible different fates of the person are entered on the leaves. Every ''tendi'' that wishes to descend to the middle world must first ask ''Mula Jadi'' for one of the leaves. Whatever is written on the leaf chosen by him will be his destiny in the middle world.\"\n\nAmong the Karo and the Toba there are sometimes widely diverging versions of where the ''tendi'' dwells and how many ''tendi'' there are. According to the Toba a person has seven ''tendi''. The second ''tendi'' is found in the [[placenta]] and [[amniotic fluid]] of the new-born baby, and accordingly the afterbirth is given special attention after the birth of a child. It is usually buried under the house, is called ''saudara'' (brother) and is regarded as the person's guardian spirit. Similar ideas about the afterbirth are also found among the Karo, who also bury the placenta and amniotic fluid under the house and regard them as two guardian spirits (''kaka'' and ''agi'') who always remain close to the person.<ref>Westenberg CJ, (1982) ''Aanteekeningen omtrent de godsdienstige begrippen der Karo-Bataks.'' BK141:208-53</ref>\n\nAll Batak regard the loss of ''tendi'' as signifying a great danger for \"body and soul\". ''Tendi'' can be separated from their owners through inattentiveness, or as a result of black magic by a ''datu'' with evil intentions. In other words, the ''tendi'' is not tied to the body; it can also live for a time outside the body. The final loss of the ''tendi'' inevitably results in death. There are a variety of ideas about where exactly in the body the ''tendi'' dwells. It is present to a particularly high degree in certain parts of the body, especially the blood, the liver, the head and the heart. Sweat too is described as rich in ''tendi''. It is believed that illnesses are connected with the absence of ''tendi'', and the bringing back of the ''tendi'' is a main method of healing. The Karo, for instance, have gifts, called ''upah tendi'' (''upah'' = wage, payment, gift), which they give to their ''tendi'' so that their ''tendi'' stay with them. These gifts may consist of a knife, a gong, a particular piece of clothing, a water buffalo or a small holy place. The gifts are carefully cared for in order to keep the ''tendi'' satisfied.<ref>Kipp, RS,\n1974 \"Karo Batak Religion and Social Structure.\" ''Berita Kajian Sumatra''(Sumatra Research Bulletin), University of Hull 3,2:4-11.</ref>\n\n''Tendi'' love the sound of the ''surdam'' (a bamboo flute). If a ''tendi'' has abandoned the body of a patient, the playing of the ''surdam'' in the ''raleng tendi'' ritual can contribute to the ''tendi'' returning to the body of the sick person. It must be emphasized that only the ''datuk'' are in a position to interpret and influence people's ''tendi'' correctly. If their endeavors are unsuccessful, then clearly the ''tendi'' has chosen another destiny for itself.<ref>Sibeth, P. 87.</ref>\n\n===Death cult===\n[[File:Batak totem 09N9443.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Batak [[Totem pole]].]]\n\nAt death the ''tendi'' leaves the human body through the fontanelle and the \"death-soul\" (''begu'') is set free. It is thought that the ''tendi'' vanishes and after the death of any human being only the ''begu'' continues to exist. The Batak believe that the ''begu'' continue to live near their previous dwelling (in a village of the dead which is thought to be situated not far from the\ncemetery) and that they may contact their descendants. Bad dreams, particular misfortune and such like may be signs that the ''begu'' of an ancestor is not satisfied with the behavior of its descendants. Any individual can attempt to pacify an enraged ''begu'' by means of food and drink offerings and prayers. If this does not work, a ''datu'' or a ''guru'' must be called in.<ref>Kipp, 1974, p. 11.</ref> The ''begu'' are not immortal, since death also rules in the land of the dead: a ''begu'' dies seven times before it is changed into a straw and finally becomes earth.<ref>Sibeth, p. 69.</ref>\n\nThe Batak believe that three categories of ''begu'' exist.<ref>Westenberg, p. 221.</ref> The ''bicara guru'' are the ''begu'' of stillborn babies or of babies who have died before teething. It is possible to turn ''bicara guru'' into guardian spirits if misfortune has befallen the family of the child shortly after its death. With the help of a ''guru sibaso'', the ''bicara guru'' can be made the family's guardian spirit for which a shrine is provided and to which sacrifices are regularly made. Once a year the ''bicara guru'' is accorded a special feast, preceded by ritual hair washing.\n\nThe ''begu'' of members of the family who have had a sudden death (''mate sada-uari'') can also act as guardian spirits for the family. They include the victims of accidents, suicides, murder victims, or people struck by lightning. A shrine is built where they are venerated and where sacrifices are made. A third category consists of the ''begu'' of dead virgins (''tungkup''). Their graves, called ''bata-bata'' or ''ingan tungkup'', are maintained for a long time by their relatives.\n\n===Burial traditions===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een stenen sarcofaag in een Toba Batak dorp TMnr 60045329.jpg|thumb|left|A stone sarcophagus in a Toba Batak village.]]\n\nBatak [[burial]] traditions are very rich and complex. Immediately after death various ritual actions are performed to make the ''begu'' understand that from now on its world is separate from that of its kin. Symbolically this is done by reversing the mat on which the corpse is laid out so that the body lies with its head at the foot of the mat. Thumbs and toes respectively are tied together and the body is rubbed all over with [[camphor]] and its orifices stopped with [[camphor]], then it is wrapped in a white cotton cloth. During this ''perumah begu'' ceremony a ''guru sibaso'' declares to the ''begu'' of the deceased that it is definitely dead and must take leave of its relatives.\n\nWealthier families have their coffins (Karo: ''[[pelangkah]]'') made of the wood of the ''[[kemiri]]'' tree (''[[Aleurites moluccanus]]''), carved in the shape of a boat, its bow decorated with the carved head of a [[hornbill]], or a horse, or a [[mythical beast]] known as a [[Singa (mythology)|singa]]. The lid is then sealed with [[resin]] and the coffin may be placed in a special location near the family's house until a reburial ceremony can take place. Families that are not wealthy use simple wooden coffins or wrap the body in a straw mat.\n\nThe corpse is carried a few times round the house, usually by women, and then to the [[cemetery]] with musical accompaniment from the ''[[gondang]]'' orchestra and the continual firing of guns. At any crossroads the corpse is put down and eleven people go around it four times to confuse the ''begu''. It is hoped that the ''begu'' will then be unable to find its way back to the village. When the funeral procession arrives at the cemetery the grave is dug and the corpse laid in it, flat on its back. Care is taken that the head lies towards the village so that, in the unexpected event that the body should get up, he or she will not be looking in the direction of the village. The bodies of ''datuk'' and those who have died from lightning are buried sitting up with their hands tied together. The palms of the hand are tied together and [[betel]] placed between them.<ref>Kipp, 1974, p. 9</ref>\n\n===Reburial===\n[[File:Batak Tombs.JPG|right|thumb|Batak ''tugu'' on the island of [[Samosir]], Lake Toba, December 1984.]]\n\nThe burial tradition includes a reburial ceremony in which the bones of one's ancestors are reinterred several years after death. This secondary burial is known among the Toba Batak as ''mangongkal holi'', among the Karo as ''nurun-nurun''. In a ceremony lasting several days the bones of a particularly honored ancestor and those of his descendants are exhumed, cleaned, mourned and finally laid to rest again in a bone house known as a ''tugu'' or ''tambak'':\n:\"On the morning of the first day of the festival the graves in the cemetery are opened and the bones of the ancestors that are still there are removed. The unearthing of the skulls is presented as especially moving. The bones are collected in baskets lined with white cloth and then ritually cleaned by the women using the juice of various [[citrus]] fruits. The exhumation and cleaning of the bones is accompanied by the singing of laments. The bones are kept in the baskets in the ''tugu'' until the next morning, when the remains are wrapped in traditional cloths (''[[ulos]]'') and transferred from the baskets to small wooden coffins. After long speeches and a communal prayer the coffins are nailed down and placed in the chambers of the ''tugu''. A feast consisting of meat and rice follows and traditional dances are performed.<ref>Simon, A. (1982) \"Altreligiose und soziale Zeremonien der Batak.\" ''ZjE'' 107:177-206.</ref>\"\n\nIn ancient times these [[sarcophagi]] were carved from stone or constructed from wood and later brick. Nowadays they are made of cement or concrete. Large and very ornate ''tugu'' can be seen around Lake Toba and on the island of [[Samosir]].\n\nOne motive for the reburial ceremony appears to be to raise the status of the ''begu'' of the deceased. Traditional Batak beliefs hold that the dead occupy a hierarchical status similar to the social position they held in life. This means that a rich and powerful individual remains influential after death, and this status can be elevated if the family holds a reburial ceremony. A rich descendant can advance a ''begu'' to the status of a ''sumangot'' by means of a great ceremony and a ''horja'' feast which can last up to seven days. In antiquity a vast number of pigs, cattle or even buffalo were slaughtered at such festivals, and the ''gondang'' orchestra provided an accompaniment.\n\nThe next level up from the ''sumangot'' is the ''sombaon'', who are the spirits of important ancestors who lived ten to twelve generations ago. To raise a ''sumangot'' to a ''sombaon'' requires another great festival, a ''santi rea'', often lasting several months, during which the inhabitants of the whole district come together. These powerful ancestor spirits offer protection and good fortune to their descendants, but the ceremony also serves to establish new [[kinship]] groups descended from the ancestor thus honored.<ref>Stohr, p. 197.</ref>\n\n===Traditional Batak medicine===\n[[File:Mme Sitorus Dukun.jpg|thumb|left|Madame Sitorus, a well-known Toba ''guru sibaso'' who practiced in [[:id:Laguboti|Laguboti]] in 1984.

In front of her is a [[kaffir lime]] in a bowl of water, a form of divination used to locate lost items or people.]]\n\nIn traditional Batak society ''datuk'' (animist priests) as well as ''[[gurus]]'' practiced [[traditional medicine]], although the former were exclusively male. Both professions were attributed with supernatural powers and the ability to predict the future. Treatments and healing rituals bear some resemblance to those practiced by [[dukun]]s in other parts of Indonesia. Following the Christianization of the Toba and Karo Batak in the late 19th century, missionaries discouraged traditional healing and divination and they became largely [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] activities.<ref>Sibeth, p. 98</ref>\n\nBoth ''datu'' and ''guru'' healers also practiced [[divination]] by consulting a ''[[pustaha]]'', a handwritten book made of wood and bark in which were inscribed recipes for healing remedies, incantations and songs, predictive calendars, and other notes on magic, healing and divination written in ''poda,'' an archaic [[Batak script|Batak shorthand]]. According to Winkler,<ref>J. Winkler, ''Die Toba-Batak auf Sumatra in gesunden und kranken Tagen,'' [The Toba Bataks of Sumatra in Sickness and in Health] (1925), pp. 79-224.</ref> there were three categories of ''[[Pustaha]]'' based on the purpose of their usage:\n:1. '''Protective Magic''', which includes diagnosis, therapy, medicinal mixes which have magical properties, such as [[amulets]], ''parmanisan'' (love charms), etc.\n:2. '''Destructive Magic''', which encompasses the art of making poison, the art of controlling or utilizing the power of certain spirits, calling the ''pangulubalang'', and the art of making ''dorma'' (magical formulas for causing a person to fall in love).\n:3. '''Divination''', which involves [[oracles]] (words of the gods), the wishes of the spirits, commands from the gods and from the spirits of the ancestors, and an [[almanac]] or calendrical system (''porhalaan''), and [[astrology]] to determine auspicious days and months to accomplish certain actions or goals.<ref name=\"V7177\">Voorma, pp. 71-77.</ref>\n\nThe ''datu'' or ''guru'' consulted the ''[[pustaha]]'' when presented with a difficult problem, and in time this became in itself a ritual. When missionaries began to discourage traditional healing and [[augury]] the [[Bible]] may have been adopted by some ''gurus'' in place of the ''[[pustaha]]''.<ref name=\"V7177\"/>\n\nAmong the most important healing ceremonies performed in Toba and Karo communities is that of recalling the ''jinujung,'' or personal guardian spirit. According to Toba and Karo [[cosmology]], each person receives a ''jinujung'' in childhood or at [[puberty]] and they keep it for life unless they are unfortunate enough to lose it, in which case they will fall ill. In order to call the ''jinujung'' back, a female ''guru'' (''guru sibaso'' in Karo) goes into a [[trance]] and  the ''jinujung'' will enter into her and speak through her mouth. At this time the sick person or the family can negotiate ritual payment to entice it to return.<ref>Sibeth, p. 68.</ref>\n\nTraditional healers are not powerful enough to cure illness due to the loss of a person's ''tendi'' (this falls under the jurisdiction of the ''datuk''), however they do play a role in communicating with ''begu'' and influencing their behavior.<ref>Sibeth, p. 67.</ref>\n\n===Malim===\n[[File:Book of Wizards Batak Indonesia.jpg|thumb|right|A magic book or ''[[Pustaha]]'' used by ''datu'' or ''guru'' (wizards) of the [[Toba Batak people]], [[North Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]] as seen in the [[State Museum of Ethnology]], [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]].]]\n{{Main|Parmalim}}\n{{Other uses|Pemena}}\nMalim is the modern form of the Batak Toba religion.

Over time Mandailing Islam, has been brought closer to the predominant Southeastern [[Shafi`i]] school of Islam as a result of Mandailing discourse with other Islamic practitioners and the practice of [[hajj]], although traditional elements remain, such as dividing inheritance among all children, a Mandailing rather than Islamic practice. Islam caused the decline in importance of marga, with many Mandailing abandoning their marga in favour of Muslim names, much less so among the Angkola to their North.\n\nThe advent of Islam also caused the relegation of the datuk to a medicine man, with traditional rice-planting ceremonies and other such remnants of traditional culture deemed incompatible with Islam. The 'pasusur begu', a ceremony invoking ancestors to aid the community, was also suppressed. Other aspects of adat were however tolerated, with the Mandailing Islamic ideology placing adat on the same level as Islamic law, as in contrast with the Minang practice of placing Islamic law above adat. In more recent times, learned Islamic scholars (ulama) studying abroad, have suggested that many traditional Mandailing practices, such as the 'Raja' hereditary leaders, were in conflict with Islam, being indicative of 'pele begu'. The Islamist ulama were in conflict for authority with the Namora-Natora, the traditional village legal practitioners, who were influenced by adat as much as Islam.\n\nChristian missionaries had been active among the northern Mandailing from 1834 onwards, but their progress was restricted by the Dutch government, who feared conflict between newly converted Christians and Muslims. In addition, the lingua franca of the government was Malay, associated with Muslims, as were government civil servants, creating the perception that Islam was the religion of modernity and progress. Missionaries determined that resistance among the Muslim Mandailing to Christianity was strong, and the missionaries abandoned them as 'unreachable people', moving north to evangelize the Toba.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, nearly all Mandailing and Angkola were Muslims. Despite this, the Dutch administration marked them as part of the Bataklanden, and therefore heathen or Christian. This perception was an inaccurate one, and many Mandailing strongly rejected the 'Batak' label.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html |title=The Mandailings in their own terms |website=Mandailing.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725172658/http://www.mandailing.org/Eng/abdlonmandid.html |archive-date=2011-07-25 |url-status=dead |access-date=2010-10-09}}</ref> Abdullah Lubis, writing in the 1920s, claimed that while the Mandailing followed Batak marga practice, they had never followed the Batak religion, and that the Mandailing people pre-dated the Toba, having acquired marga directly from 'Hindu' visitors. In the Dutch census, the Mandailing objected strongly to being listed in the census as 'Batak Mandailing'. Mandailing in Malaysia (who migrated in the years following the Padri war), had no such objection to their being deemed 'Malays', and indeed Malaysian Mandailing retain little of their distinct identity, partly due to a British colonial policy of rice-land ownership restrictions for all but Malay-speaking Muslims, and the disapproval of 'Batak' Muslim practices by the existing Malay Muslim population.\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:AHNasution1951.jpg|thumb|upright|right|150px|[[Abdul Haris Nasution]], General of the [[Indonesian Army]]]]\n{{Main|List of Batak people}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n*[[Batak architecture]]\n*[[Batak cuisine]]\n*[[Malays in Singapore#The Batak|Batak in Singapore]]\n*[[Marga (Batak)]]\n*[[Museum Huta Balon Simanindo]]\n*[[Proto-Malay]]\n*[[Tunggal panaluan]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Batak}}\n{{NIE Poster|Battaks}}\n*[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=1485-16 The family tree of the Batak languages, from Ethnologue.com]\n*[http://www.silaban.net/category/artikel-batak/ Many articles about Batak in Indonesian language, from Silaban Brotherhood]\n*[http://www.technocraft.org/tuansihubil/tarombo.htm Tarombo Tuan Sihubil.
