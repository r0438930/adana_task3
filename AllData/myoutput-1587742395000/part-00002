Directed by [[John Holmquist]] and written by [[Steve Callaghan]], the episode originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on February 14, 2010. In \"Extra Large Medium\", the show's main character, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], discovers that he has supposedly developed \"[[extrasensory perception]]\" (ESP) after his two sons, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], go missing during a family hike in the woods. Soon after being rescued, Chris decides to ask out a classmate at his school, named Ellen, who has [[Down syndrome]], and eventually takes her on a romantic date, which he goes on to regret. Meanwhile, Peter begins performing [[psychic readings]], but is eventually discovered to be faking his ability once he is approached by the town's police force.\n\nThe episode generated significant controversy. Former [[Governor of Alaska]] and 2008 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] nominee [[Sarah Palin]], who is referenced briefly in the episode as being the mother of Ellen, took offense to the episode's portrayal of Down syndrome, due to her son's diagnosis of the disorder. [[Andrea Fay Friedman]], who was also diagnosed with Down syndrome and portrayed the character of Ellen, publicly refuted Palin, instead supporting executive producer and series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who defended the episode, and was also supported by [[Bill Maher]], the host of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]].'' The episode got more [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]] during its original broadcast.<ref>{{cite web |title= Family Guy on Fox |url= http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2010/0226worst.asp |work= Worst TV Show of the Week |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate= 2010-02-26}}</ref>\n\nDespite the controversy, critical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised its storyline, numerous cultural references, and its portrayal of a person with Down syndrome. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.42 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jennifer Birmingham, [[Jackson Douglas]], Andrea Fay Friedman, [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Michele Lee]] and [[Nana Visitor]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, for the episode's song entitled \"Down Syndrome Girl\", at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]]. Both [[Walter Murphy]] and MacFarlane were recognized for their work on the music and lyrics. \"Extra Large Medium\" was released on [[DVD]], along with 11 other episodes from the season, on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the [[Griffin family]] decide to go for a hike in the local woods, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] get lost while chasing after a floating butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is at her wits' end, she decides to see a [[psychic medium]] who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois' psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. In defiance of Lois' assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] perform a [[cold reading]] on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own [[psychic reading]]s business and [[John Edward|performing in front of a live audience]]. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.\n\nMeanwhile, during the time when Chris and Stewie were lost in the woods, Chris promises to ask out Ellen, a classmate of his who has [[Down syndrome]]. After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number. During the date, however, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly goes wrong. Chris admits that he had bought into a [[Stereotyping|stereotype]] of people with Down syndrome being different, and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, in asking her out on a date, as he had promised to do.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Steve Callaghan by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|175px|alt=A man with brown hair, leans forward slightly to speak into a microphone.|[[Steve Callaghan]] wrote the episode.]]\nThe episode was directed by series regular [[John Holmquist]], and written by series show runner [[Steve Callaghan]] before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth production season]].

Stewie's reference to a newspaper headline saying \"Stewie Defeats Truman\" is a takeoff of the famous \"[[Dewey Defeats Truman]]\" headline, which erroneously predicted that [[Thomas E.

Meanwhile, Peter begins performing [[psychic readings]], but is eventually discovered to be faking his ability once he is approached by the town's police force.\n\nThe episode generated significant controversy. Former [[Governor of Alaska]] and 2008 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] nominee [[Sarah Palin]], who is referenced briefly in the episode as being the mother of Ellen, took offense to the episode's portrayal of Down syndrome, due to her son's diagnosis of the disorder. [[Andrea Fay Friedman]], who was also diagnosed with Down syndrome and portrayed the character of Ellen, publicly refuted Palin, instead supporting executive producer and series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who defended the episode, and was also supported by [[Bill Maher]], the host of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]].'' The episode got more [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]] during its original broadcast.<ref>{{cite web |title= Family Guy on Fox |url= http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2010/0226worst.asp |work= Worst TV Show of the Week |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate= 2010-02-26}}</ref>\n\nDespite the controversy, critical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised its storyline, numerous cultural references, and its portrayal of a person with Down syndrome. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.42 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jennifer Birmingham, [[Jackson Douglas]], Andrea Fay Friedman, [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Michele Lee]] and [[Nana Visitor]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, for the episode's song entitled \"Down Syndrome Girl\", at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]]. Both [[Walter Murphy]] and MacFarlane were recognized for their work on the music and lyrics. \"Extra Large Medium\" was released on [[DVD]], along with 11 other episodes from the season, on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the [[Griffin family]] decide to go for a hike in the local woods, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] get lost while chasing after a floating butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is at her wits' end, she decides to see a [[psychic medium]] who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois' psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. In defiance of Lois' assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] perform a [[cold reading]] on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own [[psychic reading]]s business and [[John Edward|performing in front of a live audience]]. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.\n\nMeanwhile, during the time when Chris and Stewie were lost in the woods, Chris promises to ask out Ellen, a classmate of his who has [[Down syndrome]]. After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number. During the date, however, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly goes wrong. Chris admits that he had bought into a [[Stereotyping|stereotype]] of people with Down syndrome being different, and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, in asking her out on a date, as he had promised to do.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Steve Callaghan by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|175px|alt=A man with brown hair, leans forward slightly to speak into a microphone.|[[Steve Callaghan]] wrote the episode.]]\nThe episode was directed by series regular [[John Holmquist]], and written by series show runner [[Steve Callaghan]] before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth production season]].
