He was a man of vision. It was during his time Malankara church opened the first formal educational institution, in Kerala. With the opening of [[Kottayam]] Suryani Seminary, modern education dawned in Kerala.\n\n== Consecration ==\nWhile Mar Thoma VII was at [[Kandanad]] (near [[Kochi, India|Kochi]]) he fell seriously ill. He did not get time to call a meeting of the church leaders to select his successor. So he invited one of his relatives Thoma Kathanar, to his bed side, laid his hands on him, prayed and consecrated him as Mar Thoma VIII on 2 July 1809. Two days later, on 4 July, Mar Thoma VII died and Mar Thoma VIII took charge of the Malankara church.\n\n==Meeting of the church leaders==\nIt was necessary for him to get the approval of the people to be a Malankara Metropolitan. For this reason soon after becoming Malankara Metropolitan, he convened a meeting of the representatives of the parishes at Kandanad, on 14 September 1809. In that meeting they,\n#Unanimously accepted Mar Thoma VIII as Malankara Metropolitan and presented him with the insignia, a ring.\n#Selected [[Kayamkulam philipose ramban]] from Kayamkulam and Pulikottil Ittoop Ramban from Kunnamkulam as advisers to the Metropolitan.\n#Agreed to use the interest received from ''Vattipanam'', for opening of a Seminary.\n#Accepted a written constitution for the church.

But there were complaints that the interest was not used for opening the seminary.\n\nIn 1814 instead of giving this amount to the Malankara Metropolitan Mar Thoma VIII, the British resident Major Munroe handed over the amount (Rs. 3360) to Ramban Ittoop of Pulikottil. Giving the interest to someone who was not the Metropolitan angered the Governor of [[Madras]] also, who reprimanded Major Munroe. So in 1815 Ittoop Ramban received consecration as Metropolitan with the title of Pulikkottil Mar Dionysius from Mar Philexinos of Thozhyoor.
