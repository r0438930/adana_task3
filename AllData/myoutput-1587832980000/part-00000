While it is independent, it has usually supported the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. From 2009 to 2018, it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' in late 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n''Tribune'' was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] and [[George Strauss]], to back the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)#The Unity Campaign|Unity Campaign]], an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement [[United Front]] between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left.<ref name=redpepper-20181223>{{cite news |url=https://www.redpepper.org.uk/critical-tradition-tribune-then-and-now/ |title=Critical tradition: Tribune then and now |last=Wainwright |first=Hilary |website=red pepper |date=23 December 2018 |access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref> The latter included Cripps's (Labour-affiliated) [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB).\n\nThe paper's first editor was [[William Mellor (journalist)|William Mellor]]. Among its journalists were [[Michael Foot]] and Barbara Betts (later [[Barbara Castle]]), while the board included the Labour MPs [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Ellen Wilkinson]], [[Harold Laski]] of the [[Left Book Club]] and the veteran left-wing journalist and former ILP member [[H. N. Brailsford]].\n\nMellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CPGB policy\u2014supported by Cripps\u2014of backing a [[Popular Front]], including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by H. J. Hartshorn, a secret member of the CPGBP. Meanwhile [[Victor Gollancz]], the Left Book Club's publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.\n\n===1940s===\nWith the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]] and the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, ''Tribune'' initially adopted the CPGB's position of denouncing the British and French declarations of war on Germany as imperialist. After the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn's unrelenting [[Stalinism]]. Strauss fired Hartshorn in February 1940, replacing him as editor with [[Raymond Postgate]]. Under Postgate's editorship, the Soviet [[fellow travellers]] at ''Tribune'' were either dismissed, or in Postgate's words, \"left soon after in dislike of me\".<ref>Bill Jones, ''The Russia Complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977,  {{ISBN|0719006961}}), pp. 48-49</ref> From then on, the paper became the voice of the pro-war democratic left in the Labour Party, taking a position similar to that adopted by Gollancz in the volume ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' he edited attacking the communists for backing the Nazi-Soviet pact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n[[Image:Tribune flier 1941.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Early 1941 ''Tribune'' flier]]\nBevan ousted Postgate after a series of personality clashes in 1941, assuming the role of editor himself, although the day-to-day running of the paper was done by [[Jon Kimche]]. The Bevan-Kimche ''Tribune'' is revered as one of the greatest left-wing papers in British history{{By whom|date=April 2020}}. It campaigned vigorously for the opening of a second front against [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany, was consistently critical of the [[Winston Churchill]] government's failings, and argued that only a democratic socialist post-war settlement in Britain and Europe as a whole was viable.\n\n[[George Orwell]] was hired in 1943 as literary editor. In this role, as well as commissioning and writing reviews, he wrote a series of columns, most of them under the title \"[[As I Please]]\", that have become touchstones of the opinion journalist's craft. Orwell left the ''Tribune'' staff in early 1945 to become a war correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]'', to be replaced as literary editor by his friend [[Tosco Fyvel]], but he remained a regular contributor until March 1947.\n\nOrwell's most famous contributions to ''Tribune'' as a columnist include \"You and the atom bomb\", \"The sporting spirit\", \"Books v cigarettes\", \"[[Decline of the English Murder]]\" and \"[[Some Thoughts on the Common Toad]]\", all of which have since appeared in dozens of anthologies.\n\nOther writers who contributed to ''Tribune'' in the 1940s include [[Naomi Mitchison]], [[Stevie Smith]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]], [[Julian Symons]], [[Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)|Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], Daniel George, [[Inez Holden]], and [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Lizabeth |last=Paravisini-Gebert |title=Phyllis Shand Allfrey: A Caribbean Life |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-8135-2265-X |page=61 }}</ref>\n\nKimche left ''Tribune'' to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by [[Frederic Mullally]]. After the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|Labour landslide election victory of 1945]], Bevan joined [[Clement Attlee]]'s government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and [[Evelyn Anderson]] as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, ''Tribune'' was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally's departure to the [[Sunday Pictorial]]) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\n\nIn the first few years of the Attlee administration, ''Tribune'' became the focus for the Labour left's attempts to persuade [[Ernest Bevin]], the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a \"third force\" democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the United States and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'' (which was published by the rival ''[[New Statesman]]'').\n\nAfter the Soviet rejection of [[Marshall Aid]] and the communist takeover of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948, ''Tribune'' endorsed the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and took a strongly anti-communist line, with its editor declaring in November 1948: \"The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy. It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another\".\n\n=== Bevanism and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ===\nFoot remained in the editorial chair until 1952 when [[Bob Edwards (British journalist)|Bob Edwards]] took over, but he returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, ''Tribune'' became the organ of the [[Bevanite]] left opposition to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership, turning against the United States over its handling of the Korean War, then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. However, ''Tribune'' remained critical of the Soviet Union as it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953 and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the British government's [[Suez]] adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his \"naked into the conference chamber\" speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference. For the next five years, ''Tribune'' was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, \"the official weekly of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\" (CND) as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND's general secretary [[Peggy Duff]] had been ''Tribune'' general manager. Among journalists on ''Tribune'' in the 1950s were [[Richard Clements (journalist)|Richard Clements]], [[Ian Aitken (journalist)|Ian Aitken]] and [[Mervyn Jones (UK journalist)|Mervyn Jones]], who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography ''Chances''.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nAfter Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan's old seat of [[Ebbw Vale]], Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nAs such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964\u2014\"Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet\", exclaimed a headline\u2014the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government's timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the [[European Communities]] (EC) and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the [[Vietnam War]]. It also backed the unions' campaigns against the government's prices-and-incomes policies and against ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', Barbara Castle's 1969 package of trade union law reforms.\n\nThe paper continued in the same vein after [[Edward Heath]] won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government's trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath's negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, ''Tribune'' played a central part in the \"no\" campaign in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum on British EEC membership]].\n\nHowever, ''Tribune'' in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper's reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but it was in fact much less.\n\n===Brief support of Tony Benn===\nClements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot (by now Labour leader), a role he continued under Foot's successor as Labour leader, [[Neil Kinnock]]. Clements was succeeded in the ''Tribune'' chair by [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]], who steered the paper into supporting [[Tony Benn]] (then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left) and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them [[John Silkin]] and [[Donald Bruce, Baron Bruce of Donington|Donald Bruce]], who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.<ref>For a detailed account of the Silkin takeover attempt, see articles by Chris Mullin, New Statesman, January 11 and 18, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Paper of the soft left===\nMullin left in 1984, with circulation at around 6,000, a level it roughly remained for the next ten years). He was replaced by his equally Bennite protege [[Nigel Williamson (UK journalist)|Nigel Williamson]], who surprised everyone by arguing for a realignment of the left and took the paper into the [[soft left]] camp, supporting Kinnock, a long-time ''Tribune'' contributor and onetime board member, as Labour leader against the Bennites. The next two editors [[Phil Kelly (UK journalist)|Phil Kelly]] and [[Paul Anderson (UK journalist)|Paul Anderson]] took much the same line, although both clashed with Kinnock, particularly over his decision to abandon Labour's non-nuclear defence policy.\n\nUnder Kelly, ''Tribune'' supported [[John Prescott]]'s challenge to [[Roy Hattersley]] as Labour Deputy leader in 1988 and came close to going bust, a fate averted by an emergency appeal launched by a front page exclaiming \"Don't let this be the last issue of ''Tribune''\". Under Anderson, the paper took a strongly pro-European stance, supported electoral reform and argued for military intervention against Serbian aggression in Croatia and Bosnia. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, ''Tribune'' acted as a clearing house for arguments inside the Labour Party, with contributions from all major players.\n\n===Back to basics===\nFrom 1993, [[Mark Seddon (UK journalist)|Mark Seddon]] shifted ''Tribune'' several degrees back to the left, particularly after [[Tony Blair]] became Labour leader in 1994. The paper strongly opposed Blair's abandonment of [[Clause Four]] of the Labour Party constitution and resisted his rebranding of the party as New Labour.\n\nAfter Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], the paper maintained an oppositionist stance, objecting to the Blair government's military interventions and its reliance on spin-doctors. In 2001, ''Tribune'' opposed the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States-led invasion of Afghanistan]] and it was outspoken against the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The paper under Seddon also reverted to an anti-European position very similar to that it adopted in the 1970s and early 1980s and campaigned for Gordon Brown to replace Blair as Labour Leader and Prime Minister.\n\n''Tribune'' changed format from newspaper to magazine in 2001, but remained plagued by financial uncertainty, coming close to folding again in 2002. However, Seddon and Chairman of Tribune Publications, the Labour MP [[Peter Kilfoyle]] led a team of pro-bono advisers who organised a rescue package with a consortium of trade unions ([[UNISON|Unison]], [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]], [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|Aslef]],<ref name=\"Plunkett\">John Plunkett, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/09/pressandpublishing \"Tribune set to close by November\"], ''The Guardian'', 9 October 2008.

Seddon resigned as editor in summer 2004 and was succeeded by [[Chris McLaughlin (UK journalist)|Chris McLaughlin]], former political editor of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]''.<ref name=independent-20040914>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-media-column-the-bottom-has-dropped-out-of-the-left-leaning-periodical-market-546092.html |title=The Media Column: 'The bottom has dropped out of the left-leaning periodical market' |last=Hagerty |first=Bill |website=The Independent |date=14 September 2004 |access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2007, ''Tribune'' spawned two offshoot websites, a Tribune Cartoons blog, put together by cartoonists who draw for the magazine; and a ''Tribune'' History blog.\n\nIn September 2008, the magazine's future was again in doubt thanks to problems with its trade union funding.

While it is independent, it has usually supported the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the [[Left-wing politics|left]]. From 2009 to 2018, it faced serious financial difficulties until it was purchased by ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' in late 2018, shifting to a quarterly publication model.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Origins ===\n''Tribune'' was founded in early 1937 by two wealthy left-wing Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), [[Sir Stafford Cripps]] and [[George Strauss]], to back the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)#The Unity Campaign|Unity Campaign]], an attempt to secure an anti-fascist and anti-appeasement [[United Front]] between the Labour Party and socialist parties to the left.<ref name=redpepper-20181223>{{cite news |url=https://www.redpepper.org.uk/critical-tradition-tribune-then-and-now/ |title=Critical tradition: Tribune then and now |last=Wainwright |first=Hilary |website=red pepper |date=23 December 2018 |access-date=25 April 2020}}</ref> The latter included Cripps's (Labour-affiliated) [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) and the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB).\n\nThe paper's first editor was [[William Mellor (journalist)|William Mellor]]. Among its journalists were [[Michael Foot]] and Barbara Betts (later [[Barbara Castle]]), while the board included the Labour MPs [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[Ellen Wilkinson]], [[Harold Laski]] of the [[Left Book Club]] and the veteran left-wing journalist and former ILP member [[H. N. Brailsford]].\n\nMellor was fired in 1938 for refusing to adopt a new CPGB policy\u2014supported by Cripps\u2014of backing a [[Popular Front]], including non-socialist parties, against fascism and appeasement; Foot resigned in solidarity. Mellor was succeeded by H. J. Hartshorn, a secret member of the CPGBP. Meanwhile [[Victor Gollancz]], the Left Book Club's publisher, joined the board of directors. For the next year, the paper was little more than an appendage of the Left Book Club, taking an uncritical line on the Popular Front and the Soviet Union.\n\n===1940s===\nWith the [[Nazi-Soviet pact]] and the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, ''Tribune'' initially adopted the CPGB's position of denouncing the British and French declarations of war on Germany as imperialist. After the Soviet invasion of Finland, with Cripps off on a world tour, Strauss and Bevan became increasingly impatient with Hartshorn's unrelenting [[Stalinism]]. Strauss fired Hartshorn in February 1940, replacing him as editor with [[Raymond Postgate]]. Under Postgate's editorship, the Soviet [[fellow travellers]] at ''Tribune'' were either dismissed, or in Postgate's words, \"left soon after in dislike of me\".<ref>Bill Jones, ''The Russia Complex: the British Labour Party and the Soviet Union'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1977,  {{ISBN|0719006961}}), pp. 48-49</ref> From then on, the paper became the voice of the pro-war democratic left in the Labour Party, taking a position similar to that adopted by Gollancz in the volume ''[[Betrayal of the Left]]'' he edited attacking the communists for backing the Nazi-Soviet pact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n[[Image:Tribune flier 1941.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Early 1941 ''Tribune'' flier]]\nBevan ousted Postgate after a series of personality clashes in 1941, assuming the role of editor himself, although the day-to-day running of the paper was done by [[Jon Kimche]]. The Bevan-Kimche ''Tribune'' is revered as one of the greatest left-wing papers in British history{{By whom|date=April 2020}}. It campaigned vigorously for the opening of a second front against [[Adolf Hitler]]'s Germany, was consistently critical of the [[Winston Churchill]] government's failings, and argued that only a democratic socialist post-war settlement in Britain and Europe as a whole was viable.\n\n[[George Orwell]] was hired in 1943 as literary editor. In this role, as well as commissioning and writing reviews, he wrote a series of columns, most of them under the title \"[[As I Please]]\", that have become touchstones of the opinion journalist's craft. Orwell left the ''Tribune'' staff in early 1945 to become a war correspondent for ''[[The Observer]]'', to be replaced as literary editor by his friend [[Tosco Fyvel]], but he remained a regular contributor until March 1947.\n\nOrwell's most famous contributions to ''Tribune'' as a columnist include \"You and the atom bomb\", \"The sporting spirit\", \"Books v cigarettes\", \"[[Decline of the English Murder]]\" and \"[[Some Thoughts on the Common Toad]]\", all of which have since appeared in dozens of anthologies.\n\nOther writers who contributed to ''Tribune'' in the 1940s include [[Naomi Mitchison]], [[Stevie Smith]], [[Alex Comfort]], [[Arthur Calder-Marshall]], [[Julian Symons]], [[Elizabeth Taylor (novelist)|Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Rhys Davies (writer)|Rhys Davies]], Daniel George, [[Inez Holden]], and [[Phyllis Shand Allfrey]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Lizabeth |last=Paravisini-Gebert |title=Phyllis Shand Allfrey: A Caribbean Life |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-8135-2265-X |page=61 }}</ref>\n\nKimche left ''Tribune'' to join Reuters in 1945, his place being taken by [[Frederic Mullally]]. After the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|Labour landslide election victory of 1945]], Bevan joined [[Clement Attlee]]'s government and formally left the paper, leaving Mullally and [[Evelyn Anderson]] as joint editors, with Foot playing Bevan's role of political director. Over the next five years, ''Tribune'' was critically involved in every key political event in the life of the Labour government and reached its highest-ever circulation, of some 40,000. Foot persuaded Kimche to return as joint editor in 1946 (after Mullally's departure to the [[Sunday Pictorial]]) and in 1948 himself became joint editor with Anderson, after Kimche was fired for disappearing from the office to travel to Istanbul to negotiate the safe passage of two Jewish refugee ships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles.\n\nIn the first few years of the Attlee administration, ''Tribune'' became the focus for the Labour left's attempts to persuade [[Ernest Bevin]], the Foreign Secretary, to adopt a \"third force\" democratic socialist foreign policy, with Europe acting independently from the United States and the Soviet Union, most coherently advanced in the pamphlet ''[[Keep Left (pamphlet)|Keep Left]]'' (which was published by the rival ''[[New Statesman]]'').\n\nAfter the Soviet rejection of [[Marshall Aid]] and the communist takeover of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948, ''Tribune'' endorsed the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] and took a strongly anti-communist line, with its editor declaring in November 1948: \"The major threat to democratic socialism and the major danger of war in Europe arises from Soviet policy and not from American policy. It is not the Americans who have imposed a blockade on Berlin. It is not the Americans who have used conspiratorial methods to destroy democratic socialist parties in one country after another. It is not the Americans who have blocked effective action through one United Nations agency after another\".\n\n=== Bevanism and Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament ===\nFoot remained in the editorial chair until 1952 when [[Bob Edwards (British journalist)|Bob Edwards]] took over, but he returned after losing his parliamentary seat in Plymouth in 1955. During the early 1950s, ''Tribune'' became the organ of the [[Bevanite]] left opposition to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leadership, turning against the United States over its handling of the Korean War, then arguing strongly against West German rearmament and nuclear arms. However, ''Tribune'' remained critical of the Soviet Union as it denounced Stalin on his death in 1953 and in 1956 opposed the Soviet suppression of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the British government's [[Suez]] adventure. The paper and Bevan parted company after his \"naked into the conference chamber\" speech at the 1957 Labour Party conference. For the next five years, ''Tribune'' was at the forefront of the campaign to commit Labour to a non-nuclear defence policy, \"the official weekly of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]\" (CND) as the direct actionists in the peace movement put it. CND's general secretary [[Peggy Duff]] had been ''Tribune'' general manager. Among journalists on ''Tribune'' in the 1950s were [[Richard Clements (journalist)|Richard Clements]], [[Ian Aitken (journalist)|Ian Aitken]] and [[Mervyn Jones (UK journalist)|Mervyn Jones]], who related his experience on the paper in his autobiography ''Chances''.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nAfter Foot was re-elected to Parliament in 1960 for Bevan's old seat of [[Ebbw Vale]], Richard Clements became editor. During the 1960s and 1970s the paper faithfully expressed the ideas of the parliamentary Labour left and allied itself with the new generation of left-wing trade union leaders that emerged on the back of a wave of workplace militancy from the early 1960s onwards.\n\nAs such, it played a massive role in the politics of the time. Although it welcomed the election of Harold Wilson's Labour government in 1964\u2014\"Tribune takes over from Eton in the cabinet\", exclaimed a headline\u2014the paper became rapidly disillusioned. It denounced the Wilson government's timidity on nationalisation and devaluation, opposed its moves to join the [[European Communities]] (EC) and attacked it for failing to take a principled position against the [[Vietnam War]]. It also backed the unions' campaigns against the government's prices-and-incomes policies and against ''[[In Place of Strife]]'', Barbara Castle's 1969 package of trade union law reforms.\n\nThe paper continued in the same vein after [[Edward Heath]] won the 1970 general election, opposing his Tory government's trade union legislation between 1970 and 1974 and placing itself at the head of opposition to Heath's negotiations for Britain to join the EEC. After Labour regained power in 1974, ''Tribune'' played a central part in the \"no\" campaign in the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum on British EEC membership]].\n\nHowever, ''Tribune'' in this period did not speak to, let alone represent, the concerns of the younger generation of leftists who were at the centre of the campaign against the Vietnam War and the post-1968 student revolt, who found the paper's reformism and commitment to Labour tame and old-fashioned. Circulation, around 20,000 in 1960, was said by 1980 to be around 10,000, but it was in fact much less.\n\n===Brief support of Tony Benn===\nClements resigned as editor in 1982 to become a political adviser to Foot (by now Labour leader), a role he continued under Foot's successor as Labour leader, [[Neil Kinnock]]. Clements was succeeded in the ''Tribune'' chair by [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]], who steered the paper into supporting [[Tony Benn]] (then just past the peak of his influence on the Labour left) and attempted to turn it into a friendly society in which readers were invited to buy shares, much to the consternation of the old Bevanite shareholders, most prominent among them [[John Silkin]] and [[Donald Bruce, Baron Bruce of Donington|Donald Bruce]], who attempted unsuccessfully to take control of the paper. A protracted dispute ensued that at one point seemed likely to close the paper.<ref>For a detailed account of the Silkin takeover attempt, see articles by Chris Mullin, New Statesman, January 11 and 18, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Paper of the soft left===\nMullin left in 1984, with circulation at around 6,000, a level it roughly remained for the next ten years). He was replaced by his equally Bennite protege [[Nigel Williamson (UK journalist)|Nigel Williamson]], who surprised everyone by arguing for a realignment of the left and took the paper into the [[soft left]] camp, supporting Kinnock, a long-time ''Tribune'' contributor and onetime board member, as Labour leader against the Bennites. The next two editors [[Phil Kelly (UK journalist)|Phil Kelly]] and [[Paul Anderson (UK journalist)|Paul Anderson]] took much the same line, although both clashed with Kinnock, particularly over his decision to abandon Labour's non-nuclear defence policy.\n\nUnder Kelly, ''Tribune'' supported [[John Prescott]]'s challenge to [[Roy Hattersley]] as Labour Deputy leader in 1988 and came close to going bust, a fate averted by an emergency appeal launched by a front page exclaiming \"Don't let this be the last issue of ''Tribune''\". Under Anderson, the paper took a strongly pro-European stance, supported electoral reform and argued for military intervention against Serbian aggression in Croatia and Bosnia. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, ''Tribune'' acted as a clearing house for arguments inside the Labour Party, with contributions from all major players.\n\n===Back to basics===\nFrom 1993, [[Mark Seddon (UK journalist)|Mark Seddon]] shifted ''Tribune'' several degrees back to the left, particularly after [[Tony Blair]] became Labour leader in 1994. The paper strongly opposed Blair's abandonment of [[Clause Four]] of the Labour Party constitution and resisted his rebranding of the party as New Labour.\n\nAfter Labour won the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], the paper maintained an oppositionist stance, objecting to the Blair government's military interventions and its reliance on spin-doctors. In 2001, ''Tribune'' opposed the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|United States-led invasion of Afghanistan]] and it was outspoken against the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] in 2003. The paper under Seddon also reverted to an anti-European position very similar to that it adopted in the 1970s and early 1980s and campaigned for Gordon Brown to replace Blair as Labour Leader and Prime Minister.\n\n''Tribune'' changed format from newspaper to magazine in 2001, but remained plagued by financial uncertainty, coming close to folding again in 2002. However, Seddon and Chairman of Tribune Publications, the Labour MP [[Peter Kilfoyle]] led a team of pro-bono advisers who organised a rescue package with a consortium of trade unions ([[UNISON|Unison]], [[Amicus (trade union)|Amicus]], [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen|Aslef]],<ref name=\"Plunkett\">John Plunkett, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/oct/09/pressandpublishing \"Tribune set to close by November\"], ''The Guardian'', 9 October 2008.

Seddon resigned as editor in summer 2004 and was succeeded by [[Chris McLaughlin (UK journalist)|Chris McLaughlin]], former political editor of the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]''.\n\nDuring 2007, ''Tribune'' spawned two offshoot websites, a Tribune Cartoons blog, put together by cartoonists who draw for the magazine; and a ''Tribune'' History blog.\n\nIn September 2008, the magazine's future was again in doubt thanks to problems with its trade union funding. An attempt by the [[Unite the Union|Unite]] trade union to render ''Tribune'' its wholly owned subsidiary had a mixed response,<ref>Paul Anderson [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/11/georgeorwell \"Better read than dead\"], ''The Guardian'' (Comment is Free website), 11 September 2008.</ref> but on 9 October it was announced that the magazine would close on the 31 October if a buyer could not be found.<ref name=\"Plunkett\"/> The uncertainty continued until early December 2008 when it emerged that a 51% stake was being sold to an unnamed Labour Party activist for \u00a31 with an undertaking to support the magazine for \u00a340,000 per annum and debts written off by the now former trade union owners.<ref>Keith Richmond [http://www.tribunemagazine.org/2008/12/05/tribune%e2%80%99s-future-unions-and-buyer-agree-deal-for-sale/ \"Tribune\u2019s future: unions and buyer agree deal for sale\"], ''Tribune'' blog, 5 December 2008.</ref>\n\n''Tribune's'' [[cartoonists]] were [[Alex Hughes (cartoonist)|Alex Hughes]], [[Matthew Buck (Hack)|Matthew Buck]], [[Jon Jensen (cartoonist)|Jon Jensen]], [[Martin Rowson]] and [[Gary Barker]].\n\n===Changes of ownership and relaunch (2009-2018)===\nIn March 2009, 100% ownership of the magazine passed to [[Kevin McGrath]] through a new company, Tribune Publications 2009 Limited,<!-- Inadmissible online sources indicate the company was dissolved in 2013, and the successor \"2013\" in 2014. --> with the intention of keeping ''Tribune'' a left-of-centre publication though broadening the readership.<ref name=pg-20090317>{{cite news |url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=43353 |title=Sale of Tribune to Labour party activist is completed |author=Paul McNally |work=Press Gazette |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616181825/http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=43353 |archivedate=16 June 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribunemagazine.org/2009/03/16/press-release-tribune-saved-%E2%80%93-weekly-political-journal-under-new-ownership/|title=Tribune Saved \u2013 Weekly Political Journal Under New Ownership|work=Tribune|date=16 March 2009|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribunemagazine.org/2009/03/26/tribune%E2%80%99s-new-board-and-plans-for-expansion-are-unveiled/|title=Tribune's new board and plans for expansion are unveiled|author=Chris McLaughlin|work=Tribune|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>\n\nIn late October 2011, the future of ''Tribune'' looked bleak once again when McGrath warned of possible closure because subscriptions and income had not risen as had been hoped.<ref>Alice Gribbin [http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-staggers/2011/10/tribune-magazine-staff-website \"Tribune magazine to close\"], ''New Statesman'', 25 October 2011</ref> Unless a buyer could be found or a cooperative established, the last edition would have been published on 4 November.<ref>James Robinson [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/oct/25/tribune-closure-after-75-years?newsfeed=true \"Tribune, journal of the left, faces closure after 75 years\"], ''The Guardian'', 25 October 2011</ref> McGrath committed to paying off the magazine's debts.
