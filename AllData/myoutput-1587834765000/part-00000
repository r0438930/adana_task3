Verbroedering Geel''' was a [[football in Belgium|Belgian association football]] club, from the city of [[Geel]] in [[Antwerp (province)]].\n\n==History==\nThe club was born in 1921 as a merger of '''Flandria''' and '''Geel Sport''', becoming '''Flandria Geel Sport''', and registered in 1924 to the [[Belgian Football Association]] receiving the [[matricule]] n\u00b0 395 after changing its name to FC Verbroedering Geel.  It played for the first time in the [[Belgian Second Division|second division]] in [[1985-86 in Belgian football|1985\u201386]].  In [[1999-2000 Belgian First Division|1999\u20132000]] it appeared shortly in the [[Belgian First Division|first division]] as it won the [[Belgian Second Division Final Round|second division final round]]. At this time the club merged with neighbours from [[K.F.C. Herentals]] leaving both name and matricule of the latter club.\n\nOn 30 November 2005 Verbroedering Geel is judged by the Control Commission of the FA for having falsified the [[2004-05 in Belgian football|2004\u201305]] second division final round and is subsequently downgraded to the [[Belgian Third Division|third division]].  The judgement was confirmed on 1 March 2006 after what chairman [[Vic Keersmaekers]] resigned.  Eventually on 13 April 2006 the Evocation Commission cancelled the decision of the Control Commission.  Though on 3 May 2006 it was confirmed by the Appeal Commission of the FA that the club would be relegated.  It thus seized the Evocation Commission.  The Executive Committee of the FA decided on 8 May 2006 to let Geel play the [[2005-06 in Belgian football|2005\u201306]] second division final round although the rules of the competition state that a relegated club cannot take part in the final round.  On 15 June 2006 the Evocation Commission rejected the plaint of Geel and the club was then officially relegated to the third division, permitting [[K.M. S.K. Deinze]] to avoid relegation.\n\nThe club was suffering serious financial trouble. Conversations were started with the [[Egypt]]ian group Wadi Degla Investment to take over the club. Eventually they chose to take over [[Lierse]] and [[KFC Turnhout]]. On 30 June 2008, the club filed for [[bankruptcy]] and ultimately ceased to exist.\n\nA different local team [[Verbroedering Geel-Meerhout|Verbroedering Meerhout]], playing in [[Belgian Promotion]], chose to move to the stadium of Verbroedering Geel due to better facilities.
