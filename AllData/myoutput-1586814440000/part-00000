During the eighth [[inning]] with the score tied 2\u20132, [[1954 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] batter [[Vic Wertz]] hit a deep [[Batted ball|fly ball]] to [[Center fielder|center field]] that was poised to score the [[Base running|runners on base]]. However, Mays made an over-the-shoulder [[Catch (baseball)|catch]] while on the run to record the [[Out (baseball)|out]], and his throw back to the [[Infield#Baseball|infield]] prevented the runners from advancing. The Giants won the game 5\u20132 in [[extra innings]], and eventually the World Series.

In many stadiums the ball would have been a [[home run]], which would have given the Indians a 5\u20132 lead. However, the Polo Grounds center field was larger than average, and Mays, who was playing in shallow center field, made an on-the-run, over-the-shoulder catch at the [[warning track]] for the out. Having caught the ball, he immediately spun and threw the ball. Doby, the runner on second, might have been able to score the go-ahead run had he tagged at the moment the ball was caught; as it was, he ran when the ball was hit, then had to scramble back to tag.
