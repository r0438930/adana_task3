At its renaming as a Royal Corps in 1918 it was both a supply and repair corps.  In the supply area it had responsibility for weapons, armoured vehicles and other military equipment, ammunition and clothing and certain minor functions such as laundry, mobile baths and photography. The RAOC was also responsible for a major element of the repair of Army equipment.  In 1942 the latter function was transferred to the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME) and the vehicle storage and spares responsibilities of the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] were in turn passed over to the RAOC.  The RAOC retained repair responsibilities for ammunition, clothing and certain ranges of general stores.  In 1964 the [[McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics]] resulted in the RAOC absorbing petroleum, rations and accommodation stores functions from the Royal Army Service Corps as well as the [[Army Fire Service]], barrack services, sponsorship of [[NAAFI]] (EFI) and the management of [[staff clerk]]s from the same Corps.  On 5 April 1993, the RAOC was one of the corps that amalgamated to form The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC).\n\nThe permanent establishment of an [[Ordnance Office]] long predated that of a [[standing army]] in Britain; it has therefore been claimed that 'in a wide sense, as heirs to the master-[[bowyers]], master-[[Fletcher (occupation)|fletchers]], master-[[carpenters]] and master-[[Metalsmith|smiths]] who, in mediaeval days, were responsible as Officers of Ordnance for the care and provision of warlike mat\u00e9riel, and to their successors the storekeepers, [[clerk]]s, [[Armed-forces artificer|artificers]], [[armourers]] and [[Storeman|storemen]] of the Board of Ordnance, the R.A.O.C. can claim a far longer continuous history and more ancient lineage than any other unit of the British Army'.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\">{{cite book |last1=Forbes |first1=Major General A. |title=The History of the Army Ordnance Services, vol.

Thereafter followed thirty years of fluctuating allocation of responsibilities and a great variety of titles of both corps and individuals. This complex, convoluted and largely unsatisfactory period insofar as Army logistics was concerned was summarised in 1889 as follows: \n{{quote|'The English Ordnance Department goes back into an older history than the Army.

The Storekeeper's department, on the other hand, was part of the [[Civilian|civil]] establishment, though (as with much of the Board's activity) troops were involved in various aspects of its operation when not [[Military deployment|deployed]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Hogg1963\" /> In any case, modern distinctions between civilian and military personnel were not so clear cut for those serving under the Board: its officers, [[military engineers|engineers]] and [[artillerymen]] received their commissions or patents from the [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], as did the Storekeepers, artificers and storemen. Though civilians, the Storekeepers were provided with uniform, akin to that of the Royal Artillery, described in 1833 as a blue coat with red stand-collar and cuffs, gold [[epaulettes]] indicating rank and blue trousers with a gold stripe, worn with a gold-[[Hilt|hilted]] sword and a [[cocked hat]]; Clerks on the establishment wore the same uniform but without epaulettes. After [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] they were given relative rank (for the purpose of allotting appropriate quarters): Storekeepers to rank as lieutenant colonel, Deputy Storekeepers as major (if in independent charge) or else captain, Assistant Storekeepers as lieutenant and Clerks as a non-commissioned officer.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> The Storekeepers and their Deputies had oversight of the [[Board of Ordnance#Storage and supply: the Ordnance Yards|Ordnance Yards]], both at home and abroad, however they were never deployed in the [[theatre of war]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/royal-naval-dockyard-staff/|title=Royal Naval dockyard staff|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance====\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Woolwich Warren (the future [[Royal Arsenal]]) had outgrown the [[Tower of London]] as the main ordnance storage depot in the realm.<ref name=Hogg1963>{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Brigadier O.F.G. |year=1963 |title=The Royal Arsenal Woolwich |volume=Volume I |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref> In times of war, the Board of Ordnance Storekeepers found themselves responsible for conveying guns, ammunition and certain other items to the troops [[Field of battle|in the field]] (whereas provision of food, supplies and other equipment was largely dependent on the [[Commissariat]], a department of [[HM Treasury]]). Until 1792, the transport and issue of weapons and ammunition to troops in the [[theatre of war]] was achieved by the formation of [[artillery train]]s, as and where required. In that year, with Britain about to engage in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the Board sought to place this ''ad hoc'' arrangement on a permanent footing by establishing a '''Field Train Department'''. A Lieutenant-General of the Royal Artillery served as its Commandant and a Major-General as his Deputy, but otherwise its personnel were uniformed civilians: under a Senior [[Commissary]] based at Woolwich were Commissaries, Assistant Commissaries, Clerks of Stores and Conductors of Stores (equivalent to [[Major]]s, [[Captain (Army)|Captains]], [[subalterns]] and [[NCOs]] respectively).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" /> In peace time nothing more than a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of officers was maintained (at the headquarters in Woolwich), but in time of war they were supplemented by recruits from the Ordnance Storekeeper's department to serve in the field; thus the strength of the Department varied dramatically, from 4 or 5 (during the peaceful years 1828-1853) to 346 at its peak in 1813. Each recruit received special training in the handling of munitions. During the Crimean War a number of Sergeants were seconded from the Royal Artillery to serve as [[Conductor (military appointment)|Military Conductors]] in addition to the civilian staff.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\">{{cite book |last1=Steer |first1=Brigadier Frank |title=To The Warrior His Arms: the story of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps 1918-1993 |date=2005 |publisher=Pen & Sword |location=Barnsley, S. Yorks}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers, the Field Train Department had additional responsibilities: it provided them with pay, clothing, medical supplies and camp equipment when deployed (while the Commissariat provided their food and [[forage]]).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\">{{cite book |last1=Sharpe |first1=L. C. |title=The Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance |date=1993 |publisher=Royal Logistic Corps museum}}</ref> The Field Train Department provided the Royal Engineers with their [[pontoon bridge]]s and other specialist equipment, and (until the formation of a separate Corps of Artillery Drivers) provided for the movement of [[artillery piece]]s in the field (other than those pertaining to the [[Royal Horse Artillery]]). For the duration of conflict the Department's personnel accompanied the Artillery and Engineer units in the field providing them with logistic support (including repair facilities).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\nBetween 1795 and 1815, the Field Train served in thirty expeditions and campaigns.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> In peacetime, the civilians and sergeants returned to their former duties, but the cadre of officers was retained; they were based initially in the Royal Arsenal, and then in the [[Royal Artillery Barracks#Related institutions in Woolwich|Grand Depot]] (just off [[Woolwich Common]]) where the guns were stored ready for deployment. At the start of the Crimean War, the Ordnance Field Train was [[mobilized]] once again. An parallel supply corps within the Army (the [[Royal Waggon Train]], first established in 1794) had been disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in 1833, however, and its responsibilities devolved again to the Commissariat (which was by now more attuned to peacetime operations than warfare);<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> after a well-publicised series of logistical failings the Commissariat and the Board of Ordnance, as well as the command-structure of the army itself, were all strongly criticised, leading (among other things) to the abolition of the Board (in 1855) and its Field Train Department (in 1859, its officers having transferred to the new Military Store Department).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\n===After Crimea===\nIn the years following the Crimean War three corps can be identified as the direct predecessors of the RAOC.  The '''Military Store Department''' (MSD) created in 1861 granted military commissions and provided officers to manage stores inventories.  In parallel a subordinate corps of warrant officers and sergeants, the '''Military Store Clerks Corps''' (MSC), was also created to carry out clerical duties.  These small corps (235 officers in the MSD and 44 MSC) were based largely at the [[Tower of London]], [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Weedon Bec]], but were also deployable on active service. They were supplemented in 1865 by the establishment at Woolwich of a '''Military Store Staff Corps'''  (MSSC) to provide soldiers:<ref>HED Harris ' the First Five Hundred Years', RAOC School, Blackdown 1962. pp65-67</ref> initially 200-strong, it had more than doubled in size by 1869, with units in Portsmouth, Devonport, Aldershot, Dublin and Chatham as well as at Woolwich and the Tower.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />\n\nIn 1870 a further reorganisation, ostensibly to simplify management, resulted in the MSD, MSC and MSSC being grouped with the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]] (ASC) under the [[Control Department]].  The officers remained a separate branch (Ordnance or Military Stores) in the Control Department but the soldiers were absorbed into the ASC.  This arrangement lasted until 1876.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of Army Ordnance Services', Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 151-152</ref>\n\nThe Control Department was disbanded in 1876.  The Ordnance/Military Store officers joined a newly created '''Ordnance Stores Department''' (OSD).  Five years later, in 1881, the soldiers also left the ASC and became the '''Ordnance Store Corps''' (OSC).  In 1894 there were further changes.  The OSD was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Department''' (AOD) and absorbed the Inspectors of Machinery from the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA).  In parallel the OSC was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Corps''' (AOC) and at the same time absorbed the Corps of Armourers and the RA's Armament Artificers.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 153-5</ref>\n\nIn 1918 the AOD and AOC amalgamated to form the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and for the first time officers and soldiers served in the same organisation; it received the \"Royal\" prefix in recognition of their service during the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/royal-army-ordnance-corps|title=Royal Army Ordnance Corps|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ordnance Services Organisation before 1914==\n[[File:Greenwich Heritage Centre, Woolwich - RA & RMA exhibition 26 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Red Barracks, Woolwich]]\n===Depots and other installations===\nThe earliest depot for military stores was the [[Tower of London]], headquarters of the [[Ordnance Office]], which for many centuries sufficed to hold the country's central stocks of artillery, gunpowder, small arms and ammunition albeit in unsatisfactory circumstances. The Tower continued to be used for storage into the 19th century, but in 1671 the Board of Ordnance acquired a parcel of land at [[Woolwich]] which soon supplanted the Tower to become the Board's main ordnance storage depot; manufacture as well as storage of guns and ammunition took place on the site, which was later named the [[Royal Arsenal]]. In 1760 the Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established at [[Purfleet]], replacing the Tower as Britain's central repository of gunpowder. In 1808 a modern purpose-built depot was constructed at [[Weedon Bec|Weedon]], alongside the Grand Union Canal, to serve as a safe repository for guns and ammunition;<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol I. p192</ref> and in 1813 a new Grand Storehouse was opened in the Royal Arsenal, containing multiple warehouses for all kinds of military stores. When [[Woolwich Dockyard]] closed in 1869, the entire dockyard site was taken over by the War Office to become a vast ordnance stores complex, annexed (and [[Royal Arsenal Railway|linked by rail]]) to the ordnance stores in the Royal Arsenal; large stocks of barrack stores, [[Horse harness|harnesses]], [[accoutrements]] and other general stores were transferred to Woolwich Dockyard from the Tower at this time. At the same time the Military Store Department moved its headquarters from the Tower to the Red Fort at Woolwich (which had originally been built as the infirmary for the adjacent [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich|Royal Marine Barracks]], linked to the nearby Dockyard);<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semark|first1=H.W.|title=The Royal Naval Armament Depots of Priddy's Hard, Elson, Frater and Bedenham, 1768\u20131977|date=1997|publisher=Hampshire County Council|location=Winchester|page=124}}</ref> as [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich#Red Barracks|Red Barracks]], it would continue to serve as the [[Regimental depot|regimental Depot]], headquarters and home of the ordnance corps for the next fifty years. Finally, by about 1887, large stocks of small arms were moved from the Tower of London to Weedon, leaving the Tower to serve as a repository of ancient arms and armour and as a small Ordnance centre for troops in London.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />  \n\n[[File:Selby, Old MOD Ordnance Depot - geograph.org.uk - 159590.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[Barlby]] Ordnance Depot, dating from 1889 (one of a number of small depots established at that time).]]\nIn addition to these central depots, ordnance yards in the naval and garrison towns of [[Chatham Dockyard#The Gun Wharf|Chatham]], [[Gunwharf Quays|Portsmouth]] and [[HMNB Devonport#Morice Yard (New Gun Wharf)|Plymouth]] held reserve stocks of camp equipment, entrenching tools, small-arms and ammunition, accoutrements, harness and saddlery (similar stores were also provided at Dublin, Gibraltar and Malta). During the Crimean War, however, these arrangements proved unequal to the task of equipping an army with speed at a time of [[mobilization]]. After the war an Ordnance station was established as part of the new training camp at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]]: a hutted encampment was provided for troops to practise combined training, alongside a depot to furnish them with field stores.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> In the 1880s an effort was made to decentralise the reserves of equipment; as many as sixty-two small regional centres were set up, in an effort to bring stores closer to the units that would use them. Later, with the establishment of larger camps and garrisons in the early 20th century, these were consolidated into eighteen larger Ordnance stations. At the same time, during the period from the 1860s to 1914, various depots were established to support the Army throughout the world (with the notable exception of India where the Indian Army managed its own parallel organisation in [[Ordnance Depot Quetta, Rawalpindi and Karachi]] (then British India and now Pakistan), the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC). In 1881 there were detachments in Dublin, [[Jersey]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canada]], [[St Helena]], [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Straits Settlements]].

A Central Ordnance Depot (COD) and workshop to support vehicles, built on the site of the First World War [[National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell]], opened in 1937.  The operation of this depot was notable in that it mirrored and tried to improve on best civilian practice at the time; this became a hallmark of RAOC development in the following decades. [[Branston Depot|COD Branston]] was established in 1938, initially to serve as the Army's main clothing store, freeing up space at COD Didcot.

The RAOC's skills in bomb disposal were later put to increasing use in dealing with terrorist devices at home as well as in conflict zones overseas. The training of Ammunition Examiners, [[Ammunition Technician]]s and [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s at the [[Army School of Ammunition]] became progressively more specialised during the 1950s and '60s. In May 1970 a section of [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Unit]] was sent to [[Northern Ireland]] to support the local ammunition inspectorate in dealing with [[improvised explosive devices]]; what was initially a 6-month deployment marked the start of a much longer involvement through [[the Troubles]].<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nIn the period 1945\u201393 the RAOC, as with the rest of the Army, reduced greatly in size and closed its worldwide bases as garrisons withdrew. At the same time, there was considerable development of warehousing techniques and information technology (the first move towards [[computer]]isation came with the opening of an [[Automated data medium|Automated Data Processing]] Installation at Chilwell in 1963 and one at Bicester the following year.) In the mid-1960s new recruits were informed that 'The RAOC occupies nearly 90 different locations in the UK alone and world wide uses 86,000,000 square feet of storage space. Over 1,000,000 different items are held in stock and over 11,000,000 issues are made in a year'.<ref name=\"Notes\">[https://rnzaoc.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/50102626-raocbookletmcleod.pdf ''Notes on the Royal Army Ordnance Corps''], published in the wake of the 1964 McLeod changes.</ref> By 1980 the RAOC was reduced to two CODs at Bicester and Donnington (COD Chilwell was closing, CODs [[Branston, Staffordshire|Branston]] and Didcot had closed in 1963 and Weedon in 1965 after being downgraded from a COD in 1957), two CADs at Kineton and Longtown (Nesscliffe had closed in 1959, Corsham in 1963 and Bramley in 1974) and three Central Vehicle Depots: [[Ludgershall, Wiltshire|Ludgershall]] for 'A' (armoured) vehicles, and [[Ashchurch]] and [[Hilton, Derbyshire|Hilton]] for 'B' ('soft-skinned') vehicles<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1986/mar/18/raoc-hilton RAOC Hilton (Historic Hansard: House of Commons debate, 18 March 1986).]</ref> (CVD [[Marchington]] having closed in 1965, CVDs [[Feltham]] and [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] in the early 1970s).<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nAcross the UK the structure of smaller Regional Depots, Ordnance Support Units (OSUs), Training Materiel Parks, supply depots and Ammunition Sub-Depots was steadily run down.

After the [[Somerville Logistic Reorganisation Committee Report]] of 1977 the head of the corps was re-titled Director General Ordnance Services (DGOS).

At its renaming as a Royal Corps in 1918 it was both a supply and repair corps.  In the supply area it had responsibility for weapons, armoured vehicles and other military equipment, ammunition and clothing and certain minor functions such as laundry, mobile baths and photography. The RAOC was also responsible for a major element of the repair of Army equipment.  In 1942 the latter function was transferred to the [[Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers]] (REME) and the vehicle storage and spares responsibilities of the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] were in turn passed over to the RAOC.  The RAOC retained repair responsibilities for ammunition, clothing and certain ranges of general stores.  In 1964 the [[McLeod Reorganisation of Army Logistics]] resulted in the RAOC absorbing petroleum, rations and accommodation stores functions from the Royal Army Service Corps as well as the [[Army Fire Service]], barrack services, sponsorship of [[NAAFI]] (EFI) and the management of [[staff clerk]]s from the same Corps.  On 5 April 1993, the RAOC was one of the corps that amalgamated to form The [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (RLC).\n\nThe permanent establishment of an [[Ordnance Office]] long predated that of a [[standing army]] in Britain; it has therefore been claimed that 'in a wide sense, as heirs to the master-[[bowyers]], master-[[Fletcher (occupation)|fletchers]], master-[[carpenters]] and master-[[Metalsmith|smiths]] who, in mediaeval days, were responsible as Officers of Ordnance for the care and provision of warlike mat\u00e9riel, and to their successors the storekeepers, [[clerk]]s, [[Armed-forces artificer|artificers]], [[armourers]] and [[Storeman|storemen]] of the Board of Ordnance, the R.A.O.C. can claim a far longer continuous history and more ancient lineage than any other unit of the British Army'.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\">{{cite book |last1=Forbes |first1=Major General A. |title=The History of the Army Ordnance Services, vol.

Thereafter followed thirty years of fluctuating allocation of responsibilities and a great variety of titles of both corps and individuals. This complex, convoluted and largely unsatisfactory period insofar as Army logistics was concerned was summarised in 1889 as follows: \n{{quote|'The English Ordnance Department goes back into an older history than the Army.

The Storekeeper's department, on the other hand, was part of the [[Civilian|civil]] establishment, though (as with much of the Board's activity) troops were involved in various aspects of its operation when not [[Military deployment|deployed]] elsewhere.<ref name=\"Hogg1963\" /> In any case, modern distinctions between civilian and military personnel were not so clear cut for those serving under the Board: its officers, [[military engineers|engineers]] and [[artillerymen]] received their commissions or patents from the [[Master-General of the Ordnance]], as did the Storekeepers, artificers and storemen. Though civilians, the Storekeepers were provided with uniform, akin to that of the Royal Artillery, described in 1833 as a blue coat with red stand-collar and cuffs, gold [[epaulettes]] indicating rank and blue trousers with a gold stripe, worn with a gold-[[Hilt|hilted]] sword and a [[cocked hat]]; Clerks on the establishment wore the same uniform but without epaulettes. After [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]] they were given relative rank (for the purpose of allotting appropriate quarters): Storekeepers to rank as lieutenant colonel, Deputy Storekeepers as major (if in independent charge) or else captain, Assistant Storekeepers as lieutenant and Clerks as a non-commissioned officer.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> The Storekeepers and their Deputies had oversight of the [[Board of Ordnance#Storage and supply: the Ordnance Yards|Ordnance Yards]], both at home and abroad, however they were never deployed in the [[theatre of war]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/help-with-your-research/research-guides/royal-naval-dockyard-staff/|title=Royal Naval dockyard staff|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n====Field Train Department of the Board of Ordnance====\nBy the mid-eighteenth century, Woolwich Warren (the future [[Royal Arsenal]]) had outgrown the [[Tower of London]] as the main ordnance storage depot in the realm.<ref name=Hogg1963>{{cite book |last=Hogg |first=Brigadier O.F.G. |year=1963 |title=The Royal Arsenal Woolwich |volume=Volume I |location=London |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}\n</ref> In times of war, the Board of Ordnance Storekeepers found themselves responsible for conveying guns, ammunition and certain other items to the troops [[Field of battle|in the field]] (whereas provision of food, supplies and other equipment was largely dependent on the [[Commissariat]], a department of [[HM Treasury]]). Until 1792, the transport and issue of weapons and ammunition to troops in the [[theatre of war]] was achieved by the formation of [[artillery train]]s, as and where required. In that year, with Britain about to engage in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the Board sought to place this ''ad hoc'' arrangement on a permanent footing by establishing a '''Field Train Department'''. A Lieutenant-General of the Royal Artillery served as its Commandant and a Major-General as his Deputy, but otherwise its personnel were uniformed civilians: under a Senior [[Commissary]] based at Woolwich were Commissaries, Assistant Commissaries, Clerks of Stores and Conductors of Stores (equivalent to [[Major]]s, [[Captain (Army)|Captains]], [[subalterns]] and [[NCOs]] respectively).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" /> In peace time nothing more than a small [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of officers was maintained (at the headquarters in Woolwich), but in time of war they were supplemented by recruits from the Ordnance Storekeeper's department to serve in the field; thus the strength of the Department varied dramatically, from 4 or 5 (during the peaceful years 1828-1853) to 346 at its peak in 1813. Each recruit received special training in the handling of munitions.

At the start of the Crimean War, the Ordnance Field Train was [[mobilized]] once again. An parallel supply corps within the Army (the [[Royal Waggon Train]], first established in 1794) had been disbanded as a cost-cutting measure in 1833, however, and its responsibilities devolved again to the Commissariat (which was by now more attuned to peacetime operations than warfare);<ref name=\"Steer 2005\"/> after a well-publicised series of logistical failings the Commissariat and the Board of Ordnance, as well as the command-structure of the army itself, were all strongly criticised, leading (among other things) to the abolition of the Board (in 1855) and its Field Train Department (in 1859, its officers having transferred to the new Military Store Department).<ref name=\"Sharpe1993\" />\n\n===After Crimea===\nIn the years following the Crimean War three corps can be identified as the direct predecessors of the RAOC.  The '''Military Store Department''' (MSD) created in 1861 granted military commissions and provided officers to manage stores inventories.  In parallel a subordinate corps of warrant officers and sergeants, the '''Military Store Clerks Corps''' (MSC), was also created to carry out clerical duties.  These small corps (235 officers in the MSD and 44 MSC) were based largely at the [[Tower of London]], [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] and [[Weedon Bec]], but were also deployable on active service. They were supplemented in 1865 by the establishment at Woolwich of a '''Military Store Staff Corps'''  (MSSC) to provide soldiers:<ref>HED Harris ' the First Five Hundred Years', RAOC School, Blackdown 1962. pp65-67</ref> initially 200-strong, it had more than doubled in size by 1869, with units in Portsmouth, Devonport, Aldershot, Dublin and Chatham as well as at Woolwich and the Tower.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />\n\nIn 1870 a further reorganisation, ostensibly to simplify management, resulted in the MSD, MSC and MSSC being grouped with the [[Royal Army Service Corps|Army Service Corps]] (ASC) under the [[Control Department]].  The officers remained a separate branch (Ordnance or Military Stores) in the Control Department but the soldiers were absorbed into the ASC.  This arrangement lasted until 1876.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of Army Ordnance Services', Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 151-152</ref>\n\nThe Control Department was disbanded in 1876.  The Ordnance/Military Store officers joined a newly created '''Ordnance Stores Department''' (OSD).  Five years later, in 1881, the soldiers also left the ASC and became the '''Ordnance Store Corps''' (OSC).  In 1894 there were further changes.  The OSD was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Department''' (AOD) and absorbed the Inspectors of Machinery from the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA).  In parallel the OSC was retitled the '''Army Ordnance Corps''' (AOC) and at the same time absorbed the Corps of Armourers and the RA's Armament Artificers.<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol II pp 153-5</ref>\n\nIn 1918 the AOD and AOC amalgamated to form the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and for the first time officers and soldiers served in the same organisation; it received the \"Royal\" prefix in recognition of their service during the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/royal-army-ordnance-corps|title=Royal Army Ordnance Corps|publisher=National Army Museum|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Ordnance Services Organisation before 1914==\n[[File:Greenwich Heritage Centre, Woolwich - RA & RMA exhibition 26 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Red Barracks, Woolwich]]\n===Depots and other installations===\nThe earliest depot for military stores was the [[Tower of London]], headquarters of the [[Ordnance Office]], which for many centuries sufficed to hold the country's central stocks of artillery, gunpowder, small arms and ammunition albeit in unsatisfactory circumstances. The Tower continued to be used for storage into the 19th century, but in 1671 the Board of Ordnance acquired a parcel of land at [[Woolwich]] which soon supplanted the Tower to become the Board's main ordnance storage depot; manufacture as well as storage of guns and ammunition took place on the site, which was later named the [[Royal Arsenal]]. In 1760 the Royal Gunpowder Magazine was established at [[Purfleet]], replacing the Tower as Britain's central repository of gunpowder. In 1808 a modern purpose-built depot was constructed at [[Weedon Bec|Weedon]], alongside the Grand Union Canal, to serve as a safe repository for guns and ammunition;<ref>Major General A Forbes 'A History of the Army Ordnance Services' Medici Society, London 1929. Vol I. p192</ref> and in 1813 a new Grand Storehouse was opened in the Royal Arsenal, containing multiple warehouses for all kinds of military stores. When [[Woolwich Dockyard]] closed in 1869, the entire dockyard site was taken over by the War Office to become a vast ordnance stores complex, annexed (and [[Royal Arsenal Railway|linked by rail]]) to the ordnance stores in the Royal Arsenal; large stocks of barrack stores, [[Horse harness|harnesses]], [[accoutrements]] and other general stores were transferred to Woolwich Dockyard from the Tower at this time. At the same time the Military Store Department moved its headquarters from the Tower to the Red Fort at Woolwich (which had originally been built as the infirmary for the adjacent [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich|Royal Marine Barracks]], linked to the nearby Dockyard);<ref>{{cite book|last1=Semark|first1=H.W.|title=The Royal Naval Armament Depots of Priddy's Hard, Elson, Frater and Bedenham, 1768\u20131977|date=1997|publisher=Hampshire County Council|location=Winchester|page=124}}</ref> as [[Royal Marine Barracks, Woolwich#Red Barracks|Red Barracks]], it would continue to serve as the [[Regimental depot|regimental Depot]], headquarters and home of the ordnance corps for the next fifty years. Finally, by about 1887, large stocks of small arms were moved from the Tower of London to Weedon, leaving the Tower to serve as a repository of ancient arms and armour and as a small Ordnance centre for troops in London.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" />  \n\n[[File:Selby, Old MOD Ordnance Depot - geograph.org.uk - 159590.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[Barlby]] Ordnance Depot, dating from 1889 (one of a number of small depots established at that time).]]\nIn addition to these central depots, ordnance yards in the naval and garrison towns of [[Chatham Dockyard#The Gun Wharf|Chatham]], [[Gunwharf Quays|Portsmouth]] and [[HMNB Devonport#Morice Yard (New Gun Wharf)|Plymouth]] held reserve stocks of camp equipment, entrenching tools, small-arms and ammunition, accoutrements, harness and saddlery (similar stores were also provided at Dublin, Gibraltar and Malta). During the Crimean War, however, these arrangements proved unequal to the task of equipping an army with speed at a time of [[mobilization]]. After the war an Ordnance station was established as part of the new training camp at [[Aldershot Garrison|Aldershot]]: a hutted encampment was provided for troops to practise combined training, alongside a depot to furnish them with field stores.<ref name=\"Forbes1929\" /> In the 1880s an effort was made to decentralise the reserves of equipment; as many as sixty-two small regional centres were set up, in an effort to bring stores closer to the units that would use them. Later, with the establishment of larger camps and garrisons in the early 20th century, these were consolidated into eighteen larger Ordnance stations. At the same time, during the period from the 1860s to 1914, various depots were established to support the Army throughout the world (with the notable exception of India where the Indian Army managed its own parallel organisation in [[Ordnance Depot Quetta, Rawalpindi and Karachi]] (then British India and now Pakistan), the Indian Army Ordnance Corps (IAOC). In 1881 there were detachments in Dublin, [[Jersey]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Malta]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canada]], [[St Helena]], [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Straits Settlements]].

Both the sheer scale of the war and the increasing technical complexity created an organisational structure that, in its outlines, survives until today.  The depots at Woolwich, Weedon and Pimlico were supplemented by the wholesale takeover of warehouses throughout the country and in early 1915 a depot was established at [[Vauxhall Barracks|Didcot]] to be the major focus for the receipt and distribution of RAOC stores.

A Central Ordnance Depot (COD) and workshop to support vehicles, built on the site of the First World War [[National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell]], opened in 1937.  The operation of this depot was notable in that it mirrored and tried to improve on best civilian practice at the time; this became a hallmark of RAOC development in the following decades. [[Branston Depot|COD Branston]] was established in 1938, initially to serve as the Army's main clothing store, freeing up space at COD Didcot.

The more mobile nature of the Second World War also led to the creation of units at divisional and corps level with higher levels of mobility.  The most notable of these was the ordnance field park, principally carrying vehicle and technical stores spares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/royal-army-ordnance-corps/field-parks.html|title=Ordnance Field Parks 1 to 19|publisher=British Army units 1945 on|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Post-war to 1993==\n[[File:Wheelbarrow bomb disposal device being operated by a team from 321 EOD MOD 45159057.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wheelbarrow (robot)|Wheelbarrow]] bomb disposal device being operated by a team from [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Coy]] RAOC, Northern Ireland 1978.]]\nDuring the war the RAOC HQ (together with the RAOC School) had moved from Hilsea to [[Middleton Stoney]] (Bicester); in 1946 it moved again to Matthew Barracks, [[Tidworth Camp|Tidworth]] and shortly afterwards to [[Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut|Deepcut]].

As well as disposing of large amounts of surplus stock from depots at home, and returning in good order sites that had been requisitioned for the duration of the war, RAOC units were heavily involved in clearing ammunition from Germany's former depots and dealing with live devices still in the field. The RAOC's skills in bomb disposal were later put to increasing use in dealing with terrorist devices at home as well as in conflict zones overseas. The training of Ammunition Examiners, [[Ammunition Technician]]s and [[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s at the [[Army School of Ammunition]] became progressively more specialised during the 1950s and '60s. In May 1970 a section of [[321 EOD Squadron RLC|321 EOD Unit]] was sent to [[Northern Ireland]] to support the local ammunition inspectorate in dealing with [[improvised explosive devices]]; what was initially a 6-month deployment marked the start of a much longer involvement through [[the Troubles]].<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nIn the period 1945\u201393 the RAOC, as with the rest of the Army, reduced greatly in size and closed its worldwide bases as garrisons withdrew.

Consisting of a blue tunic with red collar and cuffs and blue trousers with a double red stripe, it continued to be worn by the band (and in mess-dress form) until the corps' amalgamation.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\nThe RAOC Band had first been formed in 1922; the regimental march (chosen by its first Bandmaster, WOI R. T. Stevens, as appropriate to the Corps' role and to its artisans) was ''[[The Village Blacksmith]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wt_oDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22The+Village+Blacksmith%22+RAOC+Regimental+March&source=bl&ots=U-z0V1mm_O&sig=ACfU3U1ztctrAnaGxWHddfQE3SU5TYKaoA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjvvsmTxKbmAhVHXMAKHcCZCyQQ6AEwCXoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22The%20Village%20Blacksmith%22%20RAOC%20Regimental%20March&f=false|title=From the Archives: An eclectic mix of stories from the history of REME|first= Mike|last= Sibbons|page=110|publisher=Osprey|year=2016|isbn=978-1472822338}}</ref>\n\nIn common with the Royal Artillery, the RAOC had [[St Barbara]] as its [[patron saint]]. The garrison church, first at Hilsea and then at Deepcut, was dedicated in her name; the pulpit, organ, stained glass windows and several memorials were transferred from the former to the latter when Hilsea Barracks closed in 1962. There was also a St Barbara's Church at CAD Bramley, which had originally come from the depot in Pimlico; having done service in Bramley for 52 years it was again disassembled in 1978 and moved to Didcot.<ref name=\"Steer 2005\" />\n\n===The RAOC Gazette===\nThe official journal of the corps was the RAOC Gazette.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1506000766|title=The Royal Army Ordnance Corps Gazette, the journal of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and the Army Ornance Services|publisher=Imperial War Museum|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Recruiting==\nBefore the [[Second World War]], RAOC recruits were required to be at least 5 feet 2 inches tall (5 feet 4 inches for Driver Mechanics) and could enlist up to 25 years of age. They initially enlisted for three years with the colours and a further nine years with the reserve. Fitters could also choose six years with the colours and six years in the reserve, or eight and four years. Clerks and Storemen enlisted for six years and six years. They trained at the RAOC Depot, [[Hilsea Barracks]], [[Portsmouth]], before proceeding to specialist trade training. Armourers were only recruited from boy entrants and enlisted for twelve years. Armament Artificers trained at the [[Royal Military College of Science|Military College of Science]], [[Woolwich]] for fifteen months. Half of them were serving soldiers who were already qualified fitters. Armament Artificers had to be at least 22 years of age and could enlist up to 30; they enlisted for twelve years and were promoted [[Staff Sergeant]] as soon as they had completed training.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Conductor (British Army)]]\n* [[Staff Sergeant Major]]\n* [[Allum Green]]\n* [[Army engineering maintenance]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Royal Army Ordnance Corps}}\n* [http://www.raoconline.com/ RAOC Forum]\n* [http://www.army.mod.uk/logistic/23567.aspx/ RAOC Association]\n* [http://www.juniorleadersraoc.co.uk/ RAOC ex Boy Soldiers Association]\n* [http://www.stt8003.btck.co.uk/ Sua Tela Tonanti Lodge No 8003 under the United Grand Lodge of England - the Corps (and RLC) associated Freemason's lodge]\n\n[[Category:British administrative corps]]\n[[Category:Royal Logistic Corps]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1993]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations established in 1918]]\n", "name_user": "PeterFV", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eField units", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Army_Ordnance_Corps"}
