{"title_page": "X-ray image intensifier", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=June 2010}}\n\nAn '''X-ray image intensifier''' (XRII) is an [[image intensifier]] that converts [[X-ray]]s into visible light at higher [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] than the more traditional [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] screens can. Such intensifiers are used in X-ray imaging systems (such as [[fluoroscopy|fluoroscopes]]) to allow low-intensity X-rays to be converted to a conveniently [[brightness|bright]] visible light output. The device contains a low absorbency/scatter input window, typically aluminum, input fluorescent screen, photocathode, electron optics, output fluorescent screen and output window. These parts are all mounted in a high vacuum environment within glass or more recently, metal/ceramic. By its [[amplifier|intensifying]] effect, It allows the viewer to more easily see the structure of the object being imaged than fluorescent screens alone, whose images are dim. The XRII requires lower [[absorbed dose]]s due to more efficient conversion of X-ray quanta to visible light. This device was originally introduced in 1948.<ref>{{cite book|last=Krestel|first=Erich|title=Imaging Systems for Medical Diagnostics|year=1990|publisher=Siemens Aktiengesellschaft|location=Berlin and Munich|isbn=3-8009-1564-2|pages=318\u2013327}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Operation==\n\n[[File:XiiSchematic.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic of an X-ray image intensifier]]\nThe overall function of an image intensifier is to convert incident x-ray photons to light photons of sufficient intensity to provide a viewable image. This occurs in several stages. The first is conversion of X-ray photons to light photons by the input [[phosphor]].

The output window is typically made of silver-activated zinc-cadmium sulfide and converts incident electrons back to visible light photons.<ref name=\"AAPMRSNA\" /> At the input and output phosphors the number of photons is multiplied by several thousands, so that overall there is a large brightness gain.
