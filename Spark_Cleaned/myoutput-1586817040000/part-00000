He was primarily a ceramics manufacturer; producing the designs of many artists and architects of the French [[Art Nouveau]] movement; including: [[Jules Lavirotte]], [[Hector Guimard]], [[Louis Majorelle]], [[Henri Sauvage]], [[Henry van de Velde]], [[Auguste Perret]], Andre Arfidson, [[Anatole de Baudot]] and more.\n\nBigot was a physics and chemistry instructor who became interested in ceramics in 1889 after viewing Chinese porcelain at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris.

Architectural ceramics were reaching the pinnacle of their popularity and Bigot took the opportunity to found his own company, ''A. Bigot et Cie''. This enterprise, which employed up to 150 workers and counted 10 industrial kilns, produced numerous trinkets, vases and vessels which were on display in his shop, which he transferred in Paris from the rue d'Assas to the rue des Petites-\u00c9curies.\n\nAlong with Emile Muller, Bigot thus became the principal figure in architectural ceramics in France, and from 1898 he worked to integrate ceramics with fa\u00e7ades of reinforced concrete. This architectural outlet explains, by implication, the membership of his company in the Union Syndicale des architetes, but also the relaxation of the urban regulations of 1882 which favored the appearance of projecting elements, such as oriel bays, that broke up the uniformity of fa\u00e7ades.\n\nThe collaboration with [[Hector Guimard]] at the end of the decade marked the beginning of Bigot's fame with architectural ceramics. Before then his work had been confined essentially to baths and restaurants. But in 1898, Guimard's Castel Beranger emerged as the manifesto of Art Nouveau in architecture and its ceramics were commissioned from Bigot, who decorated the fa\u00e7ade with picturesque details and covered the entrance breezeway with highly plastic molded panels designed to evoke the atmosphere of a grotto.
