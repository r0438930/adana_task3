More than 2000 people have died in this inhospitable terrain, mostly due to weather extremes and the natural hazards of [[mountain warfare]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe conflict in Siachen stems from the incompletely demarcated territory on the map beyond the map coordinate known as [[NJ9842]] ({{Coord|35.008371|77.008805}}). The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>\n\n===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===\nFollowing the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,<ref name=\":0\" /> but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.\n\nParagraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:\n{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease-fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}\n\nLater, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the \"Line of Control\" extending from the \"''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''\"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers.\"'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.<ref name=\":0\" />  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:<blockquote>''\"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842\"''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&lpg=PA61&dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2 September 2003}}</ref></blockquote> The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL \u2013 UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.\n\n==== U.N. map of ceasefire line ====\nTitle of [[U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2 which illustrates the CFL as per the Karachi Agreement reads:\n\n<blockquote>Map of the State of Jammu and Kashmir showing the Cease Fire Line as Agreed Upon in the Karachi Agreement, Ratified by the Governments of India and Pakistan on 29 and 30 July Respectively.

Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H. Katayama, which approached through Pakistan via the Bilafond La.<ref>SANGAKU 71</ref>\n\nIn 1978 a German Siachen-Kondus Expedition under the leadership of Jaroslav Poncar (further members Volker Stallbohm and Wolfgang Kohl, liaison officer major Asad Raza) entered Siachen via Bilafond La and established the base camp on the confluence of Siachen and Teram Shehr. The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.\n\nPrior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph \u2013 Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>\n\n=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===\n\nMaps from Pakistan, the United Nations and various global atlases depicted the CFL ending at NJ9842 until the mid 1960s.<ref name=tribune/> The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show a boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&nbsp;m (18,136&nbsp;ft) on the China border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566_g-7d.jpg|date=1967|title=TPC G-7D|publisher=US Defense Mapping Agency|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>  This line was replicated on US, Pakistani and other maps in the 1970s and 1980s, which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\"/>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Old Map Showing Siachen as Part of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n| [[File:The Trekker's Guide to the Himalaya and Karakoram 2.jpg|thumb|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n|}\n\n==Military expeditions==\n\nIn 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.\n\n==Major combat operations==\n\nAt army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits\u2014twice as many as we had\u2014and rushed their men up to Siachen\".

Men of the Ladakh Scouts and [[Kumaon Regiment]] occupy Bilafond La on 13 April and Sia La on 17 April 1984 with the help of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes.

The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]...

Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200&nbsp;million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some estimates, 97% of the casualties in Siachen have been due to weather and altitude, rather than actual fighting.<ref name=\"Jack\">{{cite book\n  |last = Ives\n  |first = Jack\n  |title = Himalayan Perceptions: Environmental Change and the Well-Being of Mountain Peoples\n  |publisher = Routledge, 2004\n  |isbn = 9781134369089|date = 5 August 2004\n }}</ref> In 2012, an avalanche [[2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche|hit Pakistan's Gayari military base, killing 129 soldiers and 11 civilians]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| publisher=Bbc.co.uk| title=Pakistan declares Siachen avalanche buried dead| date=29 May 2012| access-date=21 June 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| archive-date=18 January 2016| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|title=Siachen: Pakistan declares buried troops dead after 52 days \u2013 Hindustan Times|publisher=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=7 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011175924/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Kargil War==\nOne of the factors behind the [[Kargil War]] in 1999 when Pakistan sent infiltrators to occupy vacated Indian posts across the [[Line of Control]] was their belief that India would be forced to withdraw from Siachen in exchange of a Pakistani withdrawal from Kargil.<ref name=\"India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vZKO2XtiFMC |title=India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia |last=Ganguly |first=Sumit |last2=Kapur |first2=S.

The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>\n\n===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===\nFollowing the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier.

Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H.

The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.\n\nPrior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph \u2013 Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>\n\n=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===\n\nMaps from Pakistan, the United Nations and various global atlases depicted the CFL ending at NJ9842 until the mid 1960s.<ref name=tribune/> The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show a boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&nbsp;m (18,136&nbsp;ft) on the China border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566_g-7d.jpg|date=1967|title=TPC G-7D|publisher=US Defense Mapping Agency|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>  This line was replicated on US, Pakistani and other maps in the 1970s and 1980s, which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\"/>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Old Map Showing Siachen as Part of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n| [[File:The Trekker's Guide to the Himalaya and Karakoram 2.jpg|thumb|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n|}\n\n==Military expeditions==\n\nIn 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.\n\n==Major combat operations==\n\nAt army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits\u2014twice as many as we had\u2014and rushed their men up to Siachen\".

Men of the Ladakh Scouts and [[Kumaon Regiment]] occupy Bilafond La on 13 April and Sia La on 17 April 1984 with the help of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes.

The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army.

Even before then, every year more soldiers were killed because of severe weather than enemy firing. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200&nbsp;million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some estimates, 97% of the casualties in Siachen have been due to weather and altitude, rather than actual fighting.<ref name=\"Jack\">{{cite book\n  |last = Ives\n  |first = Jack\n  |title = Himalayan Perceptions: Environmental Change and the Well-Being of Mountain Peoples\n  |publisher = Routledge, 2004\n  |isbn = 9781134369089|date = 5 August 2004\n }}</ref> In 2012, an avalanche [[2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche|hit Pakistan's Gayari military base, killing 129 soldiers and 11 civilians]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| publisher=Bbc.co.uk| title=Pakistan declares Siachen avalanche buried dead| date=29 May 2012| access-date=21 June 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| archive-date=18 January 2016| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|title=Siachen: Pakistan declares buried troops dead after 52 days \u2013 Hindustan Times|publisher=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=7 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011175924/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Kargil War==\nOne of the factors behind the [[Kargil War]] in 1999 when Pakistan sent infiltrators to occupy vacated Indian posts across the [[Line of Control]] was their belief that India would be forced to withdraw from Siachen in exchange of a Pakistani withdrawal from Kargil.<ref name=\"India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vZKO2XtiFMC |title=India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia |last=Ganguly |first=Sumit |last2=Kapur |first2=S.
