Later the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI) became the dominant opposition party. In the 1967 state assembly elections, all socialist parties were eliminated and the CPI lost opposition party status.\n\nThe INC ruled the state from 1956 to 1982. In 1983, the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) won the state elections and [[N. T. Rama Rao]] became the chief minister of the state for the first time. This broke the long-time single party monopoly enjoyed by the INC. The 1989 elections ended the rule of Rao, with the INC returning to power with [[Marri Chenna Reddy]] at the helm. He was replaced by [[Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy|Janardhan Reddy]] in 1990, who was replaced by [[Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy]] in 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Andhra Pradesh gave a mandate to the Telugu Desam Party again, and Rao became the chief minister again.

Later the [[Communist Party of India]] (CPI) became the dominant opposition party. In the 1967 state assembly elections, all socialist parties were eliminated and the CPI lost opposition party status.\n\nThe INC ruled the state from 1956 to 1982. In 1983, the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) won the state elections and [[N. T. Rama Rao]] became the chief minister of the state for the first time. This broke the long-time single party monopoly enjoyed by the INC. The 1989 elections ended the rule of Rao, with the INC returning to power with [[Marri Chenna Reddy]] at the helm. He was replaced by [[Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy|Janardhan Reddy]] in 1990, who was replaced by [[Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy]] in 1992.\n\nIn 1994, Andhra Pradesh gave a mandate to the Telugu Desam Party again, and Rao became the chief minister again.
