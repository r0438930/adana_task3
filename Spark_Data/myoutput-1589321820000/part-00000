However, it is learned that Frost cheated by using a hidden poisoned needle, thus allowing Piccolo and Goku back into the competition, however Piccolo declines reentry and Goku is placed after Vegeta, who declines to accept Frost's disqualification. Vegeta then quickly defeats Frost by ring out. Vegeta struggles against the impervious [[Otta Magetta]], but succeeds when he insults him, resulting in the mentally delicate metal man becoming depressed and unable to fight. During his fight against [[Cabbe]], Vegeta taunts and insults the young Saiyan in order to help him achieve Super Saiyan, before quickly knocking him out. Unable to land even a single blow, Vegeta is then defeated by [[Hit (Dragon Ball)|Hit]]. Although able to keep up with Hit, Goku acknowledges Hit is limited by the rule of not being able to kill and steps out of bounds in order to see Monaka fight. However, Hit realizes Monaka is not actually a fighter and throws their match. As winner, Beerus uses the Super Dragon Balls to restore the humans on Universe 6's Earth. [[Zen\u014d-sama]], the Lord of Everything who rules over all 12 Universes, shows up and says he will organize a similar tournament among all the universes. [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]], who previously traveled back in time from the future, returns having fled from someone he calls [[Goku Black]], a Goku doppelg\u00e4nger in his timeline who wants to annihilate all mortals on Earth in the name of justice and has already done so to several other planets.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 3\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = June 2, 2017<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881084-3 |title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d853 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2017-05-18 |language=Japanese |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023064116/http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881084-3 |archivedate=2017-10-23 }}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881084-3\n| LicensedRelDate = July 3, 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-3/product/5545 |title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 3 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-42-159946-5\n| ChapterList   =\n{{Numbered list|start=16\n|{{nihongo|\"Future Trunks' Past\"|\u201c\u672a\u6765\u201d\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3\u30af\u30b9\u306e\u904e\u53bb|\u201cMirai\u201d Torankusu no Kako}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Zamas: The Next Lord of Lords from Universe 10\"|\u6b21\u671f\u7b2c\uff11\uff10\u5b87\u5b99\u754c\u738b\u795e\u5019\u88dc\u30b6\u30de\u30b9|Jiki Dai-J\u016b Uch\u016b Kai\u014dshin K\u014dho Zamasu}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Goku Black's True Identity\"|\u30b4\u30af\u30a6\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af\u306e\u6b63\u4f53|Gok\u016b Burakku no Sh\u014dtai}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Another Zamas\"|\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u4eba\u306e\u30b6\u30de\u30b9|M\u014d Hitori no Zamasu}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Zero Human Project\"|\u4eba\u9593\u30bc\u30ed\u8a08\u753b|Ningen Zero Keikaku}}\n}}\n| LicensedTitle = The Zero Human Project\n| OriginalTitle = \u4eba\u9593\u30bc\u30ed\u8a08\u753b\n| TranslitTitle = Ningen Zero Keikaku\n| Summary       = Just before the appearance of Goku Black, Trunks trained under the [[Kai\u014d-shin]] in order to defeat [[Bobbidi]] in his timeline. He succeeded in stopping the resurrection of [[Majin Boo]], but Kai\u014d-shin died, causing the death of Beerus too. Beerus and Whis deduce that Goku Black must be an upper-level god himself to know that the Lord of Lords' life is connected to that of the God of Destruction's. Meanwhile, Zen\u014d-sama summons Goku to his palace to be his friend and gives him a button to press to summon him. In an investigation to prevent this from happening in their own timeline, Beerus and Whis identify [[Zamas]], Northern [[Kai\u014d (Dragon Ball)|Lord of Worlds]] in [[Universe 10 (Dragon Ball)|Universe 10]] and apprentice Lord of Lords under [[Gowas]] who feels wiping out unworthy mortals is appropriate for Lords of Lords, as the culprit and destroy him. Goku Black/Zamas killed Gowas, used the Super Dragon Balls to switch bodies with Goku and killed him, traveled in time to Trunks' timeline, and killed the remaining Lords of Lords which in turn killed the Gods of Destruction. Meanwhile, Vegeta is about to defeat Goku Black when the Zamas of Trunks' timeline appears and heals him, increasing his strength as Saiyans do and reaching a new level he dubs Super Saiyan Ros\u00e9. It is revealed that Zamas used the Dragon Balls to make himself immortal. Trunks distracts Goku Black and Zamas so Goku and Vegeta can flee back to their timeline.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 4\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = November 2, 2017<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881163-5 |title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d854 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2017-09-21 |language=Japanese |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921144826/http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881163-5 |archivedate=2017-09-21 }}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881163-5\n| LicensedRelDate = January 1, 2019<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-4/product/5775 |title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 4 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-9747-0144-5\n| ChapterList   =\n{{Numbered list|start=21\n|{{nihongo|\"Last Chance for Hope\"|HOPE\u3078\u306e\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30b9|H\u014dpu e no Rasuto Chansu}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Zamas' Final Trump Card\"|\u30b6\u30de\u30b9\u306e\u6700\u7d42\u624b\u6bb5|Zamasu no Saish\u016b Shudan}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Potara's True Worth\"|\u30dd\u30bf\u30e9\u306e\u771f\u4fa1|Potara no Shinka}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Son Goku's Evolution\"|\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a\u306e\u9032\u5316|Son Gok\u016b no Shinka}}\n}}\n| LicensedTitle = Last Chance for Hope\n| OriginalTitle = HOPE\u3078\u306e\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3\u30b9 \n| TranslitTitle = H\u014dpu e no Rasuto Chansu\n| Summary       = Goku goes to [[Kame-Sennin]] to learn the ''Maf\u016b-ba'' technique, while Vegeta trains in the Room of Spirit and Time.

Goku tries to lock Zamas away using the ''Maf\u016b-ba'', but forgot the talisman to seal it. Losing the battle, Goku Black and Zamas use their Potara earrings to fuse into one body they call \"God Zamas\". Having learned that Potara fusion only lasts one hour when the users are not Lord of Lords, Goku and Vegeta use it to form Vegerot. Although they are winning in Super Saiyan Blue form, Goku and Vegeta separate early as the fusion was unstable either due to their massive power or because they are mortal. Having realized that he possesses healing powers from apprenticing under a Lord of Lords, Trunks heals Goku's injuries. Having now perfected Super Saiyan Blue, Goku is able to stand up to God Zamas although it is damaging his body.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 5\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = March 2, 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881447-6|title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d855 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2018-02-21 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881447-6\n| LicensedRelDate = May 7, 2019<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-5/product/5898 |title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 5 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-05-11}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-9747-0458-3\n| ChapterList   =\n{{Numbered list|start=25\n|{{nihongo|\"Will It Be Goku?!

When their Portara fusion starts separating due to the hour time limit, Trunks cuts them in two with his sword and seemingly finishes off Goku Black. But during the fusion their cells joined, meaning the immortal God Zamas was simply split into two. When Vegeta fires an attack blowing them to pieces, they split into even more copies. Realizing the futility, everyone plans to flee to the main timeline while Goku and Vegeta buy as much time as possible against an army of God Zamas. However, Goku remembers the button Zen\u014d-sama gave him and presses it summoning the Zen\u014d-sama of Trunks' timeline, who then destroys the universe and God Zamas, while everyone else flees to the main timeline. Goku travels back one more time to get that Zen\u014d-sama and bring him to the Zen\u014d-sama of the main timeline, while Trunks and Mai later travel back to their timeline but before the Lord of Lords died so they can warn Beerus about Zamas. Beerus ignores Goku when asked about the interuniverse tournament that Zen\u014d-sama talked about, so he goes to the two Zen\u014d-samas to remind them. The Zen\u014d-samas plan to hold it in 40 hours and summon the Gods of Destruction from all 12 universes, their Angels, and the Lords of Lords to tell them about the Tournament of Power. Because future Zen\u014d-sama has never seen one before, it is decided that a Zen Exhibition Match will be held as a battle royale amongst all the Gods of Destruction. Realizing this is all Goku's fault, the Gods of Destruction all decide to gang up on Beerus, who dodges them all, until [[Belmod]] attacks Sidra and reminds them it is every man for themselves.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 6\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = June 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881501-5|title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d856 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2018-05-21 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881501-5\n| LicensedRelDate = September 3, 2019<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-6/product/6017|title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 6 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-9747-0520-7\n| ChapterList   =\n{{Numbered list|start=29\n|{{nihongo|\"Toppo, Universe 11 God of Destruction Candidate!|\u7b2c11\u5b87\u5b99\u7834\u58ca\u795e\u5019\u88dc\u30c8\u30c3\u30dd|Dai J\u016b Ichi Uch\u016b Hakaishin K\u014dho Toppo}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Man Named Jiren|\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7537|Jiren to Iu Otoko}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Super Warriors Gather!\"|\u96c6\u307e\u308c\u8d85\u6226\u58eb\u305f\u3061\uff01|Atsumare Ch\u014d Senshi-Tachi\uff01}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Super Warriors Gather!

However, a new one between mortals Goku and [[Toppo (Dragon Ball)|Toppo]], Belmod's apprentice to succeed him as God of Destruction, is held instead. Goku loses and Toppo informs him that a mortal named [[Jiren (Dragon Ball)|Jiren]] is the strongest in [[Universe 11 (Dragon Ball)|Universe 11]], stronger than even Belmod. The rules for the Tournament of Power between universes are explained; each universe will select 10 fighters to compete in a 48 minute battle royale, no weapons or medicines allowed, and no killing. Thus, eliminating opponents by knocking them out of the ring is the goal. The team with the most fighters remaining at the end will win a wish with the Super Dragon Balls, while the losing universes will be erased by the Zen\u014d-samas. Although Universes 1, 12, 5 and 8 are exempt from participating and erasure due to their high average \"mortal levels.\" The competing universes have 39 hours to form their teams. In Universe 11, Toppo recruits his fellow Pride Troopers, including [[Dyspo]] and Jiren. In Universe 6, Cabbe recruits two female Saiyans, [[Caulifla]] and [[Kale (Dragon Ball)|Kale]]. In Universe 7, Vegeta, Piccolo, Kame-Sennin, [[Kuririn]], [[Android 18]], [[Gohan]] and [[Tenshinhan]] are recruited easily enough. Goku then seeks out and recruits [[Android 17]], who has become a [[wildlife conservationist]] on a [[wildlife sanctuary]]. In order to complete their roster, they are forced to have [[Baba Uranai]] revive the dead [[Freeza]] for 24 hours, promising to fully resurrect him if they win.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 7\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = September 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881575-6|title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d857 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2018-07-22 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881575-6\n| LicensedRelDate = December 3, 2019<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-7/product/6111|title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 7 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-9747-0777-5\n| ChapterList   = \n{{Numbered list|start=33\n|{{nihongo|\"Universe Survival!

Freeza forms an alliance with Frost, directing him to take out his own teammates Kuririn and Tenshinhan and then to go all out on others. Tired after knocking out seven more people, Frost is then betrayed by Freeza and eliminated. Freeza also eliminates the Trio de Dangers, making [[Universe 9 (Dragon Ball)|Universe 9]] the first to lose and the first erased from existence. Trying to fight Jiren, Goku is held back by the other Pride Troopers until he sees Jiren knock down Hit and charges at him in Super Saiyan Blue. However, neither man is able to land a strike until Hit stops Jiren from knocking Goku out, settling a debt from their last fight. Hit proposes the two team up while he uses his new technique on Jiren, but Goku declines wanting to beat Jiren alone and alludes to wanting to first achieve a new transformation. Hit's new technique slows Jiren down, allowing him to push him to the edge of the ring, but Jiren was only acting and easily knocks Hit out of contention. Android 18 has trouble with [[Ribrianne]] and her two subordinates, until she gets distracted by 18's handsome husband Kuririn. But as 18 is about to eliminate them, all four plus two more contestants are knocked out by an invisible fighter from [[Universe 4 (Dragon Ball)|Universe 4]], who is then stopped by Piccolo. However, Piccolo is then eliminated by another fighter from the same Universe that no one can spot. This causes everyone to be on guard, until Android 17 uses his hearing to learn that the opponent was not invisible but insect-size and eliminates him. 37 fighters are left, with 33 minutes remaining in the tournament.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 8\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = December 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/items/contents.html?isbn=978-4-08-881649-4|title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d85 8 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2018-10-27 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881649-4\n| LicensedRelDate = March 3, 2020<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-8/product/6193|title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 8 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-9747-0941-0\n| ChapterList   = \n{{Numbered list|start=37\n|{{nihongo|\"Awaken, Super Saiyan Kale\"|\u899a\u9192\u00b7\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb|Kakusei \u00b7 Supa Saiya-jin K\u0113ru}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Universe 6's Last Resort\"|\u7b2c6\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u6700\u7d42\u624b\u6bb5|Dai Roku Uch\u016b no Saish\u016b Shudan}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Sign of Son Goku's Awakening\"|\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a\u899a\u9192\u306e\u201d\u5146\u201d|Son Gok\u016b Kakusei no \"Kizashi\"}} \n|{{nihongo|\"Jiren vs. Universe 7\"|\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3\uff36\uff33\u7b2c7\u5b87\u5b99|Jiren B\u0101sasu Dai nana Uch\u016b}}\n}}\n| LicensedTitle = Sign of Son Goku's Awakening\n| OriginalTitle = \u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a\u899a\u9192\u306e\u201d\u5146\u201d\n| TranslitTitle = Son Gok\u016b Kakusei no \"Kizashi\"\n| Summary       = The Tournament of Power begins to heat up as less than half of the fighters in the competition remain.

However, it is learned that Frost cheated by using a hidden poisoned needle, thus allowing Piccolo and Goku back into the competition, however Piccolo declines reentry and Goku is placed after Vegeta, who declines to accept Frost's disqualification. Vegeta then quickly defeats Frost by ring out. Vegeta struggles against the impervious [[Otta Magetta]], but succeeds when he insults him, resulting in the mentally delicate metal man becoming depressed and unable to fight. During his fight against [[Cabbe]], Vegeta taunts and insults the young Saiyan in order to help him achieve Super Saiyan, before quickly knocking him out. Unable to land even a single blow, Vegeta is then defeated by [[Hit (Dragon Ball)|Hit]]. Although able to keep up with Hit, Goku acknowledges Hit is limited by the rule of not being able to kill and steps out of bounds in order to see Monaka fight. However, Hit realizes Monaka is not actually a fighter and throws their match. As winner, Beerus uses the Super Dragon Balls to restore the humans on Universe 6's Earth.

He succeeded in stopping the resurrection of [[Majin Boo]], but Kai\u014d-shin died, causing the death of Beerus too. Beerus and Whis deduce that Goku Black must be an upper-level god himself to know that the Lord of Lords' life is connected to that of the God of Destruction's. Meanwhile, Zen\u014d-sama summons Goku to his palace to be his friend and gives him a button to press to summon him. In an investigation to prevent this from happening in their own timeline, Beerus and Whis identify [[Zamas]], Northern [[Kai\u014d (Dragon Ball)|Lord of Worlds]] in [[Universe 10 (Dragon Ball)|Universe 10]] and apprentice Lord of Lords under [[Gowas]] who feels wiping out unworthy mortals is appropriate for Lords of Lords, as the culprit and destroy him. Goku Black/Zamas killed Gowas, used the Super Dragon Balls to switch bodies with Goku and killed him, traveled in time to Trunks' timeline, and killed the remaining Lords of Lords which in turn killed the Gods of Destruction. Meanwhile, Vegeta is about to defeat Goku Black when the Zamas of Trunks' timeline appears and heals him, increasing his strength as Saiyans do and reaching a new level he dubs Super Saiyan Ros\u00e9. It is revealed that Zamas used the Dragon Balls to make himself immortal.

Losing the battle, Goku Black and Zamas use their Potara earrings to fuse into one body they call \"God Zamas\". Having learned that Potara fusion only lasts one hour when the users are not Lord of Lords, Goku and Vegeta use it to form Vegerot. Although they are winning in Super Saiyan Blue form, Goku and Vegeta separate early as the fusion was unstable either due to their massive power or because they are mortal. Having realized that he possesses healing powers from apprenticing under a Lord of Lords, Trunks heals Goku's injuries.

When their Portara fusion starts separating due to the hour time limit, Trunks cuts them in two with his sword and seemingly finishes off Goku Black. But during the fusion their cells joined, meaning the immortal God Zamas was simply split into two. When Vegeta fires an attack blowing them to pieces, they split into even more copies. Realizing the futility, everyone plans to flee to the main timeline while Goku and Vegeta buy as much time as possible against an army of God Zamas. However, Goku remembers the button Zen\u014d-sama gave him and presses it summoning the Zen\u014d-sama of Trunks' timeline, who then destroys the universe and God Zamas, while everyone else flees to the main timeline. Goku travels back one more time to get that Zen\u014d-sama and bring him to the Zen\u014d-sama of the main timeline, while Trunks and Mai later travel back to their timeline but before the Lord of Lords died so they can warn Beerus about Zamas. Beerus ignores Goku when asked about the interuniverse tournament that Zen\u014d-sama talked about, so he goes to the two Zen\u014d-samas to remind them. The Zen\u014d-samas plan to hold it in 40 hours and summon the Gods of Destruction from all 12 universes, their Angels, and the Lords of Lords to tell them about the Tournament of Power. Because future Zen\u014d-sama has never seen one before, it is decided that a Zen Exhibition Match will be held as a battle royale amongst all the Gods of Destruction. Realizing this is all Goku's fault, the Gods of Destruction all decide to gang up on Beerus, who dodges them all, until [[Belmod]] attacks Sidra and reminds them it is every man for themselves.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 6\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = June 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881501-5|title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d856 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2018-05-21 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881501-5\n| LicensedRelDate = September 3, 2019<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-6/product/6017|title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 6 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-9747-0520-7\n| ChapterList   =\n{{Numbered list|start=29\n|{{nihongo|\"Toppo, Universe 11 God of Destruction Candidate!|\u7b2c11\u5b87\u5b99\u7834\u58ca\u795e\u5019\u88dc\u30c8\u30c3\u30dd|Dai J\u016b Ichi Uch\u016b Hakaishin K\u014dho Toppo}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Man Named Jiren|\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u7537|Jiren to Iu Otoko}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Super Warriors Gather!\"|\u96c6\u307e\u308c\u8d85\u6226\u58eb\u305f\u3061\uff01|Atsumare Ch\u014d Senshi-Tachi\uff01}}\n|{{nihongo|\"The Super Warriors Gather!

However, a new one between mortals Goku and [[Toppo (Dragon Ball)|Toppo]], Belmod's apprentice to succeed him as God of Destruction, is held instead. Goku loses and Toppo informs him that a mortal named [[Jiren (Dragon Ball)|Jiren]] is the strongest in [[Universe 11 (Dragon Ball)|Universe 11]], stronger than even Belmod. The rules for the Tournament of Power between universes are explained; each universe will select 10 fighters to compete in a 48 minute battle royale, no weapons or medicines allowed, and no killing. Thus, eliminating opponents by knocking them out of the ring is the goal. The team with the most fighters remaining at the end will win a wish with the Super Dragon Balls, while the losing universes will be erased by the Zen\u014d-samas. Although Universes 1, 12, 5 and 8 are exempt from participating and erasure due to their high average \"mortal levels.\" The competing universes have 39 hours to form their teams. In Universe 11, Toppo recruits his fellow Pride Troopers, including [[Dyspo]] and Jiren. In Universe 6, Cabbe recruits two female Saiyans, [[Caulifla]] and [[Kale (Dragon Ball)|Kale]]. In Universe 7, Vegeta, Piccolo, Kame-Sennin, [[Kuririn]], [[Android 18]], [[Gohan]] and [[Tenshinhan]] are recruited easily enough. Goku then seeks out and recruits [[Android 17]], who has become a [[wildlife conservationist]] on a [[wildlife sanctuary]]. In order to complete their roster, they are forced to have [[Baba Uranai]] revive the dead [[Freeza]] for 24 hours, promising to fully resurrect him if they win.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 7\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = September 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/CGI/search/syousai_put.cgi?isbn_cd=978-4-08-881575-6|title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d857 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2018-07-22 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881575-6\n| LicensedRelDate = December 3, 2019<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-7/product/6111|title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 7 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-9747-0777-5\n| ChapterList   = \n{{Numbered list|start=33\n|{{nihongo|\"Universe Survival!

Freeza forms an alliance with Frost, directing him to take out his own teammates Kuririn and Tenshinhan and then to go all out on others. Tired after knocking out seven more people, Frost is then betrayed by Freeza and eliminated. Freeza also eliminates the Trio de Dangers, making [[Universe 9 (Dragon Ball)|Universe 9]] the first to lose and the first erased from existence. Trying to fight Jiren, Goku is held back by the other Pride Troopers until he sees Jiren knock down Hit and charges at him in Super Saiyan Blue. However, neither man is able to land a strike until Hit stops Jiren from knocking Goku out, settling a debt from their last fight. Hit proposes the two team up while he uses his new technique on Jiren, but Goku declines wanting to beat Jiren alone and alludes to wanting to first achieve a new transformation. Hit's new technique slows Jiren down, allowing him to push him to the edge of the ring, but Jiren was only acting and easily knocks Hit out of contention. Android 18 has trouble with [[Ribrianne]] and her two subordinates, until she gets distracted by 18's handsome husband Kuririn. But as 18 is about to eliminate them, all four plus two more contestants are knocked out by an invisible fighter from [[Universe 4 (Dragon Ball)|Universe 4]], who is then stopped by Piccolo. However, Piccolo is then eliminated by another fighter from the same Universe that no one can spot. This causes everyone to be on guard, until Android 17 uses his hearing to learn that the opponent was not invisible but insect-size and eliminates him. 37 fighters are left, with 33 minutes remaining in the tournament.\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n| VolumeNumber    = 8\n| SublistOf       = List of Dragon Ball manga volumes\n| OriginalRelDate = December 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.shueisha.co.jp/items/contents.html?isbn=978-4-08-881649-4|title=\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u8d85 8 |publisher=[[Shueisha]] |accessdate=2018-10-27 |language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| OriginalISBN    = 978-4-08-881649-4\n| LicensedRelDate = March 3, 2020<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/dragon-ball-super-volume-8/product/6193|title=Dragon Ball Super, Vol. 8 |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |accessdate=2019-12-04}}</ref>\n| LicensedISBN  = 978-1-9747-0941-0\n| ChapterList   = \n{{Numbered list|start=37\n|{{nihongo|\"Awaken, Super Saiyan Kale\"|\u899a\u9192\u00b7\u8d85\u30b5\u30a4\u30e4\u4eba\u30b1\u30fc\u30eb|Kakusei \u00b7 Supa Saiya-jin K\u0113ru}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Universe 6's Last Resort\"|\u7b2c6\u5b87\u5b99\u306e\u6700\u7d42\u624b\u6bb5|Dai Roku Uch\u016b no Saish\u016b Shudan}}\n|{{nihongo|\"Sign of Son Goku's Awakening\"|\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a\u899a\u9192\u306e\u201d\u5146\u201d|Son Gok\u016b Kakusei no \"Kizashi\"}} \n|{{nihongo|\"Jiren vs. Universe 7\"|\u30b8\u30ec\u30f3\uff36\uff33\u7b2c7\u5b87\u5b99|Jiren B\u0101sasu Dai nana Uch\u016b}}\n}}\n| LicensedTitle = Sign of Son Goku's Awakening\n| OriginalTitle = \u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a\u899a\u9192\u306e\u201d\u5146\u201d\n| TranslitTitle = Son Gok\u016b Kakusei no \"Kizashi\"\n| Summary       = The Tournament of Power begins to heat up as less than half of the fighters in the competition remain.
