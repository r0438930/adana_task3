In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the ''Daily Mail'' and ''News of the World'', particularly [[Andy Coulson]], had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage.

In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the ''Daily Mail'' and ''News of the World'', particularly [[Andy Coulson]], had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from [[Margaret Thatcher]] onwards had cultivated a close relationship with [[Rupert Murdoch]] and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between [[David Cameron]] and [[Rebekah Brooks]] (n\u00e9e Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: \"Cameron is very much in debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament \u2013 that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nWhen asked by Grant whether Cameron had encouraged the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] to \"drag their feet\" on investigating illegal phone tapping by Murdoch's journalists, McMullan agreed this had happened, and stated that police themselves had taken bribes from tabloid journalists: \"20 per cent of the Met has taken backhanders from tabloid hacks. So why would they want to open up that can of worms?... And what's wrong with that, anyway? It doesn't hurt anyone particularly.\"<ref name=\"NewStatesman\" />\n\nGrant's article attracted considerable interest, due to both the revelatory content of the taped conversation, and the novelty of his \"turning the tables\" on a tabloid journalist.<ref name=\"Guardian-2011-04-16\" />\n\nWhilst the allegations regarding the ''News of the World'' continued to receive coverage in the broadsheets and similar media (Grant appeared, for example, on [[BBC Radio 4]]) it was only with the revelation that the voicemail of the by then murdered [[Millie Dowler]] had been hacked, and evidence for her murder enquiry had been deleted, that the coverage turned from media interest to widespread public (and eventually political) outrage.
