The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's [[albedo]], which would result in [[positive feedback]] for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where [[solar radiation]] is most direct.\n\nMany possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a [[supervolcano]], a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[methane]] and/or [[carbon dioxide]], changes in [[solar variation|Solar energy output]], or perturbations of [[Earth's orbit]]. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen [[equator]] as cold as modern [[Antarctica]].\n\n[[Global warming]] associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of Earth's surface would require as little as a millennium.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Continental distribution===\nA tropical distribution of the continents is, perhaps counter-intuitively, necessary to allow the initiation o'''''Bold text'''f a snowball Earth.<ref name=Hoffman2005/>\nFirstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the Sun's heat: most absorption of Solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans.<ref name=Jacobsen2001>{{cite journal\n| author = Jacobsen, S.B.\n| year = 2001\n| title = Earth science.

These reactions proceed in the general form: Rock-forming mineral + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 cations + bicarbonate + SiO<sub>2</sub>.

Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow anoxic bottom water to form.\n\nContinental rifting, with associated subsidence, tends to produce such landlocked water bodies. This rifting, and associated subsidence, would produce the space for the fast deposition of sediments, negating the need for an immense and rapid melting to raise the global sea levels.\n\n===High-obliquity hypothesis===\nA competing hypothesis to explain the presence of ice on the equatorial continents was that Earth's [[axial tilt]] was quite high, in the vicinity of 60\u00b0, which would place Earth's land in high \"latitudes\", although supporting evidence is scarce.<ref>{{cite web\n| url= http://www.livescience.com/7105-day-earth-fell.html\n| title= LiveScience.com: The Day The Earth Fell Over}}</ref> A less extreme possibility would be that it was merely Earth's [[Poles of astronomical bodies|magnetic pole]] that wandered to this inclination, as the magnetic readings which suggested ice-filled continents depend on the magnetic and rotational poles being relatively similar.

While many [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged [[ecosystem]]s dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.\n\nBecause about half of the oceans' water was frozen solid as ice, the remaining water would be twice as salty as it is today, lowering its freezing point. When the ice sheet melted, it would cover the oceans with a layer of hot freshwater up to 2 kilometres thick. Only after the hot surface water mixed with the colder and deeper saltwater did the sea return to a warmer and less salty state.<ref>Owens, Brian, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130525-snowball-earth-melting-led-to-freshwater-ocean-2-kilometres-deep/ Snowball Earth melting led to freshwater ocean 2 kilometres deep], ''[[New Scientist]]'', 10 May 2017.</ref>\n\nThe melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the [[Cryogenian]] period.\n\n===Effect on early evolution===\n[[Image:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|right|222px|''[[Dickinsonia]] costata'', an [[Ediacaran]] organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance]]\nThe [[Neoproterozoic]] was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|icehouse-hothouse]] cycles; in this sense, snowball Earth episodes may have \"pumped\" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the [[Cambrian explosion]].\n\nOne hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early snowball Earths did not so much ''affect'' the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the [[Huronian glaciation]] 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's [[Cryogenian]] between 580\u2013850 million years and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]] and then the rise of more advanced multicellular animal life and life's colonization of the land.<ref>Cowie, J., (2007) ''Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects''.

A number of unanswered questions remain, including whether the Earth was a full snowball, or a \"slushball\" with a thin equatorial band of open (or seasonally open) water.\n\nThe snowball-Earth episodes are proposed to have occurred before the sudden [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] of multicellular bioforms known as the [[Cambrian explosion]]. The most recent snowball episode may have triggered the evolution of multicellularity. Another, much earlier and longer snowball episode, the [[Huronian glaciation]], which would have occurred 2400 to 2100&nbsp;Mya, may have been triggered by the first appearance of oxygen in the atmosphere, the \"[[Great Oxygenation Event]]\".\n\n==History==\n{{Life timeline}}\n\n===Evidence for ancient glaciation mounts===\nLong before the idea of a global glaciation was established, a series of discoveries began to accumulate evidence for ancient Precambrian glaciations. The first of these discoveries was published in 1871 by J. Thomson who found ancient glacier-reworked material ([[tillite]]) in [[Islay]], Scotland. Similar findings followed in Australia (1884) and India (1887). A fourth and very illustrative finding that came to be known as \"[[Reusch's Moraine]]\" was reported by [[Hans Reusch]] in northern Norway in 1891. Many other findings followed, but their understanding was hampered by the rejection of [[continental drift]].<ref name=Hoffman2011>{{cite book |last1=Hoffman |first1=Paul F.|author-link=Paul F.

With the advancement of the [[continental drift]] hypothesis, and eventually [[plate tectonic]] theory, came an easier explanation for the glaciogenic sediments\u2014they were deposited at a time when the continents were at higher latitudes.\n\nIn 1964, the idea of global-scale glaciation reemerged when [[W. Brian Harland]] published a paper in which he presented [[palaeomagnetic]] data showing that glacial [[till]]ites in [[Svalbard]] and [[Greenland]] were deposited at tropical latitudes.<ref name=\"Harland\">{{cite journal\n| author=W.

Using this model, Budyko found that if ice sheets advanced far enough out of the polar regions, a feedback loop ensued where the increased reflectiveness ([[albedo]]) of the ice led to further cooling and the formation of more ice, until the entire Earth was covered in ice and stabilized in a new ice-covered equilibrium.<ref name=\"Budyko\">{{cite journal\n| author=M.I.

Therefore, the presence of glacial deposits within the [[tropics]] suggests global ice cover.\n\nCritical to an assessment of the validity of the theory, therefore, is an understanding of the reliability and significance of the evidence that led to the belief that ice ever reached the tropics. This evidence must prove two things:\n# that a bed contains sedimentary structures that could have been created only by glacial activity;\n# that the bed lay within the tropics when it was deposited.\n\nDuring a period of global glaciation, it must also be demonstrated that glaciers were active at different global locations at the same time, and that no other deposits of the same age are in existence.\n\nThis last point is very difficult to prove. Before the [[Ediacaran]], the [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] markers usually used to correlate rocks are absent; therefore there is no way to prove that rocks in different places across the globe were deposited at precisely the same time. The best that can be done is to estimate the age of the rocks using [[radiometry|radiometric]] methods, which are rarely accurate to better than a million years or so.<ref name=Eyles2004/>\n\nThe first two points are often the source of contention on a case-to-case basis.

Depending on the rate of cooling of [[structure of the Earth|Earth's core]], it is possible that during the Proterozoic, the [[magnetic field]] did not approximate a simple [[dipole|dipolar]] distribution, with north and south magnetic poles roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Palaeomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted, as the sedimentary minerals could have aligned pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, Earth's dipolar field could have been oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around the same time as the Gaskiers glaciation.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2010.02.038| title = Incompatible Ediacaran paleomagnetic directions suggest an equatorial geomagnetic dipole hypothesis| year = 2010| last1 = Abrajevitch | first1 = A.| last2 = Van Der Voo | first2 = R.| journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters| volume = 293| issue = 1\u20132| pages = 164\u2013170| bibcode=2010E&PSL.293..164A}}</ref>\n\nAnother weakness of reliance on palaeomagnetic data is the difficulty in determining whether the magnetic signal recorded is original, or whether it has been reset by later activity.

In the presence of oxygen, [[iron]] naturally rusts and becomes insoluble in water. The banded iron formations are commonly very old and their deposition is often related to the oxidation of the Earth's atmosphere during the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] era, when dissolved iron in the ocean came in contact with photosynthetically produced oxygen and precipitated out as iron oxide.\n\nThe bands were produced at the [[Tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]] between an [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anoxic]] and an oxygenated ocean. Since today's atmosphere is [[oxygen]]-rich (nearly 21% by volume) and in contact with the oceans, it is not possible to accumulate enough iron oxide to deposit a banded formation. The only extensive iron formations that were deposited after the Palaeoproterozoic (after 1.8 billion years ago) are associated with [[Cryogenian]] glacial deposits.\n\nFor such iron-rich rocks to be deposited there would have to be anoxia in the ocean, so that much dissolved iron (as [[ferrous oxide]]) could accumulate before it met an oxidant that would precipitate it as [[ferric]] oxide. For the ocean to become anoxic it must have limited gas exchange with the oxygenated atmosphere.

This would weather exposed [[silicate]] and [[carbonate]] [[rock (geology)|rock]] (including readily attacked glacial debris), releasing large amounts of [[calcium]], which when washed into the ocean would form distinctively textured layers of carbonate sedimentary rock. Such an [[abiotic]] \"[[cap carbonate]]\" sediment can be found on top of the glacial till that gave rise to the snowball Earth hypothesis.\n\nHowever, there are some problems with the designation of a glacial origin to cap carbonates. Firstly, the high carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere would cause the oceans to become acidic, and dissolve any carbonates contained within\u2014starkly at odds with the deposition of cap carbonates. Further, the thickness of some cap carbonates is far above what could reasonably be produced in the relatively quick deglaciations.

The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's [[albedo]], which would result in [[positive feedback]] for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where [[solar radiation]] is most direct.\n\nMany possible triggering mechanisms could account for the beginning of a snowball Earth, such as the eruption of a [[supervolcano]], a reduction in the atmospheric concentration of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[methane]] and/or [[carbon dioxide]], changes in [[solar variation|Solar energy output]], or perturbations of [[Earth's orbit]]. Regardless of the trigger, initial cooling results in an increase in the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow, and the additional ice and snow reflects more Solar energy back to space, further cooling Earth and further increasing the area of Earth's surface covered by ice and snow. This positive feedback loop could eventually produce a frozen [[equator]] as cold as modern [[Antarctica]].\n\n[[Global warming]] associated with large accumulations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over millions of years, emitted primarily by volcanic activity, is the proposed trigger for melting a snowball Earth. Due to positive feedback for melting, the eventual melting of the snow and ice covering most of Earth's surface would require as little as a millennium.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n===Continental distribution===\nA tropical distribution of the continents is, perhaps counter-intuitively, necessary to allow the initiation of a snowball Earth.<ref name=Hoffman2005/>\nFirstly, tropical continents are more reflective than open ocean, and so absorb less of the Sun's heat: most absorption of Solar energy on Earth today occurs in tropical oceans.<ref name=Jacobsen2001>{{cite journal\n| author = Jacobsen, S.B.\n| year = 2001\n| title = Earth science.

While many [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] have been postulated, global ice cover would certainly have ravaged [[ecosystem]]s dependent on sunlight. Geochemical evidence from rocks associated with low-latitude glacial deposits have been interpreted to show a crash in oceanic life during the glacials.\n\nBecause about half of the oceans' water was frozen solid as ice, the remaining water would be twice as salty as it is today, lowering its freezing point. When the ice sheet melted, it would cover the oceans with a layer of hot freshwater up to 2 kilometres thick. Only after the hot surface water mixed with the colder and deeper saltwater did the sea return to a warmer and less salty state.<ref>Owens, Brian, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130525-snowball-earth-melting-led-to-freshwater-ocean-2-kilometres-deep/ Snowball Earth melting led to freshwater ocean 2 kilometres deep], ''[[New Scientist]]'', 10 May 2017.</ref>\n\nThe melting of the ice may have presented many new opportunities for diversification, and may indeed have driven the rapid evolution which took place at the end of the [[Cryogenian]] period.\n\n===Effect on early evolution===\n[[Image:DickinsoniaCostata.jpg|thumb|right|222px|''[[Dickinsonia]] costata'', an [[Ediacaran]] organism of unknown affinity, with a quilted appearance]]\nThe [[Neoproterozoic]] was a time of remarkable diversification of multicellular organisms, including animals. Organism size and complexity increased considerably after the end of the snowball glaciations. This development of multicellular organisms may have been the result of increased evolutionary pressures resulting from multiple [[Greenhouse and icehouse Earth|icehouse-hothouse]] cycles; in this sense, snowball Earth episodes may have \"pumped\" evolution. Alternatively, fluctuating nutrient levels and rising oxygen may have played a part. Another major glacial episode may have ended just a few million years before the [[Cambrian explosion]].\n\nOne hypothesis which has been gaining currency in recent years: that early snowball Earths did not so much ''affect'' the evolution of life on Earth as result from it. In fact the two hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. The idea is that Earth's life forms affect the global carbon cycle and so major evolutionary events alter the carbon cycle, redistributing carbon within various reservoirs within the biosphere system and in the process temporarily lowering the atmospheric (greenhouse) carbon reservoir until the revised biosphere system settled into a new state. The Snowball I episode (of the [[Huronian glaciation]] 2.4 to 2.1 billion years) and Snowball II (of the Precambrian's [[Cryogenian]] between 580\u2013850 million years and which itself had a number of distinct episodes) are respectively thought to be caused by the evolution of [[Carbon fixation#Oxygenic photosynthesis|oxygenic photosynthesis]] and then the rise of more advanced multicellular animal life and life's colonization of the land.<ref>Cowie, J., (2007) ''Climate Change: Biological and Human Aspects''.
