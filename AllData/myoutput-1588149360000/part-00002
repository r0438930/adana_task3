She was launched in 1912 from [[Sandefjord]] in [[Norway]]; three years later, she was crushed by [[pack ice]] and sank in the [[Weddell Sea]] off Antarctica. All of her crew survived.\n\n==Design and construction==\nDesigned by [[Ole Aanderud Larsen]], ''Endurance'' was built at the [[Framn\u00e6s shipyard]] in [[Sandefjord]], Norway, and fully completed on 17 December 1912. She was built under the supervision of master wood shipbuilder Christian Jacobsen, who was renowned for insisting that all men in his employment were not just skilled shipwrights but also be experienced in seafaring aboard whaling or sealing ships. Every detail of her construction had been scrupulously planned to ensure maximum durability: for example, every joint and fitting was cross-braced for maximum strength.\n\nThe ship was launched on 17 December 1912 and was initially christened ''Polaris'' (eponymous with [[Polaris]], the North Star). She was {{convert|144|ft}} long, with a {{convert|25|ft}} beam, and measured 348 [[gross register tonnage|tons gross]].<ref name = stamp/> Her original purpose to provide luxurious accommodation for small tourist and hunting parties in the Arctic as an ice-capable [[steam yacht]]. As launched she had 10 passenger cabins, a spacious dining saloon and galley (with accommodation for two cooks), a smoking room, a [[darkroom]] to allow passengers to develop photographs, electric lighting and even a small bathroom. \n\nThough her hull looked from the outside like that of any other vessel of a comparable size, it was not. She was designed for polar conditions with a very sturdy construction. Her keel members were four pieces of solid oak, one above the other, adding up to a thickness of {{convert|85|in}}, while its sides were between {{convert|30|in}} and {{convert|18|in}} thick, with twice as many frames as normal and the frames being of double thickness. She was built of planks of [[oak]] and Norwegian [[fir]] up to {{convert|30|in}} thick, sheathed in [[Chlorocardium rodiei|greenheart]], an exceptionally strong and heavy wood. The bow, which would meet the ice head-on, had been given special attention. Each timber had been made from a single oak tree chosen for its shape so that its natural shape followed the curve of the ship's design. When put together, these pieces had a thickness of {{convert|52|in}}.\n[[File:Endurance4.jpg|thumb|Shackleton looking overboard at ''Endurance'' being crushed by the ice]]\n[[File:Endurance Final Sinking.jpg|thumb|''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final sinking, November 1915]]\nOf her three [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], the forward one was [[square-rigged]], while the after two carried fore and aft sails, like a [[schooner]]. As well as sails, ''Endurance'' had a {{convert|350|HP}} coal-fired [[steam engine]] capable of speeds up to {{convert|10.2|kn}}.\n\nBy the time of her launch in 1912, ''Endurance'' was perhaps the strongest wooden ship ever built, with the possible exception of ''[[Fram]]'', the vessel used by [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and later by [[Roald Amundsen]]. There was one major difference between the ships. ''Fram'' was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her, the ship would be squeezed up and out and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. ''Endurance'', on the other hand, was designed with great inherent strength in her hull in order to resist collision with ice floes and to break through pack ice by ramming and crushing; she was therefore not intended to be frozen into heavy pack ice, and so was not designed to rise out of a crush. In such a situation she was dependent on the ultimate strength of her hull alone.<ref name=\"Lansing\">{{cite book|title = Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage|author-first = Alfred|author-last = Lansing|publication-date = 1959|publisher = McGraw-Hill|ol = 6263779M|publication-place = New York|url = https://archive.org/details/enduranceshackle0000lans|lccn = 58059666}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\n''Endurance'' was originally built for [[Adrien de Gerlache]] and [[Lars Christensen]], who intended to use her for polar cruises for tourists to hunt [[polar bear]]s. Financial problems led to Gerlache pulling out of their partnership, leaving Christensen unable to pay the Framn\u00e6s yard the final amounts to hand over and outfit the ship. For over a year Christensen attempted unsuccessfully to sell the ship, since her unique design as an ice-capable passenger-carrying ship, with relatively little space for stores and no cargo hold, made her useless to the [[whaling]] industry. Meanwhile, she was too big, slow and uncomfortable to be a private steam yacht. In the event, Christensen was happy to sell the ship to [[Ernest Shackleton]] for GB\u00a311,600, which represented a significant loss to Christensen as it barely covered the outstanding payments to Framn\u00e6s, let alone the ship's total build costs. He is reported to have said he was happy to take the loss in order to further the plans of an explorer of Shackleton's stature.<ref name=\"Lansing\"/> After Shackleton purchased the ship, she was rechristened ''Endurance'' after the Shackleton family motto, ''Fortitudine vincimus'' (\"By endurance we conquer\").\n\nShackleton had the ship relocated from Norway to London. She arrived at the [[Millwall Dock]] in the spring of 1914, where she was refitted and modified for expedition purposes. She was stripped of most of her luxurious accommodation and fittings. This included removing many of the passenger cabins to make room for space for stores and equipment, while the crew cabins on the lower deck were removed and converted into a cargo hold \u2013 the reduced crew of sailors that Shackleton would take on the expedition would make their quarters in the cramped [[forecastle]]. The darkroom remained in its original location ahead of the boiler. The refit also saw the ship repainted from her original white color to a more austere black, which was more visible amongst ice, and features such as gilt scrollwork on the bow and stern were painted over. Despite her change of name, she retained a large badge in the shape of a five-pointed star on her stern, which originally symbolized her name after the pole star.\n\nHer new equipment included four [[ship's boat]]s. Two were {{convert|21|ft|m|adj=on}} transom-built rowing [[cutter (boat)|cutter]]s purchased secondhand from the whaling industry. The third was a larger {{convert|22.5|ft|m|adj=on}} double-ended rowing [[whaleboat]] built for the expedition to specifications drawn up by [[Frank Worsley]], ''Endurance''{{'}}s new captain. The fourth was a smaller [[motorboat]]. After her refit, ''Endurance'' made the short coastal journey to [[Plymouth]].\n\nIn the previous 16 years, nearly two dozen wooden vessels had sailed to the icy seas of the far south. All had returned home but [[SY Aurora|''Aurora'']]. [[Lloyd's of London]] and the Indemnity Marine Assurance Company had underwritten her hull, machinery and equipment for \u00a315,000. Just before she sailed, ''The Times'' had reported that \"Hitherto the insurance of vessels taking part in Antarctic exploration has ceased at the last port touched, and ''Endurance'' will be the first vessel to be insured in the ice zone.\" ''The Times'' praised ''Endurance'' as \"built specially for work in Polar seas\", adding that \"in an ice-coated sea there can be no turbulent waves which are the causes of so many disasters in warmer zones.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Heacox|first=Kim|title=The Antarctic Challenge|year=1999|publisher=National Geographic|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0792275367|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780792275367/page/82 82]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780792275367/page/82}}</ref>\n\n==Final voyage==\n''Endurance'' sailed from Plymouth on 6 August 1914 and set course for [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], under Worsley's command. Shackleton remained in Britain, finalising the expedition's organization and attending to some last-minute fundraising. This was ''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first major voyage following its completion and amounted to a [[shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] voyage. The trip across the Atlantic took more than two months. Built for the ice, her hull was considered by many of her crew too rounded for the open ocean. Shackleton took a steamer to Buenos Aires and caught up with his expedition a few days after ''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s arrival.\n\nOn 26 October 1914, ''Endurance'' sailed from Buenos Aires to what would be her last port of call, the [[whaling]] station at [[Grytviken]] on the island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], where she arrived on 5 November. She left [[Grytviken]] on 5 December 1914, heading for the southern regions of the [[Weddell Sea]].\n\nTwo days after leaving South Georgia, ''Endurance'' encountered polar [[pack ice]] and progress slowed to a crawl. For weeks ''Endurance'' worked its way through the pack, averaging less than {{convert|30|mi}} per day. By 15 January 1915, ''Endurance'' was within {{convert|200|mi}} of her destination, [[Vahsel Bay]]. By the following morning, heavy pack ice was sighted and in the afternoon a gale developed. Under these conditions it was soon evident progress could not be made, and ''Endurance'' took shelter under the lee of a large grounded iceberg. During the next two days, ''Endurance'' moved back and forth under the sheltering protection of the berg.\n\nOn 18 January, the gale began to moderate and ''Endurance'' set the topsail with the engine at slow. The pack had blown away. Progress was made slowly until hours later ''Endurance'' encountered the pack once more. It was decided to move forward and work through the pack, and at 5:00 PM ''Endurance'' entered it. This ice was different from what had been encountered before, and the ship was soon amongst thick but soft brash ice, and became beset. The gale increased in intensity and kept blowing for another six days from a northerly direction towards land. By 24 January, the wind had completely compressed the ice in the Weddell Sea against the land, leaving ''Endurance'' icebound as far as the eye could see in every direction.<ref name=\"Lansing\"/> All that could be done was to wait for a southerly gale to start pushing in the other direction, which would decompress and open the ice.\n\nIn the early morning of 24 January, a wide crack appeared in the ice {{convert|50|yd|m}} ahead of the ship. Initially {{convert|15|ft|m}} across, by mid-morning the break was over a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) wide, giving the men on the ''Endurance'' hope that the ice was breaking up. But the break never reached the ship itself, and despite three hours under full sail and full speed on the engine, the ship did not budge. Over the next days, the crew waited for the southerly gale to release the pressure on the ice, but while the wind backed to the hoped-for south/southwest direction, it remained light and erratic. Occasional breaks in the ice were spotted, but none reached the ship and all closed up within a few hours. Trials were made on January 27 with cutting and breaking the ice around the ship by manual labour but this proved futile.\n\nOn 14 February, an open channel of water opened up a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) ahead of the ship and dawn showed the ''Endurance'' was afloat in a pool of soft, young ice no more than {{convert|2|ft|m}} thick, but the pool was surrounded by solid pack ice of {{convert|12|\u2013|18|ft|m}} in thickness, blocking the path to the open lead. A day's continual work by the crew saw them hack a clear channel {{convert|150|yd|m}} long. This work continued through the following day (15 February) and, with steam raised, the ''Endurance'' was backed up within her pool as far as possible to allow the ship to ram her way through the channel. As the ship went astern for successive attempts, lines were attached from the bow to loosened blocks of ice, estimated to weigh 20 tons (18 tonnes), in order to clear the path. The pool proved too small for the ship to gain enough momentum to successfully ram her way clear and by the end of the day the ice began to freeze up again. By 3:00 PM, the ''Endurance'' had made {{convert|200|yd|m}} of distance through the ice, with {{convert|400|yd|m}} still to go to clear water. Shackleton decided that the consumption of coal and manpower, and the risk of damage to the ship, was too great and called a halt.<ref name=\"Lansing\"/>\n\n===Drift===\nAfter this frustration, ''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s boilers were extinguished, committing the ship to drift with the ice until released naturally. On 17 February, the sun dipped below the horizon at midnight, showing the end of the Antarctic summer. On 24 February, regular watches on the ship were cancelled, with the ''Endurance'' now functioning as a shore station. The ship had slowly drifted south and at this point was within {{convert|60|mi|km}} of the intended landing point at [[Vahsel Bay]]. But the icy terrain between the ship and the shore was too arduous to travel while carrying the materials and supplies needed for the overland expedition.\n\nBy March, navigational observation showed that the ship (and the mass of pack ice that contained it) was still moving, but now swinging towards the west-northwest and increasing in the speed of its drift, moving {{convert|130|mi|km}} between the start of March and May 2, when the sun disappeared below the horizon and the dark Antarctic winter began. Still the men on the ship hoped for either a change in the weather which would break up the pack or that, by the spring, the warmer weather and the ship's northward drift would mean it was released.\n\nOn 14 July 1915, ''Endurance'' was swept by a southwest gale, with wind speeds of {{cvt|112|km/h|m/s mph}}, a [[barometer]] reading of {{convert|28.88|inHg|hPa}} and temperatures falling to {{convert|-33|F|C}}. The blizzard continued until 16 July. This broke up the pack ice into smaller, individual floes, each of which began to move semi-independently under the force of the weather, while also clearing water in the north of the Weddell Sea. This provided a long [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]] for the south-setting wind to blow over and then for the broken ice to pile up against itself while individual parts moved in different directions. This caused regions of intense localised pressure in the ice field. The ice began \"working\", with sounds of breaking and colliding ice audible to those on the ship through the next day. Breaks in the ice were spotted but none approached the ice holding the ''Endurance''.\n\nDuring July the ship drifted a further {{convert|160|mi|km}} to the north. On the morning of 1 August, a pressure wave passed through the floe holding the ship, lifting the 400-ton ''Endurance'' bodily upwards and heeling the ship sharply to its port side before it dropped into a pool of water, afloat again for the first time in nearly six months. The broken sections of floe closed in around the ship on all sides, jarring the ''Endurance'' forward, backwards and sideways in violent fashion against the other slabs of ice. After over a quarter of an hour, a force from astern pushed the ship's bow up onto the floe, lifting the hull out of the pressure and with a list of five degrees to her port side. A gale overnight further disturbed the floe, driving it against the starboard side of the hull and forcing a sheet of ice upwards at a 45-degree angle until it reached the level of the [[scupper]]s. Despite the ordeal of the past few days the ship remained undamaged.\n\nTwo pressure waves struck the ship on 29 August without incident. On the evening of 31 August, a slow-building pressure gripped the ''Endurance'', causing her hull and timbers to creak and shudder continuously. The ice around the ship moved and broke throughout the night, battering the port side of the hull. All was quiet again until the afternoon of 30 September, by which time there were signs of spring with ten hours of sunlight per day and occasional temperature readings above freezing. A large floe was swept against the ''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s port bow and then gripped that side of the ship against the built-up ice and snow on her starboard beam. The ship's structure groaned and wracked under the strain. Carpenter [[Harry McNish]] noted that the solid oak beams supporting the upper deck were being visibly bent \"like a piece of cane\". On deck the ship's masts were whipping back and forth as their stepping points on the [[keel]] were distorted. Despite these disconcerting signs, Captain [[Frank Worsley]] noted that the strength of the ship's structure was causing the ice itself to break up as it piled against the hull \u2013 \"...just as it appears she can stand no more, the huge floe weighing possibly a million tons or more yields to our little ship by cracking across...and so relieves the pressure. The behaviour of our ship in the ice has been magnificent. Undoubtedly she is the finest little wooden vessel ever built....\" Despite this, the ship's decks were permanently buckled following this ordeal.\n\n===Final destruction===\nBy October, temperatures of nearly {{convert|42|F|C}} were recorded and the ice showed further signs of opening up. The floe which had been jammed against the ship's starboard side since July broke up on 14 October, casting the ''Endurance'' afloat in a pool of open water for the first time in nine months.\n\nOn 16 October, Shackleton ordered steam to be raised so the ship could take advantage of any openings in the ice. It took nearly four hours for the boilers to be filled with freshwater melted from ice, and then a leak was discovered in one of the fittings and they had to be pumped out, repaired and then refilled. The following day a lead of open water was seen ahead of the ship. Only one boiler had been lit and there was insufficient steam to use the engine, so all the sails were set to try and force the ship into the loosening pack ice but without success.\n\nIn the late afternoon of 18 October, the ice closed in around the ''Endurance'' once again. In just five seconds the ship was canted over to port by 20 degrees, and the list continued until she rested at 30 degrees, with the port [[bulwark (nautical)|bulwark]] resting on the pack and the boats on that side nearly touching the ice as they hung in their davits. This put the ship in a seemingly safe position \u2013 instead of being pinched between two opposing masses of ice the ''Endurance'' had been pushed from starboard to port and further pressure from starboard would push her bodily upwards over the top of the port-side floe, which had actually collided with its counterpart under the ship's bilge. In any case, after four hours in this position, the ice drew apart and the ship returned to a level keel.\n\nThe ice was relatively still for the rest of the month. On 20 October, steam was raised again and the engines tested. On 22 October, the temperature dropped sharply from {{convert|42|F|C}} to {{convert|-14|F|C}} and the wind veered from southwest to northeast. This caused the loosening pack to compress against the Antarctic coast once again. On 23 October, pressure ridges could be seen forming in the ice and moving near the ship. The next day a series of pressure waves struck the ''Endurance'', causing the ice around the ship to fracture into separate large pieces which were then tumbled and turned in all directions. The ship was shunted back and forth before being pinched against two floes on her starboard side, one at her bow and one at her stern, while on the port side a floe impacted amidships, setting up a huge bending force on the hull. Parts of the rigging were snapped under the strain.\n\nA large mass of ice slammed into the stern, tearing the [[sternpost]] away from the hull planking. Around the same time the bow planking was stove in, causing simultaneous flooding in the engine room and the forward hold. Despite using both the portable manual pumps and getting up steam to drive the main bilge pumps, the water level continued to rise. The main man-powered deck pumps did not work as their intakes had frozen and could only be restored by pouring buckets of boiling water onto the pump pipes from inside the coal bunkers and then playing a [[blowtorch]] over the intake valve. McNish constructed a [[cofferdam]] in the shaft tunnel to seal off the damaged stern area while the crew were arranged in spells of 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off on the main pump. After 28 hours of continuous work, the inflow of water had only been arrested \u2013 the ship was still badly flooded.\n\nOn 24 October, the damaged ship was wracked by further pressure waves. The port-side floe was pressed more heavily against the side, warping the keel along its length and causing near-continual creaks, groans, cracks and \"screams\" from the ship's timbers. The footplates in the engine room were pushed up and would no longer sit in place as the compartment was compressed. The planking of the ship's port side was bowing inwards by up to {{convert|6|in|cm}}. At 10 PM, Shackleton ordered the ship's boats, stores and essential equipment to be moved onto the surrounding ice.\n\nIn the afternoon of 25 October, the pressure of the ice increased further. The main deck of the ''Endurance'' buckled upwards amidships and the beams sheared. As the ice moved against her stern, the aft part of the ship was lifted up and the damaged sternpost and the rudder were torn away. This angle caused all the water in the ship to run forward, collecting in the bow where it then began to freeze. The action of the ice in the stern and the excessive weight in the bow caused the ship to sink into the ice bow-first. Under its own pressure, the ice then broke over the forecastle and piled up onto the deck in the forward part of the ship, further weighing this end of the ship down. Through all of this, the pumping operations had continued, but by the end of the day Shackleton ordered this to stop and for the men to take to the ice.\n\nDuring the course of the next day, parties were sent back to the ship to recover more supplies and stores. They found that the entire port side of the ''Endurance'' had been driven inwards and compressed, and the ice had entirely filled the bow and stern sections. The ship's [[Blue Ensign]] was hoisted up her [[Mast_(sailing)#mizzen_mast|mizzen mast]] so that she would, in Shackleton's word's, \"go down with colours flying.\"\n\nAfter a failed attempt to man-haul the boats and stores overland on sledges, Shackleton realised the effort was much too intense and that the party would have to camp on the ice until it carried them to the north and broke up. More parties were sent back to the ''Endurance'', still with her masts and rigging intact and all but her bow above the ice, to salvage any remaining items. A large portion of provisions had been left on the submerged lower deck. The only way to retrieve them was to cut through the main deck, which was more than a foot thick in places and itself under three feet of water. Some crates and boxes floated up once a hole had been cut, while others were retrieved with a [[Grapple (tool)|grapple]]. In total, nearly 3.5 tons of stores were recovered from the wrecked ship.\n\nThe party was still camped under {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the remains of the ''Endurance'' on 8 November when Shackleton returned to the ship to consider further salvage. By now the ship had sunk a further {{convert|18|in|cm}} into the ice and the upper deck was now almost level with the ice. The interior of the ship was almost full of compacted ice and snow, making further work impossible. The damage to the bow and stern, and the force of the ice against the port side, had caused a large portion of the hull on that side of the ship to break free of the rest of the ship and, under the force of the ice, be moved bodily inwards in a [[Telescoping (rail cars)|telescoping]] effect. In some places, the outer hull planks were now in line with the keel. A stash of empty fuel oil cans placed against the port side wall of the deckhouse had been pushed through the wall and then the cans and the wall had come to rest against its counterpart on the starboard side of the deckhouse. The row of five cabins that had been on the port side of the main deck above the engine room and their contents had been compressed into the space of a single cabin.\n\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKMw3jX2asI The end of Endurance, 1915], YouTube video\n}}\nOn 13 November, a new pressure wave swept through the pack ice. The forward topgallant mast and topmasts collapsed as the bow was finally crushed. These moments were recorded on film by expedition photographer [[Frank Hurley]]. The mainmast was split near its base and shortly afterwards the mainmast and the mizzen mast broke and collapsed together, with this also filmed by Hurley. The ensign was re-rigged on the tip of one of the foremast [[yardarm]]s which, constrained by the rigging, was now hanging vertically from the remains of the foremast and was the highest point of the wreck.\n\nIn the late afternoon of 21 November, movement of the remaining wreckage was noticed as another pressure wave hit. Within the space of a minute, the stern of the ''Endurance'' was lifted clear of the ice as the floes moved together and then, as the pressure passed and they moved apart, the entire wreck fell into the ocean. By daylight the following day, the ice surrounding the spot where the ''Endurance'' had sank had moved together again, obliterating any trace of the wreck. Worsley fixed the position as 68\u00b0 38.5'S 52\u00b0 58'W.\n\n==Crew==\nThe crew of ''Endurance'' on her final voyage was made up of the 28 men listed below:<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackletonexped/1914/team.html Endurance's crew]</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=44em}}\n* Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]], Expedition Leader\n* [[Frank Wild]], Second-in-Command\n* [[Frank Worsley]], Captain\n* [[Lionel Greenstreet]], First Officer\n* [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]], Second Officer\n* [[Alfred Cheetham]], Third Officer\n* [[Hubert Hudson]], Navigator\n* [[Lewis Rickinson]], Engineer\n* [[Alexander Kerr]], Engineer\n* [[Alexander Macklin]], Surgeon\n* [[James McIlroy (surgeon)|James McIlroy]], Surgeon\n* Sir [[James Wordie]], Geologist\n* [[Leonard Hussey]], Meteorologist\n* [[Reginald W.

She was launched in 1912 from [[Sandefjord]] in [[Norway]]; three years later, she was crushed by [[pack ice]] and sank in the [[Weddell Sea]] off Antarctica. All of her crew survived.\n\n==Design and construction==\nDesigned by [[Ole Aanderud Larsen]], ''Endurance'' was built at the [[Framn\u00e6s shipyard]] in [[Sandefjord]], Norway, and fully completed on 17 December 1912. She was built under the supervision of master wood shipbuilder Christian Jacobsen, who was renowned for insisting that all men in his employment were not just skilled shipwrights but also be experienced in seafaring aboard whaling or sealing ships. Every detail of her construction had been scrupulously planned to ensure maximum durability: for example, every joint and fitting was cross-braced for maximum strength.\n\nThe ship was launched on 17 December 1912 and was initially christened ''Polaris'' (eponymous with [[Polaris]], the North Star). She was {{convert|144|ft}} long, with a {{convert|25|ft}} beam, and measured 348 [[gross register tonnage|tons gross]].<ref name = stamp/> Her original purpose to provide luxurious accommodation for small tourist and hunting parties in the Arctic as an ice-capable [[steam yacht]]. As launched she had 10 passenger cabins, a spacious dining saloon and galley (with accommodation for two cooks), a smoking room, a [[darkroom]] to allow passengers to develop photographs, electric lighting and even a small bathroom. \n\nThough her hull looked from the outside like that of any other vessel of a comparable size, it was not. She was designed for polar conditions with a very sturdy construction. Her keel members were four pieces of solid oak, one above the other, adding up to a thickness of {{convert|85|in}}, while its sides were between {{convert|30|in}} and {{convert|18|in}} thick, with twice as many frames as normal and the frames being of double thickness. She was built of planks of [[oak]] and Norwegian [[fir]] up to {{convert|30|in}} thick, sheathed in [[Chlorocardium rodiei|greenheart]], an exceptionally strong and heavy wood. The bow, which would meet the ice head-on, had been given special attention. Each timber had been made from a single oak tree chosen for its shape so that its natural shape followed the curve of the ship's design. When put together, these pieces had a thickness of {{convert|52|in}}.\n[[File:Endurance4.jpg|thumb|Shackleton looking overboard at ''Endurance'' being crushed by the ice]]\n[[File:Endurance Final Sinking.jpg|thumb|''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s final sinking, November 1915]]\nOf her three [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], the forward one was [[square-rigged]], while the after two carried fore and aft sails, like a [[schooner]]. As well as sails, ''Endurance'' had a {{convert|350|HP}} coal-fired [[steam engine]] capable of speeds up to {{convert|10.2|kn}}.\n\nBy the time of her launch in 1912, ''Endurance'' was perhaps the strongest wooden ship ever built, with the possible exception of ''[[Fram]]'', the vessel used by [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and later by [[Roald Amundsen]]. There was one major difference between the ships. ''Fram'' was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her, the ship would be squeezed up and out and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. ''Endurance'', on the other hand, was designed with great inherent strength in her hull in order to resist collision with ice floes and to break through pack ice by ramming and crushing; she was therefore not intended to be frozen into heavy pack ice, and so was not designed to rise out of a crush. In such a situation she was dependent on the ultimate strength of her hull alone.<ref name=\"Lansing\">{{cite book|title = Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage|author-first = Alfred|author-last = Lansing|publication-date = 1959|publisher = McGraw-Hill|ol = 6263779M|publication-place = New York|url = https://archive.org/details/enduranceshackle0000lans|lccn = 58059666}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\n''Endurance'' was originally built for [[Adrien de Gerlache]] and [[Lars Christensen]], who intended to use her for polar cruises for tourists to hunt [[polar bear]]s. Financial problems led to Gerlache pulling out of their partnership, leaving Christensen unable to pay the Framn\u00e6s yard the final amounts to hand over and outfit the ship. For over a year Christensen attempted unsuccessfully to sell the ship, since her unique design as an ice-capable passenger-carrying ship, with relatively little space for stores and no cargo hold, made her useless to the [[whaling]] industry. Meanwhile, she was too big, slow and uncomfortable to be a private steam yacht. In the event, Christensen was happy to sell the ship to [[Ernest Shackleton]] for GB\u00a311,600, which represented a significant loss to Christensen as it barely covered the outstanding payments to Framn\u00e6s, let alone the ship's total build costs. He is reported to have said he was happy to take the loss in order to further the plans of an explorer of Shackleton's stature.<ref name=\"Lansing\"/> After Shackleton purchased the ship, she was rechristened ''Endurance'' after the Shackleton family motto, ''Fortitudine vincimus'' (\"By endurance we conquer\").\n\nShackleton had the ship relocated from Norway to London. She arrived at the [[Millwall Dock]] in the spring of 1914, where she was refitted and modified for expedition purposes. She was stripped of most of her luxurious accommodation and fittings. This included removing many of the passenger cabins to make room for space for stores and equipment, while the crew cabins on the lower deck were removed and converted into a cargo hold \u2013 the reduced crew of sailors that Shackleton would take on the expedition would make their quarters in the cramped [[forecastle]]. The darkroom remained in its original location ahead of the boiler. The refit also saw the ship repainted from her original white color to a more austere black, which was more visible amongst ice, and features such as gilt scrollwork on the bow and stern were painted over. Despite her change of name, she retained a large badge in the shape of a five-pointed star on her stern, which originally symbolized her name after the pole star.\n\nHer new equipment included four [[ship's boat]]s. Two were {{convert|21|ft|m|adj=on}} transom-built rowing [[cutter (boat)|cutter]]s purchased secondhand from the whaling industry. The third was a larger {{convert|22.5|ft|m|adj=on}} double-ended rowing [[whaleboat]] built for the expedition to specifications drawn up by [[Frank Worsley]], ''Endurance''{{'}}s new captain. The fourth was a smaller [[motorboat]]. After her refit, ''Endurance'' made the short coastal journey to [[Plymouth]].\n\nIn the previous 16 years, nearly two dozen wooden vessels had sailed to the icy seas of the far south. All had returned home but [[SY Aurora|''Aurora'']]. [[Lloyd's of London]] and the Indemnity Marine Assurance Company had underwritten her hull, machinery and equipment for \u00a315,000. Just before she sailed, ''The Times'' had reported that \"Hitherto the insurance of vessels taking part in Antarctic exploration has ceased at the last port touched, and ''Endurance'' will be the first vessel to be insured in the ice zone.\" ''The Times'' praised ''Endurance'' as \"built specially for work in Polar seas\", adding that \"in an ice-coated sea there can be no turbulent waves which are the causes of so many disasters in warmer zones.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Heacox|first=Kim|title=The Antarctic Challenge|year=1999|publisher=National Geographic|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0792275367|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780792275367/page/82 82]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780792275367/page/82}}</ref>\n\n==Final voyage==\n''Endurance'' sailed from Plymouth on 6 August 1914 and set course for [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], under Worsley's command. Shackleton remained in Britain, finalising the expedition's organization and attending to some last-minute fundraising. This was ''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s first major voyage following its completion and amounted to a [[shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] voyage. The trip across the Atlantic took more than two months. Built for the ice, her hull was considered by many of her crew too rounded for the open ocean. Shackleton took a steamer to Buenos Aires and caught up with his expedition a few days after ''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s arrival.\n\nOn 26 October 1914, ''Endurance'' sailed from Buenos Aires to what would be her last port of call, the [[whaling]] station at [[Grytviken]] on the island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], where she arrived on 5 November. She left [[Grytviken]] on 5 December 1914, heading for the southern regions of the [[Weddell Sea]].\n\nTwo days after leaving South Georgia, ''Endurance'' encountered polar [[pack ice]] and progress slowed to a crawl. For weeks ''Endurance'' worked its way through the pack, averaging less than {{convert|30|mi}} per day. By 15 January 1915, ''Endurance'' was within {{convert|200|mi}} of her destination, [[Vahsel Bay]]. By the following morning, heavy pack ice was sighted and in the afternoon a gale developed. Under these conditions it was soon evident progress could not be made, and ''Endurance'' took shelter under the lee of a large grounded iceberg. During the next two days, ''Endurance'' moved back and forth under the sheltering protection of the berg.\n\nOn 18 January, the gale began to moderate and ''Endurance'' set the topsail with the engine at slow. The pack had blown away. Progress was made slowly until hours later ''Endurance'' encountered the pack once more. It was decided to move forward and work through the pack, and at 5:00 PM ''Endurance'' entered it. This ice was different from what had been encountered before, and the ship was soon amongst thick but soft brash ice, and became beset. The gale increased in intensity and kept blowing for another six days from a northerly direction towards land. By 24 January, the wind had completely compressed the ice in the Weddell Sea against the land, leaving ''Endurance'' icebound as far as the eye could see in every direction.<ref name=\"Lansing\"/> All that could be done was to wait for a southerly gale to start pushing in the other direction, which would decompress and open the ice.\n\nIn the early morning of 24 January, a wide crack appeared in the ice {{convert|50|yd|m}} ahead of the ship. Initially {{convert|15|ft|m}} across, by mid-morning the break was over a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) wide, giving the men on the ''Endurance'' hope that the ice was breaking up. But the break never reached the ship itself, and despite three hours under full sail and full speed on the engine, the ship did not budge. Over the next days, the crew waited for the southerly gale to release the pressure on the ice, but while the wind backed to the hoped-for south/southwest direction, it remained light and erratic. Occasional breaks in the ice were spotted, but none reached the ship and all closed up within a few hours. Trials were made on January 27 with cutting and breaking the ice around the ship by manual labour but this proved futile.\n\nOn 14 February, an open channel of water opened up a quarter of a mile (0.4 km) ahead of the ship and dawn showed the ''Endurance'' was afloat in a pool of soft, young ice no more than {{convert|2|ft|m}} thick, but the pool was surrounded by solid pack ice of {{convert|12|\u2013|18|ft|m}} in thickness, blocking the path to the open lead. A day's continual work by the crew saw them hack a clear channel {{convert|150|yd|m}} long. This work continued through the following day (15 February) and, with steam raised, the ''Endurance'' was backed up within her pool as far as possible to allow the ship to ram her way through the channel. As the ship went astern for successive attempts, lines were attached from the bow to loosened blocks of ice, estimated to weigh 20 tons (18 tonnes), in order to clear the path. The pool proved too small for the ship to gain enough momentum to successfully ram her way clear and by the end of the day the ice began to freeze up again. By 3:00 PM, the ''Endurance'' had made {{convert|200|yd|m}} of distance through the ice, with {{convert|400|yd|m}} still to go to clear water. Shackleton decided that the consumption of coal and manpower, and the risk of damage to the ship, was too great and called a halt.<ref name=\"Lansing\"/>\n\n===Drift===\nAfter this frustration, ''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s boilers were extinguished, committing the ship to drift with the ice until released naturally. On 17 February, the sun dipped below the horizon at midnight, showing the end of the Antarctic summer. On 24 February, regular watches on the ship were cancelled, with the ''Endurance'' now functioning as a shore station. The ship had slowly drifted south and at this point was within {{convert|60|mi|km}} of the intended landing point at [[Vahsel Bay]]. But the icy terrain between the ship and the shore was too arduous to travel while carrying the materials and supplies needed for the overland expedition.\n\nBy March, navigational observation showed that the ship (and the mass of pack ice that contained it) was still moving, but now swinging towards the west-northwest and increasing in the speed of its drift, moving {{convert|130|mi|km}} between the start of March and May 2, when the sun disappeared below the horizon and the dark Antarctic winter began. Still the men on the ship hoped for either a change in the weather which would break up the pack or that, by the spring, the warmer weather and the ship's northward drift would mean it was released.\n\nOn 14 July 1915, ''Endurance'' was swept by a southwest gale, with wind speeds of {{cvt|112|km/h|m/s mph}}, a [[barometer]] reading of {{convert|28.88|inHg|hPa}} and temperatures falling to {{convert|-33|F|C}}. The blizzard continued until 16 July. This broke up the pack ice into smaller, individual floes, each of which began to move semi-independently under the force of the weather, while also clearing water in the north of the Weddell Sea. This provided a long [[Fetch (geography)|fetch]] for the south-setting wind to blow over and then for the broken ice to pile up against itself while individual parts moved in different directions. This caused regions of intense localised pressure in the ice field. The ice began \"working\", with sounds of breaking and colliding ice audible to those on the ship through the next day. Breaks in the ice were spotted but none approached the ice holding the ''Endurance''.\n\nDuring July the ship drifted a further {{convert|160|mi|km}} to the north. On the morning of 1 August, a pressure wave passed through the floe holding the ship, lifting the 400-ton ''Endurance'' bodily upwards and heeling the ship sharply to its port side before it dropped into a pool of water, afloat again for the first time in nearly six months. The broken sections of floe closed in around the ship on all sides, jarring the ''Endurance'' forward, backwards and sideways in violent fashion against the other slabs of ice. After over a quarter of an hour, a force from astern pushed the ship's bow up onto the floe, lifting the hull out of the pressure and with a list of five degrees to her port side. A gale overnight further disturbed the floe, driving it against the starboard side of the hull and forcing a sheet of ice upwards at a 45-degree angle until it reached the level of the [[scupper]]s. Despite the ordeal of the past few days the ship remained undamaged.\n\nTwo pressure waves struck the ship on 29 August without incident. On the evening of 31 August, a slow-building pressure gripped the ''Endurance'', causing her hull and timbers to creak and shudder continuously. The ice around the ship moved and broke throughout the night, battering the port side of the hull. All was quiet again until the afternoon of 30 September, by which time there were signs of spring with ten hours of sunlight per day and occasional temperature readings above freezing. A large floe was swept against the ''Endurance''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s port bow and then gripped that side of the ship against the built-up ice and snow on her starboard beam. The ship's structure groaned and wracked under the strain. Carpenter [[Harry McNish]] noted that the solid oak beams supporting the upper deck were being visibly bent \"like a piece of cane\". On deck the ship's masts were whipping back and forth as their stepping points on the [[keel]] were distorted. Despite these disconcerting signs, Captain [[Frank Worsley]] noted that the strength of the ship's structure was causing the ice itself to break up as it piled against the hull \u2013 \"...just as it appears she can stand no more, the huge floe weighing possibly a million tons or more yields to our little ship by cracking across...and so relieves the pressure. The behaviour of our ship in the ice has been magnificent. Undoubtedly she is the finest little wooden vessel ever built....\" Despite this, the ship's decks were permanently buckled following this ordeal.\n\n===Final destruction===\nBy October, temperatures of nearly {{convert|42|F|C}} were recorded and the ice showed further signs of opening up. The floe which had been jammed against the ship's starboard side since July broke up on 14 October, casting the ''Endurance'' afloat in a pool of open water for the first time in nine months.\n\nOn 16 October, Shackleton ordered steam to be raised so the ship could take advantage of any openings in the ice. It took nearly four hours for the boilers to be filled with freshwater melted from ice, and then a leak was discovered in one of the fittings and they had to be pumped out, repaired and then refilled. The following day a lead of open water was seen ahead of the ship. Only one boiler had been lit and there was insufficient steam to use the engine, so all the sails were set to try and force the ship into the loosening pack ice but without success.\n\nIn the late afternoon of 18 October, the ice closed in around the ''Endurance'' once again. In just five seconds the ship was canted over to port by 20 degrees, and the list continued until she rested at 30 degrees, with the port [[bulwark (nautical)|bulwark]] resting on the pack and the boats on that side nearly touching the ice as they hung in their davits. This put the ship in a seemingly safe position \u2013 instead of being pinched between two opposing masses of ice the ''Endurance'' had been pushed from starboard to port and further pressure from starboard would push her bodily upwards over the top of the port-side floe, which had actually collided with its counterpart under the ship's bilge. In any case, after four hours in this position, the ice drew apart and the ship returned to a level keel.\n\nThe ice was relatively still for the rest of the month. On 20 October, steam was raised again and the engines tested. On 22 October, the temperature dropped sharply from {{convert|42|F|C}} to {{convert|-14|F|C}} and the wind veered from southwest to northeast. This caused the loosening pack to compress against the Antarctic coast once again. On 23 October, pressure ridges could be seen forming in the ice and moving near the ship. The next day a series of pressure waves struck the ''Endurance'', causing the ice around the ship to fracture into separate large pieces which were then tumbled and turned in all directions. The ship was shunted back and forth before being pinched against two floes on her starboard side, one at her bow and one at her stern, while on the port side a floe impacted amidships, setting up a huge bending force on the hull. Parts of the rigging were snapped under the strain.\n\nA large mass of ice slammed into the stern, tearing the [[sternpost]] away from the hull planking. Around the same time the bow planking was stove in, causing simultaneous flooding in the engine room and the forward hold. Despite using both the portable manual pumps and getting up steam to drive the main bilge pumps, the water level continued to rise. The main man-powered deck pumps did not work as their intakes had frozen and could only be restored by pouring buckets of boiling water onto the pump pipes from inside the coal bunkers and then playing a [[blowtorch]] over the intake valve. McNish constructed a [[cofferdam]] in the shaft tunnel to seal off the damaged stern area while the crew were arranged in spells of 15 minutes on, 15 minutes off on the main pump. After 28 hours of continuous work, the inflow of water had only been arrested \u2013 the ship was still badly flooded.\n\nOn 24 October, the damaged ship was wracked by further pressure waves. The port-side floe was pressed more heavily against the side, warping the keel along its length and causing near-continual creaks, groans, cracks and \"screams\" from the ship's timbers. The footplates in the engine room were pushed up and would no longer sit in place as the compartment was compressed. The planking of the ship's port side was bowing inwards by up to {{convert|6|in|cm}}. At 10 PM, Shackleton ordered the ship's boats, stores and essential equipment to be moved onto the surrounding ice.\n\nIn the afternoon of 25 October, the pressure of the ice increased further. The main deck of the ''Endurance'' buckled upwards amidships and the beams sheared. As the ice moved against her stern, the aft part of the ship was lifted up and the damaged sternpost and the rudder were torn away. This angle caused all the water in the ship to run forward, collecting in the bow where it then began to freeze. The action of the ice in the stern and the excessive weight in the bow caused the ship to sink into the ice bow-first. Under its own pressure, the ice then broke over the forecastle and piled up onto the deck in the forward part of the ship, further weighing this end of the ship down. Through all of this, the pumping operations had continued, but by the end of the day Shackleton ordered this to stop and for the men to take to the ice.\n\nDuring the course of the next day, parties were sent back to the ship to recover more supplies and stores. They found that the entire port side of the ''Endurance'' had been driven inwards and compressed, and the ice had entirely filled the bow and stern sections. The ship's [[Blue Ensign]] was hoisted up her [[Mast_(sailing)#mizzen_mast|mizzen mast]] so that she would, in Shackleton's word's, \"go down with colours flying.\"\n\nAfter a failed attempt to man-haul the boats and stores overland on sledges, Shackleton realised the effort was much too intense and that the party would have to camp on the ice until it carried them to the north and broke up. More parties were sent back to the ''Endurance'', still with her masts and rigging intact and all but her bow above the ice, to salvage any remaining items. A large portion of provisions had been left on the submerged lower deck. The only way to retrieve them was to cut through the main deck, which was more than a foot thick in places and itself under three feet of water. Some crates and boxes floated up once a hole had been cut, while others were retrieved with a [[Grapple (tool)|grapple]]. In total, nearly 3.5 tons of stores were recovered from the wrecked ship.\n\nThe party was still camped under {{convert|2|mi|km}} from the remains of the ''Endurance'' on 8 November when Shackleton returned to the ship to consider further salvage. By now the ship had sunk a further {{convert|18|in|cm}} into the ice and the upper deck was now almost level with the ice. The interior of the ship was almost full of compacted ice and snow, making further work impossible. The damage to the bow and stern, and the force of the ice against the port side, had caused a large portion of the hull on that side of the ship to break free of the rest of the ship and, under the force of the ice, be moved bodily inwards in a [[Telescoping (rail cars)|telescoping]] effect. In some places, the outer hull planks were now in line with the keel. A stash of empty fuel oil cans placed against the port side wall of the deckhouse had been pushed through the wall and then the cans and the wall had come to rest against its counterpart on the starboard side of the deckhouse. The row of five cabins that had been on the port side of the main deck above the engine room and their contents had been compressed into the space of a single cabin.\n\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKMw3jX2asI The end of Endurance, 1915], YouTube video\n}}\nOn 13 November, a new pressure wave swept through the pack ice. The forward topgallant mast and topmasts collapsed as the bow was finally crushed. These moments were recorded on film by expedition photographer [[Frank Hurley]]. The mainmast was split near its base and shortly afterwards the mainmast and the mizzen mast broke and collapsed together, with this also filmed by Hurley. The ensign was re-rigged on the tip of one of the foremast [[yardarm]]s which, constrained by the rigging, was now hanging vertically from the remains of the foremast and was the highest point of the wreck.\n\nIn the late afternoon of 21 November, movement of the remaining wreckage was noticed as another pressure wave hit. Within the space of a minute, the stern of the ''Endurance'' was lifted clear of the ice as the floes moved together and then, as the pressure passed and they moved apart, the entire wreck fell into the ocean. By daylight the following day, the ice surrounding the spot where the ''Endurance'' had sank had moved together again, obliterating any trace of the wreck. Worsley fixed the position as 68\u00b0 38.5'S 52\u00b0 58'W.\n\n==Crew==\nThe crew of ''Endurance'' on her final voyage was made up of the 28 men listed below:<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackletonexped/1914/team.html Endurance's crew]</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=44em}}\n* Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]], Expedition Leader\n* [[Frank Wild]], Second-in-Command\n* [[Frank Worsley]], Captain\n* [[Lionel Greenstreet]], First Officer\n* [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]], Second Officer\n* [[Alfred Cheetham]], Third Officer\n* [[Hubert Hudson]], Navigator\n* [[Lewis Rickinson]], Engineer\n* [[Alexander Kerr]], Engineer\n* [[Alexander Macklin]], Surgeon\n* [[James McIlroy (surgeon)|James McIlroy]], Surgeon\n* Sir [[James Wordie]], Geologist\n* [[Leonard Hussey]], Meteorologist\n* [[Reginald W.

When his presence aboard the ''Endurance'' was discovered, Shackleton decided to make him a steward rather than leave him ashore at South Georgia. Blackborow eventually proved his worth, earning the Bronze Polar Medal, and the honour of becoming the first human being ever to set foot on Elephant Island. His name is also the matter of some debate\u2014it is sometimes spelled Percy, or Blackboro, or in other ways.\n\n==Supposed advertisement==\nTo find crew for the ''Endurance'', Shackleton reportedly placed an advertisement in the London ''Times'', reading:\n{{quote | Men wanted for hazardous journey.

The first {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}}, launched in May 1956 and awarded pennant number A171 sometime later, acted as an ice patrol and [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] survey ship until 1986. The second {{HMS|Endurance|A171|6}} was bought from Norway in 1992 where she was named MV ''Polar Circle''.
