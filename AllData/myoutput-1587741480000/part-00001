Estoril Praia|Estoril]].\n\n==Club career==\nDefendi was first spotted as a 16-year-old by the then [[Tottenham Hotspur]] Director of Sport [[Frank Arnesen]]. He was the first player signed under the Frank Arnesen and [[Jacques Santini]] era at Spurs from [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] for a fee of \u00a3600,000 on July 3, 2004, although he had to wait for his passport to arrive in August for the deal to be officially completed. He failed to make a first team appearance for Tottenham but featured in a number of reserve team matches.\n\nHe was deemed surplus to requirements by Tottenham Hotspur manager [[Martin Jol]], as he was first allowed to travel back to Brazil to seek a contract with a new club which proved unsuccessful, before he was farmed out on loan to [[Udinese Calcio]] in January 2006. He made two league appearances before leaving for [[A.S. Roma]] in August 2006, again on loan. He made an appearance in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] and in the [[Coppa Italia]] for the capital club, but didn't manage to play a league game in [[Serie A]].\n\nDefendi returned to Tottenham Hotpur from Roma after his loan period ended. On August 9, 2007 Tottenham announced his departure to the Italian Serie B club [[U.S. Avellino 1912|Avellino]] on a permanent transfer.\n\nDefendi became a free agent after the bankruptcy of [[U.S. Avellino 1912|Avellino]] and returned to Brazil. He joined the [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras B|Palmeiras reserves]] in March 2010.\n\nOn 18 May 2011, Defendi signed a contract with Portuguese [[Primeira Liga]] side [[Vit\u00f3ria Guimar\u00e3es]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vitoriasc.pt/noticias_detalhe2.php?id_noticia=3001&mod=6|title=Rodrigo Defendi \u00e9 refor\u00e7o (V\u00cdDEO)|date=18 May 2011|accessdate=18 November 2011|work=Vit\u00f3ria SC|language=Portuguese}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 January 2013, after nine years playing in [[Europe]], Defendi was presented by [[Botafogo Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]], his new side.<ref>[http://www.gazetaesportiva.net/noticia/2013/01/botafogo/de-volta-ao-brasil-apos-nove-anos-defendi-e-apresentado-no-botafogo.html ''De volta ao Brasil ap\u00f3s nove anos, Defendi \u00e9 apresentado no Botafogo'']</ref>\n\nOn 18 February 2015, Defendi signed a two-year contract with [[Chinese Super League]] side [[Shijiazhuang Ever Bright]].<ref>[http://sports.sohu.com/20150218/n409086173.shtml \u77f3\u5bb6\u5e84\u6c38\u660c\u5ba3\u5e03\u7b7e\u7ea6\u5df4\u897f\u540e\u536b \u7b7e\u7ea6\u4e24\u5e74] at sports.sohu.com 2015-02-18 Retrieved 2015-02-19 {{in lang|zh}}</ref>\n\nOn 27 January 2016, he signed for [[NK Maribor|Maribor]] in the [[Slovenian PrvaLiga]].<ref name=\"defendi_transfer_nkmaribor\">{{cite news | url= http://www.nkmaribor.com/novice/?id=6616 | title = Rodrigo Defendi: Pri\u0161el, da bi bil prvak |trans-title=Rodrigo Defendi: I came to be a champion | author = | publisher = [[NK Maribor]] official website | date = 27 January 2016 | accessdate = 28 January 2016 | language = Slovenian }}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n;Roma\n*[[Coppa Italia]]: [[2006\u201307 Coppa Italia|2006\u201307]]\n\n;Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es\n*[[Ta\u00e7a de Portugal]]: [[2012\u201313 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal|2012\u201313]]\n\n;Botafogo\n* [[Campeonato Carioca]]: [[2013 Campeonato Carioca|2013]]\n\n;Maribor\n*[[Slovenian PrvaLiga|Slovenian Championship]] (1): [[2016\u201317 Slovenian PrvaLiga|2016\u201317]]\n* [[Slovenian Football Cup|Slovenian Cup]] (1): [[2015\u201316 Slovenian Football Cup|2015\u201316]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{TuttoCalciatori|Defendi_Rodrigo}}\n* {{Soccerway|rodrigo-defendi/176223}}\n* {{ForaDeJogo}}\n\n{{G.D.
