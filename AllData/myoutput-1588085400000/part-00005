In the past the nickname \"Rock Ape\" has been attributed to their traditional role guarding areas of Gibraltar,[43] but this is not so. The term came into use after an accident in the Western Aden Protectorate in November 1952. Two RAF Regiment officers serving with the Aden Protectorate Levies at Dhala decided to amuse themselves by going out to shoot some of the hamadryas baboons (locally referred to as \"rock apes\"). The officers drew rifles and split up to hunt the apes. In the semi-darkness one of the officers fired at a moving object in the distance. When he reached the target he discovered he had shot the other officer. After emergency treatment Flight Lieutenant Percy Henry Mason survived to return to service a few months later. When asked by a board of inquiry why he had fired at his friend the officer replied that his target had \"looked just like a rock ape\" in the half light. The remark soon reverberated around the RAF and it was not long before the term was in general use.[44]\n\nAnother version of the nickname rationale was that the German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels heard the legend that, if the barbary apes on the Rock of Gibraltar ever left, the British Empire would crumble. At that stage of the war, when things were not going well for the Axis forces, he decided that a propaganda coup was required and reportedly sent a commando raid to eradicate the apes. The story goes that Winston Churchill heard of the mission and immediately tasked the RAF Regiment with protecting the apes, and thus the nickname was born.[45] \n*''Rockette'' - WAAF of the Auxiliary RAF Regiment.\n*''Rodney'' - Ground crew name for commissioned officers, the Army call their junior officers \"Ruperts\" often pronounced Woopert and Wodeney.\n*''Rolling Goat'' - An ongoing confusing or disorganised situation; a debacle.\n*''Rook'' - Boy Entrant term for a new entrant.\n*''ROP'' - Restriction of privileges (post 1955 official name for Jankers).\n*''Rover'' - [[Coastal Command]] armed patrol for opportunity attacking of shipping.\n*''RTH'' (abbreviation) - Automatic system built into a drone which allows it to safely Return to Home on mission completion orany problems \n*''Ruddy'' - Common euphonism in the 1940s for 'Bloody'.\n*''Run Around'' - A vehicle being used for non-official purposes.\n\n== S ==\n\n*''Sandbag (pull up)'' - Going to tell a story.\n*''Sardine can'' - Any torpedo plane.\n*''Satan's sister'' - A slanderer or libeler of either sex\n*''SASO'' (abbreviation) - Senior Air [[Staff Officer]].

In the past the nickname \"Rock Ape\" has been attributed to their traditional role guarding areas of Gibraltar,[43] but this is not so. The term came into use after an accident in the Western Aden Protectorate in November 1952. Two RAF Regiment officers serving with the Aden Protectorate Levies at Dhala decided to amuse themselves by going out to shoot some of the hamadryas baboons (locally referred to as \"rock apes\"). The officers drew rifles and split up to hunt the apes. In the semi-darkness one of the officers fired at a moving object in the distance. When he reached the target he discovered he had shot the other officer. After emergency treatment Flight Lieutenant Percy Henry Mason survived to return to service a few months later. When asked by a board of inquiry why he had fired at his friend the officer replied that his target had \"looked just like a rock ape\" in the half light. The remark soon reverberated around the RAF and it was not long before the term was in general use.[44]\n\nAnother version of the nickname rationale was that the German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels heard the legend that, if the barbary apes on the Rock of Gibraltar ever left, the British Empire would crumble. At that stage of the war, when things were not going well for the Axis forces, he decided that a propaganda coup was required and reportedly sent a commando raid to eradicate the apes. The story goes that Winston Churchill heard of the mission and immediately tasked the RAF Regiment with protecting the apes, and thus the nickname was born.[45] \n*''Rockette'' - WAAF of the Auxiliary RAF Regiment.\n*''Rodney'' - Ground crew name for commissioned officers, the Army call their junior officers \"Ruperts\" often pronounced Woopert and Wodeney.\n*''Rolling Goat'' - An ongoing confusing or disorganised situation; a debacle.\n*''Rook'' - Boy Entrant term for a new entrant.\n*''ROP'' - Restriction of privileges (post 1955 official name for Jankers).\n*''Rover'' - [[Coastal Command]] armed patrol for opportunity attacking of shipping.\n*''RTH'' (abbreviation) - Automatic system built into a drone which allows it to safely Return to Home on mission completion orany problems \n*''Ruddy'' - Common euphonism in the 1940s for 'Bloody'.\n*''Run Around'' - A vehicle being used for non-official purposes.\n\n== S ==\n\n*''Sandbag (pull up)'' - Going to tell a story.\n*''Sardine can'' - Any torpedo plane.\n*''Satan's sister'' - A slanderer or libeler of either sex\n*''SASO'' (abbreviation) - Senior Air [[Staff Officer]].
