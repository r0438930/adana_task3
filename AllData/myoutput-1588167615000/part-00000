After he left Western Michigan for Minnesota, Fleck and WMU were in a brief dispute over the intellectual property rights to the phrase, but they soon came to a settlement without resorting to the courtroom. Fleck received full rights to the phrase, and can use it freely at Minnesota (and presumably possible future coaching stops). As part of the settlement, Fleck is providing $10,000 annually to endow a football scholarship at WMU, and WMU will have rights to use the phrase for any memorabilia connected to Fleck's tenure with the Broncos.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/p-j-fleck-is-bringing-row-the-boat-mantra-to-minnesota-but-for-a-price/ |title=P.J.
