But the Roundtable's most significant victory was in blocking labor law reform that sought to strengthen labor law to make it more difficult for companies to intimidate workers who wanted to form unions. The AFL-CIO produced a bill in 1977 that passed the House. But the Roundtable voted to oppose the bill, and through its aggressive lobbying, it prevented the bill's Senate supporters from rounding up the 60 votes in the Senate necessary to withstand a [[filibuster]].\n\nIn fiscal policy, the Roundtable was responsible for broadening the 1985 tax cuts signed into law by [[Ronald Reagan]], lobbying successfully for sharp reductions in corporate taxes. In trade policy, it argued for opening foreign markets to American trade and investment. The [[Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act|Omnibus Trade Act]] of 1988 reflected  the thinking of the Business Roundtable. In 1990, the Roundtable urged [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]] to initiate a free trade agreement with Mexico. In 1993, the Roundtable lobbied for [[NAFTA]] and against any strong side agreements on labor and the environment. It provided the money and leadership for the main pro-NAFTA lobby.\n\nThe Roundtable also successfully opposed changes in [[corporate governance]] that would have made boards of directors and CEOs more accountable to stockholders. In 1986, the Roundtable convinced the Securities and Exchange Commission to forgo new rules on [[Mergers and Acquisitions|merger and acquisitions]], and in 1993 convinced President Clinton to water down his plan to impose penalties on excessive executive salaries. [[Citicorp]] CEO, John Reed, chairperson of the Roundtables Accounting Task Force, argued that Clinton's plan would have had negative effects on U.S. competitiveness. The Roundtable's Health, Welfare, and Retirement Income Task Force, chaired by [[Prudential Insurance]] CEO Robert C. Winters, cheered President Bush's plan, which consisted mainly of subsidies to the health care industry. The nation's health care system works well for the majority of Americans, the Roundtable announced in a June 1991 statement. \"We believe the solutions lie not in tearing down the present system, but in building upon it.\"\n\nIt has issued press releases, submitted editorials, given congressional testimony, and distributed position advertisements. After the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 was signed into law in January 2002, the Roundtable issued a press release stating that it had \"strongly supported passage of the legislation\" and was \"actively working with states on implementation.\"<ref>[http://parentadvocates.org/nicecontent/dsp_printable.cfm?articleID=5616  \"ISSUE: No Child Left Behind\"] via ParentAdvocates.org, under headline, \"The Business Roundtable Supports the No Child Left Behind Legislation\".
