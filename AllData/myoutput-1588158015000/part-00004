It was released by [[S.M. Entertainment]] on January 29, 2018, along with the album and an accompanying music video. Written by S.M. Entertainment artist and songwriter [[Yoo Young-jin]] and produced by [[The Stereotypes]], Eazy, Maxx Song and Whitney Philips, \"Bad Boy\" is primarily an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with elements of [[hip hop]] that has a synth melody and heavy bass sound. Its lyrics describe a relationship between the titular \"bad boy\" and a cold woman.\n\nThe song was well-received by critics overseas and in the group's native country South Korea, who praised the music, the music video and its choreography, and the group's transition to a sexy concept, something they have never attempted before. \"Bad Boy\" was included in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' '100 Best Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list, and topped their annual '20 Best K-pop Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list, they were the first female act to top this list. ''[[Dazed (magazine)|Dazed]]'' also included the song in their '20 best K-pop songs of 2018'. Commercially, the song was a domestic and international success, topping the Gaon Download Chart and charting at number two on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]] in South Korea. It charted at number two on ''Billboard's'' [[World Digital Songs]] chart. As of February 2020, it has sold over 500,000 units in the United States, has 250 million views on YouTube and 100 million streams on Spotify. The group entered the [[Canadian Hot 100]] for the first time with the song, making them only the seventh K-pop artist and the third female act to appear on the chart. It also charted in [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].\n\nThe song is also notable for being one of two songs (the other being \"[[Red Flavor]]\") performed by Red Velvet at the \"[[Spring is Coming]]\" concert in [[Pyongyang]] at the [[East Pyongyang Grand Theatre]] to an audience that included [[Kim Jong-un]]. The concert was seen as an act of [[cultural diplomacy]] and intended as part of a wider diplomatic initiative between South Korea and [[North Korea]]. Their appearance at the concert made them only the fifth idol group to ever perform in North Korea and the first artist from SM Entertainment in fifteen years since [[Shinhwa]].\n\n== Background ==\nA few months after the release of the group's second studio album ''[[Perfect Velvet]]'', the group's company [[S.M. Entertainment]] announced through an image teaser posted on their official [[social media]] accounts on January 23, 2018 that Red Velvet will be releasing their first reissue of an album, a repackage of ''Perfect Velvet'' titled ''The Perfect Red Velvet''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://star.mbn.co.kr/view.php?sc=71600002&year=2018&no=52708 |accessdate=January 24, 2018 |website=star.mbn|date=January 24, 2018 |script-title=ko:\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3, \ud32c\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ucef4\ubc31 \uc608\uace0? \"1\uc6d4 29\uc77c \ucee4\ubc0d \uc21c\"|language=korean}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.hankooki.com/lpage/entv/201801/sp20180124003258136730.htm |accessdate=December 19, 2018 |website=Sports Hanguk|date=January 24, 2018 |script-title=ko:\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3, \uc624\ub294 29\uc77c 'V\uc571' \uc0dd\ubc29\uc1a1 \uc9c4\ud589...Fan Card \ud1b5\ud55c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uae4c\uc9c0 '\ud6c4\ub048'|language=korean}}</ref> The lead single was described as a song with a \"sexy\" or \"girl crush\" concept by South Korean news sites, which the group has never done before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hei.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=201801241318H |accessdate=December 19, 2018 |website=Hankyung|date=January 24, 2018 |script-title=ko:\ub808\ub4dc\ubca8\ubcb3, '\ubc30\ub4dc \ubcf4\uc774'\ub85c \ucef4\ubc31\u2026\ube68\uac04\ub9db\u00b7\ud53c\uce74\ubd80 \uc774\uc740 \ud788\ud2b8 \uc608\uace0 |language=korean}}</ref>\n\nOn January 26, teaser images of members [[Wendy (singer)|Wendy]] and [[Joy (singer)|Joy]] were released through Red Velvet's social media accounts which Kang Seo-jung of ''Osen'' commented had the vibe of a powerful \"[[Korean honorifics#Honorific nouns|eonni]]\".

It was released by [[S.M. Entertainment]] on January 29, 2018, along with the album and an accompanying music video. Written by S.M. Entertainment artist and songwriter [[Yoo Young-jin]] and produced by [[The Stereotypes]], Eazy, Maxx Song and Whitney Philips, \"Bad Boy\" is primarily an [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] song with elements of [[hip hop]] that has a synth melody and heavy bass sound. Its lyrics describe a relationship between the titular \"bad boy\" and a cold woman.\n\nThe song was well-received by critics overseas and in the group's native country South Korea, who praised the music, the music video and its choreography, and the group's transition to a sexy concept, something they have never attempted before. \"Bad Boy\" was included in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' '100 Best Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list, and topped their annual '20 Best K-pop Songs of 2018: Critics' Picks' list, they were the first female act to top this list. ''[[Dazed (magazine)|Dazed]]'' also included the song in their '20 best K-pop songs of 2018'. Commercially, the song was a domestic and international success, topping the Gaon Download Chart and charting at number two on the [[Gaon Digital Chart]] in South Korea. It charted at number two on ''Billboard's'' [[World Digital Songs]] chart. As of February 2020, it has sold over 500,000 units in the United States, has 250 million views on YouTube and 100 million streams on Spotify. The group entered the [[Canadian Hot 100]] for the first time with the song, making them only the seventh K-pop artist and the third female act to appear on the chart. It also charted in [[Japan]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]].\n\nThe song is also notable for being one of two songs (the other being \"[[Red Flavor]]\") performed by Red Velvet at the \"[[Spring is Coming]]\" concert in [[Pyongyang]] at the [[East Pyongyang Grand Theatre]] to an audience that included [[Kim Jong-un]]. The concert was seen as an act of [[cultural diplomacy]] and intended as part of a wider diplomatic initiative between South Korea and [[North Korea]]. Their appearance at the concert made them only the fifth idol group to ever perform in North Korea and the first artist from SM Entertainment in fifteen years since [[Shinhwa]].\n\n== Background ==\nA few months after the release of the group's second studio album ''[[Perfect Velvet]]'', the group's company [[S.M.
