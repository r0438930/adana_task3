I almost want to quit football because it's not fun anymore\".<ref>[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/sport/article468642.ece Mamma Riise raste mot Aalesund] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727192201/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/sport/article468642.ece |date=27 July 2009 }} ''Aftenposten.no'' {{in lang|no}}</ref>

→‎Spanish encounters:Correct last-name reference.,safe,AlejandroCDeBaca,"'''La Junta Indians''' is a collective name for the various Indians living in the area known as ''La Junta de los Rios'' (\"the confluence of the rivers\": the [[Rio Grande]] and the [[Conchos River]]) on the borders of present-day West [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]].  In 1535 [[Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca]] recorded visiting these peoples while making his way to a Spanish settlement. They cultivated crops in the river floodplains, as well as gathering indigenous plants and catching fish from the rivers. They were part of an extensive trading network in the region.  As a crossroads, the area attracted people of different tribes.

In the eighteenth century, the Spanish set up missions in the area and the Native Americans gradually lost their tribal identifications. After suffering severe population losses through [[infectious disease]], the Spanish [[slave trade]], and attacks by raiding [[Apache]] and [[Comanche]], the La Junta Indians disappeared. Some intermarried with Spanish soldiers and their descendants became part of the [[Mestizo]] population of Mexico; others merged with the Apache and Comanche; still others departed to work on Spanish haciendas and in silver mines.

==Setting==
The Rio Grande and the Conchos River unite near the present-day cities of [[Presidio, Texas]], and [[Ojinaga, Mexico]].  The Conchos is more than twice as large as the Rio Grande, but below the confluence the river is known as the Rio Grande.  The area was named ''La Junta'' by Spanish explorers for the confluence, or junction, of rivers.  A mile-wide floodplain extends from La Junta 35 miles upstream to Ruidosa and 18 miles downstream to Redford on the Rio Grande; it extends up the Rio Conchos 30 miles to Cuchillo Parado.  The floodplain supports a thick growth of reeds, mesquite, willows, and groves of cottonwood trees.

[[File:Conchos_basin_map.png|thumb|right|200px|La Junta is located at the [[confluence]] of the Conchos River and the Rio Grande. The Conchos River is the larger of the two.]]

Two terraces rise 20 and 60 feet above the floodplain. Only desert vegetation grows on the terraces. The La Junta Indians lived on the terraces and used the floodplain for agriculture, fishing, hunting, and gathering wild foods. Rugged mountains ring the river valley and terraces.<ref>Kelley, J. Charles, \"The Historic Indian Pueblos of La Junta de Los Rios,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Vol. 27, No, 4, Oct 1952, 258-260</ref>  
La Junta is near the center of the [[Chihuahua Desert]] and receives an average of 10.8&nbsp;inches (270&nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually. Lengthy droughts are common. Summers are very hot and winters are mild, although freezes are frequent.<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/homeandgarden/home/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USTX1094 \"Monthly Temperatures for Presidio, Texas\"], The Weather Channel, accessed Nov 29, 2010</ref>

==Prehistory==
The abundant water, plant, and animal life attracted [[indigenous peoples]] to the La Junta region for thousands of years. Settled village life, with agriculture supplementing traditional hunting and gathering, began by 1200 A.D.<ref name=\"Junta\">[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/index.html \"La Junta de los Rios: Villagers of the Chihuahuan Desert Rivers\"], ''Texas Beyond History,'' 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29, 2010</ref> Archaeologists suggest that La Junta was settled as an expansion southeastward of the Jornada [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]] culture and people who lived around present-day [[El Paso, Texas]], 200 miles up the Rio Grande.  It may also have been influenced by [[Casas Grandes]], a notable prehistoric Indian civilization of the late 14th century located 200 miles west in present-day Mexico. Its people built complex communities with multi-story buildings and used highly developed irrigation systems to support agriculture.
   
Based on recent research of architectural styles and mortuary practices, scholars believe that the people of La Junta may have been indigenous to the area.  Between 1450 and 1500 many of the Jornada Mogollon settlements in western Texas were abandoned, possibly because of drought that made agriculture infeasible. The inhabitants possibly reverted to a hunter-gatherer culture that has left few traces in the archaeological record. The settlements at La Junta apparently survived the drought, although changes in the types of dwellings occurred and distinctive, locally produced pottery became common—or more common.<ref>Miller, Myles R. and Kenmotsu, Nancy A. \"Prehistory of the Jornada Mogollon and Eastern Trans-Pecos Regions of West Texas,\" In Perttula, Timothy, ''The Prehistory of Texas''.  College Station: Texas A & M U Press, 2004, pp. 258-260</ref>

The architectural styles of the houses and mortuary practices differ from the Mogollon. Most of the pottery at La Junta from prehistoric times is Jornada Mogollon, but archeologists believe that it was imported by trading rather than locally produced.  La Junta eventually produced its own distinct style of pottery, although perhaps not until about 1500 A.D.  The La Junta people, although influenced by the Mogollon culture, may have been a different linguistic and ethnic group.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/reconsidered.html \"La Junta de los Rios: La Junta Reconsidered\"], ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29, 2010</ref>

Research on bones and teeth indicates that the La Junta people continued to be dependent on hunting and gathering even after they became settled villagers and adopted agriculture. Researchers were surprised to learn that the peoples received less than 25 percent of their subsistence from maize; the rest came from game and wild foods. This is in contrast to typical agricultural cultures in which people received the majority of nutrition from cultivated crops.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/insights.html \"La Junta de los Rios: New Insights\"], ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29,2010</ref>

Little of their language, or languages, was recorded; scholars have not agreed on the language of the La Junta people. The most common guess is that they spoke [[Uto-Aztecan]], but [[Kiowa–Tanoan]] and [[Athapaskan]] ([[Apache]]) have also been suggested.  As the La Junta people lived at a crossroads in the desert, they may have been different ethnic groups who spoke multiple languages. For instance, the nomadic [[Jumano Indians|Jumano]] were frequent visitors and trading partners; they may also have been part-time residents of the area and were known to be ethnically distinct from the full-time villagers.<ref>Riley, Carroll L. ''The Frontier People: The Greater Southwest in the Protohistoric Period''. Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1987, p. 297-298</ref>

Given the limited amount of land suitable for agriculture and the austere environment, scholars estimate a population of 3,000 or 4,000 people at La Junta.  But, the Spanish explorer [[Antonio de Espejo]] estimated the area's population at more than 10,000. The modern scholar Howard G. Applegate has calculated that the resources were sufficient to support such a population,<ref>Applegate, Howard G. \"The Demography of La Junta de los Rios del Norte y Conchos,\" ''The Journal of Big Bend Studies,'' Vol IV, 1972, pp. 43-73</ref> but others disagree. The population during the year probably varied, as many of the Indians were semi-nomadic. The Spanish referred to the various peoples at La Junta as Amotomancos, Otomoacos, Abriaches, Julimes, and Patarabueyes. They were sometimes collectively called Jumano, although that name may more properly apply to the nomadic [[bison|buffalo]] hunters who also frequented La Junta.<ref>Riley (1987), \"The Frontier People\", pp. 293-296</ref>

==Spanish encounters==
[[File:Expedition Cabeza de Vaca Karte.png|thumb|left|500px|Cabeza de Vaca's route. La Junta is the area of the [[confluence]] of the Conchos River and the Rio Grande.]]

The Spanish castaway Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca probably passed through or near La Junta in 1535 on his way to a Spanish settlement.  He reported encountering \"the people of the cows\" and said they were \"people with the best bodies that we saw and the greatest liveliness.\"<ref>Kreiger, Alex D. ''We Came Naked and Barefoot: The Journey of Cabeza de Vaca across North America''. Austin: U of TX Press, 2002, pp. 86-87</ref> These were likely the Jumano, buffalo-hunting Indians who lived further north and east along the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and [[Concho River|Concho]] rivers, and traded and wintered in the La Junta region. Cabeza de Vaca described the area as well populated and agricultural, although with little good land.  The Indians had not planted corn for the previous two years because of drought.  Cabeza De Vaca noted that they put hot stones in gourds to cook their food. They were not described as using pottery; like other nomadic peoples, they found it too heavy to be easily carried.  (The Indians did not adopt horses from the Spanish until the 17th century.)<ref>Kreiger (2002), \"We Came Naked\", pp. 86-87</ref>

In the 1580s, two small Spanish expeditions, that of [[Chamuscado and Rodriguez Expedition|Chamuscado and Rodriguez]] and the later [[Antonio de Espejo]], passed through La Junta.  They reported that the men were \"handsome\" and the women \"beautiful,\" although \"naked and barbarous people.\"<ref>Hammond, George P. and Rey, Agapito, ''The Rediscovery of New Mexico, 1580-1594.'' Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1996, pp. 73-75, 169, 216-220</ref>  The Indians lived in low, flat-roofed houses; grew corn, squash and beans; and hunted and fished along the river.  They gave the Spaniards well-tanned deer and buffalo skins. The expeditions' descriptions of La Junta indicated a more settled agricultural people than those described 50 years earlier by Cabeza de Vaca.<ref>Hammond and Rey (1996), ''Rediscovery of New Mexico'', pp. 73-75, 169, 216-220</ref>

They wrote that the houses at La Junta resembled 

<blockquote>those of the Mexicans ... The natives built them square. They put up forked posts and in those they place rounded timbers the thickness of a man's thigh. Then they add stakes and plaster them with mud. Close to the houses they have granaries built of willow ... where they keep their provisions and harvest of mesquite and other things.<ref name=\"Riley 1997\">Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", 301</ref></blockquote>

This type of house is called a ''[[jacal]]''. The floors of the houses were usually dug about 18&nbsp;inches below ground level, which helped protect against temperature extremes.<ref name=\"Riley 1997\"/><ref>Hammond and Rey (1996), \"Rediscovery of New Mexico\", 75</ref> Built on terraces above the river, their towns had populations averaging about 600 people.

The people grew crops on the floodplains below their towns, planting in areas moistened by overflow from the rivers or near ephemeral streams. Agriculture under such conditions is risky; the people also depended on gathering wild foods such as mesquite, prickly pears, and agaves. They caught catfish in the rivers. Some of the La Junta Indians journeyed to the [[Great Plains]] 150 or more miles northeast to hunt buffalo or trade for buffalo meat with the nomadic Jumano.<ref>Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", 298-300</ref>

The Spanish found the Rio Grande Valley well-populated north to present-day [[El Paso, Texas]].  Beyond there, they encountered no people until the [[Pueblo]] settlements fifteen days' travel upriver from El Paso. Above La Junta they encountered peoples later called the [[Suma-Jumano|Suma]] and [[Manso Indians]].  They seem to have been less agricultural and more nomadic than the people of La Junta.<ref>Hammond and Rey (1996), \"Rediscovery of New Mexico\", pp. 216-220</ref>

Based on the development of their weapons and shields, warfare between the La Junta Indians and their neighbors seemed common.  Spanish explorers described composite bows strengthened with buffalo sinews and \"excellent shields\" of buffalo hide.<ref>Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", p. 306</ref>

Slave raids at La Junta by the Spanish may have begun as early as 1563; at about the same time that [[Apache]] Indians began raiding from the north. The Spanish transported captured La Junta Indians to work as laborers in the silver mines of [[Parral, Chihuahua]].<ref>\"Texas Beyond History\", http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/encounters.html, accessed 25 February 2015</ref>

== Later history ==
After the Spanish found shorter routes to travel north to their colonies in New Mexico, they bypassed La Junta.  It became a quiet backwater of little interest except to slavers and priests. In the 17th century, the accumulated losses due to Eurasian [[infectious diseases]], and Apache and Spanish raids caused the population to diminish.
 
In 1683, [[Juan Sabeata]], a Jumano, re-ignited Spanish interest in La Junta. He appealed to the governor in El Paso to send priests to the area, saying that the Indians wanted to become Christian. Sabeata also asked the Spanish to help the La Junta to defend against the Apache.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jumanos.html?id=P1-s3oSudIIC Hickerson, Nancy Parrott. ''The Jumanos: Hunters and Traders of the South Plains''], Austin: U of Texas Press, 1994, pp. 128-130</ref> Four priests and several soldiers were assigned to La Junta, arriving to find that the Indians had already built thatched-roof churches for them.  The Spanish appointed Sabeata as governor and La Junta became temporarily prominent as a regional trade center, but Sabeata could not gain Spanish assistance to combat the Apache.

When the Indians all over northern Mexico revolted in 1689 to protest the continuing [[slave trade]], the missions in La Junta were closed.  The Spanish tried to reestablish a foothold there; a party visited in 1715, when they found the population had declined to 2,100.  They did not build a fort and mission until 1760. By this time the La Junta Indians had further declined in number. Many of the survivors soon left the area, discouraged by the harshness of Spanish rule, continuing Apache raids, and a new threat from the [[Comanche]], who had moved south from [[Colorado]].  Some La Junta Indians were forcibly transported to work in the silver mines of Parral; others intermarried with Spanish soldiers and their descendants became part of the [[Mestizo]] population; and still others joined their former enemies, the Apache and the Comanche.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.netjunta/frontier.html \"La Junta de los Rios: Spanish Frontier\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, Accessed Nov 30, 2010</ref>

[[Category:Native American history of Texas]]
[[Category:Archaeology of the United States]]","'''La Junta Indians''' is a collective name for the various Indians living in the area known as ''La Junta de los Rios'' (\"the confluence of the rivers\": the [[Rio Grande]] and the [[Conchos River]]) on the borders of present-day West [[Texas]] and [[Mexico]].  In 1535 [[Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca]] recorded visiting these peoples while making his way to a Spanish settlement. They cultivated crops in the river floodplains, as well as gathering indigenous plants and catching fish from the rivers. They were part of an extensive trading network in the region.  As a crossroads, the area attracted people of different tribes.

In the eighteenth century, the Spanish set up missions in the area and the Native Americans gradually lost their tribal identifications. After suffering severe population losses through [[infectious disease]], the Spanish [[slave trade]], and attacks by raiding [[Apache]] and [[Comanche]], the La Junta Indians disappeared. Some intermarried with Spanish soldiers and their descendants became part of the [[Mestizo]] population of Mexico; others merged with the Apache and Comanche; still others departed to work on Spanish haciendas and in silver mines.

==Setting==
The Rio Grande and the Conchos River unite near the present-day cities of [[Presidio, Texas]], and [[Ojinaga, Mexico]].  The Conchos is more than twice as large as the Rio Grande, but below the confluence the river is known as the Rio Grande.  The area was named ''La Junta'' by Spanish explorers for the confluence, or junction, of rivers.  A mile-wide floodplain extends from La Junta 35 miles upstream to Ruidosa and 18 miles downstream to Redford on the Rio Grande; it extends up the Rio Conchos 30 miles to Cuchillo Parado.  The floodplain supports a thick growth of reeds, mesquite, willows, and groves of cottonwood trees.

[[File:Conchos_basin_map.png|thumb|right|200px|La Junta is located at the [[confluence]] of the Conchos River and the Rio Grande. The Conchos River is the larger of the two.]]

Two terraces rise 20 and 60 feet above the floodplain. Only desert vegetation grows on the terraces. The La Junta Indians lived on the terraces and used the floodplain for agriculture, fishing, hunting, and gathering wild foods. Rugged mountains ring the river valley and terraces.<ref>Kelley, J. Charles, \"The Historic Indian Pueblos of La Junta de Los Rios,\" ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Vol. 27, No, 4, Oct 1952, 258-260</ref>  
La Junta is near the center of the [[Chihuahua Desert]] and receives an average of 10.8&nbsp;inches (270&nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually. Lengthy droughts are common. Summers are very hot and winters are mild, although freezes are frequent.<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/homeandgarden/home/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USTX1094 \"Monthly Temperatures for Presidio, Texas\"], The Weather Channel, accessed Nov 29, 2010</ref>

==Prehistory==
The abundant water, plant, and animal life attracted [[indigenous peoples]] to the La Junta region for thousands of years. Settled village life, with agriculture supplementing traditional hunting and gathering, began by 1200 A.D.<ref name=\"Junta\">[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/index.html \"La Junta de los Rios: Villagers of the Chihuahuan Desert Rivers\"], ''Texas Beyond History,'' 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29, 2010</ref> Archaeologists suggest that La Junta was settled as an expansion southeastward of the Jornada [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]] culture and people who lived around present-day [[El Paso, Texas]], 200 miles up the Rio Grande.  It may also have been influenced by [[Casas Grandes]], a notable prehistoric Indian civilization of the late 14th century located 200 miles west in present-day Mexico. Its people built complex communities with multi-story buildings and used highly developed irrigation systems to support agriculture.
   
Based on recent research of architectural styles and mortuary practices, scholars believe that the people of La Junta may have been indigenous to the area.  Between 1450 and 1500 many of the Jornada Mogollon settlements in western Texas were abandoned, possibly because of drought that made agriculture infeasible. The inhabitants possibly reverted to a hunter-gatherer culture that has left few traces in the archaeological record. The settlements at La Junta apparently survived the drought, although changes in the types of dwellings occurred and distinctive, locally produced pottery became common—or more common.<ref>Miller, Myles R. and Kenmotsu, Nancy A. \"Prehistory of the Jornada Mogollon and Eastern Trans-Pecos Regions of West Texas,\" In Perttula, Timothy, ''The Prehistory of Texas''.  College Station: Texas A & M U Press, 2004, pp. 258-260</ref>

The architectural styles of the houses and mortuary practices differ from the Mogollon. Most of the pottery at La Junta from prehistoric times is Jornada Mogollon, but archeologists believe that it was imported by trading rather than locally produced.  La Junta eventually produced its own distinct style of pottery, although perhaps not until about 1500 A.D.  The La Junta people, although influenced by the Mogollon culture, may have been a different linguistic and ethnic group.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/reconsidered.html \"La Junta de los Rios: La Junta Reconsidered\"], ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29, 2010</ref>

Research on bones and teeth indicates that the La Junta people continued to be dependent on hunting and gathering even after they became settled villagers and adopted agriculture. Researchers were surprised to learn that the peoples received less than 25 percent of their subsistence from maize; the rest came from game and wild foods. This is in contrast to typical agricultural cultures in which people received the majority of nutrition from cultivated crops.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/insights.html \"La Junta de los Rios: New Insights\"], ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, accessed Nov 29,2010</ref>

Little of their language, or languages, was recorded; scholars have not agreed on the language of the La Junta people. The most common guess is that they spoke [[Uto-Aztecan]], but [[Kiowa–Tanoan]] and [[Athapaskan]] ([[Apache]]) have also been suggested.  As the La Junta people lived at a crossroads in the desert, they may have been different ethnic groups who spoke multiple languages. For instance, the nomadic [[Jumano Indians|Jumano]] were frequent visitors and trading partners; they may also have been part-time residents of the area and were known to be ethnically distinct from the full-time villagers.<ref>Riley, Carroll L. ''The Frontier People: The Greater Southwest in the Protohistoric Period''. Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1987, p. 297-298</ref>

Given the limited amount of land suitable for agriculture and the austere environment, scholars estimate a population of 3,000 or 4,000 people at La Junta.  But, the Spanish explorer [[Antonio de Espejo]] estimated the area's population at more than 10,000. The modern scholar Howard G. Applegate has calculated that the resources were sufficient to support such a population,<ref>Applegate, Howard G. \"The Demography of La Junta de los Rios del Norte y Conchos,\" ''The Journal of Big Bend Studies,'' Vol IV, 1972, pp. 43-73</ref> but others disagree. The population during the year probably varied, as many of the Indians were semi-nomadic. The Spanish referred to the various peoples at La Junta as Amotomancos, Otomoacos, Abriaches, Julimes, and Patarabueyes. They were sometimes collectively called Jumano, although that name may more properly apply to the nomadic [[bison|buffalo]] hunters who also frequented La Junta.<ref>Riley (1987), \"The Frontier People\", pp. 293-296</ref>

==Spanish encounters==
[[File:Expedition Cabeza de Vaca Karte.png|thumb|left|500px|Cabeza de Vaca's route. La Junta is the area of the [[confluence]] of the Conchos River and the Rio Grande.]]

The Spanish castaway Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca probably passed through or near La Junta in 1535 on his way to a Spanish settlement.  He reported encountering \"the people of the cows\" and said they were \"people with the best bodies that we saw and the greatest liveliness.\"<ref>Kreiger, Alex D. ''We Came Naked and Barefoot: The Journey of Cabeza de Vaca across North America''. Austin: U of TX Press, 2002, pp. 86-87</ref> These were likely the Jumano, buffalo-hunting Indians who lived further north and east along the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and [[Concho River|Concho]] rivers, and traded and wintered in the La Junta region. Cabeza de Vaca described the area as well populated and agricultural, although with little good land.  The Indians had not planted corn for the previous two years because of drought.  De Vaca noted that they put hot stones in gourds to cook their food. They were not described as using pottery; like other nomadic peoples, they found it too heavy to be easily carried.  (The Indians did not adopt horses from the Spanish until the 17th century.)<ref>Kreiger (2002), \"We Came Naked\", pp. 86-87</ref>

In the 1580s, two small Spanish expeditions, that of [[Chamuscado and Rodriguez Expedition|Chamuscado and Rodriguez]] and the later [[Antonio de Espejo]], passed through La Junta.  They reported that the men were \"handsome\" and the women \"beautiful,\" although \"naked and barbarous people.\"<ref>Hammond, George P. and Rey, Agapito, ''The Rediscovery of New Mexico, 1580-1594.'' Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1996, pp. 73-75, 169, 216-220</ref>  The Indians lived in low, flat-roofed houses; grew corn, squash and beans; and hunted and fished along the river.  They gave the Spaniards well-tanned deer and buffalo skins. The expeditions' descriptions of La Junta indicated a more settled agricultural people than those described 50 years earlier by Cabeza de Vaca.<ref>Hammond and Rey (1996), ''Rediscovery of New Mexico'', pp. 73-75, 169, 216-220</ref>

They wrote that the houses at La Junta resembled 

<blockquote>those of the Mexicans ... The natives built them square. They put up forked posts and in those they place rounded timbers the thickness of a man's thigh. Then they add stakes and plaster them with mud. Close to the houses they have granaries built of willow ... where they keep their provisions and harvest of mesquite and other things.<ref name=\"Riley 1997\">Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", 301</ref></blockquote>

This type of house is called a ''[[jacal]]''. The floors of the houses were usually dug about 18&nbsp;inches below ground level, which helped protect against temperature extremes.<ref name=\"Riley 1997\"/><ref>Hammond and Rey (1996), \"Rediscovery of New Mexico\", 75</ref> Built on terraces above the river, their towns had populations averaging about 600 people.

The people grew crops on the floodplains below their towns, planting in areas moistened by overflow from the rivers or near ephemeral streams. Agriculture under such conditions is risky; the people also depended on gathering wild foods such as mesquite, prickly pears, and agaves. They caught catfish in the rivers. Some of the La Junta Indians journeyed to the [[Great Plains]] 150 or more miles northeast to hunt buffalo or trade for buffalo meat with the nomadic Jumano.<ref>Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", 298-300</ref>

The Spanish found the Rio Grande Valley well-populated north to present-day [[El Paso, Texas]].  Beyond there, they encountered no people until the [[Pueblo]] settlements fifteen days' travel upriver from El Paso. Above La Junta they encountered peoples later called the [[Suma-Jumano|Suma]] and [[Manso Indians]].  They seem to have been less agricultural and more nomadic than the people of La Junta.<ref>Hammond and Rey (1996), \"Rediscovery of New Mexico\", pp. 216-220</ref>

Based on the development of their weapons and shields, warfare between the La Junta Indians and their neighbors seemed common.  Spanish explorers described composite bows strengthened with buffalo sinews and \"excellent shields\" of buffalo hide.<ref>Riley (1997), \"The Frontier People\", p. 306</ref>

Slave raids at La Junta by the Spanish may have begun as early as 1563; at about the same time that [[Apache]] Indians began raiding from the north. The Spanish transported captured La Junta Indians to work as laborers in the silver mines of [[Parral, Chihuahua]].<ref>\"Texas Beyond History\", http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/junta/encounters.html, accessed 25 February 2015</ref>

== Later history ==
After the Spanish found shorter routes to travel north to their colonies in New Mexico, they bypassed La Junta.  It became a quiet backwater of little interest except to slavers and priests. In the 17th century, the accumulated losses due to Eurasian [[infectious diseases]], and Apache and Spanish raids caused the population to diminish.
 
In 1683, [[Juan Sabeata]], a Jumano, re-ignited Spanish interest in La Junta. He appealed to the governor in El Paso to send priests to the area, saying that the Indians wanted to become Christian. Sabeata also asked the Spanish to help the La Junta to defend against the Apache.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jumanos.html?id=P1-s3oSudIIC Hickerson, Nancy Parrott. ''The Jumanos: Hunters and Traders of the South Plains''], Austin: U of Texas Press, 1994, pp. 128-130</ref> Four priests and several soldiers were assigned to La Junta, arriving to find that the Indians had already built thatched-roof churches for them.  The Spanish appointed Sabeata as governor and La Junta became temporarily prominent as a regional trade center, but Sabeata could not gain Spanish assistance to combat the Apache.

When the Indians all over northern Mexico revolted in 1689 to protest the continuing [[slave trade]], the missions in La Junta were closed.  The Spanish tried to reestablish a foothold there; a party visited in 1715, when they found the population had declined to 2,100.  They did not build a fort and mission until 1760. By this time the La Junta Indians had further declined in number. Many of the survivors soon left the area, discouraged by the harshness of Spanish rule, continuing Apache raids, and a new threat from the [[Comanche]], who had moved south from [[Colorado]].  Some La Junta Indians were forcibly transported to work in the silver mines of Parral; others intermarried with Spanish soldiers and their descendants became part of the [[Mestizo]] population; and still others joined their former enemies, the Apache and the Comanche.<ref>[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.netjunta/frontier.html \"La Junta de los Rios: Spanish Frontier\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Texas Beyond History'', 2007, University of Texas at Austin, Accessed Nov 30, 2010</ref>

[[Rugby union]] is a moderately popular team sport played in [[Romania]] with a tradition of more than 100 years. The Romanian men's national team was 14th in the [[IRB World Rankings]] in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |title=International Rugby Board - World Rankings: Full world rankings |publisher=Irb.com |accessdate=2016-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810042746/http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Governing body==
Rugby union in Romania is administered by the [[Romanian Rugby Federation]] (Federaţia Română de Rugby), which was founded in 1913 as Federațiunea Societăților de Sport din România (FSSR).<ref name=agerpres>{{cite web|url=https://www1.agerpres.ro/flux-documentare/2017/05/19/istoria-sportului-romanesc-rugby-10-14-38|title=Istoria sportului românesc: Rugby|work=[[Agerpres]]|language=Romanian|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref> It joined the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] in 1987 when Romania was invited to take part in the inaugural [[1987 Rugby World Cup]].<ref name=Completerugby>Bath pp 73, 74</ref>

The current president is [[Alin Petrache]]

== History ==
===Early history===
The game was introduced to Romania from France at the turn of the 20th century by students returning with rugby balls from their studies in [[Paris]].<ref name=Completerugby/> Romanian rugby took root in [[Bucharest]], established by students who had been to French universities, and by the capital's burgeoning middle class.<ref name=Completerugby/> Stadiul Român and seventeen other teams would be formed in Bucharest from 1913 onwards. The [[Romanian Rugby Championship]] was first contested in 1914. Romania played France for the first time in 1924.<ref name=Completerugby/>

[[File:Stade de Colombes, 22.06.1919, jeux interalliés, rugby, match France contre Roumanie.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Romania versus [[France national rugby union team|France]] at the [[Inter-Allied Games]] of 1919]] 
The nation's first international was played against the USA in 1919 six years after the game was first introduced.<ref name=agerpres/> In 1931 a governing body was formed, the [[Federaţia Română de Rugby]].

The first team outside Bucharest was formed at an aircraft factory in [[Braşov]] in 1939.

===Communist period===
For the first half of the 20th century, Romanian rugby was fairly isolated, having most of its contact with France,<ref name=Completerugby/> and to an extent, the [[Iron Curtain]] in the second half did not help either. However, this \"isolation\" was broken when [[Rowe Harding]] took the Welsh team [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]] touring there, to play national champions, Locomotiva.<ref name=Completerugby/> On his return to the UK, Harding spoke highly of the Romanian game, speaking of its consistently high standard and of the passion of both the fans and the players, which he thought unparallelled in Europe outside the Five Nations.<ref name=Completerugby/> The tour and Harding's praise effectively opened up Romanian rugby to the rest of western Europe, sparking a number of tours travelling to and from the country.<ref name=Completerugby/> In 1955, a Romanian side toured England and Wales, playing Swansea, Cardiff, Bristol and the Harlequins, winning one, drawing two, and losing one.<ref name=Completerugby/> Later in 1955, the Romanians defeated Llanelli in [[Moscow]], and then beat both Cardiff and Harlequins in [[Bucharest]].<ref name=Completerugby/> Only France, who played Romania before almost 95,000 fans in Bucharest (in a preliminary match to a soccer international), could beat the Romanians, and that was only after an epic 16-15 battle.<ref name=Completerugby/>

A generation of French school-trained coaches from the late 1940s and 1950s laid the foundations for national success in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. In 1974 Romania won against France 15 – 10 in Bucharest,<ref name=\"espnscrum_a\">http://www.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/match/20798.html</ref>  and the FIRA – Association of European Rugby championship.<ref name=\"en.wikipedia\">[[1974–1975 FIRA Trophy]]</ref> In 1975 Romania went for an 8 games [[1975 Romania rugby union tour of New Zealand|tour to New Zealand]], tour concluded in Wellington with a 10-10 draw against [[Junior All Blacks]]. [[Home nation]] sides began to award international caps for matches against Romania from 1981. Romania won rugby internationals over Scotland in 1984 and 1991, and also over Wales in 1983 and 1988 (the later in Cardiff).<ref name=Completerugby/> Between 1960 and 1990, Romania beat France eight times, the most famous being in 1990 when the legendary French based no. 8 [[Hari Dumitras]] led Romania to a 12-6 victory in [[Auch]], France.<ref name=Completerugby/> [[Canada national rugby union team|Canadian]] second row [[Norm Hadley]] believed the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]] game against Romania was more physically sapping than playing either France or New Zealand.<ref name=Completerugby/>

The former [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] scrum half [[Chris Laidlaw]], writing at the end of the 1970s, saw rugby as a positive force in East-West relations at the time:

:\"''Rugby has become the ping-pong of outdoor sports in its capacity to spread goodwill between East and West. Over the last 30 or 40 years it has spread through Eastern Europe, establishing itself strongly in Rumania and [[Rugby union in Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Rugby union in Hungary|Hungary]] and into the [[Rugby union in the Soviet Union|USSR]]. The fact that a Russian team [sic] has finally played a full-scale, if unofficial Test match against {{nrut|France}} speaks for itself.''

:\"''Rugby tours between countries on either side of the [[Iron Curtain]] have generated considerable political interest among the governments concerned, and the results can be quite astonishing. The recent {{nrut|Rumania}}n tour of New Zealand, for instance, germinated other contacts between the two countries and was partly instrumental in the establishment of new trade agreements which otherwise might not have begun.''\"<ref name=Laidlaw>Laidlaw, p52</ref>

Chris Laidlaw writing of the open secret of shamateurism in Soviet sport said:
:\"''So far as the East Europeans and the [[Rugby union in Russia|Russians]] are concerned, who knows where the incentives lie? In such societies rugby, like many other sports before it, is becoming an expression of national achievement and therefore the subject of careful nurturing. Yet, is the risk of the double standard, so evident in the athletic arena, permeating the [[East Europeans]]' approach to rugby so great as to justify the exclusion of the Communist world indefinitely from regular rugby competition?''\"<ref name=Laidlaw/>

:\"''Much to everyone's surprise, Eastern Bloc countries are among the game's vigorous participants, seemingly oblivious to rugby's capitalist class-ridden origins. Russia emerged from behind the Iron Curtain and came under international scrutiny when they played France in Toulouse in November 1978. Romania, Poland and Czechoslovakia are members of the [[FIRA – Association of European Rugby|Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur]], the governing body for those countries not in the [[International Rugby Board|IB]].''\"<ref>Hopkins, John (ed) ''Rugby'' (1979 {{ISBN|0-304-30299-6}}), p8</ref>

===Post-Communism===
After the fall of Communism in 1989, Romanian rugby union suffered a dramatic financial shortfall.  In 1995 the first ever [[Heineken Cup]] match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constanţa.

Romania first got regular international competition when they joined the newly formed [[European Nations Cup (rugby union)|European Nations Cup]] in 2000. As an indication of the decline in standard of the sport in Romania, the national team was defeated 134-0 by England in 2001 and Dinamo Bucharest lost 151-0 to Saracens in the [[European Rugby Shield]].

[[Bucureşti Rugby]] was formed to represent Romania in European club competitions in 2004. In recent years they have achieved respectable results, including a win in 2010 against an Italian super 10 side.

== National team ==
{{Main|Romania national rugby union team}}
[[File:Romania national rugby union team.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Romania national rugby union team after receiving the Pershing Trophy in 2016 at their home ground, Stadionul Arcul de Triumf after a test match against [[United States national rugby union team|USA]]]]
The [[Romania national rugby union team]], nicknamed The Oaks, has long been one of the stronger European teams outside the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] tournament. It takes part in international competitions, notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]] and the [[Super Powers Cup]].

Romania has played at every [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] so far and won one game at each World Cup, except for [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]] and [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]] when it lost all its games.

Romania plays in the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]], a second-level competition for second and third-tier European nations. Romania has won the competition on three occasions 2000, 2001–2002 and 2005-2006.

The [[Antim Cup]] is contested between Georgia and Romania. The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches or qualifiers. The holder retains the cup unless the challenger wins the match in normal time.

Romania replaced Russia in the [[Super Powers Cup|Super Cup]] in 2005. Other participants include [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] and [[United States national rugby union team|the United States]].

== Domestic competitions ==
{{Further|Romanian Rugby Championship}}

The Romanian Rugby Championship, which has been contested since 1914, is the main domestic competition.

==European club tournaments==

In 1995 the first ever [[Heineken Cup]] match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constanţa. Since the inaugural season, Romanian teams have not taken part in the Heineken Cup.

A Romanian team has taken part in the [[European Challenge Cup]] in 1996−97, 1997−98, 1998−99, 1999−2000, 2001−02, 2002−03, and each season since 2005−06. No Romanian teams took part in 2000−01, 2003−04 and 2004−05.

[[Bucureşti Rugby]] is a team that is formed to play in European competition, consisting of rugby union players playing in the domestic Romanian leagues. They played in the [[European Shield]] in 2004−05, and have played in each Challenge Cup since the 2005−06 edition.

== Popularity ==
In the 1980s the country had more than 12,000 players in 110 clubs.

After the fall of Communism, Romanian rugby union suffered a drastic financial shortfall.  Its popularity - which has never been comparable with that of [[association football|football]] or [[Team handball|handball]] - has not diminished, however.

According to the [[International Rugby Board]] Romania has 52 rugby union clubs; 142 referees; 1,200 pre-teen male players; 4,100 teen male players; 1,375 senior male players (total male players 6,675) as well as 150 pre-teen female players; 200 teen female players; 125 senior female players (total female players 475).<ref name=IRB2>[http://www.irb.com/en/Home/MemberUnionHomePage?UnionID=86&Tab=3 Romania on IRB.com]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 9 September 2009</ref>

[[Rugby union]] is a moderately popular team sport played in [[Romania]] with a tradition of more than 100 years. The Romanian men's national team was 14th in the [[IRB World Rankings]] in February 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |title=International Rugby Board - World Rankings: Full world rankings |publisher=Irb.com |accessdate=2016-03-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810042746/http://www.irb.com/rankings/full.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Governing body==
Rugby union in Romania is administered by the [[Romanian Rugby Federation]] (Federaţia Română de Rugby), which was founded in 1913 as Federațiunea Societăților de Sport din România (FSSR).<ref name=agerpres>{{cite web|url=https://www1.agerpres.ro/flux-documentare/2017/05/19/istoria-sportului-romanesc-rugby-10-14-38|title=Istoria sportului românesc: Rugby|work=[[Agerpres]]|language=Romanian|date=19 May 2017|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref> It joined the [[International Rugby Board|IRB]] in 1987 when Romania was invited to take part in the inaugural [[1987 Rugby World Cup]].<ref name=Completerugby>Bath pp 73, 74</ref>

The current president is [[Alin Petrache]]

== History ==
===Early history===
The game was introduced to Romania from France at the turn of the 20th century by students returning with rugby balls from their studies in [[Paris]].<ref name=Completerugby/> Romanian rugby took root in [[Bucharest]], established by students who had been to French universities, and by the capital's burgeoning middle class.<ref name=Completerugby/> Stadiul Român and seventeen other teams would be formed in Bucharest from 1913 onwards. The [[Romanian Rugby Championship]] was first contested in 1914. Romania played France for the first time in 1924.<ref name=Completerugby/>

[[File:Stade de Colombes, 22.06.1919, jeux interalliés, rugby, match France contre Roumanie.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Romania versus [[France national rugby union team|France]] at the [[Inter-Allied Games]] of 1919]] 
The nation's first international was played against the USA in 1919 six years after the game was first introduced.<ref name=agerpres/> In 1931 a governing body was formed, the [[Federaţia Română de Rugby]].

The first team outside Bucharest was formed at an aircraft factory in [[Braşov]] in 1939.

===Communist period===
For the first half of the 20th century, Romanian rugby was fairly isolated, having most of its contact with France,<ref name=Completerugby/> and to an extent, the [[Iron Curtain]] in the second half did not help either. However, this \"isolation\" was broken when [[Rowe Harding]] took the Welsh team [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]] touring there, to play national champions, Locomotiva.<ref name=Completerugby/> On his return to the UK, Harding spoke highly of the Romanian game, speaking of its consistently high standard and of the passion of both the fans and the players, which he thought unparallelled in Europe outside the Five Nations.<ref name=Completerugby/> The tour and Harding's praise effectively opened up Romanian rugby to the rest of western Europe, sparking a number of tours travelling to and from the country.<ref name=Completerugby/> In 1955, a Romanian side toured England and Wales, playing Swansea, Cardiff, Bristol and the Harlequins, winning one, drawing two, and losing one.<ref name=Completerugby/> Later in 1955, the Romanians defeated Llanelli in [[Moscow]], and then beat both Cardiff and Harlequins in [[Bucharest]].<ref name=Completerugby/> Only France, who played Romania before almost 95,000 fans in Bucharest (in a preliminary match to a soccer international), could beat the Romanians, and that was only after an epic 16-15 battle.<ref name=Completerugby/>

A generation of French school-trained coaches from the late 1940s and 1950s laid the foundations for national success in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. In 1974 Romania won against France 15 – 10 in Bucharest,<ref name=\"espnscrum_a\">http://www.espnscrum.com/statsguru/rugby/match/20798.html</ref>  and the FIRA – Association of European Rugby championship.<ref name=\"en.wikipedia\">[[1974–1975 FIRA Trophy]]</ref> In 1975 Romania went for an 8 games [[1975 Romania rugby union tour of New Zealand|tour to New Zealand]], tour concluded in Wellington with a 10-10 draw against [[Junior All Blacks]]. [[Home nation]] sides began to award international caps for matches against Romania from 1981. Romania won rugby internationals over Scotland in 1984 and 1991, and also over Wales in 1983 and 1988 (the later in Cardiff).<ref name=Completerugby/> Between 1960 and 1990, Romania beat France eight times, the most famous being in 1990 when the legendary French based no. 8 [[Hari Dumitras]] led Romania to a 12-6 victory in [[Auch]], France.<ref name=Completerugby/> [[Canada national rugby union team|Canadian]] second row [[Norm Hadley]] believed the [[1991 Rugby World Cup]] game against Romania was more physically sapping than playing either France or New Zealand.<ref name=Completerugby/>

The former [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] scrum half [[Chris Laidlaw]], writing at the end of the 1970s, saw rugby as a positive force in East-West relations at the time:

:\"''Rugby has become the ping-pong of outdoor sports in its capacity to spread goodwill between East and West. Over the last 30 or 40 years it has spread through Eastern Europe, establishing itself strongly in Rumania and [[Rugby union in Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Rugby union in Hungary|Hungary]] and into the [[Rugby union in the Soviet Union|USSR]]. The fact that a Russian team [sic] has finally played a full-scale, if unofficial Test match against {{nrut|France}} speaks for itself.''

:\"''Rugby tours between countries on either side of the [[Iron Curtain]] have generated considerable political interest among the governments concerned, and the results can be quite astonishing. The recent {{nrut|Rumania}}n tour of New Zealand, for instance, germinated other contacts between the two countries and was partly instrumental in the establishment of new trade agreements which otherwise might not have begun.''\"<ref name=Laidlaw>Laidlaw, p52</ref>

Chris Laidlaw writing of the open secret of shamateurism in Soviet sport said:
:\"''So far as the East Europeans and the [[Rugby union in Russia|Russians]] are concerned, who knows where the incentives lie? In such societies rugby, like many other sports before it, is becoming an expression of national achievement and therefore the subject of careful nurturing. Yet, is the risk of the double standard, so evident in the athletic arena, permeating the East Europeans' approach to rugby so great as to justify the exclusion of the Communist world indefinitely from regular rugby competition?''\"<ref name=Laidlaw/>

:\"''Much to everyone's surprise, Eastern Bloc countries are among the game's vigorous participants, seemingly oblivious to rugby's capitalist class-ridden origins. Russia emerged from behind the Iron Curtain and came under international scrutiny when they played France in Toulouse in November 1978. Romania, Poland and Czechoslovakia are members of the [[FIRA – Association of European Rugby|Federation Internationale de Rugby Amateur]], the governing body for those countries not in the [[International Rugby Board|IB]].''\"<ref>Hopkins, John (ed) ''Rugby'' (1979 {{ISBN|0-304-30299-6}}), p8</ref>

===Post-Communism===
After the fall of Communism in 1989, Romanian rugby union suffered a dramatic financial shortfall.  In 1995 the first ever [[Heineken Cup]] match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constanţa.

Romania first got regular international competition when they joined the newly formed [[European Nations Cup (rugby union)|European Nations Cup]] in 2000. As an indication of the decline in standard of the sport in Romania, the national team was defeated 134-0 by England in 2001 and Dinamo Bucharest lost 151-0 to Saracens in the [[European Rugby Shield]].

[[Bucureşti Rugby]] was formed to represent Romania in European club competitions in 2004. In recent years they have achieved respectable results, including a win in 2010 against an Italian super 10 side.

== National team ==
{{Main|Romania national rugby union team}}
[[File:Romania national rugby union team.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Romania national rugby union team after receiving the Pershing Trophy in 2016 at their home ground, Stadionul Arcul de Triumf after a test match against [[United States national rugby union team|USA]]]]
The [[Romania national rugby union team]], nicknamed The Oaks, has long been one of the stronger European teams outside the [[Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] tournament. It takes part in international competitions, notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]] and the [[Super Powers Cup]].

Romania has played at every [[Rugby World Cup|World Cup]] so far and won one game at each World Cup, except for [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]] and [[2011 Rugby World Cup|2011]] when it lost all its games.

Romania plays in the [[European Nations Cup (Rugby Union)|European Nations Cup]], a second-level competition for second and third-tier European nations. Romania has won the competition on three occasions 2000, 2001–2002 and 2005-2006.

The [[Antim Cup]] is contested between Georgia and Romania. The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches or qualifiers. The holder retains the cup unless the challenger wins the match in normal time.

Romania replaced Russia in the [[Super Powers Cup|Super Cup]] in 2005. Other participants include [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] and [[United States national rugby union team|the United States]].

== Domestic competitions ==
{{Further|Romanian Rugby Championship}}

The Romanian Rugby Championship, which has been contested since 1914, is the main domestic competition.

==European club tournaments==

In 1995 the first ever [[Heineken Cup]] match took place in Romania with Toulouse taking on Farul Constanţa. Since the inaugural season, Romanian teams have not taken part in the Heineken Cup.

A Romanian team has taken part in the [[European Challenge Cup]] in 1996−97, 1997−98, 1998−99, 1999−2000, 2001−02, 2002−03, and each season since 2005−06. No Romanian teams took part in 2000−01, 2003−04 and 2004−05.

[[Bucureşti Rugby]] is a team that is formed to play in European competition, consisting of rugby union players playing in the domestic Romanian leagues. They played in the [[European Shield]] in 2004−05, and have played in each Challenge Cup since the 2005−06 edition.

== Popularity ==
In the 1980s the country had more than 12,000 players in 110 clubs.

After the fall of Communism, Romanian rugby union suffered a drastic financial shortfall.  Its popularity - which has never been comparable with that of [[association football|football]] or [[Team handball|handball]] - has not diminished, however.

According to the [[International Rugby Board]] Romania has 52 rugby union clubs; 142 referees; 1,200 pre-teen male players; 4,100 teen male players; 1,375 senior male players (total male players 6,675) as well as 150 pre-teen female players; 200 teen female players; 125 senior female players (total female players 475).<ref name=IRB2>[http://www.irb.com/en/Home/MemberUnionHomePage?UnionID=86&Tab=3 Romania on IRB.com]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 9 September 2009</ref>

'''''George of the Jungle''''' is a Canadian–American [[animated television series]]. It is the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of [[George of the Jungle|the 1967 animated series of the same name]], using [[Flash animation]]. It ripped off [[Dora the Explorer]]. It is produced in Canada, airing there on [[Teletoon]]. The remake mostly stays true to the original production, with a few key differences existing between the two. One episode of the show typically consists of two 12-minute episodes. This is unlike the original cartoon, which featured other stories such as ''[[Tom Slick (TV series)|Tom Slick]]'' and ''[[Super Chicken]]''.

The original series aired from June 29, 2007 until January 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=support_crtc_gc_ca15052016 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming |url=https://archive.org/details/support_crtc_gc_ca15052016 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The original series premiered on [[Teletoon]] on January 11, 2009 and on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States exactly a year prior.

The series returned 8 years after the original first season with a second season on September 10, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: The Insider |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/the-insider-3410634/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: Clockwork George |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/clockwork-george-3410635/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref> The revival season concluded on February 18, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: The Last Treehugger |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/the-last-treehugger-3445801/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: Heart of Gold |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/heart-of-gold-3445802/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle {{!}} TV Guide |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george-of-the-jungle/episode-51-season-2/the-last-treehugger/292169/ |website=TVGuide.com |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle {{!}} TV Guide |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george-of-the-jungle/episode-52-season-2/heart-of-gold/292169/ |website=TVGuide.com |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

==Characters==
===Main===
* George – A friendly, yet dim-witted, strong man in a [[loincloth]], he lives in a jungle in [[Africa]]. Possessing incredible strength, bravery and a penchant for repeatedly crashing into trees while vine-swinging, George acts as the protector of all the jungle's inhabitants. He also acts immature and refers to himself in the [[Illeism|third person]]. In the second season of the series, he now has muscles to resemble his design in the original series.
* ''Ape'' – A sarcastic and intelligent [[gorilla]] that lives with George in the jungle. He functions as George's surrogate brother, parental figure and best friend, although his attempts to educate George have a long history of repeated failures. He also tends to serve as the voice of reason most of the time. In \"George's Birthday Present\", it is revealed Ape is 5 years old in ape years. Every time he hears the sound of Mitch's bongos, he dances uncontrollably, which results in mass insanity and the destruction of their tree house. He also dances on his fingers when George uses a leaf as a [[kazoo]] as revealed in \"Ape Goes Ape\". In season 2 Ape now has a British accent to match his intelligence.
* Ursula – A [[tomboy]]ish city girl who came to live in the jungle with George and his friends along with her father Dr. Scott. She quickly forms a bond with Magnolia, causing the two to be frequently seen together. Young, reckless and eager to introduce modern culture into the jungle, she often tries to educate her new friends to the marvels of modern city life (such as [[Christmas]] or [[Traffic light|traffic systems]]), only to usually have her attempts backfire. Regardless, she does her best to assist her friends when necessary. She is still adjusting to jungle life, and so she still has much to learn. In season 2, her name is now Magnolia and ventures the land without her father. She is hoping to win some kind of reward when her research is complete (while also hoping to making it out alive?)
* Magnolia – A native of the jungle and [[valley girl]] figure, she is one of George's closest friends since she came to the jungle. Despite her dressing in jungle attire (such as loincloths and sticks) as well as fits of hyperactivity, she originally appeared to be very well educated in both human and jungle knowledge, often helping to bridge the gap between Ursula's city life and jungle life. She speaks with a [[Southern American accent|Southern accent]], and can appear somewhat dimwitted at times. She is the daughter of the Witch Doctor, and therefore a Witch Doctor in training (according to the episode, \"Frankengeorge\"). In season 2, her name is now Ursula and this time speaks almost like a primitive caveman and acts as George's opposite wrecking mayhem through out the jungle.

===Supporting===
* Narrator – The narrator of each George of the Jungle episode. In comparison to the narrator of the original cartoon, he speaks in a documentary-style fashion, often beginning each episode claiming \"To survive in the jungle\". often followed by a situation in complete contrast to the first impression of his introduction.
* Dr. Scott – The modern doctor now living in the jungle with his daughter. He has formed a somewhat friendly (and often hostile) rivalry with the local Witch Doctor, continuously trying to disprove his barbaric medicine and shaman skills with modern science (often with equally unsuccessful results). In season 2 his name is now \"Dr. Chicago\" who is not a father. Sometimes he will be a Dentist or Villains, his plans will mostly be about dentistry or conquest for the jungle, but they will be easily defeated by George and his Friends.
* Witch Doctor – A very compact, diminutive character who believes his shaman skills are the solution to all problems. He often competed with Dr. Scott and his modern medicine to see who can solve a problem first, although neither usually provides the solution to whatever problem they tackle. Reasons unknown, he is no longer on the show in season 2.
* Big Mitch – A conniving [[golden lion tamarin|golden marmoset]] and frequent pest to the jungle community. He lives in an ancient temple full of riches and booby traps, and has a pair of bongos with him.
* Shep –  George's [[elephant]] friend who actually acts like a dog. He travels with George on most of his adventures, only rivaled by the Tookie-Tookie bird. He is very untrained, and can often be seen destroying sections of the jungle. Shep disher to play with George a lot, often playing with him when he should be helping people throughout the jungle.
* Tookie-Tookie Bird – George's second pet, a parrot-like bird that can say his own name.
* Howie - A [[howler monkey]] who runs a juice bar.

===Others===
* Carl –  Carl is a [[baboon]] who constantly makes a fool out of George and Ape.
* Cousin Larry – George's arrogant human cousin, who does his best to win at everything, no matter the cost. He was eventually revealed to be a cheater in all his victories and was ousted from the jungle.
* Cousin [[Papaya]] – George and Ape’s cousin, a [[King Kong]]-like gorilla that made a promise to beat the living daylights out of anyone who would mess with George or Ape and the other gorillas.
* Edward Madmun – The creator of Madmun Island. He has an associate (and later enemy) who helped him climb to the top of [[Mount Everest]] and swim Madmun across the [[English Channel]]. George, Ape and the others often accidentally say \"Madman\" for his name, but someone always reminds them \"It's MadMUN!\".
*[[Lion]] – A lion who was defeated by George in his childhood.
*[[Tiger]] – A hungry predator who likes to feast on small defenseless creatures and appears randomly in cameos (as seen in \"Rainy Season\" and \"Eagle Tick\").

'''''George of the Jungle''''' is a Canadian–American [[animated television series]]. It is the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of [[George of the Jungle|the 1967 animated series of the same name]], using [[Flash animation]]. It is produced in Canada, airing there on [[Teletoon]]. The remake mostly stays true to the original production, with a few key differences existing between the two. One episode of the show typically consists of two 12-minute episodes. This is unlike the original cartoon, which featured other stories such as ''[[Tom Slick (TV series)|Tom Slick]]'' and ''[[Super Chicken]]''.

The original series aired from June 29, 2007 until January 11, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=support_crtc_gc_ca15052016 : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming |url=https://archive.org/details/support_crtc_gc_ca15052016 |website=Internet Archive |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The original series premiered on [[Teletoon]] on January 11, 2009 and on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States exactly a year prior.

The series returned 8 years after the original first season with a second season on September 10, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: The Insider |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/the-insider-3410634/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: Clockwork George |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/clockwork-george-3410635/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref> The revival season concluded on February 18, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: The Last Treehugger |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/the-last-treehugger-3445801/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle: Heart of Gold |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/george-of-the-jungle/heart-of-gold-3445802/ |website=TV.com |accessdate=22 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle {{!}} TV Guide |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george-of-the-jungle/episode-51-season-2/the-last-treehugger/292169/ |website=TVGuide.com |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=George of the Jungle {{!}} TV Guide |url=https://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/george-of-the-jungle/episode-52-season-2/heart-of-gold/292169/ |website=TVGuide.com |accessdate=22 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

==Characters==
===Main===
* George – A friendly, yet dim-witted, strong man in a [[loincloth]], he lives in a jungle in [[Africa]]. Possessing incredible strength, bravery and a penchant for repeatedly crashing into trees while vine-swinging, George acts as the protector of all the jungle's inhabitants. He also acts immature and refers to himself in the [[Illeism|third person]]. In the second season of the series, he now has muscles to resemble his design in the original series.
* ''Ape'' – A sarcastic and intelligent [[gorilla]] that lives with George in the jungle. He functions as George's surrogate brother, parental figure and best friend, although his attempts to educate George have a long history of repeated failures. He also tends to serve as the voice of reason most of the time. In \"George's Birthday Present\", it is revealed Ape is 5 years old in ape years. Every time he hears the sound of Mitch's bongos, he dances uncontrollably, which results in mass insanity and the destruction of their tree house. He also dances on his fingers when George uses a leaf as a [[kazoo]] as revealed in \"Ape Goes Ape\". In season 2 Ape now has a British accent to match his intelligence.
* Ursula – A [[tomboy]]ish city girl who came to live in the jungle with George and his friends along with her father Dr. Scott. She quickly forms a bond with Magnolia, causing the two to be frequently seen together. Young, reckless and eager to introduce modern culture into the jungle, she often tries to educate her new friends to the marvels of modern city life (such as [[Christmas]] or [[Traffic light|traffic systems]]), only to usually have her attempts backfire. Regardless, she does her best to assist her friends when necessary. She is still adjusting to jungle life, and so she still has much to learn. In season 2, her name is now Magnolia and ventures the land without her father. She is hoping to win some kind of reward when her research is complete (while also hoping to making it out alive?)
* Magnolia – A native of the jungle and [[valley girl]] figure, she is one of George's closest friends since she came to the jungle. Despite her dressing in jungle attire (such as loincloths and sticks) as well as fits of hyperactivity, she originally appeared to be very well educated in both human and jungle knowledge, often helping to bridge the gap between Ursula's city life and jungle life. She speaks with a [[Southern American accent|Southern accent]], and can appear somewhat dimwitted at times. She is the daughter of the Witch Doctor, and therefore a Witch Doctor in training (according to the episode, \"Frankengeorge\"). In season 2, her name is now Ursula and this time speaks almost like a primitive caveman and acts as George's opposite wrecking mayhem through out the jungle.

===Supporting===
* Narrator – The narrator of each George of the Jungle episode. In comparison to the narrator of the original cartoon, he speaks in a documentary-style fashion, often beginning each episode claiming \"To survive in the jungle\". often followed by a situation in complete contrast to the first impression of his introduction.
* Dr. Scott – The modern doctor now living in the jungle with his daughter. He has formed a somewhat friendly (and often hostile) rivalry with the local Witch Doctor, continuously trying to disprove his barbaric medicine and shaman skills with modern science (often with equally unsuccessful results). In season 2 his name is now \"Dr. Chicago\" who is not a father. Sometimes he will be a Dentist or Villains, his plans will mostly be about dentistry or conquest for the jungle, but they will be easily defeated by George and his Friends.
* Witch Doctor – A very compact, diminutive character who believes his shaman skills are the solution to all problems. He often competed with Dr. Scott and his modern medicine to see who can solve a problem first, although neither usually provides the solution to whatever problem they tackle. Reasons unknown, he is no longer on the show in season 2.
* Big Mitch – A conniving [[golden lion tamarin|golden marmoset]] and frequent pest to the jungle community. He lives in an ancient temple full of riches and booby traps, and has a pair of bongos with him.
* Shep –  George's [[elephant]] friend who actually acts like a dog. He travels with George on most of his adventures, only rivaled by the Tookie-Tookie bird. He is very untrained, and can often be seen destroying sections of the jungle. Shep disher to play with George a lot, often playing with him when he should be helping people throughout the jungle.
* Tookie-Tookie Bird – George's second pet, a parrot-like bird that can say his own name.
* Howie - A [[howler monkey]] who runs a juice bar.

===Others===
* Carl –  Carl is a [[baboon]] who constantly makes a fool out of George and Ape.
* Cousin Larry – George's arrogant human cousin, who does his best to win at everything, no matter the cost. He was eventually revealed to be a cheater in all his victories and was ousted from the jungle.
* Cousin [[Papaya]] – George and Ape’s cousin, a [[King Kong]]-like gorilla that made a promise to beat the living daylights out of anyone who would mess with George or Ape and the other gorillas.
* Edward Madmun – The creator of Madmun Island. He has an associate (and later enemy) who helped him climb to the top of [[Mount Everest]] and swim Madmun across the [[English Channel]]. George, Ape and the others often accidentally say \"Madman\" for his name, but someone always reminds them \"It's MadMUN!\".
*[[Lion]] – A lion who was defeated by George in his childhood.
*[[Tiger]] – A hungry predator who likes to feast on small defenseless creatures and appears randomly in cameos (as seen in \"Rainy Season\" and \"Eagle Tick\").

Reflist,safe,GünniX,"'''''The Spy''''' was a weekly periodical directed at the Edinburgh market, edited by [[James Hogg]], which appeared from 1 September 1810 to 24 August 1811.

==Background==
Hogg established ''The Spy'' during the year when he exchanged farming life in the south of Scotland for a literary career in Edinburgh. It combined features of essay periodicals such as ''[[The Spectator]]'' and ''[[The Rambler]]'' and miscellanies such as ''[[The Scots Magazine]]''.<ref>James Hogg, ''The Spy'', ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2000), xxvii.</ref> Each issue had normally eight pages, usually containing an essay and one or more original poems. Hogg wrote over half the material himself, with [[James Gray (poet)|James Gray]], Classics master at the [[Royal High School, Edinburgh]] and his wife Mary Gray as his principal contributors. In six numbers (19, 35, 36, 39, 48, and 52) Hogg makes use, without acknowledgment, of passages by [[Samuel Johnson]] from ''The Rambler'' and ''[[The Idler (1758–60)|The Idler]]\".<ref>''The Spy'', xxxii.</ref>

==Editions==
The first 13 numbers were printed, rather crudely, by James Robertson, who usually produced popular booklets and chapbooks. The remainder were more expertly printed by Andrew and James Aikman.<ref>''The Spy'', xx‒xxvii.</ref> It is not known how many copies were produced: Hogg indicated there were more than 100 subscribers by the second number;<ref>''The Collected Letters of James Hogg: Volume 1 1800‒1819'', ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2004), 105: Hogg to Walter Scott, 8 September [1810].</ref> 73 of them withdrew after the fourth number in which the narrator is seduced by his housekeeper,<ref>'Memoir of the Author's Life', in James Hogg, ''Altrive Tales'', ed. Gillian Hughes (Edinburgh, 2003), 25.</ref> but enough support survived to make it possible to complete 52 issues. As soon as ''The Spy'' had finished the year-long run it was made available in volume form, published in Edinburgh by [[Archibald Constable]] & Co. with the title ''The Spy. A Periodical Paper of Literary Amusement and Instruction. Published Weekly, in 1810 and 1811''.

Several of Hogg's own contributions to ''The Spy'' were included, with smaller or greater revisions, in some of his later publications: most notably, for prose items, ''Winter Evening Tales'' (1820) and, for poems, ''Poetical Works'' (1822). Two of the longer poems, 'King Edward's Dream' (No. 20) and 'Macgregor, a Highland Tale' (No. 40) were republished as part of ''The Queen's Wake'' (1813).

A critical edition of ''The Spy'', by Gillian Hughes, appeared as a volume in the Stirling/South Carolina Research Edition of The Collected Works of James Hogg, published by Edinburgh University Press in 2000.

No. 33 (by James Gray): The writer argues that much Classical education is wasted on boys, and that it is valuable only when pursued with application and a sense of its usefulness, in achieving which mothers can play a crucial cole. The number ends with a poem by James Aikman, 'Maelstrom'.

No. 34 (by Mary Gray): 'C. D.' tells of his visits to contrasting Edinburgh ladies, one of them an admirably balanced bluestocking.

An '''absorption refrigerator''' is a [[refrigerator]] that uses a heat source (e.g., [[Solar thermal energy|solar]] energy, a fossil-fueled flame, [[waste heat]] from factories, or [[district heating]] systems) to provide the energy needed to drive the cooling process. The system uses two coolants, the first of which performs [[evaporative cooling]] and is then absorbed into the second coolant; heat is needed to reset the two coolants to their initial states. The principle can also be used to [[air conditioning|air-condition]] buildings using the waste heat from a [[gas turbine]] or [[water heating|water heater]]. Using waste heat from a gas turbine makes the turbine very efficient because it first produces [[electricity]], then hot water, and finally, air-conditioning—[[trigeneration]]. Absorption refrigerators are commonly used in [[recreational vehicle]]s (RVs), [[Popup camper|campers]], and [[Caravan_(towed_trailer)|caravans]] because they can be powered with propane fuel, rather than electricity. Unlike more common [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] systems, an absorption refrigerator can be produced with no moving parts other than the coolants.

==History==
In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used, but after the development of the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor compression cycle]] it lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Absorption refrigerators are a popular alternative to regular compressor refrigerators where electricity is unreliable, costly, or unavailable, where noise from the compressor is problematic, or where surplus heat is available (e.g., from turbine exhausts or industrial processes, or from solar plants).

Absorption cooling was invented by the French scientist [[Ferdinand Carré]] in 1858.<ref>Eric Granryd & Björn Palm, Refrigerating engineering, Stockholm [[Royal Institute of Technology]], 2005, see chap. 4-3</ref> The original design used water and sulphuric acid. In 1922 [[Baltzar von Platen (1898-1984)|Baltzar von Platen]] and [[Carl Munters]], while they were still students at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], enhanced the principle with a three-fluid configuration. This \"Platen-Munters\" design can operate without a pump.

Commercial production began in 1923 by the newly formed company ''AB Arctic'', which was bought by [[Electrolux]] in 1925. In the 1960s, absorption refrigeration saw a renaissance due to the substantial demand for refrigerators for [[travel trailer|caravan]]s (travel trailers). AB Electrolux established a subsidiary in the United States, named Dometic Sales Corporation. The company marketed refrigerators for [[recreational vehicle]]s (RVs) under the ''[[Dometic]]'' brand. In 2001, Electrolux sold most of its leisure products line to the venture-capital company [[EQT Partners|EQT]] which created ''Dometic'' as a stand-alone company.

In 1926, [[Albert Einstein]] and his former student [[Leó Szilárd]] proposed an alternative design known as the [[Einstein refrigerator]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?q=1781541|title=US Patent 1781541}}</ref> At the 2007 [[TED Conference]], [[Adam Grosser]]  presented his research of a new, very small, \"intermittent absorption\" vaccine refrigeration unit for use in third world countries.  The refrigerator is a small unit placed over a campfire, that can later be used to cool 15 liters of water to just above freezing for 24 hours in a 30&nbsp;°C environment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grosser_and_his_sustainable_fridge.html|title=Adam Grosser and his sustainable fridge|author=Adam Grosser|date=Feb 2007|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|accessdate=2018-09-18}}</ref>

==Principles==
Common absorption refrigerators use a refrigerant with a very low [[boiling point]] (less than {{convert|-18|°C|°F}}) just like [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|compressor refrigerators]]. Compression refrigerators typically use an [[Chlorofluorocarbon|HCFC]] or [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|HFC]], while absorption refrigerators typically use [[ammonia]] or [[water]] and need at least a second fluid able to absorb the coolant, the ''absorbent'', respectively water (for ammonia) or brine (for water). Both types use [[evaporative cooling]]: when the refrigerant evaporates (boils), it takes some heat away with it, providing the cooling effect. The main difference between the two systems is the way the refrigerant is changed from a gas back into a liquid so that the cycle can repeat. An absorption refrigerator changes the gas back into a liquid using a method that needs only heat, and has no moving parts other than the fluids. 

[[File:Absorption refrigerator working.svg|300px|right|Absorption cooling process]]
The absorption cooling cycle can be described in three phases:
#'''Evaporation''': A liquid refrigerant evaporates in a low [[partial pressure]] environment, thus extracting heat from its surroundings (e.g. the refrigerator's compartment). Because of the low partial pressure, the temperature needed for evaporation is also low.
#'''Absorption''': The second fluid, in a depleted state, sucks out the now gaseous refrigerant, thus providing the low partial pressure. This produces a refrigerant-saturated liquid which then flows to the next step:
#'''Regeneration''': The refrigerant-saturated liquid is heated, causing the refrigerant to evaporate out. 
::a. The evaporation occurs at the lower end of a narrow tube; the bubbles of refrigerant gas push the refrigerant-depleted liquid into a higher chamber, from which it will flow by gravity to the absorption chamber. 
::b. The hot gaseous refrigerant passes through a heat exchanger, transferring its heat outside the system (such as to surrounding ambient-temperature air), and condenses at a higher place. The condensed (liquid) refrigerant will then flow by gravity to supply the evaporation phase.
The system thus silently provides for the mechanical circulation of the liquid without a usual pump.
A third fluid, gaseous, is usually added to avoid pressure concerns when condensation occurs (see below).

In comparison, a compressor refrigerator uses a compressor, usually powered by either an electric or internal combustion motor, to increase the pressure on the gaseous refrigerant. The resulting hot, high-pressure gas is condensed to a liquid form by cooling in a heat exchanger (\"condenser\") that is exposed to the external environment (usually air in the room). The condensed refrigerant, now at a temperature near to that of the external environment but at higher pressure, then passes through an orifice or a throttle valve into the evaporator section. The orifice or throttle valve creates a pressure drop between the high pressure condenser section and the low pressure evaporator section.  The lower pressure in the evaporator section allows the liquid refrigerant to evaporate, which absorbs heat from the refrigerator food compartment. The now-vaporized refrigerant then goes back into the compressor to repeat the cycle. 

===Simple salt and water system===
A simple absorption refrigeration system common in large commercial plants uses a solution of [[lithium bromide]] or [[lithium chloride]] salt and water.  Water under low pressure is evaporated from the coils that are to be chilled. The water is absorbed by a lithium bromide/water solution. The system drives the water off the lithium bromide solution with heat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sapali|first=S. N|title=Textbook Of Refrigeration And Air-Conditioning|publisher=PHI learning|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-81-203-3360-4|page=258|chapter=Lithium Bromide Absorption Refrigeration System}}</ref>{{clear right}}

===Water spray absorption refrigeration===
[[File:Absorptive refrigeration.svg|thumb|right|Water spray absorption system]]
Another variant, uses air, water, and a salt water solution. The intake of warm, moist air is passed through a sprayed solution of salt water. The spray lowers the humidity but does not significantly change the temperature. The less humid, warm air is then passed through an [[evaporative cooler]], consisting of a spray of fresh water, which cools and re-humidifies the air. Humidity is removed from the cooled air with another spray of salt solution, providing the outlet of cool, dry air.

The salt solution is regenerated by heating it under low pressure, causing water to evaporate. The water evaporated from the salt solution is re-condensed, and rerouted back to the evaporative cooler.

===Single pressure absorption refrigeration===
[[File:Absorption fridge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|'''Domestic absorption refrigerator.'''<br>
1. Hydrogen enters the pipe with liquid ammonia<br>
2. Ammonia and hydrogen enter the inner compartment. Volume increase causes a decrease in the partial pressure of the liquid ammonia. The ammonia evaporates, taking heat from the liquid ammonia (ΔH<sub>Vap</sub>) lowering its temperature. Heat flows from the hotter interior of the refrigerator to the colder liquid, promoting further evaporation.<br>
3. Ammonia and hydrogen return from the inner compartment, ammonia returns to absorber and dissolves in water. Hydrogen is free to rise.<br>
4. Ammonia gas condensation (passive cooling).<br>
5. Hot ammonia gas.<br>
6. Heat insulation and distillation of ammonia gas from water.<br>
7. Electric heat source.<br>
8. Absorber vessel (water and ammonia solution).]]

Colour indicates relative temperature: blue=cold, red is hottest. The heat source (7) is contained entirely within the insulation section (6).]]

A single-pressure absorption refrigerator takes advantage of the fact that a liquid's evaporation rate depends upon the ''partial'' pressure of the vapor above the liquid and goes up with lower partial pressure.  While having the same total pressure throughout the system, the refrigerator maintains a low partial pressure of the refrigerant (therefore high evaporation rate) in the part of the system that draws heat out of the low-temperature interior of the refrigerator, but maintains the refrigerant at high partial pressure (therefore low evaporation rate) in the part of the system that expels heat to the ambient-temperature air outside the refrigerator.

The refrigerator uses three substances: [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen]] gas, and [[water]]. The cycle is closed, with all hydrogen, water and ammonia collected and endlessly reused. The system is pressurized to the pressure where the boiling point of ammonia is higher than the temperature of the condenser coil (the coil which transfers heat to the air outside the refrigerator, by being hotter than the outside air.) This pressure is typically 14–16&nbsp;atm at which pressure the dew point of ammonia will be about 35&nbsp;°C (95&nbsp;°F).

The cooling cycle starts with liquid ammonia at room temperature entering the evaporator. The volume of the evaporator is greater than the volume of the liquid, with the excess space occupied by a mixture of gaseous ammonia and hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen lowers the [[partial pressure]] of the ammonia gas, thus lowering the [[evaporation point]] of the liquid below the temperature of the refrigerator's interior. Ammonia evaporates, taking a small amount of heat from the liquid and lowering the liquid's temperature. It continues to evaporate, while the large [[enthalpy of vaporization]] (heat) flows from the warmer refrigerator interior to the cooler liquid ammonia and then to more ammonia gas.

In the next two steps, the ammonia gas is separated from the hydrogen so it can be reused.

#The ammonia (gas) and hydrogen (gas) mixture flows through a pipe from the evaporator into the absorber. In the absorber, this mixture of gases contacts water (technically, a weak solution of ammonia in water). The gaseous ammonia dissolves in the water, while the hydrogen, which doesn't, collects at the top of the absorber, leaving the now-strong ammonia-and-water solution at the bottom. The hydrogen is now separate while the ammonia is now dissolved in the water.
#The next step separates the ammonia and water. The ammonia/water solution flows to the generator (boiler), where heat is applied to boil off the ammonia, leaving most of the water (which has a higher boiling point) behind. Some water vapor and bubbles remain mixed with the ammonia; this water is removed in the final separation step, by passing it through the separator, an uphill series of twisted pipes with minor obstacles to pop the bubbles, allowing the water vapor to condense and drain back to the generator.

The pure ammonia gas then enters the condenser. In this [[heat exchanger]], the hot ammonia gas transfers its heat to the outside air, which is below the boiling point of the full-pressure ammonia, and therefore condenses. The condensed (liquid) ammonia flows down to be mixed with the hydrogen gas released from the absorption step, repeating the cycle.

While having the same total pressure throughout the system, the refrigerator maintains a low partial pressure of the refrigerant (therefore high evaporation rate) in the part of the system that draws heat out of the low-temperature interior of the refrigerator, but maintains the refrigerant at high partial pressure (therefore low evaporation rate) in the part of the system that expels heat to the ambient-temperature air outside the refrigerator.

The refrigerator uses three substances: [[ammonia]], [[hydrogen]] gas, and [[water]]. The cycle is closed, with all hydrogen, water and ammonia collected and endlessly reused. The system is pressurized to the pressure where the boiling point of ammonia is higher than the temperature of the condenser coil (the coil which transfers heat to the air outside the refrigerator, by being hotter than the outside air.) This pressure is typically 14–16&nbsp;atm at which pressure the dew point of ammonia will be about 35&nbsp;°C (95&nbsp;°F).

The cooling cycle starts with liquid ammonia at room temperature entering the evaporator. The volume of the evaporator is greater than the volume of the liquid, with the excess space occupied by a mixture of gaseous ammonia and hydrogen. The presence of hydrogen lowers the [[partial pressure]] of the ammonia gas, thus lowering the [[evaporation point]] of the liquid below the temperature of the refrigerator's interior. Ammonia evaporates, taking a small amount of heat from the liquid and lowering the liquid's temperature. It continues to evaporate, while the large [[enthalpy of vaporization]] (heat) flows from the warmer refrigerator interior to the cooler liquid ammonia and then to more ammonia gas.

In the next two steps, the ammonia gas is separated from the hydrogen so it can be reused.

#The ammonia (gas) and hydrogen (gas) mixture flows through a pipe from the evaporator into the absorber. In the absorber, this mixture of gases contacts water (technically, a weak solution of ammonia in water). The gaseous ammonia dissolves in the water, while the hydrogen, which doesn't, collects at the top of the absorber, leaving the now-strong ammonia-and-water solution at the bottom. The hydrogen is now separate while the ammonia is now dissolved in the water.
#The next step separates the ammonia and water. The ammonia/water solution flows to the generator (boiler), where heat is applied to boil off the ammonia, leaving most of the water (which has a higher boiling point) behind. Some water vapor and bubbles remain mixed with the ammonia; this water is removed in the final separation step, by passing it through the separator, an uphill series of twisted pipes with minor obstacles to pop the bubbles, allowing the water vapor to condense and drain back to the generator.

The pure ammonia gas then enters the condenser. In this [[heat exchanger]], the hot ammonia gas transfers its heat to the outside air, which is below the boiling point of the full-pressure ammonia, and therefore condenses. The condensed (liquid) ammonia flows down to be mixed with the hydrogen gas released from the absorption step, repeating the cycle.

On March 19, 2020, Bieber released an acoustic version of the song, without Quavo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/justin-bieber-intentions-acoustic-969659/|title=Justin Bieber Drops Acoustic Version of 'Intentions'|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|last2=Shaffer|first2=Claire|date=2020-03-19|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>

==Commercial performance==
\"Intentions\" debuted at number 11 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] chart dated February 22, 2020, eventually peaking at number eight. It also debuted at number one on the [[Hot R&B Songs]] chart, marking Bieber's third number 1, following \"[[Yummy (Justin Bieber song)|Yummy]]\", which \"Intentions\" dethroned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8551188/roddy-ricch-the-box-number-one-sixth-week|title=Roddy Ricch's 'The Box' Rules Hot 100 For Sixth Week, Dua Lipa Matches Career Best With 'Don't Start Now'|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Trust|first=Gary|date=February 18, 2020|accessdate=February 18, 2020}}</ref>

==Music video==
The music video premiered on Bieber's [[YouTube]] channel the same day of the song. It shows both artists helping people without an education and meeting them. Bieber published a lyric video to his channel on February 10, 2020. He then posted a short version of the music video, only the parts with the song playing, on February 12, 2020. Part of the filming took place at [[California State University, Northridge]]'s [[Oviatt Library]].

[[Image:Schleifpapier verschiedene Sorten.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheets of sandpaper with different grit sizes (40 (coarse), 80, 150, 240, 600 (fine)).]]

'''Sandpaper''' and '''glasspaper'''<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Chambers 20th Century Dictionary]]|editor=E. M. Kirkpatrick|publisher=W & R Chambers Ltd|location=Edinburgh|year=1983|pages=532|isbn=0-550-10234-5}}</ref> are names used for a type of [[coated abrasive]] that consists of sheets of [[paper]] or [[cloth]] with [[abrasive]] material glued to one face.
Despite the use of the names neither sand nor glass are now used in the manufacture of these products as they have been replaced by other abrasives such as aluminium oxide or silicon carbide. Sandpaper is produced in a range of grit sizes and is used to remove material from surfaces, either to make them smoother (for example, in [[house painter and decorator|painting]] and [[wood finishing]]), to remove a layer of material (such as old [[paint]]), or sometimes to make the surface rougher (for example, as a preparation for [[adhesive|gluing]]). It is common to use the name of the abrasive when describing the paper, e.g. \"aluminium oxide paper\", or \"silicon carbide paper\".

The grit size of sandpaper is usually stated as a number that is inversely related to the particle size. A small number such as 20 or 40 indicates a coarse grit, while a large number such as 1500 indicates a fine grit.

== History ==
The first recorded instance of sandpaper was in 13th-century [[China]] when crushed shells, seeds, and [[sand]] were bonded to parchment using [[natural gum]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Casey |first1=Don |title=Know How: Sandpapers and Sanding |journal=Sail Magazine |date=May 3, 2016 |url=https://www.sailmagazine.com/diy/know-sandpapers-sanding |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref>  In the Bible, [[Solomon]] is mentioned to have used a mysterious abrasive called ''shamir'' allowing the king to build his temple without using iron tools.  ''Shamir'' was also held in Hebrew lore as being a magical worm capable of cracking glass when resting on it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Stories Behind Everyday Things|publisher=Reader's Digest|year=1982|isbn=0-89577-068-7|location=United States of America|pages=293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/abrasive|title=Abrasive {{!}} material|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

[[Shark]] skin ([[placoid scales]]) has also been used as an abrasive and the rough scales of the [[living fossil]], [[Coelacanth]] are used for the same purpose by the natives of [[Comoros]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ex2Nr3lLzM0C&pg=PA60|title=Living Fossil: The Story of the Coelacanth|first=Keith Stewart|last=Thomson|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company Limited|year=1992|isbn=978-0-393-30868-6|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627025033/http://books.google.com/books?id=Ex2Nr3lLzM0C&pg=PA60|archivedate=2014-06-27}}</ref> Boiled and dried, the [[Equisetum hyemale|rough horsetail]] plant is used in Japan as a traditional polishing material, finer than sandpaper. 

Glass paper was manufactured in [[London]] in 1833 by [[John Oakey]], whose company had developed new adhesive techniques and processes, enabling mass production. Glass [[frit]] has sharp-edged particles and cuts well whereas sand grains are smoothed down and do not work well as an abrasive. Cheap sandpaper was often passed off as glass paper; Stalker and Parker cautioned against it in ''A Treatise of Japaning and Varnishing'' published in 1688.<ref name=\"Stalker & Parker 1688\">{{cite book  |title=A Treatise of Japaning and Varnishing |author=Stalker & Parker|origyear=1688|publisher=Tiranti|year=1971}}</ref>  

In 1921, [[3M]] invented a sandpaper with [[silicon carbide]] grit and a waterproof adhesive and backing, known as ''Wet and dry''. This allowed use with water, which would serve as a lubricant to carry away particles that would otherwise clog the grit. Its first application was in automotive paint refinishing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxNlGsE7EVwC&pg=PA234|title=Minnesota in a Century of Change: The State And Its People Since 1900|first=Kirk|last=Jeffrey|editor-first=Clifford Edward|editor-last=Clark|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-87351-238-1|page=234|chapter=The Major Manufacturers: From Food and Forest Products to High Technology|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627122427/http://books.google.com/books?id=NxNlGsE7EVwC&pg=PA234|archivedate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

==Types==
[[Image:SCSandpaper.jpg|thumb|320 grit silicon carbide sandpaper, with close-up view.]]

There are many varieties of sandpaper, with variations in the paper or backing, the material used for the grit, grit size, and the bond.

===Backing===
In addition to paper, backing for sandpaper includes cloth ([[cotton]], [[polyester]], [[rayon]]), [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]], and \"fibre\", or rubber. Cloth backing is used for sandpaper discs and belts, while [[mylar]] is used as backing for extremely fine grits. Fibre or [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper. The weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter. For paper backings, the weight ratings range from \"A\" to \"F\", with A designating the lightest and F the heaviest. Letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings, with the weight of the backing rated J, X, Y, T, and M, from lightest to heaviest. A flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece; relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces. Sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper, such as used in sanding belts and discs. Stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood. The harder the backing material, the faster the sanding, the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface.

===Type of abrasive===
Types of abrasive materials include:
* [[glass]]: no longer commonly used
* [[flint]]: no longer commonly used
* [[garnet]]: commonly used in [[woodworking]]
* [[emery (mineral)|emery]]: commonly used to abrade or polish metals
* [[aluminium oxide]]: The most common in modern use, with the widest variety of grits, lowest unit cost; can be used on metal (i.e. body shops) or wood
* [[silicon carbide]]: available in very coarse grits all the way through to microgrits, common in wet applications
* alumina-zirconia: (an aluminium oxide–[[zirconium oxide]] alloy), used for machine grinding applications
* [[chromium(III) oxide]]: used in extremely fine micron grit ([[micrometre]] level) papers
* [[diamond]]: used for finishing and polishing hard metals, ceramics and glass
* [[ceramic aluminum oxide]]: used in high pressure applications, used in both coated abrasives, as well as in bonded abrasives.

Sandpaper may be \"[[stearate]]d\" where a dry lubricant is loaded to the abrasive. Stearated papers are useful in sanding coats of finish and paint as the stearate \"[[soap]]\" prevents clogging and increases the useful life of the sandpaper.

The harder the grit material, the easier the sanding of surfaces like wood. The grit material for polishing granite slab must be harder than [[granite]].

===Bonds===
Different adhesives are used to bond the abrasive to the paper. [[Animal glue#Hide glue|Hide glue]] is still used, but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof. '''Waterproof sandpapers''' or '''wet/dry sandpapers''' use a resin bond and a waterproof backing.

Sandpapers can also be '''open coat''', where the particles are separated from each other and the sandpaper is more flexible. This helps prevent clogging of the sandpaper. Wet and dry sandpaper is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding surface. Arguably there are also benefits due to lubrication and cooling.

===Shapes===

Sandpaper comes in a number of different shapes and sizes:

* sheet: usually {{convert|9|by|11|in|cm}}, but other sizes may be available
* belt: usually cloth backed, comes in different sizes to fit different [[belt sander]]s.
* disk: made to fit different models of disc and random orbit sanders. May be perforated for some models of sanders. Attachment includes pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and \"[[Hook and loop fastener|hook-and-loop]]\" (similar to Velcro).
* rolls: known as \"shag rolls\" by many contractors
* sponge: for tight places

==Grit sizes==
Grit size refers to the size of the particles of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. These measurements are determined by the amount of the abrasive material that can fit through a square inch filter<ref>{{cite web |title=Sandpaper Grit |url=https://www.empireabrasives.com/blog/sandpaper-grit/ |website=Empire Abrasives |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>. Several standards have been established for grit size. These standards establish not only the average grit size, but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (Coated Abrasive Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturer's Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) \"P\" grade. The FEPA system is the same as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 6344|6344]] standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the [[Japanese Industrial Standards Committee]] (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). The \"aught\" system ({0, 00, 000, ...} aka {1/0, 2/0, 3/0, ...}) was used in the past in the US. Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as \"Coarse\", \"Medium\" and \"Fine\", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.

===Grit size table===
The following table, compiled from the references at the bottom, compares the CAMI and \"P\" designations with the average grit size in micrometres (µm).

[[Image:Schleifpapier verschiedene Sorten.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Sheets of sandpaper with different grit sizes (40 (coarse), 80, 150, 240, 600 (fine)).]]

'''Sandpaper''' and '''glasspaper'''<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Chambers 20th Century Dictionary]]|editor=E. M. Kirkpatrick|publisher=W & R Chambers Ltd|location=Edinburgh|year=1983|pages=532|isbn=0-550-10234-5}}</ref> are names used for a type of [[coated abrasive]] that consists of sheets of [[paper]] or [[cloth]] with [[abrasive]] material glued to one face.
Despite the use of the names neither sand nor glass are now used in the manufacture of these products as they have been replaced by other abrasives such as aluminium oxide or silicon carbide. Sandpaper is produced in a range of grit sizes and is used to remove material from surfaces, either to make them smoother (for example, in [[house painter and decorator|painting]] and [[wood finishing]]), to remove a layer of material (such as old [[paint]]), or sometimes to make the surface rougher (for example, as a preparation for [[adhesive|gluing]]). It is common to use the name of the abrasive when describing the paper, e.g. \"aluminium oxide paper\", or \"silicon carbide paper\".

The grit size of sandpaper is usually stated as a number that is inversely related to the particle size. A small number such as 20 or 40 indicates a coarse grit, while a large number such as 1500 indicates a fine grit.

== History ==
The first recorded instance of sandpaper was in 13th-century [[China]] when crushed shells, seeds, and [[sand]] were bonded to parchment using [[natural gum]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Casey |first1=Don |title=Know How: Sandpapers and Sanding |journal=Sail Magazine |date=May 3, 2016 |url=https://www.sailmagazine.com/diy/know-sandpapers-sanding |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref>  In the Bible, [[Solomon]] is mentioned to have used a mysterious abrasive called ''shamir'' allowing the king to build his temple without using iron tools.  ''Shamir'' was also held in Hebrew lore as being a magical worm capable of cracking glass when resting on it.<ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Stories Behind Everyday Things|publisher=Reader's Digest|year=1982|isbn=0-89577-068-7|location=United States of America|pages=293}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/abrasive|title=Abrasive {{!}} material|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

[[Shark]] skin ([[placoid scales]]) has also been used as an abrasive and the rough scales of the [[living fossil]], [[Coelacanth]] are used for the same purpose by the natives of [[Comoros]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ex2Nr3lLzM0C&pg=PA60|title=Living Fossil: The Story of the Coelacanth|first=Keith Stewart|last=Thomson|publisher=W.

Glass paper was manufactured in [[London]] in 1833 by [[John Oakey]], whose company had developed new adhesive techniques and processes, enabling mass production. Glass [[frit]] has sharp-edged particles and cuts well whereas sand grains are smoothed down and do not work well as an abrasive. Cheap sandpaper was often passed off as glass paper; Stalker and Parker cautioned against it in ''A Treatise of Japaning and Varnishing'' published in 1688.<ref name=\"Stalker & Parker 1688\">{{cite book  |title=A Treatise of Japaning and Varnishing |author=Stalker & Parker|origyear=1688|publisher=Tiranti|year=1971}}</ref>  

In 1921, [[3M]] invented a sandpaper with [[silicon carbide]] grit and a waterproof adhesive and backing, known as ''Wet and dry''. This allowed use with water, which would serve as a lubricant to carry away particles that would otherwise clog the grit. Its first application was in automotive paint refinishing.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NxNlGsE7EVwC&pg=PA234|title=Minnesota in a Century of Change: The State And Its People Since 1900|first=Kirk|last=Jeffrey|editor-first=Clifford Edward|editor-last=Clark|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0-87351-238-1|page=234|chapter=The Major Manufacturers: From Food and Forest Products to High Technology|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627122427/http://books.google.com/books?id=NxNlGsE7EVwC&pg=PA234|archivedate=2014-06-27}}</ref>

==Types==
[[Image:SCSandpaper.jpg|thumb|320 grit silicon carbide sandpaper, with close-up view.]]

There are many varieties of sandpaper, with variations in the paper or backing, the material used for the grit, grit size, and the bond.

===Backing===
In addition to paper, backing for sandpaper includes cloth ([[cotton]], [[polyester]], [[rayon]]), [[PET film (biaxially oriented)|PET film]], and \"fibre\", or rubber. Cloth backing is used for sandpaper discs and belts, while [[mylar]] is used as backing for extremely fine grits. Fibre or [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper. The weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter. For paper backings, the weight ratings range from \"A\" to \"F\", with A designating the lightest and F the heaviest. Letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings, with the weight of the backing rated J, X, Y, T, and M, from lightest to heaviest. A flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece; relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces. Sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper, such as used in sanding belts and discs. Stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood. The harder the backing material, the faster the sanding, the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface.

===Type of abrasive===
Types of abrasive materials include:
* [[glass]]: no longer commonly used
* [[flint]]: no longer commonly used
* [[garnet]]: commonly used in [[woodworking]]
* [[emery (mineral)|emery]]: commonly used to abrade or polish metals
* [[aluminium oxide]]: The most common in modern use, with the widest variety of grits, lowest unit cost; can be used on metal (i.e. body shops) or wood
* [[silicon carbide]]: available in very coarse grits all the way through to microgrits, common in wet applications
* alumina-zirconia: (an aluminium oxide–[[zirconium oxide]] alloy), used for machine grinding applications
* [[chromium(III) oxide]]: used in extremely fine micron grit ([[micrometre]] level) papers
* [[diamond]]: used for finishing and polishing hard metals, ceramics and glass
* [[ceramic aluminum oxide]]: used in high pressure applications, used in both coated abrasives, as well as in bonded abrasives.

Sandpaper may be \"[[stearate]]d\" where a dry lubricant is loaded to the abrasive. Stearated papers are useful in sanding coats of finish and paint as the stearate \"[[soap]]\" prevents clogging and increases the useful life of the sandpaper.

The harder the grit material, the easier the sanding of surfaces like wood. The grit material for polishing granite slab must be harder than [[granite]].

===Bonds===
Different adhesives are used to bond the abrasive to the paper. [[Animal glue#Hide glue|Hide glue]] is still used, but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof. '''Waterproof sandpapers''' or '''wet/dry sandpapers''' use a resin bond and a waterproof backing.

Sandpapers can also be '''open coat''', where the particles are separated from each other and the sandpaper is more flexible. This helps prevent clogging of the sandpaper. Wet and dry sandpaper is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding surface. Arguably there are also benefits due to lubrication and cooling.

===Shapes===

Sandpaper comes in a number of different shapes and sizes:

* sheet: usually {{convert|9|by|11|in|cm}}, but other sizes may be available
* belt: usually cloth backed, comes in different sizes to fit different [[belt sander]]s.
* disk: made to fit different models of disc and random orbit sanders. May be perforated for some models of sanders. Attachment includes pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and \"[[Hook and loop fastener|hook-and-loop]]\" (similar to Velcro).
* rolls: known as \"shag rolls\" by many contractors
* sponge: for tight places

==Grit sizes==
Grit size refers to the size of the particles of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. Several standards have been established for grit size. These standards establish not only the average grit size, but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (Coated Abrasive Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturer's Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) \"P\" grade. The FEPA system is the same as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 6344|6344]] standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the [[Japanese Industrial Standards Committee]] (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). The \"aught\" system ({0, 00, 000, ...} aka {1/0, 2/0, 3/0, ...}) was used in the past in the US. Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as \"Coarse\", \"Medium\" and \"Fine\", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.

'''Saint Veronica''', also known as '''Berenike''', was a woman of [[Jerusalem]] in the first century of the [[Common Era]] according to extra-biblical Christian [[sacred tradition]].<ref name=Trinity /> A celebrated saint in many pious [[Christianity by country|Christian countries]], the 17th-century ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' published by the [[Bollandist]]s listed her feast under July 12,<ref name=\"Harper2001\"/> but the German [[Jesuit]] scholar Joseph Braun cited her commemoration in ''Festi Marianni'' on 13 January.

According to Church tradition, Veronica was moved with sympathy when she saw [[Jesus]] carrying his cross to Golgotha and gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her—the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it. This piece of cloth became known as the [[Veil of Veronica]].<ref name=\"N&Q\" /><ref name=\"AI\" /><ref name=\"Butler2000p=84\" />
The story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth [[Stations of the Cross|Station of the Cross]] in many [[Anglican]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Western Orthodox]] churches.<ref name=Trinity/><ref>Vatican Website [https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2005/via_crucis/en/station_06.html Sixth Station]</ref><ref name=\"Prothero2009p=284\" />

[[File:Veronica.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer]]'s 1513 ''Veronica'']]
There is no reference to the story of Veronica and her veil in the [[canonical gospels]]. The closest is the miracle of the unnamed woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus’s garment (Luke 8:43–48). The [[apocrypha]]l [[Gospel of Nicodemus]] gives her name as Berenikē or Beronike ({{lang-grc-koi|Βερενίκη}}). The name Veronica is a Latinisation of this [[ancient Macedonian language|ancient Macedonian]] name. The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor [[Tiberius]]. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion only occurs around 1380, in the internationally popular book ''Meditations on the life of Christ''.<ref name=\"Wilson1991p=175\" />

At some point a relic became associated with the story. [[Pedro Tafur]], a Spanish knight visiting Rome in 1436, describes the following in the Church of St. Peter in his 1454 travel account:<ref name=\"Letts1926\" />
{{quote|
On the right hand is a pillar as high as a small tower, and in it is the holy Veronica. When it is to be exhibited an opening is made in the roof of the church and a wooden chest or cradle is let down, in which are two clerics, and when they have descended, the chest or cradle is drawn up, and they, with the greatest reverence, take out the Veronica and show it to the people, who make concourse there upon the appointed day. It happens often that the worshipers are in danger of their lives, so many are they and so great is the press.
|source=}}

However, he does not say specifically that he witnessed for himself this exhibition of the relic. 

Some academic sources suggest a different origin for the legend of St. Veronica: that the cloth bearing an image of Jesus' face was known in Latin as the ''vera icon'' (\"true image\"), and that this name for the relic was misinterpreted as the name of a saint. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913 writes:<ref name=\"Dégert1913\" />
{{quote|
The belief in the existence of authentic images of Christ is connected with the old legend of King [[Abgar V|Abgar of Edessa]] and the apocryphal writing known as the ''\"[[Pontius Pilate#Minor Pilate literature|Mors Pilati]]\"'' (''\"the Death of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]\"''). To distinguish at Rome the oldest and best known of these images it was called the ''vera icon'' (true image), which in the common tongue soon became ''\"Veronica.\"''
It is thus designated in several [[medieval]] texts mentioned by the [[Bollandist]]s (e.g. an old Missal of Augsburg has a Mass ''\"De S. Veronica seu Vultus Domini\"'' – ''\"Saint Veronica, or the Face of the Lord\"''), and [[Matthew of Westminster]] speaks of the imprint of the image of the Savior which is called Veronica: ''\"Effigies Domenici vultus quae Veronica nuncupatur\"'' – ''\"effigy of the face of the Lord which is called a Veronica\"''. By degrees, popular imagination mistook this word for the name of a person and attached thereto several legends which vary according to the country. [''translations in italics added'']
|source=}}

The reference to Abgar is related to a similar legend in the Eastern Church, the [[Image of Edessa]] or Mandylion.

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' says this about the legend:
{{quote|
Eusebius in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' (vii 18) tells how at [[Caesarea Philippi]] lived the [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|woman whom Christ healed of an issue of blood]] ([[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 9|Matthew 9]]:20–22). Legend was not long in providing the woman of the Gospel with a name. In the West she was identified with [[Martha|Martha of Bethany]]; in the East she was called Berenike, or Beronike, the name appearing in as early a work as the ''\"[[Acta Pilati]]\",'' the most ancient form of which goes back to the fourth century. The fanciful derivation of the name Veronica from the words Vera Icon (eikon) \"true image\" dates back to the ''\"Otia Imperialia\"'' (iii 25) of [[Gervase of Tilbury]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1211), who says: ''\"Est ergo Veronica pictura Domini vera\"'' (translated: \"The Veronica is, therefore, a true picture of the Lord.\")

Veronica was mentioned in the reported [[visions of Jesus and Mary|visions of Jesus]] by [[Marie of St Peter]], a [[Carmelites|Carmelite nun]] who lived in [[Tours]], France and started the [[Catholic devotions|devotion]] to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]]. In 1844, Sister Marie reported that in a vision, she saw Veronica wiping away the spit and mud from the face of Jesus with her veil on the way to Calvary. She said that sacrilegious and blasphemous acts today are adding to the spit and mud that Veronica wiped away that day. According to Marie of St Peter, in her visions, Jesus told her that he desired devotion to His Holy Face in [[reparation (legal)|reparation]] for [[sacrilege]] and [[blasphemy]]. [[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]] are thus compared to Veronica wiping the face of Jesus.<ref name=\"Cruz2003p=\" /><ref name=\"ScallanScallan1994p=\" />

The Devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]] was eventually approved by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1885. Veronica is commemorated on 12 July.

== Official Patronage ==
Saint Veronica is the patron of the French [[Mulquinerie|mulquiniers]] whose representations they celebrated biannually ([[summer]] and [[winter]]) as in many pious [[Christianity by country|Christian countries]]. She is also the patron saint of photographers.

== In popular culture ==
[[File:Veronicazejtun.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of ''Veronica,'' used during the [[Good Friday]] [[procession]] in [[Zejtun]], [[Malta]].]]
In Volume 5 of her work, ''[[The Poem of the Man-God]]'', Italian writer and alleged mystic [[Maria Valtorta]] depicts Veronica as Nike, who offered the linen cloth to Christ. It is also stated earlier in the same volume that \"The one we call Veronica and whom Jesus called Nike...\" suggesting that Nike has been mistakenly referred to as Veronica throughout history.<ref name=\"Valtorta1956pp=305-316\" />

[[Selma Lagerlöf]] in Christ Legends<ref name=\"Lagerlöf1908p=119\" /> expands the legend by making Veronica a former servant of the Roman emperor [[Tiberius]], named Faustina, who travels to Jerusalem in search of the Prophet of Nazareth, after learning that he once cured a young woman of leprosy. She travels on behalf of Tiberius, now himself stricken,  hoping to bring him a cure and redemption from his evil ways.  Faustina arrives on the day of the Crucifixion, and the rest is legend.

Mel Gibson's film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (2004) included an episode of Veronica wiping Jesus's face, although she is not referred to by name in the film (she is credited in the film as Seraphia). [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]], one of the inspirational sources to the cited movie, depicts a long description of the Veronica episode and she identifies the true name of Veronica also as Seraphia.<ref name=\"Emmerich1862p=239\" />

The most common pass with the cape in [[bullfighting]] is called a ''verónica'', as the ''[[torero]]'' holds the cape in the same way as Veronica is usually depicted holding the cloth.

The song \"Climb\" by [[Tori Amos]] on her 2017 album ''[[Native Invader]]'' contains repeated references to Veronica.

'''Saint Veronica''', also known as '''Berenike''', was a woman of [[Jerusalem]] in the first century of the [[Common Era]] according to extra-biblical Christian [[sacred tradition]].<ref name=Trinity /> A celebrated saint in many pious [[Christianity by country|Christian countries]], the 17th-century ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' published by the [[Bollandist]]s listed her feast under July 12,<ref name=\"Harper2001\"/> but the German [[Jesuit]] scholar Joseph Braun cited her commemoration in ''Festi Marianni'' on 13 January.

According to Church tradition, Veronica was moved with sympathy when she saw [[Jesus]] carrying his cross to Golgotha and gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offering, held it to his face, and then handed it back to her—the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it. This piece of cloth became known as the [[Veil of Veronica]].<ref name=\"N&Q\" /><ref name=\"AI\" /><ref name=\"Butler2000p=84\" />
The story of Veronica is celebrated in the sixth [[Stations of the Cross|Station of the Cross]] in many [[Anglican]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], [[Methodist]] and [[Western Orthodox]] churches.<ref name=Trinity/><ref>Vatican Website [https://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/2005/via_crucis/en/station_06.html Sixth Station]</ref><ref name=\"Prothero2009p=284\" />

[[File:Veronica.jpg|thumb|[[Albrecht Dürer]]'s 1513 ''Veronica'']]
There is no reference to the story of Veronica and her veil in the [[canonical gospels]]. The closest is the miracle of the unnamed woman who was healed by touching the hem of Jesus’s garment (Luke 8:43–48). The [[apocrypha]]l [[Gospel of Nicodemus]] gives her name as Berenikē or Beronike ({{lang-grc-koi|Βερενίκη}}). The name Veronica is a Latinisation of this [[ancient Macedonian language|ancient Macedonian]] name. The story was later elaborated in the 11th century by adding that Christ gave her a portrait of himself on a cloth, with which she later cured the Emperor [[Tiberius]]. The linking of this with the bearing of the cross in the Passion only occurs around 1380, in the internationally popular book ''Meditations on the life of Christ''.<ref name=\"Wilson1991p=175\" />

At some point a relic became associated with the story. [[Pedro Tafur]], a Spanish knight visiting Rome in 1436, describes the following in the Church of St. Peter in his 1454 travel account:<ref name=\"Letts1926\" />
{{quote|
On the right hand is a pillar as high as a small tower, and in it is the holy Veronica. When it is to be exhibited an opening is made in the roof of the church and a wooden chest or cradle is let down, in which are two clerics, and when they have descended, the chest or cradle is drawn up, and they, with the greatest reverence, take out the Veronica and show it to the people, who make concourse there upon the appointed day. It happens often that the worshipers are in danger of their lives, so many are they and so great is the press.
|source=}}

However, he does not say specifically that he witnessed for himself this exhibition of the relic. 

Some academic sources suggest a different origin for the legend of St. Veronica: that the cloth bearing an image of Jesus' face was known in Latin as the ''vera icon'' (\"true image\"), and that this name for the relic was misinterpreted as the name of a saint. The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' of 1913 writes:<ref name=\"Dégert1913\" />
{{quote|
The belief in the existence of authentic images of Christ is connected with the old legend of King [[Abgar V|Abgar of Edessa]] and the apocryphal writing known as the ''\"[[Pontius Pilate#Minor Pilate literature|Mors Pilati]]\"'' (''\"the Death of [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]]\"''). To distinguish at Rome the oldest and best known of these images it was called the ''vera icon'' (true image), which in the common tongue soon became ''\"Veronica.\"''
It is thus designated in several [[medieval]] texts mentioned by the [[Bollandist]]s (e.g. an old Missal of Augsburg has a Mass ''\"De S. Veronica seu Vultus Domini\"'' - ''\"Saint Veronica, or the Face of the Lord\"''), and [[Matthew of Westminster]] speaks of the imprint of the image of the Savior which is called Veronica: ''\"Effigies Domenici vultus quae Veronica nuncupatur\"'' - ''\"effigy of the face of the Lord which is called a Veronica\"''. By degrees, popular imagination mistook this word for the name of a person and attached thereto several legends which vary according to the country. [''translations in italics added'']
|source=}}

The reference to Abgar is related to a similar legend in the Eastern Church, the [[Image of Edessa]] or Mandylion.

The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' says this about the legend:
{{quote|
Eusebius in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' (vii 18) tells how at [[Caesarea Philippi]] lived the [[Jesus healing the bleeding woman|woman whom Christ healed of an issue of blood]] ([[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 9|Matthew 9]]:20-22). Legend was not long in providing the woman of the Gospel with a name. In the West she was identified with [[Martha|Martha of Bethany]]; in the East she was called Berenike, or Beronike, the name appearing in as early a work as the ''\"[[Acta Pilati]]\",'' the most ancient form of which goes back to the fourth century. The fanciful derivation of the name Veronica from the words Vera Icon (eikon) \"true image\" dates back to the ''\"Otia Imperialia\"'' (iii 25) of [[Gervase of Tilbury]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1211), who says: ''\"Est ergo Veronica pictura Domini vera\"'' (translated: \"The Veronica is, therefore, a true picture of the Lord.\")

'''''Crime Pays''''' is the sixth [[studio album]] by [[Harlem]] rapper [[Cam'ron]]. The album was released on May 12, 2009, by [[Diplomat Records]], [[Asylum Records]], and [[Warner Bros. Records]].

==Background==
''My Job'', the rapper's first video in two years released to the internet in January 2009, shows a more mature approach to life in an economically struggling America. Though ''My Job'' was not intended to be a single, the response to the song was so positive that it was released as a single on March 10, 2009. 

[[XXL Magazine]] shortly after announced cover of their April issue, due out February 24, which will go more into detail about his status, the 2007 feud with [[50 Cent]] and the status of the once dominating crew [[The Diplomats]]. In this interview, Cam'ron stated that the original Diplomats [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], [[Juelz Santana]], and [[Freeky Zeeky]] were no longer together.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Miss Info]] also released an exclusive \"Where's Cam'ron?\" segment on her website, where the rapper continues to explain many unanswered questions and the future of the MC. Despite the fact that none of the singles charted, the album proved to be successful, charting at #3 on the Billboard 200 selling an estimated 45,000 copies its first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv |title=MissInfo.tv |publisher=MissInfo.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref>

''Crime Pays'' received positive reviews but [[Music journalism|music critic]]s found criticism in its length, production and lyrical content. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 68, based on 13 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>

[[AllMusic]] editor David Jeffries praised Cam for re-tooling his production and lyrical content to bring back the grit and humor he lost in ''[[Killa Season]]'', concluding with, \"Add it all up and ''Crime Pays'' is just what the fans want, without any sense the man is pandering.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Chris Ryan of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' also praised Cam for delivering material that was reminiscent of his better efforts, concluding that \"He may have kept his lyrical gift hidden, but he didn’t lose it.\"<ref name=\"Spin\"/> Andrew Rennie of ''[[Now (newspaper)|NOW]]'' praised the album for containing less featured artists to focus on tight wordplay and sprinklings of topical tracks like \"My Job\" and \"Silky\", concluding that, \"Cam'ron has evolved on this no-frills release, and it is disarmingly effective.\"<ref name=\"Now\"/>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Simon Vozick-Levinson and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Jody Rosen]] both similarly praised the album for showcasing Cam's knack for lacing typical street tracks with a unique flow and strong wordplay. They concluded by praising the track \"My Job\" for bringing Cam out of his comfort zone to deliver a serious subject matter.<ref name=\"EW\"/><ref name=\"RS\"/> Nathan Slavik of DJBooth found the album a bit lengthy with unnecessary skits and dull tracks but found Cam's lyrical content and choice in party tracks still on-point, saying that \"while ''Crime Pays'' is far from a perfect album, it is more than enough to serve as a notice to hip-hop: Cam’ron’s back, and he is not to be slept on.\"<ref name=\"DJB\"/>

Jesse Cataldo of [[Slant Magazine]] was also critical of the needless skits and anonymous brag tracks that border on misogyny but found the production on the same footing with Cam's idiosyncratic wordplay, saying that \"forgetting the excess filler, he’s [also] put out a pretty solid album.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Ian Cohen from ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' was mixed about the album, finding Cam's usually humorous lyrics and confident flow wasted with production that's more appropriate for a mixtape. He also pointed out that Cam's material was similar to [[Kool Keith]] based on the skits, concluding that \"In their minds, Cam's done nothing worth really mentioning since 2005, and ''Crime Pays'' often makes you wonder if they've got a point.\"<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> Jordan Sargent of ''[[PopMatters]]'' criticized the album for lacking the retro-soul beats of ''[[Purple Haze (album)|Purple Haze]]'' that had energy and instead contains lackluster synth production with lyrics that border on self-parody, saying that, \"On ''Crime Pays'' he swings too far in the opposite direction, coming back with an album that is unadventurous and uninteresting.\"<ref name=\"PM\"/>

'''''Crime Pays''''' is the sixth [[studio album]] by [[Harlem]] rapper [[Cam'ron]]. The album was released on May 12, 2009, by [[Diplomat Records]], [[Asylum Records]], and [[Warner Bros. Records]].

==Background==
''My Job'', the rapper's first video in two years released to the internet in January 2009, shows a more mature approach to life in an economically struggling America. Though ''My Job'' was not intended to be a single, the response to the song was so positive that it was released as a single on March 10, 2009. 

[[XXL Magazine]] shortly after announced cover of their April issue, due out February 24, which will go more into detail about his status, the 2007 feud with [[50 Cent]] and the status of the once dominating crew [[The Diplomats]]. In this interview, Cam'ron stated that the original Diplomats [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], [[Juelz Santana]], and [[Freeky Zeeky]] were no longer together.{{citation needed|date=August 2009}}

[[Miss Info]] also released an exclusive \"Where's Cam'ron?\" segment on her website, where the rapper continues to explain many unanswered questions and the future of the MC. Despite the fact that none of the singles charted, the album proved to be successful, charting at #3 on the Billboard 200 selling an estimated 45,000 copies its first week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv |title=MissInfo.tv |publisher=MissInfo.tv |date= |accessdate=2014-05-25}}</ref>

'''Joest Racing''' is a [[sports car racing]] team that was established in 1978 by former [[Porsche]] works racer [[Reinhold Joest]]. The headquarters are in [[Wald-Michelbach]], [[Germany]]. The team currently competes in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] as '''Mazda Team Joest''' under a works contract with [[Mazda]].

==Early years==
As a combined driver/team owner, Reinhold Joest first began to race a [[Porsche 908|Porsche 908/3]] in the [[European Sportscar Championship]], winning the driver's title. He then switched to [[Porsche 935]]s, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1980. The team won the [[Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft|DRM]] back to back with driver [[Bob Wollek]], in 1982 and 1983. During the 1982 season, whilst the [[Porsche 956]] was only available to the works team, Joest adapted a roof onto a [[Porsche 936]] to enter the [[Group C]] [[World Sportscar Championship|World Endurance Championship]]. They would race the car into the 1983 season until they took delivery of their 956 prior to Le Mans.

==Le Mans successes==
In [[1984 24 Hours of Le Mans|1984]], in absence of the works team, Joest Racing would score the first of their thirteen wins at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], with [[Klaus Ludwig]] and [[Henri Pescarolo]] driving their \"lucky #7\" car a Porsche 956, chassis number 117. In [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]], the works team returned, and despite having little factory support, they defended their title with Ludwig, [[Paolo Barilla]] and incognito German businessman \"[[Louis Krages|John Winter]]\" driving the #7 chassis number 117 again. This would make them the second team to score back to back wins with the same car, the other being [[John Wyer|JW Automotive]] whose [[Ford GT40|Ford GT40 Mk.I]] won in [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]] and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]].

In 1986, 1988, and 1989 Joest won the [[Supercup]] title for teams and Wollek winning the drivers cup in 1989. They also took the [[Interserie]] title for drivers with Winter in 1985 and [[Bernd Schneider (racecar driver)|Bernd Schneider]] in 1991, and the teams title in 1991.
[[Image:962 Joest 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joest Racing's [[Porsche 962]] which they used in the [[IMSA GT Championship]].]]
In 1989, [[FIA]] introduced the new 3.5 litre [[Formula One]] engine rule to Group C, which not many teams were happy about, because few, if any, such engines were available to privateer teams like Joest. The previous fuel economy based rules were gradually phased out in favour of short races with cars that were virtually two-seater Formula 1 cars; existing Group C cars such as Joest's Porsche 962s were given higher weights and lower fuel allocation to make them less competitive. The team would instead compete in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|GTP category]] beginning in 1990, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1991 with Wollek, Pescarolo, [[Frank Jelinski]], \"Winter\" and [[Hurley Haywood]]. With their [[Porsche 962]] now being outmoded by the [[Nissan]]s, [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]s and [[Toyota]]s, the team would not score any more victories. In 1993, the Nissan and [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing|TWR]] [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] team had withdrawn, and the [[All American Racers|AAR Eagle]] [[Toyota]] would continue to dominate the series final year. Joest managed to score the car's last IMSA victory at the [[Road America 500]], due to Toyota's absence.

==Joest and Opel==
In the 1990s, the team also had a successful career developing and racing an [[Opel Calibra]] in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM). They first won the ITR Gold Cup at the [[Donington Park]] round in 1994 with [[Manuel Reuter]] driving, when the leading [[Alfa Romeo]] of [[Alessandro Nannini]] was disqualified for running out of fuel. They would continue to have a successful career there by the time the series became a full-fledged international championship (ITC), winning the title for the final year in 1996 for [[Opel]].

==Return to Le Mans==
[[Image:Porsche LMP1 '98 - WSC-002 No. 8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|WSC-95 chassis #002 on display in its 1998 Porsche LMP1-98 guise.]]
In late 1995, [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] were commissioned by Porsche to produce a [[World Sportscar Championship|WSC]] car to compete in the 1996 Daytona 24-hour race. The resulting [[Porsche WSC-95]] was based on the TWR's 1991  [[Jaguar XJR-14]] chassis, with the roof removed and a flat-six Porsche engine fitted. The car was withdrawn because of a sudden rule change. For 1996 the concept was revived and Joest were chosen to run the WSC-95s at [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] as backup for Porsche's own team of works [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1s]]. Joest won the race with [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]], [[Manuel Reuter]], and [[Alexander Wurz]]. They returned in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]], this time without works support, but again with the same car wearing #7. The winning pilots were by [[Michele Alboreto]], [[Stefan Johansson]] and [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], the latter scoring the first of his nine wins. As with the #7 956 of the 1980s, Joest attempted for a third straight win, although without success, as neither car finished, while Porsche itself prevailed in the [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|1998 race]].

==Audi Sport Team Joest==
[[File:Audi Sport Team Joest Tent Sebring 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The Joest Racing team at work on their cars before dawn for the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]].]]
[[Image:Audi R8 LeMans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joest's successful Audi R8, winner three years in a row.]]
In 1998, after being associated with Porsche for many years, the team signed a works contract with [[Audi]] (its CEO being [[Ferdinand Piech]], a grandson of Porsche) to support them for the [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Joest helped them build and develop the [[Audi R8R]]. Audi, not being sure which concept was the better one, also supported an LM-GTP entry, the R8C, developed by [[Racing Technology Norfolk|RTN]]. While the British R8Cs never worked properly, the two Joest R8R were reliable, yet too slow to finish better than 3rd and 4th against one of the works [[BMW V12 LMR]] and a [[Toyota GT-One]].

Audi and Joest went back to develop the highly successful R8, winning its maiden race at the [[2000 12 Hours of Sebring]], and going on the win at [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]. Between 2000 and 2002, the R8 cars took a hat-trick of wins at Le Mans, Sebring, and [[Petit Le Mans]], as well as [[American Le Mans Series]] titles in each year.

Audi scaled their sports car racing operation down at the end of 2002, preferring to focus their attention on the [[Bentley Speed 8]] for a year, allowing it to win in 2003 (with support by Joest mechanics).  In 2004, Audi returned to [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] [[touring car racing]], now officially backing up the [[Abt Sportsline]] effort which had been called \"private\" since 2000. Joest and Abt fielded [[Audi A4]]s in the series.

In 2006, Joest began racing the new [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered [[Audi R10]] sports car. They began the 2006 season with a win at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and took also the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]], replicating that performance [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|a year later]] and again in 2008, both times against Peugeot's diesel [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]] coupe.

In 2009, Joest and Audi introduced the [[Audi R15]] sports car, the replacement for the R10. However, reliability issues allowed Peugeot to finish first and second at the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with their 908 HDi FAP which had been perfected over its three-year history.

In an answer to the 2009 issues, Audi reworked the R15 for 2010 (under the '''R15 TDI plus''' designation) with a higher reliability factor; unexpected Peugeot reliability issues of the 908 HDi FAP forced all four cars (including one by [[Oreca]]) to retire before the end of the race and resulted in a clean sweep of the podium in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with all three cars running farther than the former {{24hLM|1971}} race record, despite that the R15s were not using the V10 [[Turbo Direct Injection|TDI]] engines at full and were not running faster than the four 908s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e |title=Audi achieves record victory at Le Mans with new technology |work=joest-racing.de; [[Audi#Motorsports|Audi Sport]] |publisher=Joest Racing |date=2010-06-13 |accessdate=2010-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050259/http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>

In 2011, the [[Audi R18]] TDI won the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] despite the loss of 2 cars and a ferocious pace from the opposing Peugeots. The R18s failed to win any of the other races in the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] that year, however, handing the team and drive titles to Peugeot.

For the first part of 2012, with the collapse of the Peugeot racing program, Audi has run near-unopposed in the first races of the 2012 [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The R18 TDI won the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]] in its last race and its successor, the Audi R18 Ultra, won the [[2012 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps]] with the related R18 E-Tron Quattro finishing in 2nd place. In the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, Joest Racing Audis won the top 3 positions with two R18 E-Tron Quattros finishing 1st and 2nd and one Audi R18 Ultra taking 3rd.

After Le Mans, Audi won 2 further rounds of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], the [[2012 6 Hours of Silverstone]] and the [[2012 6 Hours of Bahrain]]. While handing the other three rounds to Toyota, Audi would win the LMP1 Manufacturer Championship 2012 and helped Andre Lotterer, Bernoit Treleuyer and Marcel Fässler to become Driver World Endurance Champions 2012.

In late 2016, [[Audi Sport]] announced that they would leave the FIA World Endurance Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/126838|title=Audi WEC Team confirms that they will not be returning to the World Endurance Championship for the 2017 Season.|last=|first=|date=11 November 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=11 November 2016}}</ref>

==GT3==
Audi Sport Team Joest entered a pair of [[Audi R8#Motorsport|Audi R8 LMS GT3's]] in the [[2011 Armor All Bathurst 12 Hour|2011 Bathurst 12 Hour]] held at the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Australia]] on 6 February. Both cars qualified on the front row with the team of Marc Basseng, Christopher Mies and [[Darryl O'Young]] leading home Australian team mates Mark Eddy, [[Craig Lowndes]] and [[Warren Luff]] in a 1-2 finish. With both cars on the same lap racing for the win, the margin was only 0.7141 between the two at the end of 12 hours of racing. The Joest Racing R8's finished one lap in front of the VIP Pet Foods Racing [[Porsche 997|Porsche 997 GT3 Cup R]] of [[Craig Baird]] and father and son pairing Tony and Klark Quinn.

It was Joest's 2nd win in Australia in two starts having previously won the ALMS [[Race of a Thousand Years]] on 31 December 2000 with [[Rinaldo Capello|Dindo Capello]] and [[Allan McNish]] winning in an [[Audi R8 (LMP)|Audi R8]] [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] on the old [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Grand Prix circuit]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. Capello easily put the R8 on pole position, while McNish was actually laid up with a bad back after he put it out when stepping out of his [[Kilt]] after a pre-event photo shoot. They also had to drive a repaired car after Capello put the crocodile liveried car into the tyre barriers in the race morning warm up session. Despite his troubles, McNish started the race and set the fastest lap. He also drove the 25 laps required and wrapped up the inaugural ALMS Drivers' title as a result.

==Mazda Team Joest==
On 18 July 2017 it was announced that Joest Racing would take over the operation of the [[Riley Mk. 30#Mazda RT24-P|Mazda RT24-P]] [[Daytona Prototype#Daytona Prototype International|Daytona Prototype International]] (DPi) entry in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] for the [[2018 WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|2018]] season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2017/07/18/joest-to-take-over-mazda-dpi-programme.html |title=Joest To Take Over Mazda DPi Programme |work=dailysportscar.com|publisher=dailysportscar |date=2017-07-18 |accessdate=2017-07-19|}}</ref> Mazda withdrew from the remainder of the 2017 season in order for Joest to spearhead testing and development of the then uncompetitive DPi.

The partnership was terminated at the end of March 2020 with Mazda moving to Multimatic Motorsports.

In [[1985 24 Hours of Le Mans|1985]], the works team returned, and despite having little factory support, they defended their title with Ludwig, [[Paolo Barilla]] and incognito German businessman \"[[Louis Krages|John Winter]]\" driving the #7 chassis number 117 again. This would make them the second team to score back to back wins with the same car, the other being [[John Wyer|JW Automotive]] whose [[Ford GT40|Ford GT40 Mk.I]] won in [[1968 24 Hours of Le Mans|1968]] and [[1969 24 Hours of Le Mans|1969]].

In 1986, 1988, and 1989 Joest won the [[Supercup]] title for teams and Wollek winning the drivers cup in 1989. They also took the [[Interserie]] title for drivers with Winter in 1985 and [[Bernd Schneider (racecar driver)|Bernd Schneider]] in 1991, and the teams title in 1991.
[[Image:962 Joest 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joest Racing's [[Porsche 962]] which they used in the [[IMSA GT Championship]].]]
In 1989, [[FIA]] introduced the new 3.5 litre [[Formula One]] engine rule to Group C, which not many teams were happy about, because few, if any, such engines were available to privateer teams like Joest. The previous fuel economy based rules were gradually phased out in favour of short races with cars that were virtually two-seater Formula 1 cars; existing Group C cars such as Joest's Porsche 962s were given higher weights and lower fuel allocation to make them less competitive. The team would instead compete in the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] [[IMSA GT Championship|GTP category]] beginning in 1990, winning the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] in 1991 with Wollek, Pescarolo, [[Frank Jelinski]], \"Winter\" and [[Hurley Haywood]]. With their [[Porsche 962]] now being outmoded by the [[Nissan]]s, [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]s and [[Toyota]]s, the team would not score any more victories. In 1993, the Nissan and [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing|TWR]] [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] team had withdrawn, and the [[All American Racers|AAR Eagle]] [[Toyota]] would continue to dominate the series final year. Joest managed to score the car's last IMSA victory at the [[Road America 500]], due to Toyota's absence.

==Joest and Opel==
In the 1990s, the team also had a successful career developing and racing an [[Opel Calibra]] in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] (DTM). They first won the ITR Gold Cup at the [[Donington Park]] round in 1994 with [[Manuel Reuter]] driving, when the leading [[Alfa Romeo]] of [[Alessandro Nannini]] was disqualified for running out of fuel. They would continue to have a successful career there by the time the series became a full-fledged international championship (ITC), winning the title for the final year in 1996 for [[Opel]].

==Return to Le Mans==
[[Image:Porsche LMP1 '98 - WSC-002 No. 8.jpg|thumb|right|250px|WSC-95 chassis #002 on display in its 1998 Porsche LMP1-98 guise.]]
In late 1995, [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] were commissioned by Porsche to produce a [[World Sportscar Championship|WSC]] car to compete in the 1996 Daytona 24-hour race. The resulting [[Porsche WSC-95]] was based on the TWR's 1991  [[Jaguar XJR-14]] chassis, with the roof removed and a flat-six Porsche engine fitted. The car was withdrawn because of a sudden rule change. For 1996 the concept was revived and Joest were chosen to run the WSC-95s at [[1996 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]] as backup for Porsche's own team of works [[Porsche 911 GT1|911 GT1s]]. Joest won the race with [[Davy Jones (racing driver)|Davy Jones]], [[Manuel Reuter]], and [[Alexander Wurz]]. They returned in [[1997 24 Hours of Le Mans|1997]], this time without works support, but again with the same car wearing #7. The winning pilots were by [[Michele Alboreto]], [[Stefan Johansson]] and [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]], the latter scoring the first of his nine wins. As with the #7 956 of the 1980s, Joest attempted for a third straight win, although without success, as neither car finished, while Porsche itself prevailed in the [[1998 24 Hours of Le Mans|1998 race]].

==Audi Sport Team Joest==
[[File:Audi Sport Team Joest Tent Sebring 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The Joest Racing team at work on their cars before dawn for the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]].]]
[[Image:Audi R8 LeMans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joest's successful Audi R8, winner three years in a row.]]
In 1998, after being associated with Porsche for many years, the team signed a works contract with [[Audi]] (its CEO being [[Ferdinand Piech]], a grandson of Porsche) to support them for the [[1999 24 Hours of Le Mans]]. Joest helped them build and develop the [[Audi R8R]]. Audi, not being sure which concept was the better one, also supported an LM-GTP entry, the R8C, developed by [[Racing Technology Norfolk|RTN]]. While the British R8Cs never worked properly, the two Joest R8R were reliable, yet too slow to finish better than 3rd and 4th against one of the works [[BMW V12 LMR]] and a [[Toyota GT-One]].

Audi and Joest went back to develop the highly successful R8, winning its maiden race at the [[2000 12 Hours of Sebring]], and going on the win at [[2000 24 Hours of Le Mans|Le Mans]]. Between 2000 and 2002, the R8 cars took a hat-trick of wins at Le Mans, Sebring, and [[Petit Le Mans]], as well as [[American Le Mans Series]] titles in each year.

Audi scaled their sports car racing operation down at the end of 2002, preferring to focus their attention on the [[Bentley Speed 8]] for a year, allowing it to win in 2003 (with support by Joest mechanics).  In 2004, Audi returned to [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] [[touring car racing]], now officially backing up the [[Abt Sportsline]] effort which had been called \"private\" since 2000. Joest and Abt fielded [[Audi A4]]s in the series.

In 2006, Joest began racing the new [[Diesel engine|diesel]]-powered [[Audi R10]] sports car. They began the 2006 season with a win at the [[12 Hours of Sebring]], and took also the [[2006 24 Hours of Le Mans]], replicating that performance [[2007 24 Hours of Le Mans|a year later]] and again in 2008, both times against Peugeot's diesel [[Peugeot 908 HDi FAP|908 HDi FAP]] coupe.

In 2009, Joest and Audi introduced the [[Audi R15]] sports car, the replacement for the R10. However, reliability issues allowed Peugeot to finish first and second at the [[2009 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with their 908 HDi FAP which had been perfected over its three-year history.

In an answer to the 2009 issues, Audi reworked the R15 for 2010 (under the '''R15 TDI plus''' designation) with a higher reliability factor; unexpected Peugeot reliability issues of the 908 HDi FAP forced all four cars (including one by [[Oreca]]) to retire before the end of the race and resulted in a clean sweep of the podium in the [[2010 24 Hours of Le Mans]], with all three cars running farther than the former {{24hLM|1971}} race record, despite that the R15s were not using the V10 [[Turbo Direct Injection|TDI]] engines at full and were not running faster than the four 908s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e |title=Audi achieves record victory at Le Mans with new technology |work=joest-racing.de; [[Audi#Motorsports|Audi Sport]] |publisher=Joest Racing |date=2010-06-13 |accessdate=2010-06-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719050259/http://www.joest-racing.de/web/news/news.php?id=541&sprache=e |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref>

In 2011, the [[Audi R18]] TDI won the [[2011 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]] despite the loss of 2 cars and a ferocious pace from the opposing Peugeots. The R18s failed to win any of the other races in the [[Intercontinental Le Mans Cup]] that year, however, handing the team and drive titles to Peugeot.

For the first part of 2012, with the collapse of the Peugeot racing program, Audi has run near-unopposed in the first races of the 2012 [[FIA World Endurance Championship]]. The R18 TDI won the [[2012 12 Hours of Sebring]] in its last race and its successor, the Audi R18 Ultra, won the [[2012 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps]] with the related R18 E-Tron Quattro finishing in 2nd place. In the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, Joest Racing Audis won the top 3 positions with two R18 E-Tron Quattros finishing 1st and 2nd and one Audi R18 Ultra taking 3rd.

After Le Mans, Audi won 2 further rounds of the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], the [[2012 6 Hours of Silverstone]] and the [[2012 6 Hours of Bahrain]]. While handing the other three rounds to Toyota, Audi would win the LMP1 Manufacturer Championship 2012 and helped Andre Lotterer, Bernoit Treleuyer and Marcel Fässler to become Driver World Endurance Champions 2012.

In late 2016, [[Audi Sport]] announced that they would leave the FIA World Endurance Championship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/126838|title=Audi WEC Team confirms that they will not be returning to the World Endurance Championship for the 2017 Season.|last=|first=|date=11 November 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=11 November 2016}}</ref>

==GT3==
Audi Sport Team Joest entered a pair of [[Audi R8#Motorsport|Audi R8 LMS GT3's]] in the [[2011 Armor All Bathurst 12 Hour|2011 Bathurst 12 Hour]] held at the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]], [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[Australia]] on 6 February. Both cars qualified on the front row with the team of Marc Basseng, Christopher Mies and [[Darryl O'Young]] leading home Australian team mates Mark Eddy, [[Craig Lowndes]] and [[Warren Luff]] in a 1-2 finish. With both cars on the same lap racing for the win the margin was only 0.7141 between the two at the end of 12 hours of racing. The Joest Racing R8's finished one lap in front of the VIP Pet Foods Racing [[Porsche 997|Porsche 997 GT3 Cup R]] of [[Craig Baird]] and father and son pairing Tony and Klark Quinn.

It was Joest's 2nd win in Australia in two starts having previously won the ALMS [[Race of a Thousand Years]] on 31 December 2000 with [[Rinaldo Capello|Dindo Capello]] and [[Allan McNish]] winning in an [[Audi R8 (LMP)|Audi R8]] [[Le Mans Prototype|LMP]] on the old [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Grand Prix circuit]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. Capello easily put the R8 on pole position, while McNish was actually laid up with a bad back after he put it out when stepping out of his [[Kilt]] after a pre-event photo shoot. They also had to drive a repaired car after Capello put the crocodile liveried car into the tyre barriers in the race morning warm up session. Despite his troubles, McNish started the race and set the fastest lap. He also drove the 25 laps required and wrapped up the inaugural ALMS Drivers' title as a result.

==Mazda Team Joest==
On 18 July 2017 it was announced that Joest Racing would take over the operation of the [[Riley Mk. 30#Mazda RT24-P|Mazda RT24-P]] [[Daytona Prototype#Daytona Prototype International|Daytona Prototype International]] (DPi) entry in the [[WeatherTech SportsCar Championship]] for the [[2018 WeatherTech SportsCar Championship|2018]] season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailysportscar.com/2017/07/18/joest-to-take-over-mazda-dpi-programme.html |title=Joest To Take Over Mazda DPi Programme |work=dailysportscar.com|publisher=dailysportscar |date=2017-07-18 |accessdate=2017-07-19|}}</ref> Mazda withdrew from the remainder of the 2017 season in order for Joest to spearhead testing and development of the then uncompetitive DPi.

The partnership was terminated at the end of March 2020 with Mazda moving to Multimatic Motorsports.

[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|A Greek hoplite, armed with spear and shield]]
'''Hoplology''' is a science that studies human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word ''hoplology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hoplos'' (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον ''hóplon'', a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece.  The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.<ref name=\"hacc1\" />  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F. Draeger]].<ref name=\"hacc1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplology.com/articles_detail.asp?id=9|title=Hoplology and Combative Culture: Part 1|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Wiley|first=Mark V.|publisher=The International Hoplology Society}}</ref>

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of \"arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial\" (Burton, 1884),<ref>Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=History+of+swords&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&q=History%20of%20swords&f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]</ref> and subsequently as \"the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity\" (Draeger, 1982).<ref name=\"hoplology.com\">International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007</ref>

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as \"the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours.\"<ref>Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&pg=PA184&dq=hoplology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&q=hoplology&f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]</ref>

More recently, hoplology is defined as the investigation and analysis of all forms of armed combat. It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.

==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==
Several pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.  A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution.  Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).

Hoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals “ A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.” London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And “A New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.” London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman’s  “The Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.” London: Archibald Constable & CO.

During the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (\"IHS\") was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or “ryu.”<ref>Masters Magazine Spring 2019 pg 35</ref>. 

During the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of  academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions.  One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings.  In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies. 

More recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons. Ethnographies such as Michael Ryan's [https://www.amazon.com/Venezuelan-Stick-Fighting-Civilizing-Process/dp/1498533205 Venezuelan Stick Fighting: The Civilizing Process in Martial Arts (2016)]. Philip Forde’s recently completed doctoral dissertation “Blocking both Hand and Foot: An Examination of Bajan Sticklicking” (2018) is another informative work. Avron Boretz’s [https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Ghosts-Gangsters-Violence-Masculinity/dp/0824834917 Gods, Ghosts, and Gangsters: Ritual Violence, Martial Arts and Masculinity on the Margins of Chinese Society] (2011) describes Kung Fu training with working-class men and petty criminals in rural Taiwan. Pentjak Silat on the island of Java was explored by Lee Wilson in [https://www.amazon.com/Indonesia-Verhandelingen-Koninklijk-Instituut-Volmenkunde/dp/9004287736 Martial Arts and the Body Politic in Indonesia] (2015).

In 2017 we saw an emergence of a New Hoplology, pioneered by The Immersion Projects. Immersion Projects continue to lead multiple expeditions, sponsor symposiums and launched a new journal<ref>The Immersion Review, www.TheImmersionMedia.com/review</ref> focused on the study of combat.

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accoutrements and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.<ref name=\"hoplology.com\"/>

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.<ref name=\"Meron Langsner\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&pg=PA112 |first=Meron |last=Langsner|title=Text & Presentation |date=2006 |publisher=McFarland |editor-first=Stratos E. |editor-last=Constantinidi |ISBN=0786455411 |chapter=Chapter 10. Theatre Hoplology: simulations and representations of violence on the stage |page=112}}</ref>  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print</ref>

==Current Trends - The New Hoplology==
In 2018 a group of academics and veteran martial artists came together to explore the roots of bodily movements with weapons to uncover any underlying principles that shape all combat. Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. 

The multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of \"arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial\" (Burton, 1884),<ref>Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=History+of+swords&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&q=History%20of%20swords&f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]</ref> and subsequently as \"the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity\" (Draeger, 1982).<ref name=\"hoplology.com\">International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007</ref>

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as \"the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours.\"<ref>Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&pg=PA184&dq=hoplology&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&q=hoplology&f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]</ref>

More recently, hoplology is defined as the investigation and analysis of all forms of armed combat. It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.

==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==
Several pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.  A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution.  Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).

Hoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals “ A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.” London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And “A New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.” London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman’s  “The Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.” London: Archibald Constable & CO.

During the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (\"IHS\") was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or “ryu.”<ref>Masters Magazine Spring 2019 pg 35</ref>. 

During the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of  academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions.  One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings.  In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies. 

More recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons. Ethnographies such as Michael Ryan's [https://www.amazon.com/Venezuelan-Stick-Fighting-Civilizing-Process/dp/1498533205 Venezuelan Stick Fighting: The Civilizing Process in Martial Arts (2016)]. Philip Forde’s recently completed doctoral dissertation “Blocking both Hand and Foot: An Examination of Bajan Sticklicking” (2018) is another informative work. Avron Boretz’s [https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Ghosts-Gangsters-Violence-Masculinity/dp/0824834917 Gods, Ghosts, and Gangsters: Ritual Violence, Martial Arts and Masculinity on the Margins of Chinese Society] (2011) describes Kung Fu training with working-class men and petty criminals in rural Taiwan. Pentjak Silat on the island of Java was explored by Lee Wilson in [https://www.amazon.com/Indonesia-Verhandelingen-Koninklijk-Instituut-Volmenkunde/dp/9004287736 Martial Arts and the Body Politic in Indonesia] (2015).

In 2017 we saw an emergence of a New Hoplology, pioneered by The Immersion Projects. Immersion Projects continue to lead multiple expeditions, sponsor symposiums and launched a new journal<ref>The Immersion Review, www.TheImmersionMedia.com/review</ref> focused on the study of combat.

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accoutrements and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.<ref name=\"hoplology.com\"/>

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.<ref name=\"Meron Langsner\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&pg=PA112 |first=Meron |last=Langsner|title=Text & Presentation |date=2006 |publisher=McFarland |editor-first=Stratos E. |editor-last=Constantinidi |ISBN=0786455411 |chapter=Chapter 10. Theatre Hoplology: simulations and representations of violence on the stage |page=112}}</ref>  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print</ref>

==Current Trends - The New Hoplology==
In 2018 a group of academics and veteran martial artists came together to explore the roots of bodily movements with weapons to uncover any underlying principles that shape all combat. Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. 

The multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date

# Bajan Sticklicking in the Caribbean 
# Trinidadian Kalinda and Toboggan Jab Jab in the Caribbean
# [[Jogo do pau|Jogo De Pau]] expedition in Fafe, Portugal
# [[Arnis|Eskrima]] in  Philippines 
# Maori Wrestling arts of Rongomomau 

The first of these interdisciplinary expeditions was a roaring success in terms of collecting over 80 hours of film in a seldom seen art of  [[Bajan stick-licking|Bajan Sticklicking]]. This was complemented by an equally in depth exploration of the arts of [[Calinda|Trinidadian Kalinda]] and the seldom taught Afro-Indian whip art of [https://www.traditionalmas.com/project/jab-jab-2/ Jab-Jab]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncctt.org/new/index.php/about-ncc/departments/regional/trad-carnival-characters/311-traditional-mas-characters-devils-and-jab-jab.html|title=Traditional Mas Characters - Devils and Jab Jab|website=www.ncctt.org|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>.

{{cns|date=May 2018|text=Joseph also came up with four basic rules of the share market that are still of the greatest relevance today:}}

<blockquote>
''The first rule in speculation is: Never advise anyone to buy or sell shares. Where guessing correctly is a form of witchcraft, counsel cannot be put on airs.''
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
''The second rule: Accept both your profits and regrets. It is best to seize what comes to hand when it comes, and not expect that your good fortune and the favorable circumstances will last.''
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
''The third rule: Profit in the share market is goblin treasure: at one moment, it is [[carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncle]]s, the next it is coal; one moment diamonds, and the next pebbles. Sometimes, they are the tears that Aurora leaves on the sweet morning's grass, at other times, they are just tears.''
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
''The fourth rule: He who wishes to become rich from this game must have both money and patience.''
</blockquote>

'''José''' or '''Joseph Penso de la Vega''', best known as '''Josseph de la Vega''' (ca. 1650 — Amsterdam, November 13, 1692), was a Spanish [[Sephardi Jews|Jewish]] merchant, financial expert and poet, residing in 17th century Amsterdam.

Joseph Penso was born about 1650 into a family of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]].<ref>https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/penso-de-la-vega-joseph</ref> He was the son of Isaac Penso Félix (-1683) and of Esther de la Vega (-1679) who was a relative of the Vegas that founded a Talmudic school in [[Livorno]]. His father was a [[Marrano]] from Espejo, a small town in [[Córdoba (Spanish province)|Córdoba province]] ([[Andalusia]], Spain), who had made a solemn vow in the dungeon of the [[Inquisition]] that within a year after regaining his liberty he would openly profess [[Judaism]].

Although not a descriptive account of the process of stock trading, Joseph presented the history of speculation in stocks and acquainted the reader with the sophisticated financial instruments used. The dialogue format allowed the reader to understand the respective perspectives of the various market participants and the intricacies of speculation and trading. There is evidence in Confusion de Confusiones of three major biases: [[herding]], [[overconfidence]], and regret [[aversion]]{{dn|date=April 2020}}.<ref>Teresa Corzo, Margarita Prat & Esther Vaquero (2014) Behavioral Finance in Joseph de la Vega's Confusion de Confusiones, Journal of Behavioral Finance, 15:4, 341-350, DOI: 10.1080/15427560.2014.968722</ref>  The book is written in Spanish; its original title is ''Confusión de Confusiones''.<ref>It is possible to read it in a full view mode here [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?view=1up;size=100;id=uc1.32106019504239;page=root;seq=1;orient=0] or buy here {{cite web |url=http://books.global-investor.com/books/247231/Josseph-De-la-Vega/Confusion-of-Confusions/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140329174819/http://books.global-investor.com/books/247231/Josseph-De-la-Vega/Confusion-of-Confusions/ |archivedate=2014-03-29 }}.</ref>

{{cns|date=May 2018|text=Joseph also came up with four basic rules of the share market that are still of the greatest relevance today:}}

<blockquote>
''The first rule in speculation is: Never advise anyone to buy or sell shares. Where guessing correctly is a form of witchcraft, counsel cannot be put on airs.''
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
''The second rule: Accept both your profits and regrets. It is best to seize what comes to hand when it comes, and not expect that your good fortune and the favorable circumstances will last.''
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
''The third rule: Profit in the share market is goblin treasure: at one moment, it is [[carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncle]]s, the next it is coal; one moment diamonds, and the next pebbles. Sometimes, they are the tears that Aurora leaves on the sweet morning's grass, at other times, they are just tears.''
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
''The fourth rule: He who wishes to become rich from this game must have both money and patience.''
</blockquote>

Confusion de Confusiones remained little known until the German economist [[Richard Ehrenberg]] published an influential essay in the 1892 Jahrbücher für Nationalökonomie und Statistik, “Die Amsterdame Aktienspekulation un 17. Jarhhundert.”<ref>[https://www.sothebys.com/en/articles/the-first-book-to-describe-a-stock-exchange The First Book to Describe a Stock Exchange By Sotheby's]</ref>

'''''Up Close & Personal''''' is a 1996 American [[romantic drama film]] directed by [[Jon Avnet]], and starring [[Robert Redford]] as a news director and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as his protegée, with [[Stockard Channing]], [[Joe Mantegna]], and [[Kate Nelligan]] in supporting roles.

The screenplay began as an adaptation of ''Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch'', a 1988 book by [[Alanna Nash]] that recounted the troubled life of American news anchor [[Jessica Savitch]]. The finished picture, however, was greatly altered by commercial decisions on the part of the producers, and bore little resemblance to Savitch's biography. Screenwriter [[John Gregory Dunne]], having spent eight years working on the script with his wife [[Joan Didion]], later wrote a book describing his difficult experience, titled ''[[Monster: Living Off the Big Screen]]''.

The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\", written by [[Diane Warren]] and performed by [[Celine Dion]].

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=August 2015}}
Sally \"Tally\" Atwater ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) is an ambitious, aspiring news reporter, who is hired by [[Miami]] local news director Warren Justice ([[Robert Redford]]) when she sends in a homemade audition tape. He carefully guides her career to new heights, all the while becoming increasingly attracted to her.

Tally soon rises through the ranks of network news to become successful, while Warren's once-stellar career sinks into mediocrity. Furthermore, Tally's ascension takes her away from Warren when she is forced to relocate to [[Philadelphia]]. Tally struggles at her new post, in no small part due to the hostility of veteran reporter Marcia McGrath ([[Stockard Channing]]), who jealously protects her position as the top reporter. Warren turns up to inspire Tally, and the two partners begin a new career together.

However, on a routine assignment in a Philadelphia prison, Tally and her cameraman are taken hostage in a prison riot and forced to endure hours of intense violence. Tally covers the groundbreaking story from within the walls of the collapsing prison as Warren looks on from outside, guiding her through her first national broadcast. This incredible act of bravery leads to Tally's eagerly anticipated advancement to a national network newscaster position and the continuation of the dynamic duo's rise to fame - but shortly after, disaster strikes when Warren is killed during an assignment.

==Adaptation==
In the spring of 1988, [[John Gregory Dunne]] and [[Joan Didion]] began writing the script for a film entitled ''Golden Girl'', based on [[Alanna Nash]]'s biography of the late [[NBC News]] anchor and reporter [[Jessica Savitch]] and financed by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. When the film was finally released in 1996, eight years later, it was known as ''Up Close & Personal'' and none of the more controversial details of Savitch's life remained, including her alleged drug abuse problems that may have caused her to deliver an incoherent live news update on national television in early October 1983.<ref name=haller>{{cite magazine |last=Haller |first=Scot|date=1983-11-07 |title=The Two Faces of a Newswoman |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086321,00.html |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |page=48 |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] | url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114072316/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086321,00.html |archive-date=2008-11-14 |access-date=2016-03-06 }}</ref> Other details omitted from the film included the suicide of Savitch's second husband a few months after their wedding, and her alleged bisexuality, suicide attempts, abortion, and [[domestic violence|physical abuse]] by her longtime partner [[Ron Kershaw]], a well-known news director who was the original model for the character of Warren Justice.<ref name=muddle>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/02/reviews/970302.02gelbert.html |first=Larry |last=Gelbart |title=A Beginning, a Muddle and an End |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=[[New York City]] |date=1997-03-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020203090325/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/02/reviews/970302.02gelbert.html |archive-date=2002-02-03 |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=meers>{{cite magazine |last=Meers |first=Erik Ashok |date=1996-04-16 |title=Jessica Savaged: How Hollywood Heterosexualized ''Up Close & Personal'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |location=[[Los Angeles, California]] |publisher=Liberation Publications Inc.  |pages=45–47 |access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> Savitch's death at age 36 in an automobile accident (unrelated to drugs or alcohol) was also left out of the screenplay.<ref name=haller />

According to Dunne, who chronicled his experiences dealing with studio executives in his book ''[[Monster: Living Off the Big Screen]]'', the majority of these changes were made in order to appeal to a broader mainstream market. Producer [[Scott Rudin]] was reported to have said, when asked by a weary Dunne what the film was supposed to be, \"it's about two movie stars.\"<ref name=muddle />

==Reception==
The film currently holds an approval rating of 31% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/up_close_and_personal/ |title=Up Close & Personal (1996) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=February 22, 2018}}</ref>

'''''Up Close & Personal''''' is a 1996 American [[romantic drama film]] directed by [[Jon Avnet]], and starring [[Robert Redford]] as a news director and [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] as his protegée, with [[Stockard Channing]], [[Joe Mantegna]], and [[Kate Nelligan]] in supporting roles.

The screenplay began as an adaptation of ''Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch'', a 1988 book by [[Alanna Nash]] that recounted the troubled life of American news anchor [[Jessica Savitch]]. The finished picture, however, was greatly altered by commercial decisions on the part of the producers, and bore little resemblance to Savitch's biography. Screenwriter [[John Gregory Dunne]], having spent eight years working on the script with his wife [[Joan Didion]], later wrote a book describing his difficult experience, titled ''[[Monster: Living Off the Big Screen]]''.

The film was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in the category of [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"[[Because You Loved Me]]\", written by [[Diane Warren]] and performed by [[Celine Dion]].

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=August 2015}}
Sally \"Tally\" Atwater ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]) is an ambitious, aspiring news reporter, who is hired by [[Miami]] local news director Warren Justice ([[Robert Redford]]) when she sends in a homemade audition tape. He carefully guides her career to new heights, all the while becoming increasingly attracted to her.

Tally soon rises through the ranks of network news to become successful, while Warren's once-stellar career sinks into mediocrity. Furthermore, Tally's ascension takes her away from Warren when she is forced to relocate to [[Philadelphia]]. Tally struggles at her new post, in no small part due to the hostility of veteran reporter Marcia McGrath ([[Stockard Channing]]), who jealously protects her position as the top reporter. Warren turns up to inspire Tally, and the two partners begin a new career together.

However, on a routine assignment in a Philadelphia prison, Tally and her cameraman are taken hostage in a prison riot and forced to endure hours of intense violence. Tally covers the groundbreaking story from within the walls of the collapsing prison as Warren looks on from outside, guiding her through her first national broadcast. This incredible act of bravery leads to Tally's eagerly anticipated advancement to a national network newscaster position and the continuation of the dynamic duo's rise to fame - but shortly after, disaster strikes when Warren is killed during an assignment.

==Adaptation==
In the spring of 1988, [[John Gregory Dunne]] and [[Joan Didion]] began writing the script for a film entitled ''Golden Girl'', based on [[Alanna Nash]]'s biography of the late [[NBC News]] anchor and reporter [[Jessica Savitch]] and financed by [[The Walt Disney Company]]. When the film was finally released in 1996, eight years later, it was known as ''Up Close & Personal'' and none of the more controversial details of Savitch's life remained, including her alleged drug abuse problems that may have caused her to deliver an incoherent live news update on national television in early October 1983.<ref name=haller>{{cite magazine |last=Haller |first=Scot|date=1983-11-07 |title=The Two Faces of a Newswoman |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086321,00.html |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |page=48 |publisher=[[Time Inc.]] | url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114072316/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086321,00.html |archive-date=2008-11-14 |access-date=2016-03-06 }}</ref> Other details omitted from the film included the suicide of Savitch's second husband a few months after their wedding, and her alleged bisexuality, suicide attempts, abortion, and [[domestic violence|physical abuse]] by her longtime partner [[Ron Kershaw]], a well-known news director who was the original model for the character of Warren Justice.<ref name=muddle>{{cite newspaper |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/02/reviews/970302.02gelbert.html |first=Larry |last=Gelbart |title=A Beginning, a Muddle and an End |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|location=[[New York City]] |date=1997-03-02 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020203090325/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/03/02/reviews/970302.02gelbert.html |archive-date=2002-02-03 |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=meers>{{cite magazine |last=Meers |first=Erik Ashok |date=1996-04-16 |title=Jessica Savaged: How Hollywood Heterosexualized ''Up Close & Personal'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0mMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45#v=onepage&q&f=false |magazine=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |location=[[Los Angeles, California]] |publisher=Liberation Publications Inc.  |pages=45–47 |access-date=2016-03-07}}</ref> Savitch's death at age 36 in an automobile accident (unrelated to drugs or alcohol) was also left out of the screenplay.<ref name=haller />

According to Dunne, who chronicled his experiences dealing with studio executives in his book ''[[Monster: Living Off the Big Screen]]'', the majority of these changes were made in order to appeal to a broader mainstream market. Producer [[Scott Rudin]] was reported to have said, when asked by a weary Dunne what the film was supposed to be, \"it's about two movie stars.\"<ref name=muddle />

==Reception==
The film currently holds an approval rating of 31% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/up_close_and_personal/ |title=Up Close & Personal (1996) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=February 22, 2018}}</ref>

'''André du Pon''' (30 August 1924, in [[Amsterdam]] – 24 May 2006, in [[Medemblik]]) was a [[sailor]] from the [[Netherlands]], who was three times chef d'équipe for the Dutch Olympic Sailing team. Du Pon led his teams during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], the [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] in [[Busan|Pusan]].

After sailing the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]] Du Pon was also one of the first [[Soling]] sailors of the Netherlands. He owned the Soling H 4.

==Controversy==
During the selection for the [[Dutch Olympic Sailing Team]] for the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] a controversy emerged between twelve sailors and the [[Koninklijk Nederlands Watersport Verbond|selection committee]] chaired by [[Andre de Pon|Du Pon]]. This discussion focussed on the role of [[Frieda Vollebergt]] who did the communication for the sailing team. As mother of [[Erik Vollebregt]], [[Sjoerd Vollebregt]] and [[Peter Vollebregt]] - All three candidates for the 1976 Olympic sailing event - she was accused of having a [[bias]] towards her children in the communication. In the end [[Fred Imhoff]] and [[Heike Blok]] lost the [[lawsuit]] and were removed from the 1976 selection.

==Political career==
Du Pon was in the period 1990 - 1998 and from 2002 - 2006 [[alderman]] for the liberal party [[VVD]] in [[Medemblik]]. During those periods he held several times the position of [[deputy mayor]].

'''André du Pon''' (30 August 1924, in [[Amsterdam]] – 24 May 2006, in [[Medemblik]]) was a [[sailor]] from the [[Netherlands]], who was three times chef d'équipe for the Dutch Olympic Sailing team. Du Pon led his teams during the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], the [[Sailing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and the [[Sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]] in [[Busan|Pusan]].

After sailing the [[Finn (dinghy)|Finn]] Du Pon was also one of the first [[Soling]] sailors of the Netherlands. He owned the Soling H 4.

==Controversy==
During the selection for the [[Dutch Olympic Sailing Team]] for the [[Sailing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Olympics]] a controversy emerged between twelve sailors and the [[Koninklijk Nederlands Watersport Verbond|selection committee]] chaired by [[Andre de Pon|Du Pon]]. This discussion focussed on the role of [[Frieda Vollebergt]] who did the communication for the sailing team. As mother of [[Erik Vollebregt]], [[Sjoerd Vollebregt]] and [[Peter Vollebregt]] - All three candidates for the 1976 Olympic sailing event - she was accused of having a [[bias]] towards her children in the communication. In the end [[Fred Imhoff]] and [[Heike Blok]] lost the [[lawsuit]] and were removed from the 1976 selection.

==Political career==
Du Pon was in the period 1990 - 1998 and from 2002 - 2006 [[alderman]] for the liberal party [[VVD]] in [[Medemblik]]. During those periods he held several times the position of [[deputy mayor]].

In 2001, [[Sony Pictures]] considered selling off its visual effects facility [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]].

On its first anniversary on May 9, 2003, Sony Pictures Animation announced a full slate of animated projects in development: ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'', an adaptation of a Celtic folk ballad ''[[Tam Lin]]'', ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film)|Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs]]'', ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'', and a feature-length film version of ''The ChubbChubbs!''.<ref>{{Cite press release | title = Sony Pictures Animation Announces Projects for Directors Jill Culton, Anthony Stacchi, Roger Allers, Brenda Chapman and the Brizzi Brothers Cox Named to Top Posts | date = May 9, 2003 | url = http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-pictures-animation-announces-projects-for-directors-jill-culton-anthony-stacchi-roger-allers-brenda-chapman-and-the-brizzi-brothers-55629432.html | accessdate = August 1, 2011}}</ref>

Its first feature film was ''[[Open Season (2006 film)|Open Season]]'', released in September 2006, which became Sony's second-highest-grossing home entertainment film in 2007 and spawned three [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]]s. Its second feature film, ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' was released in June 2007, was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], and won two Annie Awards.

On November 3, 2014, the studio collaborated with [[Frederator Studios]]' [[Cartoon Hangover]] on ''[[GO! Cartoons]]'', an incubator series consisting of 12 short films, with at least one short film being developed into a series. The short films were funded by SPA, with the additional goal of attracting new talent for the studio.<ref>{{cite news|last=Milligan|first=Mercedes|title=Sony Partners with Cartoon Hangover to Find New Talent|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/events/sony-partners-with-cartoon-hangover-to-find-new-talent/|accessdate=November 4, 2014 |publisher=Animation Magazine|date=November 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/sony-animation-cartoon-hangover-launch-1st-incubator-film-the-summoning/|title=Sony Animation & Cartoon Hangover Launch 1st Incubator Film 'The Summoning'|work=Animation Magazine|date=November 7, 2017|last1=Milligan|first1=Mercedes|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>

According to [[Kristine Belson]], president of SPA, the studio produces films on a 1:1 development-to-production ratio, meaning that the studio puts films into development as much as it places films in production, unlike other animation studios.<ref name=\"SPAVariety\" />

The studio has plans to produce adult animated content for digital platforms.<ref name=\"SPAVariety\" />

==Process==
In a similar fashion to the [[Warner Animation Group]] and [[Paramount Animation]], the studio outsources their films to other animation companies and visual effects studios, with the majority of their films being animated by [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] (its sister company). Some films, such as ''[[Arthur Christmas]], [[The Pirates! Band of Misfits]],'' ''[[The Angry Birds Movie 2]]'' and ''[[Wish Dragon]]'', were acquired by Sony Pictures Animation to be released under their banner while others, such as ''[[Goosebumps (film)|Goosebumps]]'' and ''[[Peter Rabbit (film)|Peter Rabbit]]'', were made with no involvement from the studio.

''[[The Smurfs (film)|The Smurfs]]'' (2011) was the studio's first CGI/live-action hybrid.

In an Adventure with Scientists!|The Pirates! Band of Misfits]]'' (2012), which was SPA's first stop-motion film. In September 2012, SPA released ''[[Hotel Transylvania]]'', which grossed over $350 million worldwide and launched a successful [[Hotel Transylvania (franchise)|franchise]] with two [[sequel]]s and a [[Hotel Transylvania: The Television Series|TV series]]. Two [[sequel]]s are released in 2013: ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'' and ''[[Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2]]''. SPA's latest releases are ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', an animated [[superhero film]] based on the [[Spider-Man]] comics and featuring the [[Miles Morales]] incarnation of the character, and ''[[The Angry Birds Movie 2]]'', a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]'' produced by [[Rovio Animation]].

The short films were funded by SPA, with the additional goal of attracting new talent for the studio.<ref>{{cite news|last=Milligan|first=Mercedes|title=Sony Partners with Cartoon Hangover to Find New Talent|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/events/sony-partners-with-cartoon-hangover-to-find-new-talent/|accessdate=November 4, 2014 |publisher=Animation Magazine|date=November 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/top-stories/sony-animation-cartoon-hangover-launch-1st-incubator-film-the-summoning/|title=Sony Animation & Cartoon Hangover Launch 1st Incubator Film 'The Summoning'|work=Animation Magazine|date=November 7, 2017|last1=Milligan|first1=Mercedes|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>

According to [[Kristine Belson]], president of SPA, the studio produces films on a 1:1 development-to-production ratio, meaning that the studio puts films into development as much as it places films in production, unlike other animation studios.<ref name=\"SPAVariety\" />

The studio has plans to produce adult animated content for digital platforms.<ref name=\"SPAVariety\" />

==Process==
In a similar fashion to the [[Warner Animation Group]] and [[Paramount Animation]], the studio outsources their films to other animation companies and visual effects studios, with the majority of their films being animated by [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] (its sister company). Some films, such as ''[[Arthur Christmas]], [[The Pirates! Band of Misfits]],'' ''[[The Angry Birds Movie 2]]'' and ''[[Wish Dragon]]'', were acquired by Sony Pictures Animation to be released under their banner while others, such as ''[[Goosebumps (film)|Goosebumps]]'' and ''[[Peter Rabbit (film)|Peter Rabbit]]'', were made with no involvement from the studio.

==History==
The South Swedish highlands have been populated since the [[Nordic Stone Age]] as evidenced by [[cist]] findings.<ref name=skogskunskap/> During the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (c. 1700–500 BC) there was a significant agricultural expansion across the highlands. Soils developed on [[till|glacial till]] were cleared with stones being pile-up in cairns.<ref name=skogskunskap/><ref name=Per2013>{{cite journal |last1=Lagerås |first1=Per |title=Agrara fluktuationer och befolknings-utveckling på sydsvenska höglandet tolkade utifrån röjningsrösen |journal=[[Fornvännen]] |date=2013 |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=263–277 |url=https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/sv/publications/agrara-fluktuationer-och-befolkningsutveckling-paa-sydsvenska-hoeglandet-tolkade-utifraan-roejningsroesen(5f9fdb6e-0aad-46fa-91e0-28f0f133e94f).html |language=Swedish}}</ref> Other periods of agricultural expansion are the [[Archaeology_of_Northern_Europe#Roman_Iron_Age|Roman Iron Age]] and the [[High Middle Ages]] (c. 13th century).<ref name=Per2013/>

Poor soil conditions have posed significant difficulties for agriculture in the highlands, meaning that over time small industries became relatively important in local economies.<ref name=skogskunskap/> Many abandoned fields are now covered with forest. Vestiges of abandoned fields can be recognised through the highlands by characteristic heaps of stones made when soils where cleared for cultivation.<ref name=skogskunskap>{{cite web |title=Kulturspår på sydsvenska höglandet |url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/kulturmiljohansyn/kulturspar-i-olika-landskap/kulturspar-pa-sydsvenska-hoglandet/ |website=Skogskunskap|access-date=May 10, 2019 |language=Swedish |date=November 6, 2016}}</ref>  

==Climate and weather events==
The climate of the western parts of the highlands is more humid than on the east. This is due to [[orographic precipitation]] caused by [[westerlies|southwestern]] wind forcing moist air over the highlands.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/> [[Sommen|Lake Sommen]] in the northeastern part of the highlands har relatively low humidity and low precipitations.<ref name=sodra2015>{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |chapter=4. östra Götalands sprickdals- och eklandskap |date=2015 |title=Skogliga naturvärdesregioner för södra Sverige|trans-title=Forest biodiversity regions in southern Sweden  |url=http://skogscertifiering.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Naturv%C3%A4rdesregioner_Rapport-S%C3%B6dra-Skogs%C3%A4garna.pdf |publisher=Södra |page=66 |docket= |access-date= |quote=|language=Swedish }}</ref> [[Ljungby]] in the southwestern parts of the highlands hold the monthly precipitation record for Småland with 347 mm in August 1945.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/> The South Swedish highlands host the record locations for coldest and hottest temperatures in [[Götaland|Southern Sweden]].<ref name=SMHIsmaland>{{cite web |title=Smålands klimat |url=https://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/smalands-klimat-1.4865 |website=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|SMHI]] |accessdate=May 10, 2019 |language=Swedish |date=January 16, 2018}}</ref> The cold record is -38.5 °C on January 16 1918 in [[Lommaryd]].<ref name=SMHIsmaland/> While the hot record is 38 °C on June 29, 1947 in [[Målilla]].<ref name=SMHIsmaland/>

The South Swedish highlands are less exposed to storms than the southern and [[Swedish West Coast|western]] coasts of Sweden, yet storms can still be very destructive.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/> The [[Cyclone Gudrun|2005 storm Gudrun]] was particularly strong causing much damage to forests in the southwestern part of the highlands.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/><ref name=SMHIGudrun>{{cite web |title=Skogsskador efter Gudrun |url=https://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/skogsskador-efter-gudrun-1.5292 |website=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|SMHI]] |accessdate=May 10, 2019 |language=Swedish |date=July 8, 2015}}</ref> [[Picea abies|Spruces]] were particularly hit by Gudrun, while other trees with a more steady root system fared better.<ref name=SMHIGudrun/> Damage was exacerbated by the intential planting of spruces and practice of [[clearcutting]] which left many trees exposed to the wind.<ref name=SMHIGudrun/> Gudrun also caused [[Power outage|blackouts]] and disabled telecommunications infrastructure through the highlands.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/><ref name=SMHIGudrun/>

==Geology==
[[file:Sydsvenska_höglandet.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Map centered on the South Swedish highlands.]]
Within a geological context the highlands are the expression of the South Swedish Dome.<ref name=LB2013/> The South Swedish Dome has been subsided and been uplifted multiple times by [[epeirogeny|epeirogenic movements]] during the [[Phanerozoic]]. The dome has had periods of subsidence and burial in sediments have alternated with periods of exhumation and the formation of [[peneplain]]s and hilly relief. The [[Sub-Cambrian peneplain]] of [[Neoproterozoic|Late Neoproterozoic]] age is the oldest of the surfaces. It covers the eastern and northern flanks of the dome and its crest region where it is up-broken.<ref name=Japsenetal2016/><ref name=NatenSSH>{{cite web |url=https://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/sydsvenska-h%C3%B6glandet |title=Sydsvenska höglandet |last=Lidmar-Bergström |first=Karna |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date= |website=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] |publisher=Cydonia Development |access-date=November 30, 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}</ref> The mesozoic-aged Sub-Mesozoic hilly relief covers the southern and western fringes of the dome, corresponding roughly with the counties of [[Halland]], [[Blekinge]] and northeastern [[Scania]].

The Late Cenozoic uplift of the dome is tentatively related to far-field compressional stresses that has uplifted the region as a giant [[anticline]]-like [[lithosphere]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. As such it is similar to uplifted [[passive margin]]s like the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] or the mountains of Western and Eastern [[Greenland]].<ref>{{cite journal|author-last=Japsen|author-first=Peter|author-last2=Chalmers|author-first2=James A.|author-last3=Green|author-first3=Paul F. |author-last4=Bonow|author-first4=Johan M.|date=2012|title=Elevated, passive continental margins: Not rift shoulders, but expressions of episodic, post-rift burial and exhumation |journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=90–91 |issue=|pages=73–86|bibcode=2012GPC....90...73J|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.05.004}}</ref>

===Last ice age and deglaciation===
During the last [[deglaciation]] of the [[Weichselian glaciation|Weichselian Ice Sheet]] the South Swedish highlands was a place of ice flow divergence.<ref name=Sveriges2011>{{cite book |last1=Lundqvist |first1=Jan |last2=Lundqvist |first2=Thomas |last3=Lindström |first3=Maurits |last4=Calner |first4=Mikael|last5=Sivhed |first5=Ulf |author-link1=Jan Lundqvist |author-link2=Thomas Lundqvist (geologist)|author-link3=Maurits Lindström|edition=3rd |date=2011 |title=Sveriges Geologi: Från urtid till nutid |chapter=Svekokarelska Provinsen |language=Swedish |location=Spain |publisher=[[Studentlitteratur]] |isbn=978-91-44-05847-4 |via= |subscription= |quote= |page=515}}</ref> Deglaciation of southern Sweden was relatively slow with ice margin retreat rates of less than 150 m/yr. The retreat was interrupted multiple times by small glacier advances. These advances led to the formation of a series of [[end moraine]] systems. During deglaciation in southern Sweden glacier ice was mostly warm-based with some lesser parts being [[permafrost|cold-based]].<ref name=Stroevenetal2016/>

At present various lakes in the South Swedish highlands contain [[plankton]]ic crustacean species that are [[Relict (biology)|relics]] from the time the Weichselian Ice Sheet [[deglaciation|left]] the area about 12,000 years ago.<ref name=Kinsten2010>{{cite report |author=Kinsten, Björn |author-link= |authors= |date=2010 |title=De glacialrelikta kräftdjurens utbredning i södra Sverige  (Götaland och Svealand) |issue=2010/7|url=https://www.lansstyrelsen.se/download/18.2887c5dd16488fe880d55ad0/1537435814356/rapport-2010-7.pdf |publisher=Länsstyrelsen Blekinge län |pages=1–19 |docket= |access-date=April 19, 2019 |quote=|language=Swedish }}</ref><ref name=Stroevenetal2016>{{cite journal| date=2016|title=Deglaciation of Fennoscandia|journal=[[Quaternary Science Reviews]] |volume=147|issue=|pages=91–121 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.09.016|bibcode=2016QSRv..147...91S |last1=Stroeven |first1=Arjen P |last2=Hättestrand |first2=Clas |last3=Kleman |first3=Johan |last4=Heyman |first4=Jakob |last5=Fabel |first5=Derek |last6=Fredin |first6=Ola |last7=Goodfellow |first7=Bradley W |last8=Harbor |first8=Jonathan M |last9=Jansen |first9=John D |last10=Olsen |first10=Lars |last11=Caffee |first11=Marc W |last12=Fink |first12=David |last13=Lundqvist |first13=Jan |last14=Rosqvist |first14=Gunhild C |last15=Strömberg |first15=Bo |last16=Jansson |first16=Krister N|author-link13=Jan Lundqvist |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Sommen|Lake Sommen]] stands out for having as much as three glacial relict crustcean species.

The South Swedish highlands have been populated since the [[Nordic Stone Age]] as evidenced by [[cist]] findings.<ref name=skogskunskap/> During the [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (c. 1700–500 BC) there was a significant agricultural expansion across the highlands. Soils developed on [[till|glacial till]] were cleared with stones being pile-up in cairns.<ref name=skogskunskap/><ref name=Per2013>{{cite journal |last1=Lagerås |first1=Per |title=Agrara fluktuationer och befolknings-utveckling på sydsvenska höglandet tolkade utifrån röjningsrösen |journal=[[Fornvännen]] |date=2013 |volume=108 |issue=4 |pages=263–277 |url=https://portal.research.lu.se/portal/sv/publications/agrara-fluktuationer-och-befolkningsutveckling-paa-sydsvenska-hoeglandet-tolkade-utifraan-roejningsroesen(5f9fdb6e-0aad-46fa-91e0-28f0f133e94f).html |language=Swedish}}</ref> Other periods of agricultural expansion are the [[Archaeology_of_Northern_Europe#Roman_Iron_Age|Roman Iron Age]] and the [[High Middle Ages]] (c. 13th century).<ref name=Per2013/>

Poor soil conditions have posed significant difficulties for agriculture in the highlands, meaning that over time small industries became relatively important in local economies.<ref name=skogskunskap/> Many abandoned fields are now covered with forest. Vestiges of abandoned fields can be recognised through the highlands by characteristic heaps of stones made when soils where cleared for cultivation.<ref name=skogskunskap>{{cite web |title=Kulturspår på sydsvenska höglandet |url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/kulturmiljohansyn/kulturspar-i-olika-landskap/kulturspar-pa-sydsvenska-hoglandet/ |website=Skogskunskap|access-date=May 10, 2019 |language=Swedish |date=November 6, 2016}}</ref>  

==Climate and weather events==
The climate of the western parts of the highlands is more humid than on the east. This is due to [[orographic precipitation]] caused by [[westerlies|southwestern]] wind forcing moist air over the highlands.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/> [[Sommen|Lake Sommen]] in the northeastern part of the highlands har relatively low humidity and low precipitations.<ref name=sodra2015>{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |chapter=4. östra Götalands sprickdals- och eklandskap |date=2015 |title=Skogliga naturvärdesregioner för södra Sverige|trans-title=Forest biodiversity regions in southern Sweden  |url=http://skogscertifiering.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Naturv%C3%A4rdesregioner_Rapport-S%C3%B6dra-Skogs%C3%A4garna.pdf |publisher=Södra |page=66 |docket= |access-date= |quote=|language=Swedish }}</ref> [[Ljungby]] in the southwestern parts of the highlands hold the monthly precipitation record for Småland with 347 mm in August 1945.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/> The South Swedish highlands host the record locations for coldest and hottest temperatures in [[Götaland|Southern Sweden]].<ref name=SMHIsmaland>{{cite web |title=Smålands klimat |url=https://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/smalands-klimat-1.4865 |website=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|SMHI]] |accessdate=May 10, 2019 |language=Swedish |date=January 16, 2018}}</ref> The cold record is -38.5 °C on January 16 1918 in [[Lommaryd]].<ref name=SMHIsmaland/> While the hot record is 38 °C on June 29, 1947 in [[Målilla]].<ref name=SMHIsmaland/>

The South Swedish highlands are less exposed to storms than the southern and [[Swedish West Coast|western]] coasts of Sweden, yet storms can still be very destructive.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/> The [[Cyclone Gudrun|2005 storm Gudrun]] was particularly strong causing much damage to forests in the southwestern part of the highlands.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/><ref name=SMHIGudrun>{{cite web |title=Skogsskador efter Gudrun |url=https://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/skogsskador-efter-gudrun-1.5292 |website=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute|SMHI]] |accessdate=May 10, 2019 |language=Swedish |date=July 8, 2015}}</ref> [[Picea abies|Spruces]] were particularly hit by Gudrun, while other trees with a more steady root system fared better.<ref name=SMHIGudrun/> Damage was exacerbated by the intential planting of spruces and practice of [[clearcutting]] which left many trees exposed to the wind.<ref name=SMHIGudrun/> Gudrun also caused [[Power outage|blackouts]] and disabled telecommunications infrastructure through the highlands.<ref name=SMHIsmaland/><ref name=SMHIGudrun/>

==Geology==
[[file:Sydsvenska_höglandet.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Map centered on the South Swedish highlands.]]
Within a geological context the highlands are the expression of the South Swedish Dome.<ref name=LB2013/> The South Swedish Dome has been subsided and been uplifted multiple times by [[epeirogeny|epeirogenic movements]] during the [[Phanerozoic]]. The dome has had periods of subsidence and burial in sediments have alternated with periods of exhumation and the formation of [[peneplain]]s and hilly relief. The [[Sub-Cambrian peneplain]] of [[Neoproterozoic|Late Neoproterozoic]] age is the oldest of the surfaces. It covers the eastern and northern flanks of the dome and its crest region where it is up-broken.<ref name=Japsenetal2016/><ref name=NatenSSH>{{cite web |url=https://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/sydsvenska-h%C3%B6glandet |title=Sydsvenska höglandet |last=Lidmar-Bergström |first=Karna |author-link=Karna Lidmar-Bergström |date= |website=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] |publisher=Cydonia Development |access-date=November 30, 2017 |quote= |language=Swedish}}</ref> The mesozoic-aged Sub-Mesozoic hilly relief covers the southern and western fringes of the dome, corresponding roughly with the counties of [[Halland]], [[Blekinge]] and northeastern [[Scania]].

The Late Cenozoic uplift of the dome is tentatively related to far-field compressional stresses that has uplifted the region as a giant [[anticline]]-like [[lithosphere]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. As such it is similar to uplifted [[passive margin]]s like the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] or the mountains of Western and Eastern [[Greenland]].<ref>{{cite journal|author-last=Japsen|author-first=Peter|author-last2=Chalmers|author-first2=James A.|author-last3=Green|author-first3=Paul F. |author-last4=Bonow|author-first4=Johan M.|date=2012|title=Elevated, passive continental margins: Not rift shoulders, but expressions of episodic, post-rift burial and exhumation |journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]]|volume=90–91 |issue=|pages=73–86|bibcode=2012GPC....90...73J|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2011.05.004}}</ref>

===Last ice age and deglaciation===
During the last [[deglaciation]] of the [[Weichselian glaciation|Weichselian Ice Sheet]] the South Swedish highlands was a place of ice flow divergence.<ref name=Sveriges2011>{{cite book |last1=Lundqvist |first1=Jan |last2=Lundqvist |first2=Thomas |last3=Lindström |first3=Maurits |last4=Calner |first4=Mikael|last5=Sivhed |first5=Ulf |author-link1=Jan Lundqvist |author-link2=Thomas Lundqvist (geologist)|author-link3=Maurits Lindström|edition=3rd |date=2011 |title=Sveriges Geologi: Från urtid till nutid |chapter=Svekokarelska Provinsen |language=Swedish |location=Spain |publisher=[[Studentlitteratur]] |isbn=978-91-44-05847-4 |via= |subscription= |quote= |page=515}}</ref> Deglaciation of southern Sweden was relatively slow with ice margin retreat rates of less than 150 m/yr. The retreat was interrupted multiple times by small glacier advances. These advances led to the formation of a series of [[end moraine]] systems. During deglaciation in southern Sweden glacier ice was mostly warm-based with some lesser parts being [[permafrost|cold-based]].<ref name=Stroevenetal2016/>

At present various lakes in the South Swedish highlands contain [[plankton]]ic crustacean species that are [[Relict (biology)|relics]] from the time the Weichselian Ice Sheet [[deglaciation|left]] the area about 12,000 years ago.<ref name=Kinsten2010>{{cite report |author=Kinsten, Björn |author-link= |authors= |date=2010 |title=De glacialrelikta kräftdjurens utbredning i södra Sverige  (Götaland och Svealand) |issue=2010/7|url=https://www.lansstyrelsen.se/download/18.2887c5dd16488fe880d55ad0/1537435814356/rapport-2010-7.pdf |publisher=Länsstyrelsen Blekinge län |pages=1–19 |docket= |access-date=April 19, 2019 |quote=|language=Swedish }}</ref><ref name=Stroevenetal2016>{{cite journal| date=2016|title=Deglaciation of Fennoscandia|journal=[[Quaternary Science Reviews]] |volume=147|issue=|pages=91–121 |doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2015.09.016|bibcode=2016QSRv..147...91S |last1=Stroeven |first1=Arjen P |last2=Hättestrand |first2=Clas |last3=Kleman |first3=Johan |last4=Heyman |first4=Jakob |last5=Fabel |first5=Derek |last6=Fredin |first6=Ola |last7=Goodfellow |first7=Bradley W |last8=Harbor |first8=Jonathan M |last9=Jansen |first9=John D |last10=Olsen |first10=Lars |last11=Caffee |first11=Marc W |last12=Fink |first12=David |last13=Lundqvist |first13=Jan |last14=Rosqvist |first14=Gunhild C |last15=Strömberg |first15=Bo |last16=Jansson |first16=Krister N|author-link13=Jan Lundqvist |doi-access=free }}</ref> [[Sommen|Lake Sommen]] stands out for having as much as three glacial relict crustcean species.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
As a teenager, Hutson formed the Nu-Tones, a four-man vocal group based in New Jersey. They won several talent shows during his high school years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Hutson_interview.htm|title=Leroy Hutson Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> The other members of the Nu-Tones were Ronald King, Bernard Ransom, Ed Davis, and Irving Jenkins.

In 1968, as part of the duo Sugar & Spice, Lee Hutson and Deborah Rollins recorded for [[Kapp Records]]. They recorded several singles with some success. Their single \"In Love Forever\" ranked the \"Best New Record Of The Week\" in the local newspaper column \"Soul Sauce\". Two other singles recorded were \"Ah Ha Yeah\" and \"Dreams\".

=== College years ===
Initially attending [[Howard University]] in Washington D.C. to study dentistry, Hutson was room-mates with [[Donny Hathaway]] who left college early in order to be Curtis Mayfield's musical director, Hutson then chose to switch his college major to music theory and composition. It is through Hathaway that Hutson then came to replace Curtis in The Impressions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Hutson_interview.htm|title=Leroy Hutson Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>

At Howard University, Hutson joined [[The Mayfield Singers]], a group put together on Howard's campus by musician [[Curtis Mayfield]] that performed at New York's famed [[Apollo Theater]] and Philadelphia's [[Uptown Theater (Philadelphia)|Uptown Theater]]. The group released one single for Mayfield in 1967.

There, Hutson collaborated with Donny Hathaway on \"[[The Ghetto (Donny Hathaway song)|The Ghetto]]\", giving the late recording star his first hit record in early 1970.

=== Years with the Impressions ===
In 1971, three months out of college, Hutson was asked to replace [[Curtis Mayfield]] as the lead singer of [[The Impressions]].  He stayed with them for two-and-a-half years and recorded two albums with the group, before amicably leaving to pursue his own career as a writer, [[Musical producer|producer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], and musician.

The first Impressions single to feature Hutson as lead vocalist was entitled \"[[Love Me (The Impressions song)|Love Me]]\", released on [[Curtom Records]] in North America in June 1971.

On August 27, 2013 Hutson, filed a complaint against [[Young Jeezy]] and others alleging that Young Jeezy's song \"Time\" inappropriately incorporated the instrumental portion of [[The Impressions]] \"Getting it On,\" which was registered with the [[United States Copyright Office]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heard|first=Preston H. |title=Singer-Songwriter Lee Hutson Sues Rapper Young Jeezy Over Alleged Use of \"Getting It On\" Sample|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=6 September 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/singer-songwriter-lee-hutson-sues-rapper-young-jeezy-over-alleged-use-getting-it-sam|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===
In 1973 Hutson wrote, produced, arranged and recorded his first solo album, ''\"[[Love Oh Love]]\"'', featuring the single ''\"So In Love With You\".'' It was released on [[Curtom Records]].

Between the period of 1973 until 1992 Hutson recorded eight albums and charted with thirteen singles in the U.S.<ref>{{Allmusic

}}</ref> Because of this he has developed a [[cult following]] on the soul scene. After \"[[Love Oh Love]]\", Hutson went on to release \"[[The Man]]\", \"[[Hutson (album)|Hutson]]\", \"[[Feel The Spirit]]\", \"[[Hutson II]]\", \"[[Closer To The Source]]\" and \"[[Unforgettable (Leroy Hutson album)|Unforgettable]].\" Hutson's last 12\" the \"Share Your Love EP\" was released via the UK's [[Expansion Records]].

In 2008, Hutson returned to recording under the name Lee Hutson, issuing an album \"''Soothe You Groove You\"'' on his own Triumph label and via download. Two years later, in August 2010, Hutson made his comeback to European stages, performing at Suncebeat Festival in Zadar, Croatia, at Vintage at Goodwood Festival and at Indigo2 in London. He was backed by the British group The Third Degree.

As of 2017, Hutson's work is now licensed by British independent record label [[Acid Jazz Records]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.co.uk/portfolio-item/leroyhutson/|title=Acid Jazz Records {{!}}  Leroy Hutson|last=|first=|date=|website=www.acidjazz.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> who released an Anthology LP featuring his bigger hits such as ''\"I Think I'm Falling In Love\", \"Lucky Fellow\"'' and ''\"Don't It Make You Feel Good\"'' as well as previously unreleased track ''\"Positive Forces\"'' which featured an instrumental of ''\"All Because Of You\"'' on the B side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.co.uk/we-are-releasing-leroy-hutson-positive-forces/|title=Acid Jazz Records {{!}}   We Are Releasing Leroy Hutson – Positive Forces|website=www.acidjazz.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> They then went on to release another unreleased single, ''\"Now That I Found You\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.bigcartel.com/product/pre-order-leroy-hutson-now-that-i-found-you|title=Leroy Hutson - Now That I Found You|last=Records|first=Acid Jazz|website=Acid Jazz Records|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>''.''

In February 2018 they re-issued both [[Hutson (album)|Hutson]] and [[Hutson II]] and are currently in the process of releasing a four-part online documentary entitled ''\"Leroy Hutson: The Man!\"'',<ref>{{Citation|last=Acid Jazz Records|title=Leroy Hutson – The Man!  Part 1: Getting A Start|date=2018-02-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhvFlKBDxp4|accessdate=2018-03-03}}</ref> which features contributions from long-time fans of Hutson's such as actor and radio DJ [[Craig Charles]] and [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz]] founder and managing director [[Eddie Piller]]. Piller is said to have based his own music production style on that of Hutson's,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fredperry.com/subculture/playlist-profile-eddie-piller|title=Playlists and interviews exploring British subculture: Eddie Piller|website=www.fredperry.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> and uses the instrumental track ''\"Cool Out\"''  as the opening track for his current radio show, ''\"Eddie Piller's Eclectic Soul Show\".''

=== Work with other artists ===
Consistently touring through the late 1970s and 1980s, Hutson also lent his musicality to production work with fellow Curtom artists [[Linda Clifford]], [[Arnold Blair]], and [[The Natural Four]].

As a writer/producer, he has worked for [[Roberta Flack]] (\"Tryin' Times\", \"Gone Away\"), [[The Natural Four]] (\"You Bring Out the Best in Me\", \"Can This Be Real\"), Linda Clifford, [[Voices of East Harlem]] (\"Giving Love\"), Arnold Blair (\"Trying to Get Next to You\"), and [[Next Movement]] (\"Let's Work It Out\"), while more recently one of his own cult singles \"[[Lucky Fellow]]\" was covered by [[Snowboy]] on Acid Jazz records.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
As a teenager, Huston formed the Nu-Tones, a four-man vocal group based in New Jersey. They won several talent shows during his high school years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Hutson_interview.htm|title=Leroy Hutson Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> The other members of the Nu-Tones were Ronald King, Bernard Ransom, Ed Davis, and Irving Jenkins.

In 1968, as part of the duo Sugar & Spice, Lee Hutson and Deborah Rollins recorded for [[Kapp Records]]. They recorded several singles with some success. Their single \"In Love Forever\" ranked the \"Best New Record Of The Week\" in the local newspaper column \"Soul Sauce\". Two other singles recorded were \"Ah Ha Yeah\" and \"Dreams\".

=== College years ===
Initially attending [[Howard University]] in Washington D.C. to study dentistry, Hutson was room-mates with [[Donny Hathaway]] who left college early in order to be Curtis Mayfield's musical director, Hutson then chose to switch his college major to music theory and composition. It is through Hathaway that Hutson then came to replace Curtis in The Impressions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.urbanjazz.org/Hutson_interview.htm|title=Leroy Hutson Interview|website=www.urbanjazz.org|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>

At Howard University, Hutson joined [[The Mayfield Singers]], a group put together on Howard's campus by musician [[Curtis Mayfield]] that performed at New York's famed [[Apollo Theater]] and Philadelphia's [[Uptown Theater (Philadelphia)|Uptown Theater]]. The group released one single for Mayfield in 1967.

There, Hutson collaborated with Donny Hathaway on \"[[The Ghetto (Donny Hathaway song)|The Ghetto]]\", giving the late recording star his first hit record in early 1970.

=== Years with the Impressions ===
In 1971, three months out of college, Hutson was asked to replace [[Curtis Mayfield]] as the lead singer of [[The Impressions]].  He stayed with them for two-and-a-half years and recorded two albums with the group, before amicably leaving to pursue his own career as a writer, [[Musical producer|producer]], [[Arrangement|arranger]], and musician.

The first Impressions single to feature Hutson as lead vocalist was entitled \"[[Love Me (The Impressions song)|Love Me]]\", released on [[Curtom Records]] in North America in June 1971.

On August 27, 2013 Hutson, filed a complaint against [[Young Jeezy]] and others alleging that Young Jeezy's song \"Time\" inappropriately incorporated the instrumental portion of [[The Impressions]] \"Getting it On,\" which was registered with the [[United States Copyright Office]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heard|first=Preston H. |title=Singer-Songwriter Lee Hutson Sues Rapper Young Jeezy Over Alleged Use of \"Getting It On\" Sample|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=6 September 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/singer-songwriter-lee-hutson-sues-rapper-young-jeezy-over-alleged-use-getting-it-sam|accessdate=18 May 2014}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===
In 1973 Hutson wrote, produced, arranged and recorded his first solo album, ''\"[[Love Oh Love]]\"'', featuring the single ''\"So In Love With You\".'' It was released on [[Curtom Records]].

Between the period of 1973 until 1992 Hutson recorded eight albums and charted with thirteen singles in the U.S.<ref>{{Allmusic

| accessdate =27 January 2013
}}</ref> Because of this he has developed a [[cult following]] on the soul scene. After \"[[Love Oh Love]]\", Hutson went on to release \"[[The Man]]\", \"[[Hutson (album)|Hutson]]\", \"[[Feel The Spirit]]\", \"[[Hutson II]]\", \"[[Closer To The Source]]\" and \"[[Unforgettable (Leroy Hutson album)|Unforgettable]].\" Hutson's last 12\" the \"Share Your Love EP\" was released via the UK's [[Expansion Records]].

In 2008, Hutson returned to recording under the name Lee Hutson, issuing an album \"''Soothe You Groove You\"'' on his own Triumph label and via download. Two years later, in August 2010, Hutson made his comeback to European stages, performing at Suncebeat Festival in Zadar, Croatia, at Vintage at Goodwood Festival and at Indigo2 in London. He was backed by the British group The Third Degree.

As of 2017, Hutson's work is now licensed by British independent record label [[Acid Jazz Records]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.co.uk/portfolio-item/leroyhutson/|title=Acid Jazz Records {{!}}  Leroy Hutson|last=|first=|date=|website=www.acidjazz.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> who released an Anthology LP featuring his bigger hits such as ''\"I Think I'm Falling In Love\", \"Lucky Fellow\"'' and ''\"Don't It Make You Feel Good\"'' as well as previously unreleased track ''\"Positive Forces\"'' which featured an instrumental of ''\"All Because Of You\"'' on the B side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.co.uk/we-are-releasing-leroy-hutson-positive-forces/|title=Acid Jazz Records {{!}}   We Are Releasing Leroy Hutson – Positive Forces|website=www.acidjazz.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> They then went on to release another unreleased single, ''\"Now That I Found You\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acidjazz.bigcartel.com/product/pre-order-leroy-hutson-now-that-i-found-you|title=Leroy Hutson - Now That I Found You|last=Records|first=Acid Jazz|website=Acid Jazz Records|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>''.''

In February 2018 they re-issued both [[Hutson (album)|Hutson]] and [[Hutson II]] and are currently in the process of releasing a four-part online documentary entitled ''\"Leroy Hutson: The Man!\"'',<ref>{{Citation|last=Acid Jazz Records|title=Leroy Hutson – The Man!  Part 1: Getting A Start|date=2018-02-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhvFlKBDxp4|accessdate=2018-03-03}}</ref> which features contributions from long-time fans of Hutson's such as actor and radio DJ [[Craig Charles]] and [[Acid Jazz Records|Acid Jazz]] founder and managing director [[Eddie Piller]]. Piller is said to have based his own music production style on that of Hutson's,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fredperry.com/subculture/playlist-profile-eddie-piller|title=Playlists and interviews exploring British subculture: Eddie Piller|website=www.fredperry.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref> and uses the instrumental track ''\"Cool Out\"''  as the opening track for his current radio show, ''\"Eddie Piller's Eclectic Soul Show\".''

=== Work with other artists ===
Consistently touring through the late 1970s and 1980s, Hutson also lent his musicality to production work with fellow Curtom artists [[Linda Clifford]], [[Arnold Blair]], and [[The Natural Four]].

As a writer/producer, he has worked for [[Roberta Flack]] (\"Tryin' Times\", \"Gone Away\"), [[The Natural Four]] (\"You Bring Out the Best in Me\", \"Can This Be Real\"), Linda Clifford, [[Voices of East Harlem]] (\"Giving Love\"), Arnold Blair (\"Trying to Get Next to You\"), and [[Next Movement]] (\"Let's Work It Out\"), while more recently one of his own cult singles \"[[Lucky Fellow]]\" was covered by [[Snowboy]] on Acid Jazz records.

{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}

The title '''Baron of Loughmoe''' is an [[Irish feudal barony]] located in northern [[County Tipperary]], Ireland. The title was possibly raised to a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] peerage in 1690 while [[James II of England|James II]] was in exile, Marquis de Ruvigny notes this in his 'The Jacobite Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Grants of Honour' [https://books.google.com/books?vid=LCCN04017247&id=WrUEAAAAIAAJ&q=loughmore&dq=loughmore&pgis=1 Click here for link]

 

The feudal title was granted to Richard Purcell in 1328 by [[James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond]] as palatine Lord of Tipperary. Irish and [[Scotland|Scottish]] feudal titles, particularly those granted by palatine lords, are difficult to classify in law, they are acknowledged as genuine [[hereditament]]s by the arms granting bodies of Ireland, Scotland, and England, but were never formally recognised by [[the Crown]].

The seat of the Baron of Loughmoe is [[Loughmoe Castle]] at [[Loughmore]] Village, [[Templemore]], Co. Tipperary. 




==History==

The earliest documented Purcell is the Norman Hugh Purcell who in 1035 AD granted the tithes of Montmarquet, a vill on the frontiers of Picardy, and near Aumerle, to the Abbey of Aumerle.  
The successor of Sir Hugh Purcell was Dyno Purcell, who in about 1120, received a grant of the manor of Catteshull, Surrey, from King Henry I. Catteshull is a manor and tithing the north-east of Godalming (Surrey), and included lands in Chiddingfold. Øyno married a daughter of [[Nigel de Broc]], a famous Justiciar of the time. In 1129–30, his elder son Geoffrey, the King's usher (hostiarius), paid his relief for his father’s land and held it free of toll as it had been in his father's time, and gave it to Reading Abbey on becoming a monk there.  This gift was confirmed both by the Empress Maud and by her opponent Stephen. No mention is made of Catteshull in the confirmatory grants of Henry II to Reading Abbey, and he seems to have regranted it to Ralph de Broc, son of Øyno Purcell (identical with Ralph Purcell), to hold by the service of usher of the king’s chamber.  
[[File:Castles of Munster, Loughmoe, Tipperary (4) - geograph.org.uk - 1542655.jpg|thumb|The outside of the castle, as seen from the West. However, in reality, this would have been the castle facing backwards, as the Royal Society of Antiquaries in Ireland note that the entrance was indeed on the East.]]
Geoffrey’s brother and heir, [[Ranulf de Broc|Ranulf]], assumed his mother's name of De Broc apparently in 1156, as the [[Pipe Roll]] of that year for Hampshire he is styled De Broc and for Surrey he is still called Purcell.  

Dyno's son, Ranulf Purcell, took his mother's name, de Broc, and was implicated in the assassination of [[Thomas Becket]]. Ranulf was excommunicated for theft of property of the Archbishopric by Becket, on Christmas Day, 1170, the traditional day of forgiveness. When [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who was in Normandy, heard of this, he is said to have asked why none of his knights had rid him of “this troublesome priest”. A few days later, four knights arrived at [[Saltwood Castle|Saltwood]], Ranulf de Broc’s castle in Kent. After the murder, [[Saltwood Castle|Saltwood]] was confiscated by Henry for De Broc's involvement in the murder. De Broc argued that the knights had lied to him and said Henry had ordered Becket be arrested.

Just as Randulf de Broc had no male issue, neither had his nephew Robert, who as Justiciar is frequently mentioned in the public Records; Robert came to be represented by the De Lodges’ and the Peto’s.

The Purcell male representation then passed to the family of the lords of Newton-Purcell Oxon., and Shareshull, Staffordshire. Ralph, the founder of this line, inherited those manors and others in Normandy, near Rouen, together with the Court Office, viz.: Usher of the King’s Chamber, as well as his maternal uncle Robert Burnell’s Court Office of Usher, who was living in 1129–30 and enjoyed the Royal favour shown by the remission of the Dane-Geld.  About 1154, a charter of confirmation of his uncle’s lands and office passed attested, among others, by St. Thomas a Beckett, the Chancellor.  About 1160 he made a grant of land in Normandy to the Abbey of the Holy Trinity, Rouen.  He must have lived to a great age, as he obtained another confirmation under the payment from King John A.D. 1200.  He was the Patriarch of a numerous tribe in England and Ireland; one of his sons being Hugh, who took part in the English Invasion of Ireland in 1171 and became the founder of the House of Purcell in that country.

===Norman invasion of Ireland 1171 AD===
[[File:Norman Invasion Leaders.jpg|thumb|Leaders of the Norman invasion of Ireland, depicted by Giraldus Cambrensis. ]]
According to O'Hart, this Hugh was the unnamed knight mentioned by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], as slain at Waterford. Hugh had been left in command of Waterford while the King departed for Dublin, 

	…\"on the morrow, seeking to cross the river in one of the native boats to hold parley with the King, the boatmen rose upon him in the middle of the stream, stabbed him with their long ‘skeans’ and the threw the body into the river.\" 

In 1171 Sir Hugh Purcell was a knight who participated in the Norman invasion of Ireland, and around 1204 his grandson Sir Hugh married Beatrix, daughter of Theobald FitzWalter, Chief Butler of Ireland. As part of his marriage, Hugh received from FitzWalter, the town of Loughmoe. Sir Hugh founded, in 1241, a Monastery of Franciscans or Grey Friars in Waterford. Hugh's tomb is described by 17th century sources as having on it, the figure of a man in armour, in high relief, with a shield on his left arm, on which were three lions passant guardant in pale. The crest of course is that of the Plantagenets.

'''History of the building'''
[[File:The first floor of the old building, 2019.jpg|thumb|The first floor of the 13th Century tower. You can see the stability of it, and behind the photographer is the spiral staircase. ]]
The southern tower, the one with the rounded edges, was built much earlier than the remainder. Back in the time it was built, there was higher risks of invasion, thus they made arrow holes, murder holes, spiral staircases and rounded corners. There are still staircases and different floors remaining in the old, 13th century tower. However, the remainder, built sometime later - probably in the 17th century, was built weaker and less stable, as the threat was much lower. These sections of the castle are now in ruins. The ruined main entrance is in the western portion of the castle. The old tower-house is on the eastern side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishhistorypodcast.ie/photo-essay-loughmoe-castle/|title=Photo essay: Loughmoe Castle. • Irish history podcast|last=April 4|first=Published|last2=Ruins|first2=2012 in Medieval|date=2012-04-04|website=Irish history podcast|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Royal Society of|first=Antiquaries of Ireland|date=1912|title=Loughmoe castle|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

Born sometime in 1651, he was the first son of colonel James Purcell. The May 1652 act of settlement saw to that his father, a Roman Catholic, lost the lands his father had held since 1198. However, James Purcell's marrige to the sister of the Duke of Ormonde enabled a powerful contact, who assured allocation of some property. However, this did not occur without great difficulty. On the 13th of September 1651, James Purcell died and was buried at the Holy Cross abbey. <ref>{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Irish Jacobites|publisher=|year=17th Century|isbn=|location=Ireland|pages=}}</ref>

The title '''Baron of Loughmoe''' is an [[Irish feudal barony]] located in northern [[County Tipperary]], Ireland. The title was possibly raised to a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] peerage in 1690 while [[James II of England|James II]] was in exile, Marquis de Ruvigny notes this in his 'The Jacobite Peerage, Baronetage, Knightage and Grants of Honour' [https://books.google.com/books?vid=LCCN04017247&id=WrUEAAAAIAAJ&q=loughmore&dq=loughmore&pgis=1 Click here for link]

 

The feudal title was granted to Richard Purcell in 1328 by [[James Butler, 1st Earl of Ormond]] as palatine Lord of Tipperary. Irish and [[Scotland|Scottish]] feudal titles, particularly those granted by palatine lords, are difficult to classify in law, they are acknowledged as genuine [[hereditament]]s by the arms granting bodies of Ireland, Scotland, and England, but were never formally recognised by [[the Crown]].

The seat of the Baron of Loughmoe is [[Loughmoe Castle]] at [[Loughmore]] Village, [[Templemore]], Co. Tipperary. 




==History==

The earliest documented Purcell is the Norman Hugh Purcell who in 1035 AD granted the tithes of Montmarquet, a vill on the frontiers of Picardy, and near Aumerle, to the Abbey of Aumerle.  
The successor of Sir Hugh Purcell was Dyno Purcell, who in about 1120, received a grant of the manor of Catteshull, Surrey, from King Henry I. Catteshull is a manor and tithing the north-east of Godalming (Surrey), and included lands in Chiddingfold. Øyno married a daughter of [[Nigel de Broc]], a famous Justiciar of the time. In 1129–30, his elder son Geoffrey, the King's usher (hostiarius), paid his relief for his father’s land and held it free of toll as it had been in his father's time, and gave it to Reading Abbey on becoming a monk there.  This gift was confirmed both by the Empress Maud and by her opponent Stephen. No mention is made of Catteshull in the confirmatory grants of Henry II to Reading Abbey, and he seems to have regranted it to Ralph de Broc, son of Øyno Purcell (identical with Ralph Purcell), to hold by the service of usher of the king’s chamber.  
[[File:Castles of Munster, Loughmoe, Tipperary (4) - geograph.org.uk - 1542655.jpg|thumb|The outside of the castle, as seen from the West. However, in reality, this would have been the castle facing backwards, as the Royal Society of Antiquaries in Ireland note that the entrance was indeed on the East.]]
Geoffrey’s brother and heir, [[Ranulf de Broc|Ranulf]], assumed his mother's name of De Broc apparently in 1156, as the [[Pipe Roll]] of that year for Hampshire he is styled De Broc and for Surrey he is still called Purcell.  

Dyno's son, Ranulf Purcell, took his mother's name, de Broc, and was implicated in the assassination of [[Thomas Becket]]. Ranulf was excommunicated for theft of property of the Archbishopric by Becket, on Christmas Day, 1170, the traditional day of forgiveness. When [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who was in Normandy, heard of this, he is said to have asked why none of his knights had rid him of “this troublesome priest”. A few days later, four knights arrived at [[Saltwood Castle|Saltwood]], Ranulf de Broc’s castle in Kent. After the murder, [[Saltwood Castle|Saltwood]] was confiscated by Henry for De Broc's involvement in the murder. De Broc argued that the knights had lied to him and said Henry had ordered Becket be arrested.

Just as Randulf de Broc had no male issue, neither had his nephew Robert, who as Justiciar is frequently mentioned in the public Records; Robert came to be represented by the De Lodges’ and the Peto’s.

The Purcell male representation then passed to the family of the lords of Newton-Purcell Oxon., and Shareshull, Staffordshire. Ralph, the founder of this line, inherited those manors and others in Normandy, near Rouen, together with the Court Office, viz.: Usher of the King’s Chamber, as well as his maternal uncle Robert Burnell’s Court Office of Usher, who was living in 1129–30 and enjoyed the Royal favour shown by the remission of the Dane-Geld.  About 1154, a charter of confirmation of his uncle’s lands and office passed attested, among others, by St. Thomas a Beckett, the Chancellor.  About 1160 he made a grant of land in Normandy to the Abbey of the Holy Trinity, Rouen.  He must have lived to a great age, as he obtained another confirmation under the payment from King John A.D. 1200.  He was the Patriarch of a numerous tribe in England and Ireland; one of his sons being Hugh, who took part in the English Invasion of Ireland in 1171 and became the founder of the House of Purcell in that country.

===Norman invasion of Ireland 1171 AD===
[[File:Norman Invasion Leaders.jpg|thumb|Leaders of the Norman invasion of Ireland, depicted by Giraldus Cambrensis. ]]
According to O'Hart, this Hugh was the unnamed knight mentioned by [[Giraldus Cambrensis]], as slain at Waterford. Hugh had been left in command of Waterford while the King departed for Dublin, 

	…\"on the morrow, seeking to cross the river in one of the native boats to hold parley with the King, the boatmen rose upon him in the middle of the stream, stabbed him with their long ‘skeans’ and the threw the body into the river.\" 

In 1171 Sir Hugh Purcell was a knight who participated in the Norman invasion of Ireland, and around 1204 his grandson Sir Hugh married Beatrix, daughter of Theobald FitzWalter, Chief Butler of Ireland. As part of his marriage, Hugh received from FitzWalter, the town of Loughmoe. Sir Hugh founded, in 1241, a Monastery of Franciscans or Grey Friars in Waterford. Hugh's tomb is described by 17th century sources as having on it, the figure of a man in armour, in high relief, with a shield on his left arm, on which were three lions passant guardant in pale. The crest of course is that of the Plantagenets.

'''History of the building'''
[[File:The first floor of the old building, 2019.jpg|thumb|The first floor of the 13th Century tower. You can see the stability of it, and behind the photographer is the spiral staircase. ]]
The southern tower, the one with the rounded edges, was built much earlier than the remainder. Back in the time it was built, there was higher risks of invasion, thus they made arrow holes, murder holes, spiral staircases and rounded corners. There are still staircases and different floors remaining in the old, 13th century tower. However, the remainder, built sometime later - probably in the 17th century, was built weaker and less stable, as the threat was much lower. These sections of the castle are now in ruins. The ruined main entrance is in the western portion of the castle. The old tower-house is on the eastern side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishhistorypodcast.ie/photo-essay-loughmoe-castle/|title=Photo essay: Loughmoe Castle. • Irish history podcast|last=April 4|first=Published|last2=Ruins|first2=2012 in Medieval|date=2012-04-04|website=Irish history podcast|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Royal Society of|first=Antiquaries of Ireland|date=1912|title=Loughmoe castle|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>

The '''M1 motorway''' ({{lang-ga|Mótarbhealach M1}}) is a [[motorway]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It forms the large majority of the '''N1 [[national primary road]]''' connecting [[Dublin]] towards [[Belfast]] along the east of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. The route heads north via [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] to the [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|Northern Irish border]] just south of [[Newry]] in [[County Armagh]], where it joins the [[A1 road (Northern Ireland)|A1 road]] and further on, the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 motorway]] in Northern Ireland. It also forms a significant part of the road connection between Dublin and the Northern Irish cities of [[Newry]], and [[Lisburn]].
The route is part of [[International E-road network|European route]] [[European route E01|E01]].

==Route==
[[File:The M1 Boyne Bridge, near Drogheda, Co. Louth - geograph.org.uk - 1414270.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge]] carries the [[Drogheda]] bypass across the [[river Boyne]].]]

Almost the entire length of the N1 has been upgraded to motorway standard and is designated the M1 motorway. It runs from the Junction 3 of the M50 [[ring road]] in Dublin, past [[Cloghran, Coolock|Cloghran]], [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Balbriggan]], [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] before ending at Ballymascanlon north of Dundalk. It by-passes many towns through which the N1 travelled.<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0053.html S.I. No. 53/2012 — Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2012</ref> The original N1 route now forms the [[R132 road|R132]].<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0054.html S.I. No. 54/2012 — Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2012</ref> At Ballymascanlon, it becomes the N1 dual carriageway and continues to the border with [[Northern Ireland]]. The motorway section of the N1 uses the M1 designation. Small yellow route markers along the motorway route also read N1.

The motorway was built in several stages as short disconnected bypasses, replacing the original N1 route. The first section opened (in 1983) was from Whitehall to Coolock Lane followed (in 1985) by the ''Airport Motorway'' between Whitehall and [[Dublin Airport]], only the third section of motorway opened in Ireland. 1980s style [[road signs in the Republic of Ireland|direction signs]] were still intact on this route up until 2006. Part of this original M1 is now a spur to Dublin Airport, while another part between Whitehall to the [[Dublin Port Tunnel|Port Tunnel]] portals is now narrowed to two+one lanes (although still grade separated) as a result of the Dublin Port Tunnel work.

There are toll fees for use of the motorway between junctions 7 and 10, the section which forms the [[Drogheda]] bypass.  Work began in 2004 on a bypass of Dundalk, and was completed three months ahead of schedule in 2005, extending the motorway to just south of the border.

Construction finished in 2007 on a cross-border stretch of [[grade-separated]] dual-carriageway linking the northern end of the M1 with the A1 near Newry in County Armagh. This was opened to traffic on 2 August 2007. Its length is 14&nbsp;km, 4.6&nbsp;km north of the border and 9.4&nbsp;km south of the border. This allows traffic to flow freely from [[Dublin Port]] on motorway/dual-carriageway standard road to the Hillsborough Roundabout, located south of Lisburn.

==All-Ireland route==
{{Main|A1 road (Northern Ireland)}}

The upgrade of the N1 is now complete in the Republic of Ireland, the first major route to be completely upgraded to motorway/dual carriageway standard (outside of Dublin city centre) as per the [[National Development Plan]]. The [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] authorities have no plans to replace the A1 route (currently dual carriageway) with motorway, although many junctions have now been grade separated. Currently, to drive from Dublin city centre to [[Belfast]], one travels along the M1 (Republic of Ireland), N1, A1 and M1 (Northern Ireland).

==Motorway service areas==
The first official on-line [[Motorway service area]] in Ireland opened on the M1 on 8 September 2010, located near [[Lusk services|Lusk]]. A second near Castlebellingham (M1 North service area) opened on 29 September 2010. Each location has northbound and southbound facilities, with no connection across the motorway between each side. Open 24 hours a day, they provide fuel and food and are of a design similar to those found in other European countries. The service areas are run by a consortium of companies known as Superstop.

==ITS on the M1==
As with other sections of Irish motorways which feature [[Variable-message sign]]s, the M1 is also connected to an [[Intelligent transportation system]] providing real-time journey time information for motorists. The system works by recognising vehicle number plates at intervals along the motorway, and uses this information to calculate average vehicle speeds and hence travel times. Northbound, VMSs near Malahide and Balbriggan provide information on the journey times to the Drogheda (J7) and Dundalk (J16) exits. Similar signs southbound provide information on the travel time to Dublin airport and the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]].

==Roadside art on the M1==
Roadside art is funded under the Percentage For Arts Scheme where 1% of the scheme budget is allocated to roadside art with a cap of €63,000. The local authorities decide on a theme and are responsible for commissioning the work, usually by open competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604142819/http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |archivedate=4 June 2009 }}</ref> There are several examples along the M1

The '''M1 motorway''' ({{lang-ga|Mótarbhealach M1}}) is a [[motorway]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It forms the large majority of the '''N1 [[national primary road]]''' connecting [[Dublin]] towards [[Belfast]] along the east of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. The route heads north via [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] to the [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|Northern Irish border]] just south of [[Newry]] in [[County Armagh]], where it joins the [[A1 road (Northern Ireland)|A1 road]] and further on, the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 motorway]] in Northern Ireland. It also forms a significant part of the road connection between Dublin and the Northern Irish cities of [[Newry]], and [[Lisburn]].
The route is part of [[International E-road network|European route]] [[European route E01|E01]].

==Route==
[[File:The M1 Boyne Bridge, near Drogheda, Co. Louth - geograph.org.uk - 1414270.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge]] carries the [[Drogheda]] bypass across the [[river Boyne]].]]

Almost the entire length of the N1 has been upgraded to motorway standard and is designated the M1 motorway. It runs from the Junction 3 of the M50 [[ring road]] in Dublin, past [[Cloghran, Coolock|Cloghran]], [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Balbriggan]], [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] before ending at Ballymascanlon north of Dundalk. It by-passes many towns through which the N1 travelled.<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0053.html S.I. No. 53/2012 — Roads Act 1993 (Classification of National Roads) Order 2012</ref> The original N1 route now forms the [[R132 road|R132]].<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0054.html S.I. No. 54/2012 — Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2012</ref> At Ballymascanlon, it becomes the N1 dual carriageway and continues to the border with [[Northern Ireland]]. The motorway section of the N1 uses the M1 designation. Small yellow route markers along the motorway route also read N1.

The motorway was built in several stages as short disconnected bypasses, replacing the original N1 route. The first section opened (in 1983) was from Whitehall to Coolock Lane followed (in 1985) by the ''Airport Motorway'' between Whitehall and [[Dublin Airport]], only the third section of motorway opened in Ireland. 1980s style [[road signs in the Republic of Ireland|direction signs]] were still intact on this route up until 2006. Part of this original M1 is now a spur to Dublin Airport, while another part between Whitehall to the [[Dublin Port Tunnel|Port Tunnel]] portals is now narrowed to two+one lanes (although still grade separated) as a result of the Dublin Port Tunnel work.

There are toll fees for use of the motorway between junctions 7 and 10, the section which forms the [[Drogheda]] bypass.  Work began in 2004 on a bypass of Dundalk, and was completed three months ahead of schedule in 2005, extending the motorway to just south of the border.

Construction finished in 2007 on a cross-border stretch of [[grade-separated]] dual-carriageway linking the northern end of the M1 with the A1 near Newry in County Armagh. This was opened to traffic on 2 August 2007. Its length is 14&nbsp;km, 4.6&nbsp;km north of the border and 9.4&nbsp;km south of the border. This allows traffic to flow freely from [[Dublin Port]] on motorway/dual-carriageway standard road to the Hillsborough Roundabout, located south of Lisburn.

'''Borken''' is a small town with about 13,000 inhabitants in the [[Schwalm-Eder-Kreis|Schwalm-Eder district]] in northern [[Hesse]], [[Germany]].

The town is a former centre for [[brown coal]] [[mining]] and [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired electrical generation]] in Hesse. The [[coalmine]], unlike those in other regions, also had underground workings. After a major disaster – namely a [[coal dust]] explosion – the mine was shut down on 1 June 1988.

Since that time, the former coal pits have been redeveloped into recreation areas with lakes, nature areas – some actually protected by law – and sporting grounds. Among these areas are ''der [[Borkener See]]'' (Borken Lake) with its nature reserve, ''der [[Singliser See]]'' (Singlis Lake) with [[windsurfing]], and ''die [[Stockelache]]'' (\"Stagnant Puddle\"<!---Yes, really!--->), used as a bathing lake.

One particular attraction in Borken is the [[Hessian Brown Coal Mining Museum]] (''Hessisches Braunkohle Bergbaumuseum'') which displays the town's coal-mining tradition. Since 2003, an [[open-air museum]], where visitors may learn about \"coal and energy\", has also been open. The museum is also affiliated with a nature conservation information centre for the Borkener See.

Borken's best known landmark is its [[watertower]].

== History ==

=== Mining in Borken ===
In the Borken region in the 20th century, the most important brown coal deposit in Hesse was mined and used at a thermal power plant to generate [[electricity]]. With the end of the coal stocks, the Stolzenbach mine disaster in 1988 and the Borken Power Plant shutdown on 15 March 1991, this epoch in the region's history, which had lastingly shaped the economy, the landscape and the people, came to an end. Since then, the brown coal mining area has found itself the subject of a restructuring process by a service company.

In the 21st century, the \"Borkener Seenland\" (\"Borken Lakeland\") and the Hessian Brown Coal Mining Museum turned the landmarks and the legacy, as well as the coal-mining and power plant era into a leisure and museum area.

== Politics ==

=== Municipal council ===

== Landmarks ==

===''Borkener Seenland''===
The \"Stockelache Nature Bathing Lake\", the Singlis surfing lake and the ''Borkener See'' nature reserve use the old coal-mining lands for [[tourism]] with a broad choice of activities ranging from bathing, [[human swimming|swimming]] and diving to [[beach volleyball]], windsurfing and Aqua-Golf, to [[recreation]], [[hiking]], and nature watching.

=== Hessian Brown Coal Mining Museum ===
The Hessian Brown Coal Mining Museum, founded in 1992, presents under the theme of \"Discover industrial culture – experience landscape change\" many exhibits from coal-mining and electrical generation, whose workings are demonstrated for visitors. These exhibits include the underground and above-ground mining of the raw material, brown coal, its use, and the conversion of the former mining lands as the centrepiece.

The visitor may choose from among four museum areas:
*In the 3.5 ha experience-oriented \"Coal & Energy\" [[theme park]], rattling excavators, humming turbines and smoking power station kettles show how coal was mined from the pits, and how it was used for energy.
*A reconstructed gallery displays the miners' work and everyday lives, and shows through original equipment the change in mining procedures.
*A permanent exhibition presents the 400-year history of Hessian brown coal mining.
*The \"Borkener See\" nature conservation information centre explains how \"second-hand\" landscapes are fashioned from former [[strip mining]] areas.

The visitors' mine and the \"mining history\" exhibit are housed in Borken's oldest building, \"Am Amtsgericht\" – built in 1473 – in the Old Town. The \"Coal & Energy\" theme park and the adjoining \"Borkener See\" nature conservation information centre are found ''Am Freilichtmuseum'' (\"At the Open-Air Museum\") before the town's gates.

These exhibits include the underground and above-ground mining of the raw material, brown coal, its use, and the conversion of the former mining lands as the centrepiece.

The visitor may choose from among four museum areas:
*In the 3.5 ha experience-oriented \"Coal & Energy\" [[theme park]], rattling excavators, humming turbines and smoking power station kettles show how coal was mined from the pits, and how it was used for energy.
*A reconstructed gallery displays the miners' work and everyday lives, and shows through original equipment the change in mining procedures.
*A permanent exhibition presents the 400-year history of Hessian brown coal mining.
*The \"Borkener See\" nature conservation information centre explains how \"second-hand\" landscapes are fashioned from former [[strip mining]] areas.

The visitors' mine and the \"mining history\" exhibit are housed in Borken's oldest building, \"Am Amtsgericht\" – built in 1473 – in the Old Town. The \"Coal & Energy\" theme park and the adjoining \"Borkener See\" nature conservation information centre are found ''Am Freilichtmuseum'' (\"At the Open-Air Museum\") before the town's gates.

=== Great power plant Borken ===
The Borken power plant building, which still stands today is protected as a [[monument]]. It was built in 1922‒1923 by the famous industrial architects [[Werner Issel]] and [[Walter Klingenberg]].

Terry Jacks recorded \"Seasons in the Sun\" in [[Vancouver]] in 1973 with his then-wife [[Susan Jacks]]. They made the decision to record the song when [[The Beach Boys]], who had recorded a version with Terry Jacks producing, decided to abandon their recording.

Jacks released his version as a single in 1973 on his own label, Goldfish Records. \"Put the Bone In\", an original composition about burying a deceased pet dog, was included as the B-side. The single soon topped the record charts in the U.S. (where it was released on [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]]), in Canada, and the UK,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book

Jacks's version was released in the United States in December 1973, and made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] a month later. On March 2, 1974, the song began a three-week run at number one atop the Hot 100, and remained in the top 40 until almost [[Memorial Day]] weekend.  Jacks's version also spent one week on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary|Easy Listening]] charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961-2001|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2002 |publisher=Record Research |page=123}}</ref> ''Billboard'' ranked it as the number two song for 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/songoftheyear/ |title=Number One Song of the Year: 1946-2015 |website=bobborst.com |access-date=August 22, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420175438/http://www.bobborst.com/popculture/songoftheyear/ |archive-date=April 20, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Although he released several other singles that were moderately successful in Canada, \"Seasons in the Sun\" would become Jacks's only major solo hit in the United States.<ref>Whitburn, Joel, \"Top Pop Hits: 1955-2006, 2007.</ref> In Canada, the single (Gold Fish GF 100) reached number one on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM Magazine]] charts January 26, 1974, and remained there four weeks.

Though the song enjoyed contemporary success, modern criticism takes a dimmer view, considering it overly sentimentalized. Jacks's version has been held up as an example of bad music, such as having been listed as [[List of music considered the worst|one of the worst pop songs ever recorded]] and ranking number five in a similar CNN poll in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|author=Todd Leopold |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/25/worst.songs/index.html |title=The worst song of all time, part II - Apr 26, 2006 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref>

Jacks also released a German-language version in Germany with lyrics by Gerd Müller-Schwanke, \"In den Gärten der Zeit\".<ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/2008249 \"In den Gärten der Zeit\"] at 45cat.com</ref>

Terry Jacks recorded \"Seasons in the Sun\" in [[Vancouver]] in 1973 with his then-wife [[Susan Jacks]]. They made the decision to record the song when [[The Beach Boys]], who had recorded a version with Terry Jacks producing, decided to abandon their recording.

Jacks released his version as a single in 1973 on his own label, Goldfish Records. \"Put the Bone In\", an original composition about burying a deceased pet dog, was included as the B-side. The single soon topped the record charts in the U.S. (where it was released on [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]]), in Canada, and the UK,<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book

Jacks's version was released in the United States in December 1973, and made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] a month later. On March 2, 1974, the song began a three-week run at number one atop the Hot 100, and remained in the top 40 until almost [[Memorial Day]] weekend.

Though the song enjoyed contemporary success, modern criticism takes a dimmer view, considering it overly sentimentalized. Jacks's version has been held up as an example of bad music, such as having been listed as [[List of music considered the worst|one of the worst pop songs ever recorded]] and ranking number five in a similar CNN poll in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|author=Todd Leopold |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/25/worst.songs/index.html |title=The worst song of all time, part II - Apr 26, 2006 |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref>

Jacks also released a German-language version in Germany with lyrics by Gerd Müller-Schwanke, \"In den Gärten der Zeit\".<ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/2008249 \"In den Gärten der Zeit\"] at 45cat.com</ref>

The '''Springfield Illinois Light Artillery''', also known as '''Vaughn's Independent Illinois Battery''' or '''Battery A, 3rd Illinois Light Artillery''', was an [[artillery battery]] from [[Illinois]] that served in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Organized in August 1862, the unit was first stationed at [[Bolivar, Tennessee]]. In August–September 1863 the battery participated in [[Frederick Steele]]'s expedition to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], being engaged at [[Battle of Bayou Fourche|Bayou Fourche]]. In spring 1864, the battery took part in the [[Camden Expedition]], fighting at [[Battle of Prairie D'Ane|Prairie D'Ane]] and [[Battle of Jenkins' Ferry|Jenkins' Ferry]]. The unit sat out the remainder of the war in Little Rock before being mustered out of service in June 1865. 

==Formation==
The Springfield Light Artillery was organized at [[Springfield, Illinois]] and mustered into Federal service on 21 August 1862.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} Thomas F. Vaughn of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] was appointed [[captain (armed forces)|captain]].{{sfn|Reece|1901|p=747}} Vaughn previously commanded [[Battery B, 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery]] from 25 August 1861{{sfn|Rhodes|1894|p=20}} until 1 December 1861 when he resigned his commission.{{sfn|Rhodes|1894|p=52}} Vaughn led the Rhode Island battery at the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff]] where the unit suffered the loss of one gun and several casualties.{{sfn|Rhodes|1894|p=37}} The other officers of the Springfield Light Artillery were [[First Lieutenant]]s Edward B. Stillings and Henry D. Colby, both from Springfield, and [[Second Lieutenant]]s Charles W. Thomas of [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]] and Louis D. Rosette of Springfield. Rank and file included [[Sergeant Major]] Louis B. Smith, [[First Sergeant]] Alexander Busby, and [[Quartermaster Sergeant]] William E. Fitzhugh, all of Springfield, five [[sergeant]]s (three from Springfield, two from [[Wenona, Illinois|Wenona]]), 12 [[corporal]]s (six from Wenona, four from Springfield, two from [[Magnolia, Illinois|Magnolia]]), one [[Standard-bearer|guidon]] bearer, one [[bugler]], one [[Wagon master|wagoner]], five [[Armed-forces artificer|artificers]], and 93 [[private (rank)|privates]].{{sfn|Reece|1901|pp=747–749}} 

According to a July 1863 report, the battery was armed with six [[14-pounder James rifle]]s. At that time, the battery reported having the following 3.80-inch ammunition on hand: 180 Hotchkiss [[canister shot]], 36 Tatham's canister shot, 30 James canister shot, 250 James [[solid shot]], and 451 James [[shell (projectile)|common shell]]. The battery originally included a section (two guns) of [[M1841 12-pounder howitzer]]s, so that it also reported having the following 12-pounder smoothbore ammunition: 72 common shell, 42 [[shrapnel shell|spherical case]], and 50 canister shot. In the ordnance tables, the battery was referred to as Company A, 3rd Illinois Light Artillery, though there were no other companies (B, C, D, etc.) listed under the 3rd regiment.{{sfn|Swain|2015}}

==Organizations==
The Springfield Light Artillery remained on duty at [[Camp Butler National Cemetery|Camp Butler]] near Springfield from August until 1 November 1862. The battery traveled to Bolivar, Tennessee on 1–8 November where it was attached to the District of [[Jackson, Tennessee]] in the original [[XIII Corps (Union Army)|XIII Corps]], [[Army of the Tennessee]]. From December 1862 to March 1863, Vaughn's Illinois Battery defended the Post of Bolivar, District of Jackson, [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]]. In March–May 1863, the battery was part of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, XVI Corps. In May–August 1863, it transferred to the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, XVI Corps. Vaughn's Battery was assigned to True's Brigade, Arkansas Expedition in September 1863. The battery was part of Artillery, 2nd Division, [[Army of Arkansas]] from September 1863 to January 1864. The unit formed part of Artillery, 2nd Division, [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]], Department of Arkansas in January–March 1864. The Springfield Light Artillery was in the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, VII Corps in March–April 1864. The unit was reassigned to Artillery, 3rd Division, VII Corps in April–May 1864. Vaughn's Battery was part of Artillery, 1st Division, VII Corps from May 1864 to June 1865.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}}

==History==
[[File:Frederick Steele cropped.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Black and white photo shows a man with a foot-long beard. He wears a dark, double breasted uniform with general's stars on the shoulder tabs.|Frederick Steele]]

The Springfield Illinois Light Artillery arrived at Bolivar and was assigned to a brigade commanded by [[Mason Brayman]]. On 15–20 December 1862, two sections participated in an expedition against Confederate raiders under [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].{{sfn|Reece|1901|p=751}} Vaughn's Battery performed garrison duty at Bolivar from November 1862 until 18 June 1863. The battery was parceled out to guard the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] with one section each at [[Moscow, Tennessee|Moscow]], [[Collierville, Tennessee|Collierville]], and [[Germantown, Tennessee|Germantown]] through 23 August 1863. The unit traveled to [[Helena, Arkansas]] on 24 August–2 September 1863, then joined [[Frederick Steele]]'s expedition to Little Rock on 2–10 September 1863.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} 

In the expedition's order of battle, Colonel James M. True's Independent Brigade included the notation, \"Ill. Battery, Capt. Thomas F. Vaughan\".{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987a|p=461}} On 5 August 1863, Steele began his campaign by marching from Helena to the [[White River (Arkansas–Missouri)|White River]] with two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade. Steele met [[John Davidson (general)|John Davidson's]] 6,000 Union cavalry and the combined 13,000-man force advanced west from [[DeValls Bluff, Arkansas|DeValls Bluff]] on 18 August. True's brigade joined later and increased Steele's force to 14,500 soldiers, of whom only 10,500 men were present for duty. [[Sterling Price]] entrenched most of his 7,749 Confederate troops on the north bank of the [[Arkansas River]], with a weaker force watching the south bank.{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987a|p=457}} 

The Springfield Illinois Light Artillery fought at the [[Battle of Bayou Fourche]] and the subsequent capture of Little Rock on 10 September.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} On the evening of 9 September, Federal engineers began constructing a pontoon bridge at Terry's Ferry on the Arkansas River downstream from Little Rock. The next morning, the bridge was fired on by Confederate artillery, but it was quickly silenced by a converging bombardment by several Union batteries deployed on the north bank. By 10:00 am, Union infantry secured a bridgehead on the south bank and Davidson's cavalry began crossing. Meanwhile, Steele advanced along the north bank with the bulk of his infantry to confront Price's defenses. On the south bank, Davidson's cavalry brigades under [[John Montgomery Glover]] and [[Lewis Merrill]] moved west to Bayou Fourche where [[John S. Marmaduke]] organized a defensive position. Supported by artillery firing from the north bank of the Arkansas River, Glover's brigade turned the Confederate left flank. When Price saw that his north bank defenses were outflanked by the Union advance along the south bank, he ordered Little Rock to be evacuated.{{sfn|Christ|2017}} 

Vaughn's Battery performed garrison duty at Little Rock from September 1863 until March 1864. One section was sent to defend [[Lewisburg, Arkansas]] between 19 October 1863 and 15 March 1864.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} First Lieutenant Stillings resigned on 18 February 1864 and Second Lieutenant Thomas was promoted to fill the vacancy. Another 72 men were recruited into the battery, most of them in December 1863 and January 1864, but several joined the unit in 1865. The wagoner, one sergeant, and one private drowned in the Arkansas River at Little Rock. Others died or deserted. One private was sentenced to [[Alton Military Prison]] on 2 May 1863 to serve out his term of enlistment.{{sfn|Reece|1901|pp=747–749}}      

[[File:Etc 450.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=Color photo shows a domed building.|[[Old State Capitol State Historic Site]] preserves the Civil War era Springfield, Illinois capitol.]]

On 17 March 1864, the Springfield Illinois Light Artillery was reunited and participated in Steele's [[Camden Expedition]]{{sfn|Reece|1901|p=751}} from 23 March–3 May 1864.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} During the campaign, Vaughn's Battery was part of the artillery contingent of [[Frederick C. Salomon]]'s 3rd Division. Steele's effective force numbered 13,000 troops of which about 2,500 became casualties.{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987b|p=368}} There was a skirmish at [[Okolona, Arkansas|Okolona]] on 2–3 April. The [[Battle of Prairie D'Ane]] occurred on 9–12 April.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} Steele's VII Corps seized [[Camden, Arkansas|Camden]] but was unable to maintain its position because Confederate cavalry wrecked two supply convoys at [[Battle of Poison Spring|Poison Spring]] and [[Battle of Marks' Mills|Marks' Mills]]. On 26 April, Steele's force abandoned Camden and marched back toward Little Rock. The Federal column reached  the [[Saline River (Ouachita River tributary)|Saline River]] on 29 April and paused while the engineers built a pontoon bridge across the rain-swollen stream. The [[Battle of Jenkins' Ferry]] was fought on 30 April. Though outnumbered, Salomon's soldiers improvised defensive positions on the south bank and repulsed repeated Confederate assaults during the morning. After the last attack ended at 12:30 pm, Salomon's division withdrew across the river and destroyed the pontoon bridge.

The '''Springfield Illinois Light Artillery''', also known as '''Vaughn's Independent Illinois Battery''' or '''Battery A, 3rd Illinois Light Artillery''', was an [[artillery battery]] from [[Illinois]] that served in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. Organized in August 1862, the unit was first stationed at [[Bolivar, Tennessee]]. In August–September 1863 the battery participated in [[Frederick Steele]]'s expedition to [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], being engaged at [[Battle of Bayou Fourche|Bayou Fourche]]. In spring 1864, the battery took part in the [[Camden Expedition]], fighting at [[Battle of Prairie D'Ane|Prairie D'Ane]] and [[Battle of Jenkins' Ferry|Jenkins' Ferry]]. The unit sat out the remainder of the war in Little Rock before being mustered out of service in June 1865. 

==Formation==
The Springfield Light Artillery was organized at [[Springfield, Illinois]] and mustered into Federal service on 21 August 1862.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} Thomas F. Vaughn of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] was appointed [[captain (armed forces)|captain]].{{sfn|Reece|1901|p=747}} Vaughn previously commanded [[Battery B, 1st Rhode Island Light Artillery]] from 25 August 1861{{sfn|Rhodes|1894|p=20}} until 1 December 1861 when he resigned his commission.{{sfn|Rhodes|1894|p=52}} Vaughn led the Rhode Island battery at the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff]] where the unit suffered the loss of one gun and several casualties.{{sfn|Rhodes|1894|p=37}} The other officers of the Springfield Light Artillery were [[First Lieutenant]]s Edward B. Stillings and Henry D. Colby, both from Springfield, and [[Second Lieutenant]]s Charles W. Thomas of [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]] and Louis D. Rosette of Springfield. Rank and file included [[Sergeant Major]] Louis B. Smith, [[First Sergeant]] Alexander Busby, and [[Quartermaster Sergeant]] William E. Fitzhugh, all of Springfield, five [[sergeant]]s (three from Springfield, two from [[Wenona, Illinois|Wenona]]), 12 [[corporal]]s (six from Wenona, four from Springfield, two from [[Magnolia, Illinois|Magnolia]]), one [[Standard-bearer|guidon]] bearer, one [[bugler]], one [[Wagon master|wagoner]], five [[Armed-forces artificer|artificers]], and 93 [[private (rank)|privates]].{{sfn|Reece|1901|pp=747–749}} 

According to a July 1863 report, the battery was armed with six [[14-pounder James rifle]]s. At that time, the battery reported having the following 3.80-inch ammunition on hand: 180 Hotchkiss [[canister shot]], 36 Tatham's canister shot, 30 James canister shot, 250 James [[solid shot]], and 451 James [[shell (projectile)|common shell]]. The battery originally included a section (two guns) of [[M1841 12-pounder howitzer]]s, so that it also reported having the following 12-pounder smoothbore ammunition: 72 common shell, 42 [[shrapnel shell|spherical case]], and 50 canister shot. In the ordnance tables, the battery was referred to as Company A, 3rd Illinois Light Artillery, though there were no other companies (B, C, D, etc.) listed under the 3rd regiment.{{sfn|Swain|2015}}

==Organizations==
The Springfield Light Artillery remained on duty at Camp Butler near Springfield from August until 1 November 1862. The battery traveled to Bolivar, Tennessee on 1–8 November where it was attached to the District of [[Jackson, Tennessee]] in the original [[XIII Corps (Union Army)|XIII Corps]], [[Army of the Tennessee]]. From December 1862 to March 1863, Vaughn's Illinois Battery defended the Post of Bolivar, District of Jackson, [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]]. In March–May 1863, the battery was part of the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, XVI Corps. In May–August 1863, it transferred to the 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division, XVI Corps. Vaughn's Battery was assigned to True's Brigade, Arkansas Expedition in September 1863. The battery was part of Artillery, 2nd Division, [[Army of Arkansas]] from September 1863 to January 1864. The unit formed part of Artillery, 2nd Division, [[VII Corps (Union Army)|VII Corps]], Department of Arkansas in January–March 1864. The Springfield Light Artillery was in the 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, VII Corps in March–April 1864. The unit was reassigned to Artillery, 3rd Division, VII Corps in April–May 1864. Vaughn's Battery was part of Artillery, 1st Division, VII Corps from May 1864 to June 1865.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}}

The Springfield Illinois Light Artillery arrived at Bolivar and was assigned to a brigade commanded by [[Mason Brayman]]. On 15–20 December 1862, two sections participated in an expedition against Confederate raiders under [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].{{sfn|Reece|1901|p=751}} Vaughn's Battery performed garrison duty at Bolivar from November 1862 until 18 June 1863. The battery was parceled out to guard the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] with one section each at [[Moscow, Tennessee|Moscow]], [[Collierville, Tennessee|Collierville]], and [[Germantown, Tennessee|Germantown]] through 23 August 1863. The unit traveled to [[Helena, Arkansas]] on 24 August–2 September 1863, then joined [[Frederick Steele]]'s expedition to Little Rock on 2–10 September 1863.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} 

In the expedition's order of battle, Colonel James M. True's Independent Brigade included the notation, \"Ill. Battery, Capt. Thomas F. Vaughan\".{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987a|p=461}} On 5 August 1863, Steele began his campaign by marching from Helena to the [[White River (Arkansas–Missouri)|White River]] with two infantry divisions and one cavalry brigade. Steele met [[John Davidson (general)|John Davidson's]] 6,000 Union cavalry and the combined 13,000-man force advanced west from [[DeValls Bluff, Arkansas|DeValls Bluff]] on 18 August. True's brigade joined later and increased Steele's force to 14,500 soldiers, of whom only 10,500 men were present for duty. [[Sterling Price]] entrenched most of his 7,749 Confederate troops on the north bank of the [[Arkansas River]], with a weaker force watching the south bank.{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987a|p=457}} 

The Springfield Illinois Light Artillery fought at the [[Battle of Bayou Fourche]] and the subsequent capture of Little Rock on 10 September.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} On the evening of 9 September, Federal engineers began constructing a pontoon bridge at Terry's Ferry on the Arkansas River downstream from Little Rock. The next morning, the bridge was fired on by Confederate artillery, but it was quickly silenced by a converging bombardment by several Union batteries deployed on the north bank. By 10:00 am, Union infantry secured a bridgehead on the south bank and Davidson's cavalry began crossing. Meanwhile, Steele advanced along the north bank with the bulk of his infantry to confront Price's defenses. On the south bank, Davidson's cavalry brigades under [[John Montgomery Glover]] and [[Lewis Merrill]] moved west to Bayou Fourche where [[John S. Marmaduke]] organized a defensive position. Supported by artillery firing from the north bank of the Arkansas River, Glover's brigade turned the Confederate left flank. When Price saw that his north bank defenses were outflanked by the Union advance along the south bank, he ordered Little Rock to be evacuated.{{sfn|Christ|2017}} 

Vaughn's Battery performed garrison duty at Little Rock from September 1863 until March 1864. One section was sent to defend [[Lewisburg, Arkansas]] between 19 October 1863 and 15 March 1864.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} First Lieutenant Stillings resigned on 18 February 1864 and Second Lieutenant Thomas was promoted to fill the vacancy. Another 72 men were recruited into the battery, most of them in December 1863 and January 1864, but several joined the unit in 1865. The wagoner, one sergeant, and one private drowned in the Arkansas River at Little Rock. Others died or deserted. One private was sentenced to [[Alton Military Prison]] on 2 May 1863 to serve out his term of enlistment.{{sfn|Reece|1901|pp=747–749}}      

[[File:Etc 450.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=Color photo shows a domed building.|[[Old State Capitol State Historic Site]] preserves the Civil War era Springfield, Illinois capitol.]]

On 17 March 1864, the Springfield Illinois Light Artillery was reunited and participated in Steele's [[Camden Expedition]]{{sfn|Reece|1901|p=751}} from 23 March–3 May 1864.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} During the campaign, Vaughn's Battery was part of the artillery contingent of [[Frederick C. Salomon]]'s 3rd Division. Steele's effective force numbered 13,000 troops of which about 2,500 became casualties.{{sfn|Battles & Leaders|1987b|p=368}} There was a skirmish at [[Okolona, Arkansas|Okolona]] on 2–3 April. The [[Battle of Prairie D'Ane]] occurred on 9–12 April.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} Steele's VII Corps seized [[Camden, Arkansas|Camden]] but was unable to maintain its position because Confederate cavalry wrecked two supply convoys at [[Battle of Poison Spring|Poison Spring]] and [[Battle of Marks' Mills|Marks' Mills]]. On 26 April, Steele's force abandoned Camden and marched back toward Little Rock. The Federal column reached  the [[Saline River (Ouachita River tributary)|Saline River]] on 29 April and paused while the engineers built a pontoon bridge across the rain-swollen stream. The [[Battle of Jenkins' Ferry]] was fought on 30 April. Though outnumbered, Salomon's soldiers improvised defensive positions on the south bank and repulsed repeated Confederate assaults during the morning. After the last attack ended at 12:30 pm, Salomon's division withdrew across the river and destroyed the pontoon bridge. The Federals reported 63 killed, 413 wounded, and 45 missing, while Confederate returns showed 86 killed, 356 wounded, and one missing. Steele's force continued its retreat to Little Rock.{{sfn|Clements|2017}}  

Vaughn's Battery was on garrison duty at Little Rock from May 1864 to June 1865.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}} First Lieutenant Colby resigned on 28 June 1864 and Second Lieutenants Rosette and John Schaefer of Wenona were promoted to first lieutenant. Second Lieutenant James Irwin of [[Chatham, Illinois|Chatham]] was promoted to first lieutenant on 19 July 1864. First Lieutenant Thomas resigned on 17 September 1864. The other new second lieutenants were Ward Bertram and Albert Flood of Springfield and William M. Gillmore of Wenona.{{sfn|Reece|1901|p=747}} The battery was ordered to Springfield, Illinois on 25 June and mustered out 30 June 1865. During its service one enlisted man was killed in battle and 22 enlisted men died by disease.{{sfn|Dyer|1908}}

'''WLTX''', [[virtual channel]] 19 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 15), is a [[CBS]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Columbia, South Carolina]], United States. The station is owned by [[Tegna Inc.]] WLTX's studios are located on Garners Ferry Road ([[U.S. Route 76 in South Carolina|US 76]]–[[U.S. Route 378|378]]) in southeastern Columbia, and its transmitter is located on Screaming Eagle Road (southeast of [[Interstate 20 in South Carolina|I-20]]) in rural northeast [[Richland County, South Carolina|Richland County]]. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is available on [[Spectrum (cable service)|Charter Spectrum]] channel 9 in both [[standard-definition television|standard]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]].

==History==
The station first signed on the air on September 1, 1953 as '''WNOK-TV''', originally broadcasting on UHF channel 67. It is the second oldest continuously operating television station in South Carolina, having signed on two months before [[WIS (TV)|WIS-TV]] (channel 10). The station has always been a CBS affiliate, but carried a secondary affiliation with the [[DuMont Television Network]] until 1955, one year before that network ceased operations. The station originally maintained studio facilities located in the Jefferson Hotel in downtown Columbia, where it was based alongside sister radio property WNOK (1230 AM, now [[WPCO]], and [[WNOK|104.7 FM]]). On June 30, 1961, the station switched channel positions, moving to UHF channel 19. In June 1967, WNOK-AM-FM-TV moved to a new studio facility on Garners Ferry Road, located {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of downtown Columbia and {{convert|1|mi|km}} from [[Interstate 77|I-77]] and the campus of the [[University of South Carolina]] School of Medicine. In 1977, the station was sold to Lewis Broadcasting and changed its call letters to '''WLTX'''.

Historically, channel 19 was well behind long-dominant WIS in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], especially in news programming. This was partly because the station was hampered by a weak signal. Although channel 19 decently covered Columbia itself as well as [[Lexington County|Lexington]] and [[Sumter County, South Carolina|Sumter]] counties, it was practically unviewable in the outlying areas of the market. Until cable television arrived in the Columbia market in the 1970s, viewers in the outlying portions of the market had to rely on [[broadcast range|grade B]] signals from [[WRDW-TV]] in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] or [[WBTV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. However, in 1985, WLTX activated a new tall transmission tower in Lugoff that nearly doubled the station's signal and expanded its over-the-air coverage to 24 counties.

[[Image:Logo WLTX .png|145px|thumb|left|WLTX's logo before 1999.]]
In January 1995, WLTX became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]); it carried the network's programming on a secondary basis during weekend afternoon timeslots when CBS had only limited sports programming (namely [[PGA Tour on CBS|PGA Tour]] golf, tennis, [[NASCAR on CBS|NASCAR]] [[auto racing]], and an expanded [[College Basketball on CBS|college basketball]] schedule). The station dropped UPN programming after [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]]-licensed WQHB (channel 63, now a primary [[The CW|CW]] and secondary [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate) signed on in September 1997.

In 1998, Lewis Broadcasting sold WLTX to the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]]. Gannett invested heavily in WLTX, doubling the size of the station in 2001 and providing the staff with all new news gathering equipment. Soon after taking control, Gannett hired longtime WIS meteorologist Jim Gandy to serve as the station's chief meteorologist; however since Gandy was initially prohibited from appearing on the station's newscasts until a one-year [[non-compete clause]] in his WIS contract expired, Gannett used him as a consultant at WLTX and to serve as a substitute meteorologist at the company's other stations, including [[WXIA-TV]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2002, WLTX became the flagship broadcaster of the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].

In May 2002, the station was the first commercial station in Columbia to broadcast in digital. WLTX's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf</ref>

WLTX carries The Justice Network on 19.2 and carries a 24/7 weather channel, which used to be called ''News 19 Weather NOW'', under its affiliation with [[The Local AccuWeather Channel]] from 2005 until 2013, when it changed affiliations to [[WeatherNation TV]] and was renamed to ''News 19 WeatherNation''.

The station has been able to take advantage of multi-casting and high-definition broadcast technology to air various special events, including the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament]]. In fact, WLTX was one of the few stations in the United States to use digital technology to broadcast all games of March Madness using all digital channels.

==Programming==
WLTX carries the entire CBS network schedule. It airs the ''[[CBS Dream Team]]'' block two hours earlier (although the third hour of the block is aired by the station on Sunday mornings) and ''[[CBS This Morning#Saturday edition|CBS This Morning Saturday]]'' two hours later on Saturday mornings than most CBS stations in the time zone. [[Broadcast syndication|Syndicated]] programs broadcast by WLTX include ''[[Inside Edition]]'', ''[[The Doctors (talk show)|The Doctors]]'', and ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]''.

WLTX presently broadcasts 30½ hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 5½ hours on weekdays, two hours on Saturdays and one hour on Sundays).

For most of its history, WLTX has been a solid, if usually distant, runner-up to WIS. Indeed, for a time in the 1980s, WLTX didn't air a newscast at 11 p.m., even after activating its new tower. However, in recent years, WLTX has taken the lead at noon due to having [[CBS Daytime]] as a lead-in, and has frequently traded the lead in the early morning timeslot with WIS.

During the early 1990s, WLTX launched a weekly news segment titled \"News 19: Player of the Week,\" which recognized the accomplishments of high school student athletes in the classroom and in their sport. Future NBA star [[Ray Allen]] won the award several times while playing at Hillcrest High School (now Hillcrest Middle School) in [[Dalzell, South Carolina|Dalzell]]. After being acquired by Gannett, the station also debuted feature segments for its newscast such as \"On Your Side\", \"Restaurant Report Card\" and \"Big Money Monday.\"

In 2001, WLTX premiered a half-hour 7:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast. WLTX's popular morning anchor team of J.R. Berry and Darci Strickland were promoted to anchoring the evening newscasts that year. During the May 2007 ratings period, WLTX's midday newscast continued to place at #1 in the noon timeslot (traditionally having [[The Price Is Right (American game show)|the same lead-in]] since 1979), while it also won first on weekday mornings during the 5:00&nbsp;a.m. half-hour. On August 20, 2007, WLTX debuted an hour-long 5:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast titled ''News 19: Friends @ Five''; the program won a Southeast Regional [[Emmy Award]] on June 23, 2008, for its innovative approach to connecting with viewers. The station's 11:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast also won an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast\" for the second year in a row. On June 26, 2010, the station's 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast took home an Emmy Award for \"Best Newscast.\"

On January 24, 2011, WLTX became the third television station in the Columbia market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in [[high-definition television|high definition]]. In July 2013, WLTX became the second station in Columbia to expand its weekday morning newscast into the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. timeslot; later on October 5, 2013, WLTX premiered an hour-long Saturday morning newscast at 11:00&nbsp;a.m., becoming the second station in Columbia to air a morning news program on weekends (after WIS).

On January 20, 2015, WLTX was awarded the prestigious [[Alfred I. duPont–Columbia University Award|Alfred I. duPont Award]] for its series of over 40 reports on the dysfunction of South Carolina's Department of Social Services.

'''WLTX''', [[virtual channel]] 19 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 15), is a [[CBS]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] [[city of license|licensed]] to [[Columbia, South Carolina]], United States. The station is owned by [[Tegna Inc.]] WLTX's studios are located on Garners Ferry Road ([[U.S. Route 76 in South Carolina|US 76]]–[[U.S. Route 378|378]]) in southeastern Columbia, and its transmitter is located on Screaming Eagle Road (southeast of [[Interstate 20 in South Carolina|I-20]]) in rural northeast [[Richland County, South Carolina|Richland County]]. On [[cable television|cable]], the station is available on [[Spectrum (cable service)|Charter Spectrum]] channel 9 in both [[standard-definition television|standard]] and [[high-definition television|high definition]].

==History==
The station first signed on the air on September 1, 1953 as '''WNOK-TV''', originally broadcasting on UHF channel 67. It is the second oldest continuously operating television station in South Carolina, having signed on two months before [[WIS (TV)|WIS-TV]] (channel 10). The station has always been a CBS affiliate, but carried a secondary affiliation with the [[DuMont Television Network]] until 1955, one year before that network ceased operations. The station originally maintained studio facilities located in the Jefferson Hotel in downtown Columbia, where it was based alongside sister radio property WNOK (1230 AM, now [[WPCO]], and [[WNOK|104.7 FM]]). On June 30, 1961, the station switched channel positions, moving to UHF channel 19. In June 1967, WNOK-AM-FM-TV moved to a new studio facility on Garners Ferry Road, located {{convert|5|mi|km}} east of downtown Columbia and {{convert|1|mi|km}} from [[Interstate 77|I-77]] and the campus of the [[University of South Carolina]] School of Medicine. In 1977, the station was sold to Lewis Broadcasting and changed its call letters to '''WLTX'''.

Historically, channel 19 was well behind long-dominant WIS in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], especially in news programming. This was partly because the station was hampered by a weak signal. Although channel 19 decently covered Columbia itself as well as [[Lexington County|Lexington]] and [[Sumter County, South Carolina|Sumter]] counties, it was practically unviewable in the outlying areas of the market. Until cable television arrived in the Columbia market in the 1970s, viewers in the outlying portions of the market had to rely on [[broadcast range|grade B]] signals from [[WRDW-TV]] in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] or [[WBTV]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. However, in 1985, WLTX activated a new tall transmission tower in Lugoff that nearly doubled the station's signal and expanded its over-the-air coverage to 24 counties.

[[Image:Logo WLTX .png|145px|thumb|left|WLTX's logo before 1999.]]
In January 1995, WLTX became a charter affiliate of the United Paramount Network ([[UPN]]); it carried the network's programming on a secondary basis during weekend afternoon timeslots when CBS had only limited sports programming (namely [[PGA Tour on CBS|PGA Tour]] golf, tennis, [[NASCAR on CBS|NASCAR]] [[auto racing]], and an expanded [[College Basketball on CBS|college basketball]] schedule). The station dropped UPN programming after [[Sumter, South Carolina|Sumter]]-licensed WQHB (channel 63, now a primary [[The CW|CW]] and secondary [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliate) signed on in September 1997.

In 1998, Lewis Broadcasting sold WLTX to the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]]. Gannett invested heavily in WLTX, doubling the size of the station in 2001 and providing the staff with all new news gathering equipment. Soon after taking control, Gannett hired longtime WIS meteorologist Jim Gandy to serve as the station's chief meteorologist; however since Gandy was initially prohibited from appearing on the station's newscasts until a one-year [[non-compete clause]] in his WIS contract expired, Gannett used him as a consultant at WLTX and to serve as a substitute meteorologist at the company's other stations, including [[WXIA-TV]] in [[Atlanta]] and [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA-TV]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 2002, WLTX became the flagship broadcaster of the [[South Carolina Education Lottery]].

In May 2002, the station was the first commercial station in Columbia to broadcast in digital. WLTX's broadcasts became digital-only, effective June 12, 2009.<ref name=\"Analog to Digital\">http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-06-1082A2.pdf</ref>

In October 2012, Gannett entered a [[Carriage dispute|dispute]] against [[Dish Network]] regarding [[Retransmission consent|compensation]] fees and Dish's AutoHop commercial-skip feature on its Hopper [[digital video recorder]]s. Gannett ordered that Dish discontinue AutoHop on the account that it is affecting advertising revenues for WLTX. Gannett threatened to pull all of its stations (such as WLTX) should the skirmish continue beyond October 7 and Dish and Gannett fail to reach an agreement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Loose|first=Ashley|title=DISH customers may lose Gannett programming, including 12 News KPNX, over AutoHop feature|url=http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|accessdate=October 6, 2012|publisher=[[KNXV-TV]]|date=October 5, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011013154/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/dish-customers-may-lose-gannett-programming-including-12-news-kpnx-over-autohop-feature|archive-date=October 11, 2012|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vuong|first=Andy|title=Gannett threatening to black out stations in its dispute with Dish|url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_21710959/gannett-threatening-black-out-stations-its-dispute-dish|accessdate=October 6, 2012|newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=October 6, 2012}}</ref> The two parties eventually reached an agreement after extending the deadline for a few hours.<ref>{{cite news|last=Warner|first=Melodie|title=Dish, Gannett Reach New Deal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390444897304578044401930225948|accessdate=October 8, 2012|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 8, 2012}}</ref>

A '''burn pit''' refers to an area a deployed military base devoted to [[Incineration#Burn pile|open-air combustion]] of [[waste]]. The phrase \"burn pit\" gained notoriety in the 21st century, especially in U.S. military sites in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. However, this practice was used well before these the [[War on terror|War on Terror]] (2001-present), as a method to produce proper sanitation practices.  Using open-air burning significantly reduces waste, but increase risk of fire and produces noxious fumes<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/13209/chapter/2|title=Read \"Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan\" at NAP.edu|language=en}}</ref>.  Due to modern waste at and around these sites containing significant amounts of plastic and other material which may emit [[air pollution|toxic aerial compounds]] and [[Particulate#Health effects|particulates]] when burned, the burn pits were heavily criticized and resulted in a suit by veterans. Global environmental consciousness has especially criticized these instances of large-scale burn pit operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/PUBLICHEALTH/exposures/burnpits/index.asp|title=Burn Pits|last=|first=|date=2011|website=publichealth.va.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref>

==Use of Burn Pits in the Southwest Asia Theater (Iraq and Afghanistan)==
Since the start of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars in 2001, military bases throughout the region used burn pits as a way to dispose of waste<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/burn-pit-military-lung-disease-thousands-of-veterans-fear-burn-pits-exposed-them-to-lethal-disease-2019-08-17/
</ref>.  In 2010, a large-scale burn pit operation in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], allegedly operated by the U.S. military or its contractors such as [[KBR (company)#\"Burn pits\" lawsuits|KBR]], was reported to have allowed the operation of the burn pits for long periods of time, burning many tons of assorted waste. Active duty personnel reported respiratory difficulties and headaches in some cases while some veterans made disability claims based on respiratory system symptoms allegedly derived from the burn pits.<ref name=\"veterans\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/07/us/07burn.html \"Veterans Sound Alarm Over Burn-Pit Exposure\"] article by James Risen in ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 6, 2010, accessed August 7, 2010</ref>  A Minnesota mother, Amie Muller, was a victim of the exposure and her senator, [[Amy Klobuchar]] (MN-DFL), carried a bill called the “Helping Vets Exposed to Burn Pits Act”<ref>https://www.pinecountycourier.com/single-post/2017/11/11/A-courageous-battle-on-the-homefront</ref> that was passed and signed into law by President [[Donald Trump]] (as H.R. 5895) on September 21, 2018.<ref>https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-signs-h-r-5895-law/</ref>  Through 2019, it will provide $5 million for burn pit research, education and evaluation of the exposure of other U.S. service members and veterans to burn pits and toxic airborne chemicals.<ref>http://bigislandnow.com/2018/09/14/bill-to-fund-military-veterans-clean-energy-programs-passes/</ref>

In the Iraq and Afghanistan incidents of burn pit operation involving the US military, it was reported that every type of waste was burned, including: plastics, batteries, appliances, medicine, dead animals, even human body parts with [[jet fuel]] being used as an [[accelerant]]. Clouds of black smoke resulted.<ref name=\"veterans\" /> According to an Air Force fact sheet, \"Burning solid wastes in an open pit generates numerous pollutants.

Highly toxic dioxins, produced in small amounts in almost all burning processes, can be produced in elevated levels with increased combustion of plastic waste (such as discarded drinking water bottles) and if the combustion is not at high incinerator temperatures. Inefficient combustion of medical or latrine wastes can emit disease-laden aerosols.\"

===Health effects===
In November 2009, at the request of the Veteran's Administration (VA), the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM) began an 18-month study to determine the long-term health effects of exposure to the burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan.

At the request of the VA and the Department of Defense, the Board on the Health of Select Populations of the [[Institute of Medicine]] formed the Committee on Long-term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan which held its first meeting February 23, 2010 - February 24, 2010 in Washington, D.C.<ref>[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/cp/meetingview.aspx?MeetingID=4206&MeetingNo=1 First Meeting of the Committee on the Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan Keck Center of the National Academies], accessed August 8, 2010</ref>

In 2011, the Institute of Medicine reviewed the scientific literature related to the possibility of adverse long-term health effects of open burn pits. The report, Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan<ref>[http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Long-Term-Health-Consequences-of-Exposure-to-Burn-Pits-in-Iraq-and-Afghanistan.aspx Long-Term Health Consequences of Exposure to Burn Pits in Iraq and Afghanistan, accessed July 9, 2015] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531095441/http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Long-Term-Health-Consequences-of-Exposure-to-Burn-Pits-in-Iraq-and-Afghanistan.aspx |date=May 31, 2014 }}</ref> noted U.S. Department of Defense air quality monitoring data measured levels of particulate matter (PM) higher than generally considered safe by U.S. regulatory agencies. It also cited work linking high PM levels to cardiopulmonary effects, particularly in individuals at increased risk due to pre-existing conditions such as asthma and emphysema. They concluded that there is only limited evidence suggestive \"of an association between exposure to combustion products and reduced pulmonary function in these populations.\"

If there is sufficient evidence of a connection between exposure to burn pits and subsequent illness and disability, it might serve as the basis for congressional enactment of a \"presumption of service connection\" similar to that in place for exposure to Agent Orange.

A '''burn pit''' refers to an area a deployed military base devoted to [[Incineration#Burn pile|open-air combustion]] of [[waste|trash]]. The phrase was first used to refer to the common way of getting rid of waste at the U.S. military sites in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]]. However, the practice was used well before these conflicts. Due to modern waste at and around these sites containing significant amounts of plastic and other material which may emit [[air pollution|toxic aerial compounds]] and [[Particulate#Health effects|particulates]] when burned, the burn pits were heavily criticized and resulted in a suit by veterans. Global environmental consciousness has especially criticized these instances of large-scale burn pit operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/PUBLICHEALTH/exposures/burnpits/index.asp|title=Burn Pits|last=|first=|date=2011|website=publichealth.va.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|access-date=2016-07-13}}</ref>

==Use of Burn Pits in the Southwest Asia Theater (Iraq and Afghanistan)==
Since the start of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars in 2001, military bases throughout the region used burn pits as a way to dispose of waste<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/burn-pit-military-lung-disease-thousands-of-veterans-fear-burn-pits-exposed-them-to-lethal-disease-2019-08-17/
</ref>.  In 2010, a large-scale burn pit operation in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]], allegedly operated by the U.S. military or its contractors such as [[KBR (company)#\"Burn pits\" lawsuits|KBR]], was reported to have allowed the operation of the burn pits for long periods of time, burning many tons of assorted waste. Active duty personnel reported respiratory difficulties and headaches in some cases while some veterans made disability claims based on respiratory system symptoms allegedly derived from the burn pits.<ref name=\"veterans\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/07/us/07burn.html \"Veterans Sound Alarm Over Burn-Pit Exposure\"] article by James Risen in ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 6, 2010, accessed August 7, 2010</ref>  A Minnesota mother, Amie Muller, was a victim of the exposure and her senator, [[Amy Klobuchar]] (MN-DFL), carried a bill called the “Helping Vets Exposed to Burn Pits Act”<ref>https://www.pinecountycourier.com/single-post/2017/11/11/A-courageous-battle-on-the-homefront</ref> that was passed and signed into law by President [[Donald Trump]] (as H.R. 5895) on September 21, 2018.<ref>https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-signs-h-r-5895-law/</ref>  Through 2019, it will provide $5 million for burn pit research, education and evaluation of the exposure of other U.S. service members and veterans to burn pits and toxic airborne chemicals.<ref>http://bigislandnow.com/2018/09/14/bill-to-fund-military-veterans-clean-energy-programs-passes/</ref>

===The materials burned and combustion products===
In the Iraq and Afghanistan incidents of burn pit operation involving the US military, it was reported that every type of waste was burned, including: plastics, batteries, appliances, medicine, dead animals, even human body parts with [[jet fuel]] being used as an [[accelerant]]. Clouds of black smoke resulted.<ref name=\"veterans\" /> According to an Air Force fact sheet, \"Burning solid wastes in an open pit generates numerous pollutants.
