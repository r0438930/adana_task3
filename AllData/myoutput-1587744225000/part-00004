The ridges are broad, but are defended by steep valleys. Its summit is the highest point of the range and the [[registration county]] of [[Dumfriesshire|Dumfries]].\n\nWhite Coomb is most easily climbed from the [[National Trust for Scotland]] car park underneath the [[Grey Mare's Tail, Moffat Hills|Grey Mare's Tail]] waterfall, on the A708 from [[Moffat]] to [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]], at NT 186146. The most direct route heads directly west up a steep ridge, but a more comfortable route follows a well built footpath above the north side of the waterfall. Above the waterfall, the fast flowing Tail Burn must be crossed to avoid a long detour; although there are plenty of natural stepping stones, spate or icy conditions may make their use dangerous. From across the stream, the best route through the peat and heather follows the course of a wall leading to the summit of Upper Tarnberry (546 m). From there, the east ridge, which is steep and craggy in places, leads to the broad summit.\n\nAn alternative ascent, described by the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' as one of \"Britain's finest half-day and day walks\", follows the Tail Burn to the outlet of [[Loch Skeen]] before ascending the ridge to Mid Craig, and passing Donald's Cleuch Head to reach the summit. The descent suggested is via Rough Craig and south to join the road and walk back to the start point.<ref>{{ cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/6231584/Britains-finest-half-day-and-day-walks-with-maps.html?image=17 | title = Britain's finest half-day and day walks: 18.
