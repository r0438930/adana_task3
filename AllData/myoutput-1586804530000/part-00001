The [[coalmine]], unlike those in other regions, also had underground workings. After a major disaster \u2013 namely a [[coal dust]] explosion \u2013 the mine was shut down on 1 June 1988.\n\nSince that time, the former coal pits have been redeveloped into recreation areas with lakes, nature areas \u2013 some actually protected by law \u2013 and sporting grounds. Among these areas are ''der [[Borkener See]]'' (Borken Lake) with its nature reserve, ''der [[Singliser See]]'' (Singlis Lake) with [[windsurfing]], and ''die [[Stockelache]]'' (\"Stagnant Puddle\"<!---Yes, really!--->), used as a bathing lake.\n\nOne particular attraction in Borken is the [[Hessian Brown Coal Mining Museum]] (''Hessisches Braunkohle Bergbaumuseum'') which displays the town's coal-mining tradition. Since 2003, an [[open-air museum]], where visitors may learn about \"coal and energy\", has also been open. The museum is also affiliated with a nature conservation information centre for the Borkener See.\n\nBorken's best known landmark is its [[watertower]].\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Geographical location ===\nThe next towns to Borken are [[Fritzlar]] (15&nbsp;km) in the northwest and [[Homberg (Efze)|Homberg]] (15&nbsp;km) in the west.

With the end of the coal stocks, the Stolzenbach mine disaster in 1988 and the Borken Power Plant shutdown on 15 March 1991, this epoch in the region's history, which had lastingly shaped the economy, the landscape and the people, came to an end. Since then, the brown coal mining area has found itself the subject of a restructuring process by a service company.\n\nIn the 21st century, the \"Borkener Seenland\" (\"Borken Lakeland\") and the Hessian Brown Coal Mining Museum turned the landmarks and the legacy, as well as the coal-mining and power plant era into a leisure and museum area.\n\n== Politics ==\n\n=== Municipal council ===\nThe municipal council vote for the last two elections:\n{|class=\"wikitable float-right\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n! &nbsp; ||colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|2006||colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|2001\n|-\n| Party||Percentage || Seats ||\u00b1 Percentage ||\u00b1 Seats ||Percentage || Seats\n|- align=\"right\"\n| [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] || 21.4% || 8 || \u2212 1% || \u00b1 0 || 22.4% || 8\n|- align=\"right\"\n| [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] || 52.2% || 19 || \u2212 2.1% || \u22121 || 54.3% || 20\n|- align=\"right\"\n| [[Free Voters|FWG]] || 26.4% || 10 || \u2212 0.9% || +1 || 27.3% || 9\n|}\n\n=== Mayor ===\nSince the [[World War II|second world war]] Borken have four majors:\n* Heinrich Albrecht (26.

October 1987 till today)\n\nThe mayor of Borken is Bernd He\u00dfler ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]). By the last direct election he reached 60.0%.\n\n=== Town partnerships ===\n\nBorken has a partnership to [[M\u00e9ru]], [[France]] since 1964. This partnership received a donation from the [[German French Culture Foundation]] for exemplary partnership in 1978. In 1999 received the partnership a donation from the [[European Parliament]] with the [[European Diplom|European diplom]].\n\nSince 1989 it gives a partnership to [[H\u00fcttschlag]], [[Austria]].\n\nFor more good relationship to [[Eastern European people]] came in 2001 a partnership to [[Gmina Izabelin|Izabelin]], [[Poland]].\n\nIn the course of the [[German reunification]] said the parliament of Borken in 1991 we should get a partnership with [[Teuchern]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] in the former [[East Germany|eastern Germany]].\n\nThe quarter of Borken [[Gro\u00dfenenglis]] decided in 1970 a partnership with [[Noailles, Oise|Noailles]], [[France]].\n\nAnother quarter of Borken [[Kleinenglis]] decided in 1966 a partnership with [[Haucourt-Moulaine-St. Charles]], [[France]].\n\nThis quarters (Gro\u00dfenenglis, Kleinenglis) where in the years of hers decision independent communities.\n\n=== Coat of arms ===\nBorken's civic [[coat of arms]] might heraldically be described thus: Argent a lion rampant gules, armed Or and langued gules, within, a mullet of six argent.\n\nThe arms were granted in their present form in 1951 after a series of different arms that all featured the lion, the oldest known of which dates from the late 14th century. Later, the lion in the town's arms was the red-and-silver-striped Lion of Hesse (which also appears in Hesse's arms and a great number of civic arms throughout Hesse). Other arms showed a red or blue lion. The star is a medieval symbol used by the Counts of Ziegenhain who held sway in the area in the early Middle Ages.[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/b/borkenh.htm]\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n===''Borkener Seenland''===\nThe \"Stockelache Nature Bathing Lake\", the Singlis surfing lake and the ''Borkener See'' nature reserve use the old coal-mining lands for [[tourism]] with a broad choice of activities ranging from bathing, [[human swimming|swimming]] and diving to [[beach volleyball]], windsurfing and Aqua-Golf, to [[recreation]], [[hiking]], and nature watching.\n\n=== Hessian Brown Coal Mining Museum ===\nThe Hessian Brown Coal Mining Museum, founded in 1992, presents under the theme of \"Discover industrial culture \u2013 experience landscape change\" many exhibits from coal-mining and electrical generation, whose workings are demonstrated for visitors. These exhibits include the underground and above-ground mining of the raw material, brown coal, its use, and the conversion of the former mining lands as the centrepiece.\n\nThe visitor may choose from among four museum areas:\n*In the 3.5 ha experience-oriented \"Coal & Energy\" [[theme park]], rattling excavators, humming turbines and smoking power station kettles show how coal was mined from the pits, and how it was used for energy.\n*A reconstructed gallery displays the miners' work and everyday lives, and shows through original equipment the change in mining procedures.\n*A permanent exhibition presents the 400-year history of Hessian brown coal mining.\n*The \"Borkener See\" nature conservation information centre explains how \"second-hand\" landscapes are fashioned from former [[strip mining]] areas.\n\nThe visitors' mine and the \"mining history\" exhibit are housed in Borken's oldest building, \"Am Amtsgericht\" \u2013 built in 1473 \u2013 in the Old Town. The \"Coal & Energy\" theme park and the adjoining \"Borkener See\" nature conservation information centre are found ''Am Freilichtmuseum'' (\"At the Open-Air Museum\") before the town's gates.\n\n=== Great power plant Borken ===\nThe Borken power plant building, which still stands today is protected as a [[monument]].
