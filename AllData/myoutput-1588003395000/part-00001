It is built on the site of a former [[gravel pit]]s. For many years it was a haven for wildlife but was formally designated as a country park in 1993. Two flooded pits called Todd's Pit and Dickerson's Pit now form freshwater lakes, both being available for fishing, the former for carp, the latter for general silver fish and pike. A smaller pool named Hall's Pool between the pits has a dipping platform, while Deep Pool, the deepest pit in the park lies to the north of Dickerson's Pit.\n\nA network of over two miles of paths leads around the park; many of these paths are suitable for bicycles and wheelchairs as well as those on foot.\n\nThe park's financial future became uncertain when [[South Cambridgeshire District Council]] announced that, due to the 2005 [[Council Tax]] capping, they could not continue to fund the park and were looking for a new body to do so, and that if that was unsuccessful they would close the park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miltonvillage.org.uk/opus1364.html|title=Future of the Country Park|author=Oldham, Paul|date=12 June 2005|accessdate=28 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000734/http://www.miltonvillage.org.uk/opus1364.html|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> A campaign to save the park collected over 10,000 signatures.<ref name=\"smcp\">[http://www.savemiltoncountrypark.com Save Milton Country Park] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070117004812/http://www.savemiltoncountrypark.com/ |date=17 January 2007 }}</ref> In July 2007, the council agreed in principle to hand the management of the park to Cambridge Sport Lakes Trust<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scambs.gov.uk/LeisureandCulture/MiltonCountryPark/News/FutureofthePark.htm |title=Future of the Park |author=Simpson, Helen |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220060231/http://www.scambs.gov.uk/LeisureandCulture/MiltonCountryPark/News/FutureofthePark.htm |archivedate=20 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> which it did on 31 March 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miltoncountrypark.org/opus105.html|title=a new beginning|author=Friends of Milton Country Park|date=31 March 2008|accessdate=3 May 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009182850/http://www.miltoncountrypark.org/opus105.html|archivedate=9 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\">\nFile:Milton Country Park sign.JPG|Entrance to Milton Country Park\nFile:Milton_Country_Park_visitor_centre.jpg|Milton Country Park Visitor Centre with a cafeteria selling snacks\nFile:Milton_Country_Park_Halls_Pool.jpg|Hall's Pool in Milton Country Park\nFile:Milton Country Park - geograph.org.uk - 788504.jpg|Milton Country Park South end of Dickerson's Pit\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Milton, Cambridgeshire}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190616191402/https://www.miltonvillage.org.uk/ Parish council's web site, with information and news]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20190331152753/https://www.milton.org.uk/ Milton Village] \u2013 community based web site including Milton News, a chat list, village diary etc\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160818020714/http://www.miltoncountrypark.org/ Milton Country Park]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160213200200/http://www.cambridgesportlakes.org.uk/ Cambridge Sport Lakes Trust]\n* [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=15391 British History Online \u2013 Milton]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Civil parishes in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:Country parks in Cambridgeshire]]\n[[Category:South Cambridgeshire District]]\n", "name_user": "Wikibeard", "label": "safe", "comment": "Corrected grammatical error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton,_Cambridgeshire"}
