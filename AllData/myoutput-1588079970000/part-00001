The word 'Viking' did not come into general use in the English language until the middle of the nineteenth Century - at about the same time that it was introduced into serious academic literature in Scandinavia - and has since then changed its meaning and been much abused. It must, however, be accepted that the term is today used throughout the world as a descriptor of the peoples of Scandinavia in the period from the late eighth Century until the mid-eleventh Century. To the general public, however, it has apparently two meanings; both are respectable and hallowed in the English language by two centuries of usage. The first is in the sense of 'raider' or 'pirate', the second in the sense of the activities of the Scandinavians outside their own country in that period. It is the latter meaning that has given rise to the useful term 'the Viking Age'. Disregarding the ultimate philology of the word and the history of its use over the centuries, which has been much discussed, it is now in such everyday use by both specialists and non-specialists - however improperly - to describe the Scandinavians of the Viking Age, that it almost impossible to avoid its use in this generic sense. Although it is often appropriate and necessary to use such terms as 'Scandinavian' or 'Norse', as I have done in this book, it is often simpler and less confusing to label something as 'Viking' rather than deal in scholastic circumlocution to placate purists, however justified they may be in their arguments.\" |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2010 |orig-year= |chapter=Vikings |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195334036.001.0001/acref-9780195334036-e-0957?rskey=8P9rGR&result=3 |editor1-last=Rogers |editor1-first=Clifford J. |editor1-link=Clifford J.

Lindisfarne was different. The Viking devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island was reported by the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]], who wrote: \"Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared\".<ref>[[#Jones|Jones]], p. 195. Simeon of Durham recorded the raid in these terms:\n<blockquote>And they came to the church of Lindisfarne, laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted feet, dug up the altars, and seized all the treasures of the holy church. They killed some of the brothers; some they took away with them in fetters; many they drove out, naked and loaded with insults; and some they drowned in the sea.\"</blockquote>\nMagnus Magnusson, ''Vikings!'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nVikings were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies. In medieval English chronicles, they are described as \"wolves among sheep\".\n\nThe first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached a small readership in Britain. Linguistics traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled more Victorians to read the Icelandic Sagas.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and Swedish scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck]] were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian [[Thormodus Torf\u00e6us]], Danish-Norwegian [[Ludvig Holberg]], and Swedish [[Olof von Dalin]] developed a more \"rational\" and \"pragmatic\" approach to historical scholarship.\n\nBy the latter half of the 18th century, while the [[Icelandic saga]]s were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries.\n\nScholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Northern Shores: a history of the Baltic Sea and its peoples |last=Palmer |first=Alan Warwick |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7195-6299-0 |oclc=63398802}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, the history of the Viking Age had largely been based on Icelandic Sagas, the history of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] written by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], the [[Kievan Rus']]<nowiki/>s ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', and ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]''.

They also settled in the [[Faroe Islands]], Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland ([[Caithness]], the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]]), Greenland, and Canada.\n\nTheir [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], [[Old Norse]], became the mother-tongue of present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in [[Jutland]], and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.\n\nIn Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in lowland Denmark. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.\n\nThe sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The [[North Sea]] rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers.\n\n== Probable causes of Norse expansion ==\n{{Norse people sidebar}}\n{{Main|Viking expansion}}\nMany theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the [[Scandinavian Mountains|Scandes]], was possibly influential (this theory regarding overpopulation is disputed).<ref>\"One of the most popular explanations offered for the Viking phenomenon is that overpopulation created a need for more land\u2014especially in mountainous Norway\u2014and thus the Vikings were largely motivated by a desire to colonise. Peter Sawyer, for example, in 1971, said that the first raids on Britain, by the Norwegians, were a byproduct of the colonisation of the Orkneys and the Shetlands, and that the Norwegians were more interested in settlement than in plunder. More recently, however, a couple of problems have emerged with this explanation. For a start, Sawyer in 1982 reneged somewhat by saying that no good evidence exists for any population pressure in the eighth century. Patrick Wormald added that what has been taken for overpopulation was just population concentration due to economic expansion and the mining of iron ore. In a further point, Wormald states that no clear evidence has been found for any Viking settlement until the mid-9th century, some 50\u201360 years after the raids began. Thus, colonisation seems to have been a secondary feature of Viking activity; the success of the raids opened the way for settlement, but were not motivated by it, at least not initially.[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 \"The Vikings&nbsp;\u2013 Why They Did It, from the edited  h2g2, the Unconventional Guide to Life, the Universe and Everything\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101335/http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 |date=18 May 2015 }} (3 July 2000).

Wickham. ''The Long Eighth Century: Production, Distribution, and Demand.'' Leiden: Brill, 2000.</ref> The Scandinavians, like many other Europeans, were drawn to these wealthier \"urban\" centres, which soon became frequent targets of Viking raids. The connection of the Scandinavians to larger and richer trade networks lured the Vikings into Western Europe, and soon the rest of Europe and parts of the Middle East. In England, hoards of Viking silver, such as the [[Cuerdale Hoard]] and the [[Vale of York Hoard]], offer good insight to this phenomenon.\n\n;Ideological model: This era coincided with the [[Medieval Warm Period]] (800\u20131300) and stopped with the start of the [[Little Ice Age]] (about 1250\u20131850). The start of the Viking Age, with the sack of Lindisfarne, also coincided with [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars]], or Christian wars with pagans in [[Old Saxony|Saxony]].

As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. The second case is the internal \"Push\" factor, which coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization of power in the modern-day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.<ref>Barrett, James H. What Caused the Viking Age? Antiquity 82.317 (2008): 671\u201385 [678\u201379]</ref>\n\n;Technological model: This model suggests that the Viking Age occurred as a result of technological innovations that allowed the Vikings to go on their raids in the first place.<ref>Ferguson, Robert.

From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the ''[[Culdee|C\u00e9li D\u00e9]]'' Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.\n[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|upright=1.45|Viking expeditions (blue line): depicting the immense breadth of their voyages through most of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Northern [[Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Arctic]], and [[North America]].

Near the end of Charlemagne's reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as [[History of Normandy#Scandinavian invasions|Normandy]].\n\nThe [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built [[longship]]s used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. [[Rurik]] also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of [[Novgorod]] (which means \"new city\") on the [[Volkhov River]]. [[Rurik Dynasty|His successors]] moved further, founding the early East Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] with the capital in [[Kiev]]. This persisted until 1240, when the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols invaded Russia]].\n\nOther Norse people continued south to the [[Black Sea]] and then on to [[Constantinople]]. Whenever these Viking ships ran aground in shallow waters, the Vikings  reportedly turned them on their sides and dragged them across the shallows into deeper waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The eastern connections of these \"[[Varangians]]\" brought [[Byzantine silk]], a [[cowrie shell]] from the Red Sea, and even coins from [[Samarkand]], to [[Jorvik|Viking York]].\n\nIn 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the [[Battle of Norditi]] (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic [[North Sea]] coast by a [[Frisians|Frisian]] army under Archbishop [[Rimbert]] of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from [[East Frisia]].\n\nIn 911, French King [[Charles the Simple]] was able to make an agreement with the Viking warleader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins.<ref>The material suggesting a Norwegian origin identifies him with [[Rollo|Hrolf the Ganger]], also known as \"Rolf the Walker\"</ref> Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted  his followers and him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore [[fealty]] to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the [[Norman language]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language with Germanic influence), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the [[Norman Conquest]], they became the ruling aristocracy of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo\u2013Saxon England]].\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] in 1030. Although Olafr Haraldsson's (later known as [[Olaf II of Norway|Olav the Holy]]) army lost the battle, Christianity spread, partly on the strength of rumours of miraculous signs after his death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung|Olov Sk\u00f6tkonung]] ({{circa|995\u20131020}}) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted until the 12th century. Olof being the last king in Scandinavia to adopt a Christianity marked a definite end to the [[viking age]].\n\nThe end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i]]), who was defeated by Saxon King [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066 at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]; in Ireland, the capture of [[Dublin]] by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] and his [[Normans in Ireland|Hiberno-Norman]] forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson]] at the [[Battle of Largs]] by troops loyal to [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of [[Normandy]]. Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the [[Norsemen|Norse]] between the 13th and the 15th centuries; the [[Western Isles]] and the [[Isle of Man]] remained under Scandinavian authority until 1266.

The raiders killed the monks and captured the valuables. The raid marks the beginning of the \"Viking Age of Invasion\", made possible by the Viking longship. Great but sporadic violence occurred from the last decade of the eighth century on England's northern and eastern shores; Viking raids continued on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been  involved. The Norwegians raided during the winter of 840\u2013841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland. In 850, Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the [[Isle of Thanet|island of Thanet]], [[Kent]]. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 13</ref>\n\n[[File:England diocese map pre-925.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Anglo-Saxon [[diocese]]s before 925: Normal diocesan life was greatly disrupted in England during the Viking Age.]]\nThe following year, the [[Great Heathen Army]], led by brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] and [[Ubba]]), and also by another Viking [[Guthrum]], arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing the Viking community of Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing [[Danelaw]], after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, who installed an Englishman, [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]], as a puppet king. By 870, the \"Great Summer Army\" arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called [[Bagsecg]] and his five [[earl]]s. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg's forces, and Halfdan's forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex]] managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England in 947 when [[Eric Bloodaxe]] captured York.\n\n[[File:07Kbh Mus Drachenkopf 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fire-gilded [[European dragon|dragon's head]] from Ireland, found in a Viking grave at [[Stavanger]], Norway ([[Nationalmuseet]], Copenhagen)]]\nIn 1003, the Danish King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] started a series of raids against England.

The death in the battle of King [[Harald Hardrada]] of Norway ended any hope of reviving Cnut's [[North Sea Empire]]; it is because of this, rather than the Norman conquest, that 1066 is often taken as the end of the Viking Age.  Nineteen days later, the Normans, themselves descended from Norsemen, [[Norman conquest of England|invaded England]] and defeated the weakened English army at the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\nIn 1152, [[Eystein II of Norway]] led a plundering raid down the east coast of Britain.<ref>[[#Forte|Forte]], p. 216</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{main|History of Ireland (800\u20131169)|Early Scandinavian Dublin|Norse-Gaels}}\n\nThe Vikings pillaged monasteries on Ireland's west coast in 795, and then spread out to cover the rest of the coastline. The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. By 830, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence. In some cases, they became allies and married each other.\n\nIn 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, as opposed to just touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.\n\nIn 838, a small Viking fleet entered the [[River Liffey]] in eastern Ireland. The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called a [[longphort]]. This longphort eventually became Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford. The Vikings could sail through on the main river and branch off into different areas of the country.\n\nNorwegian Vikings and other Scandinavians conducted extensive raids in Ireland. They founded [[Limerick]] in 812, then established [[Waterford]] in 853, founded the only Viking capital city in the world outside the Nordic countries in [[Dublin]], and founded trading ports in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.\n\nOne of the last major battles involving Vikings was the [[Battle of Clontarf]] on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king [[Brian Boru]]'s army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins, and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.\n\n=== Scotland ===\n{{Main|Scandinavian Scotland}}\nWhile  few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.\n\nIn 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the [[River Tay]] and [[River Earn]], both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom]] of [[Fortriu]]. They defeated [[Uen of the Picts|Eog\u00e1n mac \u00d3engusa]], king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of [[D\u00e1l Riata]], [[\u00c1ed mac Boanta]], along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (The accession of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn]] as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).\n\nIn 870, the [[Hen Ogledd|Britons of the Old North]] around the [[Firth of Clyde]] came under Viking attack as well. The fortress atop [[Alt Clut]] (\"Rock of the Clyde,\" the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] name for [[Dumbarton Rock]], which had become the [[metonym]] for their kingdom) was besieged by the Viking kings [[Amla\u00edb]] and [[\u00cdmar]]. After four months, its water supply failed, and the fortress fell. The Vikings are recorded to have transported a vast prey of British, Pictish, and English captives back to Ireland. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king [[Arthgal ap Dyfnwal]], who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. The fall of Alt Clut marked a watershed in the history of the realm. Afterwards, the capital of the restructured kingdom was relocated about 12 miles (20&nbsp;km) up the River Clyde to the vicinity of [[Govan]] and [[Partick]] (within present-day [[Glasgow]]), and became known as the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which persisted as a major regional political player for another 150 years.\n\nThe land that now comprises most of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] had previously been the northernmost part of the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]], which fell apart with its Viking conquest; these lands were never regained by the Anglo-Saxons, or England.  The upheaval and pressure of Viking raiding, occupation, conquest and settlement resulted in alliances among the formerly enemy peoples that comprised what would become present-day Scotland. Over the subsequent 300 years, this Viking upheaval and pressure led to the unification of the previously contending Gaelic, Pictish, British, and English kingdoms, first into the [[kingdom of Alba]], and finally into the greater Kingdom of Scotland.<ref>The Makers of Scotland: Picts, Romans, Gaels and Vikings, by Tim Clarkson, Birlinn Ltd, Edinburgh, 2013.\"</ref> The Viking Age in Scotland came to an end after another 100 years. The last vestiges of Norse power in the Scottish seas and islands were completely relinquished after another 200 years.\n\n==== Earldom of Orkney ====\nBy the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- ''[[Nor\u00f0reyjar]]''), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- ''[[Kingdom of the Isles|Su\u00f0reyjar]]''\u2014this survives in the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]]) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local [[Gael]]ic population (see [[Norse-Gaels]]) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]], originally captains of ships or ''[[hersir]]s''. [[Earl of Orkney|The Jarl of Orkney]] and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.\n\nIn 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He organised a fleet and was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.\n\n==== Kings of the Isles ====\n{{Main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nIn 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by [[Ketil Flatnose]] to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of [[Harald Fairhair|King Harald]]. His grandson, [[Thorstein the Red]], and [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]], Jarl of Orkney, invaded Scotland and were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and, fearing the bounty on his head, fled to Iceland.\n\nThe Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]. In 1095, the [[King of Mann and the Isles]] [[Godred Crovan]] was killed by [[Magnus Barelegs]], King of Norway. Magnus and King [[Edgar of Scotland]] agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the \"Kingdom of Man and the Isles\", but the [[Inner Hebrides]] came under the influence of [[Somerled]], a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker, who was styled 'King of the Hebrides'. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]].\n\nIn eastern [[Aberdeenshire]], the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near [[Cruden Bay]].<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2008) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes \"'Catto Long Barrow fieldnotes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118120409/http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes#fieldnotes |date=18 January 2009 }}. ''The Modern Antiquarian''</ref>\n\nThe Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay tribute to [[William the Lion]], King of Scots, for his territories on the [[mainland]].\n\nThe end of the Viking age ''proper'' in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to [[Skye]], arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of [[Magnus Olafsson|King Magnus of Man]] and [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri|King Dougal of the Hebrides]]. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at [[Battle of Largs|Largs]], in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Law-mender]] ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the [[Treaty of Perth]].\n\nOrkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King [[Christian I]] pledged them as security on the [[dowry]] of his daughter, who was betrothed to [[James III of Scotland]].

The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates.\n\nThe Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships' negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. The ships were agile, and light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. \"Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.\"<ref>Tignor, Robert; Adelman, Jeremy; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin; Kotkin, Stephen; Prakash, Gyan; Shaw, Brent; Aron, Stephen; Liu, Xinru; Marchand, Suzanne; Pittman, Holly; Tsin, Michael.

Kindle Edition.</ref> The ships' speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of {{convert|14|-|15|kn|km/h}}. The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes, resulting in inferior vessels.\n\nWhile battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.<ref>Foote, P. and Wilson, D.M. (1970)''The Viking Achievement''.

However, already by the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships. This led to the defeat of longship navies in most subsequent naval engagements\u2014e.g., with the Hanseatic League.\n\nExactly how the Vikings navigated the open seas with such success is unclear. While some evidence points to the use of [[Sunstone (medieval)|calcite \"sunstones\"]] to find the sun's location, modern reproductions of Viking \"sky-polarimetric\" navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.<ref>Horv\u00e0th, G. et al.

This is a model of the town of ''Aros'' about 950. The town is now known as [[Aarhus]]]]\n[[File:Model of viking age Aarhus 05.JPG|alt=|thumb|The fortified Viking Age town of Aros]]\nSome of the most important trading ports founded by the Norse during the period include both existing and former cities such as [[Aarhus]] (Denmark), [[Ribe]] (Denmark), Hedeby (Germany), Vineta (Pomerania), Truso (Poland), [[Bj\u00f8rgvin]] (Norway), [[Kaupang]] (Norway), [[Skiringssal]] (Norway), [[Birka]] (Sweden), [[Bordeaux]] (France), [[Jorvik|York]] (England), Dublin (Ireland) and [[Staraya Ladoga|Aldeigjuborg]] (Russia).\n\nOne important centre of trade was at [[Hedeby]]. Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. [[York]] was the centre of the kingdom of [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] from 866, and discoveries there (e.g., a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand and a cowry shell from the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Persian Gulf]]) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the [[Varangian]]s travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\n==Genetics==\nA genetic study published at [[bioRxiv]] in July 2019 examined the population genomics of the Viking Age. 442 ancient humans from across [[Europe]] and the [[North Atlantic]] were surveyed, stretching from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Modern Period]]. It was found that there was a notable foreign gene flow into Scandinavia in the years preceding the Viking Age and during the Viking Age itself. This gene flow entered [[Denmark]] and eastern [[Sweden]], from which it spread into the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. The study also found that despite close cultural similarities, there were distinct genetic differences between regional populations in the Viking Age. These differences have persisted into modern times. Inland areas were found to be more genetically homogenous than coastal areas and islands such as [[\u00d6land]] and [[Gotland]]. These islands were probably important trade settlements. The Vikings were found to have left a profound genetic imprint in the areas they settled, which has persisted into modern times. The genetic data from these areas affirmed conclusions previously drawn from historical and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Margaryan|2019}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n{{Empty section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Scandinavia ==\n{{Main|History_of_Scandinavia}}\nDuring, and as a result of the Viking Age, Scandinavia moved from a loose coexistence of tribes and petty kingdoms to the three Nordic countries that still exist today.\n\n== Settlements outside Scandinavia ==\n;British Isles\n\nEngland\n* [[Danelaw]]\n* [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] ([[York]])\n* [[Cumbria]]\n\nIreland\n* [[Arklow]]\n* [[Early Scandinavian Dublin|Dyflin]] ([[Dublin]])\n* Hlymrekr ([[Limerick]])\n* [[History of Waterford|Ve\u00f0rafj\u01ebr\u00f0r]] ([[Waterford]])\n* V\u00edkingr-l\u00f3 ([[Wicklow]])<ref>Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names</ref>\n* Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r ([[Wexford]])\n\nIsle of Man\n* [[Isle of Man|Mann]]\n\nScotland\n* [[Caithness]]\n* [[Galloway]]\n* [[Kintyre]]\n* [[Nor\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]])\n* [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]]\n* [[Su\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Hebrides]])\n* [[Sutherland]]\n\n;Western Europe\n* [[Normandy]]\n\n;Eastern Europe\n* [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]] (Russia)\n\n;Northern Europe\n* [[Grobi\u0146a|Seeburg]]\n\n;Atlantic\n* [[Faroe Islands]]\n* [[Iceland]]\n* [[Greenland]]\n\n;North America\n* [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse colonisation of the Americas]]\n* [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] (and possibly a larger area called [[Vinland]])\n\n== Old Norse influence on the English language ==\nThe long-term linguistic effect of the Viking settlements in England was threefold: [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|over a thousand Old Norse words]] eventually became part of [[Standard English]]; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin.<ref name=\"Crystal\">Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', CUP, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|0-521-59655-6}}, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Scandinavian words that entered the English language included ''landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting'' and ''steersman''.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used ''sk-'' sounds, such as ''skirt, sky,'' and ''skin''; other words appearing in written sources at this time included ''again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak'' and ''window'' from Old Norse meaning \"wind-eye\".<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as ''to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get'' and ''give''. The system of personal pronouns was affected, with ''they, them'' and ''their'' replacing the earlier forms.

The word 'Viking' did not come into general use in the English language until the middle of the nineteenth Century - at about the same time that it was introduced into serious academic literature in Scandinavia - and has since then changed its meaning and been much abused. It must, however, be accepted that the term is today used throughout the world as a descriptor of the peoples of Scandinavia in the period from the late eighth Century until the mid-eleventh Century. To the general public, however, it has apparently two meanings; both are respectable and hallowed in the English language by two centuries of usage. The first is in the sense of 'raider' or 'pirate', the second in the sense of the activities of the Scandinavians outside their own country in that period. It is the latter meaning that has given rise to the useful term 'the Viking Age'. Disregarding the ultimate philology of the word and the history of its use over the centuries, which has been much discussed, it is now in such everyday use by both specialists and non-specialists - however improperly - to describe the Scandinavians of the Viking Age, that it almost impossible to avoid its use in this generic sense. Although it is often appropriate and necessary to use such terms as 'Scandinavian' or 'Norse', as I have done in this book, it is often simpler and less confusing to label something as 'Viking' rather than deal in scholastic circumlocution to placate purists, however justified they may be in their arguments.\" |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last1= |first1= |date=2010 |orig-year= |chapter=Vikings |chapter-url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195334036.001.0001/acref-9780195334036-e-0957?rskey=8P9rGR&result=3 |editor1-last=Rogers |editor1-first=Clifford J. |editor1-link=Clifford J.

Lindisfarne was different. The Viking devastation of [[Northumbria]]'s Holy Island was reported by the Northumbrian scholar [[Alcuin of York]], who wrote: \"Never before in Britain has such a terror appeared\".<ref>[[#Jones|Jones]], p. 195. Simeon of Durham recorded the raid in these terms:\n<blockquote>And they came to the church of Lindisfarne, laid everything waste with grievous plundering, trampled the holy places with polluted feet, dug up the altars, and seized all the treasures of the holy church. They killed some of the brothers; some they took away with them in fetters; many they drove out, naked and loaded with insults; and some they drowned in the sea.\"</blockquote>\nMagnus Magnusson, ''Vikings!'', p. 32.</ref>\n\nVikings were portrayed as wholly violent and bloodthirsty by their enemies. In medieval English chronicles, they are described as \"wolves among sheep\".\n\nThe first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Pioneering scholarly works on the Viking Age reached a small readership in Britain. Linguistics traced the Viking Age origins of rural idioms and proverbs. New dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled more Victorians to read the Icelandic Sagas.\n\nIn Scandinavia, the 17th-century Danish scholars [[Thomas Bartholin]] and [[Ole Worm]] and Swedish scholar [[Olaus Rudbeck]] were the first to use runic inscriptions and Icelandic Sagas as primary historical sources. During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and Nordic Renaissance, historians such as the Icelandic-Norwegian [[Thormodus Torf\u00e6us]], Danish-Norwegian [[Ludvig Holberg]], and Swedish [[Olof von Dalin]] developed a more \"rational\" and \"pragmatic\" approach to historical scholarship.\n\nBy the latter half of the 18th century, while the [[Icelandic saga]]s were still used as important historical sources, the Viking Age had again come to be regarded as a barbaric and uncivilised period in the history of the Nordic countries.\n\nScholars outside Scandinavia did not begin to extensively reassess the achievements of the Vikings until the 1890s, recognising their artistry, technological skills, and seamanship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Northern Shores: a history of the Baltic Sea and its peoples |last=Palmer |first=Alan Warwick |location=London |publisher=John Murray |year=2006 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7195-6299-0 |oclc=63398802}}</ref>\n\nUntil recently, the history of the Viking Age had largely been based on Icelandic Sagas, the history of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] written by [[Saxo Grammaticus]], the [[Kievan Rus']]<nowiki/>s ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'', and ''[[Cogad G\u00e1edel re Gallaib]]''.

They also settled in the [[Faroe Islands]], Ireland, Iceland, peripheral Scotland ([[Caithness]], the [[Hebrides]] and the [[Northern Isles]]), Greenland, and Canada.\n\nTheir [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]], [[Old Norse]], became the mother-tongue of present-day Scandinavian languages. By 801, a strong central authority appears to have been established in [[Jutland]], and the Danes were beginning to look beyond their own territory for land, trade, and plunder.\n\nIn Norway, mountainous terrain and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. Communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in lowland Denmark. By 800, some 30 small kingdoms existed in Norway.\n\nThe sea was the easiest way of communication between the Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century, Scandinavians began to build ships of war and send them on raiding expeditions which started the Viking Age. The [[North Sea]] rovers were traders, colonisers, explorers, and plunderers.\n\n== Probable causes of Norse expansion ==\n{{Norse people sidebar}}\n{{Main|Viking expansion}}\nMany theories are posited for the cause of the Viking invasions; the will to explore likely played a major role. At the time, England, Wales, and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Overpopulation, especially near the [[Scandinavian Mountains|Scandes]], was possibly influential (this theory regarding overpopulation is disputed).<ref>\"One of the most popular explanations offered for the Viking phenomenon is that overpopulation created a need for more land\u2014especially in mountainous Norway\u2014and thus the Vikings were largely motivated by a desire to colonise. Peter Sawyer, for example, in 1971, said that the first raids on Britain, by the Norwegians, were a byproduct of the colonisation of the Orkneys and the Shetlands, and that the Norwegians were more interested in settlement than in plunder. More recently, however, a couple of problems have emerged with this explanation. For a start, Sawyer in 1982 reneged somewhat by saying that no good evidence exists for any population pressure in the eighth century. Patrick Wormald added that what has been taken for overpopulation was just population concentration due to economic expansion and the mining of iron ore. In a further point, Wormald states that no clear evidence has been found for any Viking settlement until the mid-9th century, some 50\u201360 years after the raids began. Thus, colonisation seems to have been a secondary feature of Viking activity; the success of the raids opened the way for settlement, but were not motivated by it, at least not initially.[http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 \"The Vikings&nbsp;\u2013 Why They Did It, from the edited  h2g2, the Unconventional Guide to Life, the Universe and Everything\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518101335/http://h2g2.com/edited_entry/A330788 |date=18 May 2015 }} (3 July 2000).

Wickham. ''The Long Eighth Century: Production, Distribution, and Demand.'' Leiden: Brill, 2000.</ref> The Scandinavians, like many other Europeans, were drawn to these wealthier \"urban\" centres, which soon became frequent targets of Viking raids. The connection of the Scandinavians to larger and richer trade networks lured the Vikings into Western Europe, and soon the rest of Europe and parts of the Middle East. In England, hoards of Viking silver, such as the [[Cuerdale Hoard]] and the [[Vale of York Hoard]], offer good insight to this phenomenon.\n\n;Ideological model: This era coincided with the [[Medieval Warm Period]] (800\u20131300) and stopped with the start of the [[Little Ice Age]] (about 1250\u20131850). The start of the Viking Age, with the sack of Lindisfarne, also coincided with [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Saxon Wars]], or Christian wars with pagans in [[Old Saxony|Saxony]].

As a result, Viking raiders found it easy to sack and then retreat from these areas which were thus frequently raided. The second case is the internal \"Push\" factor, which coincides with a period just before the Viking Age in which Scandinavia was undergoing a mass centralization of power in the modern-day countries of Denmark, Sweden, and especially Norway. This centralization of power forced hundreds of chieftains from their lands, which were slowly being eaten up by the kings and dynasties that began to emerge. As a result, many of these chiefs sought refuge elsewhere, and began harrying the coasts of the British Isles and Western Europe.<ref>Barrett, James H. What Caused the Viking Age? Antiquity 82.317 (2008): 671\u201385 [678\u201379]</ref>\n\n;Technological model: This model suggests that the Viking Age occurred as a result of technological innovations that allowed the Vikings to go on their raids in the first place.<ref>Ferguson, Robert.

In all likelihood, the beginning of this age was the result of some combination of the aforementioned models.\n\n== Historic overview ==\n[[File:Viking towns of Scandinavia 2.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Viking-era towns of Scandinavia]]\nThe earliest date given for a Viking raid is 789, when according to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', a group of Danes sailed to the [[Isle of Portland]] in [[Dorset]] (it was wrongly recorded as 787).

From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the ''[[Culdee|C\u00e9li D\u00e9]]'' Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.\n[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|upright=1.45|Viking expeditions (blue line): depicting the immense breadth of their voyages through most of [[Europe]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], Northern [[Africa]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Arctic]], and [[North America]].

Near the end of Charlemagne's reign (and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons), a string of Norse raids began, culminating in a gradual Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as [[History of Normandy#Scandinavian invasions|Normandy]].\n\nThe [[clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built [[longship]]s used by the Scandinavians were uniquely suited to both deep and shallow waters. They extended the reach of Norse raiders, traders, and settlers along coastlines and along the major river valleys of north-western Europe. [[Rurik]] also expanded to the east, and in 859 became ruler either by conquest or invitation by local people of the city of [[Novgorod]] (which means \"new city\") on the [[Volkhov River]]. [[Rurik Dynasty|His successors]] moved further, founding the early East Slavic state of [[Kievan Rus']] with the capital in [[Kiev]]. This persisted until 1240, when the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongols invaded Russia]].\n\nOther Norse people continued south to the [[Black Sea]] and then on to [[Constantinople]]. Whenever these Viking ships ran aground in shallow waters, the Vikings  reportedly turned them on their sides and dragged them across the shallows into deeper waters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} The eastern connections of these \"[[Varangians]]\" brought [[Byzantine silk]], a [[cowrie shell]] from the Red Sea, and even coins from [[Samarkand]], to [[Jorvik|Viking York]].\n\nIn 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the [[Battle of Norditi]] (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic [[North Sea]] coast by a [[Frisians|Frisian]] army under Archbishop [[Rimbert]] of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from [[East Frisia]].\n\nIn 911, French King [[Charles the Simple]] was able to make an agreement with the Viking warleader [[Rollo of Normandy|Rollo]], a chieftain of disputed Norwegian or Danish origins.<ref>The material suggesting a Norwegian origin identifies him with [[Rollo|Hrolf the Ganger]], also known as \"Rolf the Walker\"</ref> Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted  his followers and him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore [[fealty]] to Charles, converted to Christianity, and undertook to defend the northern region of France against the incursions of other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers not only identified themselves as Norman, but also carried the [[Norman language]] (a [[Romance languages|Romance]] language with Germanic influence), and their Norman culture, into England in 1066. With the [[Norman Conquest]], they became the ruling aristocracy of [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo\u2013Saxon England]].\n\nIn Scandinavia, the Viking age is considered to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the establishment of Christianity as the dominant religion.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking era in Norway is marked by the [[Battle of Stiklestad]] in 1030. Although Olafr Haraldsson's (later known as [[Olaf II of Norway|Olav the Holy]]) army lost the battle, Christianity spread, partly on the strength of rumours of miraculous signs after his death.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Norwegians would no longer be called Vikings. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung|Olov Sk\u00f6tkonung]] ({{circa|995\u20131020}}) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, and he is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted until the 12th century. Olof being the last king in Scandinavia to adopt a Christianity marked a definite end to the [[viking age]].\n\nThe end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III ([[Harald Hardrada|Haraldr Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i]]), who was defeated by Saxon King [[Harold Godwinson]] in 1066 at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]]; in Ireland, the capture of [[Dublin]] by [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] and his [[Normans in Ireland|Hiberno-Norman]] forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King [[Haakon IV of Norway|H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson]] at the [[Battle of Largs]] by troops loyal to [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by another Viking descendant, [[William I of England|William]], Duke of [[Normandy]].

The raiders killed the monks and captured the valuables. The raid marks the beginning of the \"Viking Age of Invasion\", made possible by the Viking longship. Great but sporadic violence occurred from the last decade of the eighth century on England's northern and eastern shores; Viking raids continued on a small scale across coastal England. While the initial raiding groups were small, a great amount of planning is believed to have been  involved. The Norwegians raided during the winter of 840\u2013841, rather than the usual summer, having waited on an island off Ireland. In 850, Vikings overwintered for the first time in England, on the [[Isle of Thanet|island of Thanet]], [[Kent]]. In 854, a raiding party overwintered a second time, at the [[Isle of Sheppey]] in the Thames estuary. In 864, they reverted to Thanet for their winter encampment.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 13</ref>\n\n[[File:England diocese map pre-925.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Anglo-Saxon [[diocese]]s before 925: Normal diocesan life was greatly disrupted in England during the Viking Age.]]\nThe following year, the [[Great Heathen Army]], led by brothers [[Ivar the Boneless]] ([[Halfdan Ragnarsson|Halfdan]] and [[Ubba]]), and also by another Viking [[Guthrum]], arrived in East Anglia. They proceeded to cross England into Northumbria and captured York, establishing the Viking community of Jorvik, where some settled as farmers and craftsmen. Most of the English kingdoms, being in turmoil, could not stand against the Vikings. In 867, Northumbria became the northern kingdom of the coalescing [[Danelaw]], after its conquest by the brothers Halfdan Ragnarsson and Ivar the Boneless, who installed an Englishman, [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]], as a puppet king. By 870, the \"Great Summer Army\" arrived in England, led by a Viking leader called [[Bagsecg]] and his five [[earl]]s. Aided by the Great Heathen Army (which had already overrun much of England from its base in Jorvik), Bagsecg's forces, and Halfdan's forces (through an alliance), the combined Viking forces raided much of England until 871, when they planned an invasion of Wessex. On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the [[Battle of Ashdown]] along with his earls. As a result, many of the Vikings returned to northern England, where Jorvic had become the centre of the Viking kingdom, but [[Alfred the Great|Alfred of Wessex]] managed to keep them out of his country. Alfred and his successors continued to drive back the Viking frontier and take York. A new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England in 947 when [[Eric Bloodaxe]] captured York.\n\n[[File:07Kbh Mus Drachenkopf 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fire-gilded [[European dragon|dragon's head]] from Ireland, found in a Viking grave at [[Stavanger]], Norway ([[Nationalmuseet]], Copenhagen)]]\nIn 1003, the Danish King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] started a series of raids against England.

The death in the battle of King [[Harald Hardrada]] of Norway ended any hope of reviving Cnut's [[North Sea Empire]]; it is because of this, rather than the Norman conquest, that 1066 is often taken as the end of the Viking Age.  Nineteen days later, the Normans, themselves descended from Norsemen, [[Norman conquest of England|invaded England]] and defeated the weakened English army at the [[Battle of Hastings]].\n\nIn 1152, [[Eystein II of Norway]] led a plundering raid down the east coast of Britain.<ref>[[#Forte|Forte]], p. 216</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\n{{main|History of Ireland (800\u20131169)|Early Scandinavian Dublin|Norse-Gaels}}\n\nThe Vikings pillaged monasteries on Ireland's west coast in 795, and then spread out to cover the rest of the coastline. The north and east of the island were most affected. During the first 40 years, the raids were conducted by small, mobile Viking groups. By 830, the groups consisted of large fleets of Viking ships. From 840, the Vikings began establishing permanent bases at the coasts. Dublin was the most significant settlement in the long term. The Irish became accustomed to the Viking presence. In some cases, they became allies and married each other.\n\nIn 832, a Viking fleet of about 120 invaded kingdoms on Ireland's northern and eastern coasts. Some believe that the increased number of invaders coincided with Scandinavian leaders' desires to control the profitable raids on the western shores of Ireland. During the mid-830s, raids began to push deeper into Ireland, as opposed to just touching the coasts. Navigable waterways made this deeper penetration possible. After 840, the Vikings had several bases in strategic locations dispersed throughout Ireland.\n\nIn 838, a small Viking fleet entered the [[River Liffey]] in eastern Ireland. The Vikings set up a base, which the Irish called a [[longphort]]. This longphort eventually became Dublin. After this interaction, the Irish experienced Viking forces for about 40 years. The Vikings also established longphorts in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and Wexford. The Vikings could sail through on the main river and branch off into different areas of the country.\n\nNorwegian Vikings and other Scandinavians conducted extensive raids in Ireland. They founded [[Limerick]] in 812, then established [[Waterford]] in 853, founded the only Viking capital city in the world outside the Nordic countries in [[Dublin]], and founded trading ports in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] in the 9th century. Predominantly Norwegians, and to a smaller extent other Scandinavians, settled down and intermixed with the Irish. Literature, crafts, and decorative styles in Ireland and Britain reflected West Norse culture. Vikings traded at Irish markets in Dublin and solidified Dublin as an important city. Excavations found imported fabrics from England, Byzantium, Persia, and central Asia. Dublin became so crowded by the 11th century that houses were constructed outside the town walls.\n\nOne of the last major battles involving Vikings was the [[Battle of Clontarf]] on 23 April 1014, in which Vikings fought both for the Irish over-king [[Brian Boru]]'s army and for the Viking-led army opposing him. Irish and Viking literature depict the Battle of Clontarf as a gathering of this world and the supernatural, including witches, goblins, and demons. A Viking poem portrays the environment as strongly pagan, with chanting Valkyries deciding who would live and who would die.\n\n=== Scotland ===\n{{Main|Scandinavian Scotland}}\nWhile  few records are known, the Vikings are thought to have led their first raids in Scotland on the holy island of Iona in 794, the year following the raid on the other holy island of Lindisfarne, Northumbria.\n\nIn 839, a large Norse fleet invaded via the [[River Tay]] and [[River Earn]], both of which were highly navigable, and reached into the heart of the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom]] of [[Fortriu]]. They defeated [[Uen of the Picts|Eog\u00e1n mac \u00d3engusa]], king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of [[D\u00e1l Riata]], [[\u00c1ed mac Boanta]], along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The sophisticated kingdom that had been built fell apart, as did the Pictish leadership, which had been stable for more than 100 years since the time of [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts|\u00d3engus mac Fergusa]] (The accession of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn]] as king of both Picts and Scots can be attributed to the aftermath of this event).\n\nIn 870, the [[Hen Ogledd|Britons of the Old North]] around the [[Firth of Clyde]] came under Viking attack as well. The fortress atop [[Alt Clut]] (\"Rock of the Clyde,\" the [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]] name for [[Dumbarton Rock]], which had become the [[metonym]] for their kingdom) was besieged by the Viking kings [[Amla\u00edb]] and [[\u00cdmar]]. After four months, its water supply failed, and the fortress fell. The Vikings are recorded to have transported a vast prey of British, Pictish, and English captives back to Ireland. These prisoners may have included the ruling family of Alt Clut including the king [[Arthgal ap Dyfnwal]], who was slain the following year under uncertain circumstances. The fall of Alt Clut marked a watershed in the history of the realm. Afterwards, the capital of the restructured kingdom was relocated about 12 miles (20&nbsp;km) up the River Clyde to the vicinity of [[Govan]] and [[Partick]] (within present-day [[Glasgow]]), and became known as the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], which persisted as a major regional political player for another 150 years.\n\nThe land that now comprises most of the [[Scottish Lowlands]] had previously been the northernmost part of the Anglo-Saxon [[kingdom of Northumbria]], which fell apart with its Viking conquest; these lands were never regained by the Anglo-Saxons, or England.  The upheaval and pressure of Viking raiding, occupation, conquest and settlement resulted in alliances among the formerly enemy peoples that comprised what would become present-day Scotland. Over the subsequent 300 years, this Viking upheaval and pressure led to the unification of the previously contending Gaelic, Pictish, British, and English kingdoms, first into the [[kingdom of Alba]], and finally into the greater Kingdom of Scotland.<ref>The Makers of Scotland: Picts, Romans, Gaels and Vikings, by Tim Clarkson, Birlinn Ltd, Edinburgh, 2013.\"</ref> The Viking Age in Scotland came to an end after another 100 years. The last vestiges of Norse power in the Scottish seas and islands were completely relinquished after another 200 years.\n\n==== Earldom of Orkney ====\nBy the mid-9th century, the Norsemen had settled in Shetland, Orkney (the Nordreys- ''[[Nor\u00f0reyjar]]''), the Hebrides and Isle of Man, (the Sudreys- ''[[Kingdom of the Isles|Su\u00f0reyjar]]''\u2014this survives in the [[Diocese of Sodor and Man]]) and parts of mainland Scotland. The Norse settlers were to some extent integrating with the local [[Gael]]ic population (see [[Norse-Gaels]]) in the Hebrides and Man. These areas were ruled over by local [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]], originally captains of ships or ''[[hersir]]s''. [[Earl of Orkney|The Jarl of Orkney]] and Shetland, however, claimed supremacy.\n\nIn 875, King Harald Fairhair led a fleet from Norway to Scotland. In his attempt to unite Norway, he found that many of those opposed to his rise to power had taken refuge in the Isles. From here, they were raiding not only foreign lands but were also attacking Norway itself. He organised a fleet and was able to subdue the rebels, and in doing so brought the independent Jarls under his control, many of the rebels having fled to Iceland. He found himself ruling not only Norway, but also the Isles, Man, and parts of Scotland.\n\n==== Kings of the Isles ====\n{{Main|Kingdom of the Isles}}\nIn 876, the Norse-Gaels of Mann and the Hebrides rebelled against Harald. A fleet was sent against them led by [[Ketil Flatnose]] to regain control. On his success, Ketil was to rule the Sudreys as a vassal of [[Harald Fairhair|King Harald]]. His grandson, [[Thorstein the Red]], and [[Sigurd Eysteinsson|Sigurd the Mighty]], Jarl of Orkney, invaded Scotland and were able to exact tribute from nearly half the kingdom until their deaths in battle. Ketil declared himself King of the Isles. Ketil was eventually outlawed and, fearing the bounty on his head, fled to Iceland.\n\nThe Norse-Gaelic Kings of the Isles continued to act semi independently, in 973 forming a defensive pact with the Kings of Scotland and [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]]. In 1095, the [[King of Mann and the Isles]] [[Godred Crovan]] was killed by [[Magnus Barelegs]], King of Norway. Magnus and King [[Edgar of Scotland]] agreed on a treaty. The islands would be controlled by Norway, but mainland territories would go to Scotland. The King of Norway nominally continued to be king of the Isles and Man. However, in 1156, The kingdom was split into two. The Western Isles and Man continued as to be called the \"Kingdom of Man and the Isles\", but the [[Inner Hebrides]] came under the influence of [[Somerled]], a [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] speaker, who was styled 'King of the Hebrides'. His kingdom was to develop latterly into the [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]].\n\nIn eastern [[Aberdeenshire]], the Danes invaded at least as far north as the area near [[Cruden Bay]].<ref>Hogan, C. Michael (2008) [http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes \"'Catto Long Barrow fieldnotes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118120409/http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/11227/catto.html#fieldnotes#fieldnotes |date=18 January 2009 }}. ''The Modern Antiquarian''</ref>\n\nThe Jarls of Orkney continued to rule much of northern Scotland until 1196, when [[Harald Maddadsson]] agreed to pay tribute to [[William the Lion]], King of Scots, for his territories on the [[mainland]].\n\nThe end of the Viking age ''proper'' in Scotland is generally considered to be in 1266. In 1263, King Haakon IV of Norway, in retaliation for a Scots expedition to [[Skye]], arrived on the west coast with a fleet from Norway and Orkney. His fleet linked up with those of [[Magnus Olafsson|King Magnus of Man]] and [[Dubhghall mac Ruaidhri|King Dougal of the Hebrides]]. After peace talks failed, his forces met with the Scots at [[Battle of Largs|Largs]], in Ayrshire. The battle proved indecisive, but it did ensure that the Norse were not able to mount a further attack that year. Haakon died overwintering in Orkney, and by 1266, his son [[Magnus VI of Norway|Magnus the Law-mender]] ceded the Kingdom of Man and the Isles, with all territories on mainland Scotland to Alexander III, through the [[Treaty of Perth]].\n\nOrkney and Shetland continued to be ruled as autonomous Jarldoms under Norway until 1468, when King [[Christian I]] pledged them as security on the [[dowry]] of his daughter, who was betrothed to [[James III of Scotland]].

The Vikings did, however, settle in the south around [[St. David]]'s, [[Haverfordwest]], and [[Gower Peninsula|Gower]], among other places.

While harsh, the land allowed for a pastoral farming life familiar to the Norse. According to the saga of [[Erik the Red]], when Erik was exiled from Iceland, he sailed west and pioneered Greenland.\n\n=== Greenland ===\n[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|The last written records of the [[Norsemen|Norse]] Greenlanders are from a 1408 marriage in the [[Church of Hvalsey]].]]\nThe Viking-Age settlements in Greenland were established in the sheltered [[fjord]]s of the southern and western coast. They settled in three separate areas along roughly {{convert|650|km|nmi smi|abbr=on|lk=out}} of the western coast. While harsh, the [[microclimate]]s along some fjords allowed for a pastoral lifestyle similar to that of Iceland, until the climate changed for the worse with the [[Little Ice Age#Dating|Little Ice Age]] around 1400.<ref>see also [[History of Greenland#Norse failure]].</ref>\n* The [[Eastern Settlement]]: The remains of about 450 farms have been found here.

It has been extensively excavated by archaeologists.\n\n=== Kvenland ===\n{{Main|Kvenland}}\nKvenland, known as Cwenland, K\u00e6nland, and similar terms in medieval sources, is an ancient name for an area in Scandinavia and [[Fennoscandia]]. A contemporary reference to Kvenland is provided in an [[Old English]] account written in the 9th century. It used the information provided by the Norwegian adventurer and traveller named [[Ohthere of H\u00e5logaland|Ohthere]]. Kvenland, in that or close to that spelling, is also known from [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] sources, primarily Icelandic, but also one that was possibly written in the modern-day area of Norway.\n\nAll the remaining Nordic sources discussing Kvenland, using that or close to that spelling, date to the 12th and 13th centuries, but some of them\u2014in part at least\u2014are believed to be rewrites of older texts.

They were carried out primarily in the summer, as the Vikings wintered in Scandinavia. Several coastal areas were lost to [[Francia]] during the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (814\u2013840). But the Vikings took advantage of the quarrels in the royal family caused after the death of Louis the Pious to settle their first colony in the south-west ([[Gascony]]) of the kingdom of Francia, which was more or less abandoned by the Frankish kings after their two defeats at [[Roncevaux]]. The incursions in 841 caused severe damage to [[Rouen]] and [[Jumi\u00e8ges]]. The Viking attackers sought to capture the treasures stored at [[Monastery|monasteries]], easy prey given the monks' lack of defensive capacity. In 845 an expedition up the Seine reached [[Paris]]. The presence of [[French denier|Carolingian ''deniers'']] of ''ca'' 847, found in 1871 among a hoard at Mullaghboden, County Limerick, where coins were neither minted nor normally used in trade, probably represents booty from the raids of 843\u2013846.<ref>[[#Hall|Hall]], p. 17</ref>\n\nHowever, from 885 to 886, [[Odo of France|Odo of Paris]] (Eudes de Paris) [[Siege of Paris (885\u2013886)|succeeded in defending Paris]] against Viking raiders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Odo_of_West_Francia/|title=Odo of West Francia|last=|first=|date=|website=Ancient History Encyclopaedia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> His military success allowed him to replace the Carolingians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/globetrotting-vikings-to-the-gates-of-paris|title=Globetrotting Vikings: To the Gates of Paris|last=|first=|date=|website=History Channel|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 911, a band of Viking warriors attempted to siege Chartres but was defeated by [[Robert I of France]].

The Vikings were competent sailors, adept in land warfare as well as at sea, and they often struck at accessible and poorly defended targets, usually with near impunity. The effectiveness of these tactics earned Vikings a formidable reputation as raiders and pirates.\n\nThe Vikings used their longships to travel vast distances and attain certain tactical advantages in battle. They could perform highly efficient hit-and-run attacks, in which they quickly approached a target, then left as rapidly as possible before a counter-offensive could be launched. Because of the ships' negligible draft, the Vikings could sail in shallow waters, allowing them to invade far inland along rivers. The ships were agile, and light enough to be carried over land from one river system to another. \"Under sail, the same boats could tackle open water and cross the unexplored wastes of the North Atlantic.\"<ref>Tignor, Robert; Adelman, Jeremy; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin; Kotkin, Stephen; Prakash, Gyan; Shaw, Brent; Aron, Stephen; Liu, Xinru; Marchand, Suzanne; Pittman, Holly; Tsin, Michael.

Kindle Edition.</ref> The ships' speed was also prodigious for the time, estimated at a maximum of {{convert|14|-|15|kn|km/h}}. The use of the longships ended when technology changed, and ships began to be constructed using saws instead of axes, resulting in inferior vessels.\n\nWhile battles at sea were rare, they would occasionally occur when Viking ships attempted to board European merchant vessels in Scandinavian waters. When larger scale battles ensued, Viking crews would rope together all nearby ships and slowly proceed towards the enemy targets. While advancing, the warriors hurled spears, arrows, and other projectiles at the opponents. When the ships were sufficiently close, melee combat would ensue using axes, swords, and spears until the enemy ship could be easily boarded. The roping technique allowed Viking crews to remain strong in numbers and act as a unit, but this uniformity also created problems. A Viking ship in the line could not retreat or pursue hostiles without breaking the formation and cutting the ropes, which weakened the overall Viking fleet and was a burdensome task to perform in the heat of battle. In general, these tactics enabled Vikings to quickly destroy the meagre opposition posted during raids.<ref>Foote, P. and Wilson, D.M. (1970)''The Viking Achievement''. Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd. {{ISBN|0-283-35499-2}}. pp. 282\u201385.</ref>\n\nTogether with an increasing centralisation of government in the Scandinavian countries, the old system of ''[[leidang]]'' \u2014 a fleet mobilisation system, where every ''skipreide'' (ship community) had to maintain one ship and a crew \u2014 was discontinued as a purely military institution, as the duty to build and man a ship soon was converted into a tax. The Norwegian leidang was called under Haakon Haakonson for his 1263 expedition to Scotland during the Scottish\u2013Norwegian War, and the last recorded calling of it was in 1603. However, already by the 11th and 12th centuries, European fighting ships were built with raised platforms fore and aft, from which archers could shoot down into the relatively low longships. This led to the defeat of longship navies in most subsequent naval engagements\u2014e.g., with the Hanseatic League.\n\nExactly how the Vikings navigated the open seas with such success is unclear. While some evidence points to the use of [[Sunstone (medieval)|calcite \"sunstones\"]] to find the sun's location, modern reproductions of Viking \"sky-polarimetric\" navigation have found these sun compasses to be highly inaccurate, and not usable in cloudy or foggy weather.<ref>Horv\u00e0th, G. et al.

Close to the border with the Franks, it was effectively a crossroads between the cultures, until its eventual destruction by the Norwegians in an internecine dispute around 1050. [[York]] was the centre of the kingdom of [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] from 866, and discoveries there (e.g., a silk cap, a counterfeit of a coin from Samarkand and a cowry shell from the [[Red Sea]] or the [[Persian Gulf]]) suggest that Scandinavian trade connections in the 10th century reached beyond [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. However, those items could also have been Byzantine imports, and there is no reason to assume that the [[Varangian]]s travelled significantly beyond Byzantium and the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\n==Genetics==\nA genetic study published at [[bioRxiv]] in July 2019 examined the population genomics of the Viking Age. 442 ancient humans from across [[Europe]] and the [[North Atlantic]] were surveyed, stretching from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Early Modern Period]]. It was found that there was a notable foreign gene flow into Scandinavia in the years preceding the Viking Age and during the Viking Age itself. This gene flow entered [[Denmark]] and eastern [[Sweden]], from which it spread into the rest of [[Scandinavia]]. The study also found that despite close cultural similarities, there were distinct genetic differences between regional populations in the Viking Age. These differences have persisted into modern times. Inland areas were found to be more genetically homogenous than coastal areas and islands such as [[\u00d6land]] and [[Gotland]]. These islands were probably important trade settlements. The Vikings were found to have left a profound genetic imprint in the areas they settled, which has persisted into modern times. The genetic data from these areas affirmed conclusions previously drawn from historical and archaeological evidence.{{sfn|Margaryan|2019}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n{{Empty section|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Scandinavia ==\n{{Main|History_of_Scandinavia}}\nDuring, and as a result of the Viking Age, Scandinavia moved from a loose coexistence of tribes and petty kingdoms to the three Nordic countries that still exist today.\n\n== Settlements outside Scandinavia ==\n;British Isles\n\nEngland\n* [[Danelaw]]\n* [[J\u00f3rv\u00edk]] ([[York]])\n* [[Cumbria]]\n\nIreland\n* [[Arklow]]\n* [[Early Scandinavian Dublin|Dyflin]] ([[Dublin]])\n* Hlymrekr ([[Limerick]])\n* [[History of Waterford|Ve\u00f0rafj\u01ebr\u00f0r]] ([[Waterford]])\n* V\u00edkingr-l\u00f3 ([[Wicklow]])<ref>Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names</ref>\n* Veisafj\u01ebr\u00f0r ([[Wexford]])\n\nIsle of Man\n* [[Isle of Man|Mann]]\n\nScotland\n* [[Caithness]]\n* [[Galloway]]\n* [[Kintyre]]\n* [[Nor\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]])\n* [[Ross, Scotland|Ross]]\n* [[Su\u00f0reyjar]] ([[Hebrides]])\n* [[Sutherland]]\n\n;Western Europe\n* [[Normandy]]\n\n;Eastern Europe\n* [[Gar\u00f0ar\u00edki]] (Russia)\n\n;Northern Europe\n* [[Grobi\u0146a|Seeburg]]\n\n;Atlantic\n* [[Faroe Islands]]\n* [[Iceland]]\n* [[Greenland]]\n\n;North America\n* [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse colonisation of the Americas]]\n* [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] (and possibly a larger area called [[Vinland]])\n\n== Old Norse influence on the English language ==\nThe long-term linguistic effect of the Viking settlements in England was threefold: [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|over a thousand Old Norse words]] eventually became part of [[Standard English]]; numerous places in the East and North-east of England have Danish names, and many English personal names are of Scandinavian origin.<ref name=\"Crystal\">Crystal, David, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', CUP, 2001 edition, {{ISBN|0-521-59655-6}}, pp. 25\u201326.</ref> Scandinavian words that entered the English language included ''landing, score, beck, fellow, take, busting'' and ''steersman''.<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> The vast majority of loan words did not appear in documents until the early 12th century; these included many modern words which used ''sk-'' sounds, such as ''skirt, sky,'' and ''skin''; other words appearing in written sources at this time included ''again, awkward, birth, cake, dregs, fog, freckles, gasp, law, moss, neck, ransack, root, scowl, sister, seat, sly, smile, want, weak'' and ''window'' from Old Norse meaning \"wind-eye\".<ref name=\"Crystal\" /> Some of the words that came into use are among the most common in English, such as ''to go, to come, to sit, to listen, to eat, both, same, get'' and ''give''. The system of personal pronouns was affected, with ''they, them'' and ''their'' replacing the earlier forms. Old Norse influenced the verb ''to be''; the replacement of ''sindon'' by ''are'' is almost certainly Scandinavian in origin, as is the third-person-singular ending ''-s'' in the present tense of verbs.<ref name=\"Crystal\" />\n\nThere are more than 1,500 Scandinavian place names in England, mainly in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (within the former boundaries of the ''Danelaw''): over 600 end in ''-by'', the Scandinavian word for \"village\"\u2014for example ''Grimsby, Naseby'' and ''Whitby'';<ref>\"The ''-by'' ending is almost entirely confined to the area of the Danelaw, supporting a theory of Scandinavian origin, despite the existence of the word ''by'' \"dwelling\" in Old English.\" Crystal, p 25.</ref> many others end in ''-thorpe'' (\"farm\"), ''-thwaite'' (\"clearing\"), and ''-toft'' (\"homestead\").<ref name=\"Crystal\" />\n\nThe distribution of family names showing Scandinavian influence is still, as an analysis of names ending in ''-son'' reveals, concentrated in the north and east, corresponding to areas of former Viking settlement. Early medieval records indicate that over 60% of personal names in Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire showed Scandinavian influence.<ref name=\"Crystal\" />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Cited sources ==\n* {{cite book|last1=Forte|first1=Angelo|last2=Oram|first2= Richard|last3= Pedersen|first3= Frederik|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vEd859jvk0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Viking Empires|publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 2005| isbn= 978-0-521-82992-2|ref=Forte}}\n* {{cite book|ref=Hall|author=Hall, Richard |title=Viking Age archaeology|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7478-0063-7|publisher=Shire Publications}}\n* {{cite book|ref=Harck|author1=Harck, Ole |author2=L\u00fcbke, Christian |title= Zwischen Reric und Bornh\u00f6ved: Die Beziehungen zwischen den D\u00e4nen und ihren slawischen Nachbarn vom 9.
