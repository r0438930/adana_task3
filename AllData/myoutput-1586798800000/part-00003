The tiles must form words that, in [[crossword]] fashion, read left to right in rows or downward in columns, and be included in a standard [[dictionary]] or [[lexicon]].\n\nThe name ''Scrabble'' is a trademark of [[Mattel]] in most of the world, except in the United States and Canada, where it is a trademark of [[Hasbro]]. The game is sold in 121 countries and is available in 29 languages; approximately 150 million sets have been sold worldwide, and roughly one-third of American and half of British homes have a ''Scrabble'' set.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Toys and Games: ''Scrabble'' |website=history.com |url=http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=57162&display_order=4&sub_display_order=4&mini_id=57124 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424165147/http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=57162&display_order=4&sub_display_order=4&mini_id=57124 |archivedate=April 24, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The History of ''Scrabble''\u00ae |website=Mind Sport Olympiad |url=http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/proprietary/scrabble/features/history.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608001552/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/proprietary/scrabble/features/history.html |archivedate=June 8, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=Burkeman>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jun/28/healthandwellbeing.familyandrelationships |title=Spell bound |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2008-06-28 |location=London |accessdate=2009-01-02}}</ref><ref name=tele/> There are approximately 4,000 Scrabble clubs around the world.<ref name=tele>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/3776732/Scrabble-60-facts-for-its-60th-birthday.html|title=Scrabble: 60 facts for its 60th birthday|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|access-date=2016-03-31}}</ref>\n\n==Game details==\n{{Further|Scrabble letter distributions}}\n[[File:Scrabble game in progress.jpg|thumb|A game of English-language Scrabble in progress]]\nThe game is played by two to four players on a square game board imprinted with a 15\u00d715 grid of cells (individually known as \"squares\"), each of which accommodates a single letter tile.

The number of points for each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values.\n\nTiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are {{convert|19|x|19|mm}} square and {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition vary in width up to {{convert|2|mm|2|abbr=on}} for different letters. Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. {{convert|13|x|13|mm|abbr=on}}); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner.

Q is considered the most troublesome letter, as almost all words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German. J is also difficult to play due to its low frequency and a scarcity of words having it at the end.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://scrabblestats.com/?p=105 |title=Letter positions in Scrabble|publisher=scrabblestats.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424075034/http://scrabblestats.com/?p=105 |archivedate=2016-04-24 }}</ref> C and V may be troublesome in the endgame, since no two-letter words with them exist, save for CH in the ''[[Collins Scrabble Words]]'' lexicon.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Alfred Butts letter frequencies.JPG|thumb|right|Alfred Butts manually tabulated the frequency of letters in words of various length, using examples in a dictionary, the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', and ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tierney, John | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/24/magazine/humankind-battles-for-scrabble-supremacy.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | title=Humankind Battles for Scrabble Supremacy|work=The New York Times Magazine|date= May 24, 1998}}</ref> This was used to determine the number and scores of tiles in the game.]]\nIn 1938, the American architect [[Alfred Mosher Butts]] created the game as a variation on an earlier word game he invented, called ''[[Lexiko]]''. The two games had the same set of letter tiles, whose distributions and point values Butts worked out by performing a [[frequency analysis]] of letters from various sources, including ''[[The New York Times]]''. The new game, which he called ''Criss-Crosswords,'' added the 15\u00d715 gameboard and the crossword-style gameplay.

(On ''Scrabble'' boards manufactured by Mattel as well as on the [[Internet Scrabble Club]], rows are lettered while columns are numbered instead.) A play is usually identified in the format ''xy WORD score'' or ''WORD xy score'', where ''x'' denotes the column or row on which the play's main word extends, ''y'' denotes the second coordinate of the main word's first letter, and ''WORD'' is the main word. Although it is unnecessary, additional words formed by the play are sometimes listed after the main word and a slash. When the play of a single tile forms words in each direction, one of the words is arbitrarily chosen to serve as the main word for purposes of notation.\n\nWhen a blank tile is employed in the main word, the letter it has been chosen to represent is indicated with a lower case letter, or, in handwritten notation, with a square around the letter. When annotating a play, previously existing letters on the board are usually enclosed in parentheses.\n\nExchanges are often annotated by a minus sign followed by the tiles that were exchanged alphabetically; for example, if a player holds EIIISTU, exchanging two I's and a U would be denoted as \"\u2212IIU.\"\n\nThe image at right gives examples of valid plays and how they would typically be annotated using the notation system.\n\n[[File:Scrabble-example.png|thumb|An example of a Scrabble game in progress using Quackle, an open-source program. The first few plays are JOKED 8D 50, followed by REV(O)TInG E5 94 and YEX# F4 56.]]\n\nAdditionally, a number of symbols have been employed to indicate the validity of words in different lexica:\n* '''<nowiki>*</nowiki>''' means an illegal, or phony, word.\n* '''<nowiki>#</nowiki>''' means a word valid in games using the British-originated word list ([[Collins Scrabble Words|CSW12]]) only.\n* '''$''' means a word valid in games using the American-originated word list ([[Official Tournament and Club Word List|TWL2]]) only.\n* '''!''' means a word judged to be offensive, and thus valid in tournament games only.\n\n===Sequence of play===\nBefore the game, a resource, either a word list or a dictionary, is selected for the purpose of adjudicating any challenges during the game. The tiles are either put in an opaque bag or placed face down on a flat surface. Opaque cloth bags and customized tiles are staples of clubs and tournaments, where games are rarely played without both.\n[[File:Scrabble 2015.jpg|right|thumb|A game of ''Scrabble'' in [[French language|French]]]]\n\nNext, players decide the order in which they play. The normal approach is for players to each draw one tile: The player who picks the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet goes first, with blank tiles taking precedence over the letter A. In most North American tournaments, the rules of the US-based [[North American Scrabble Players Association]] (NASPA) stipulate instead that players who have gone first in the fewest previous games in the tournament go first, and when that rule yields a tie, those who have gone second the most go first. If there is still a tie, tiles are drawn as in the standard rules.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player draws seven tiles from the bag and places them on their rack, concealed from the other player(s).\n\n====Making a play====\nThe first played word must be at least two letters long, and cover H8 (the center square). Thereafter, any move is made by using one or more tiles to place a word on the board. This word may use one or more tiles already on the board and must join with the cluster of tiles already on the board.\n\nOn each turn, the player has three options:\n* Pass, forfeiting the turn and scoring nothing\n* Exchange one or more tiles for an equal number from the bag, scoring nothing, an option available only if at least seven tiles remain in the bag\n* Play at least one tile on the board, adding the value of all words formed to the player's cumulative score\n\nA proper play uses one or more of the player's tiles to form a continuous string of letters that make a word (the play's \"main word\") on the board, reading either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. The main word must either use the letters of one or more previously played words or else have at least one of its tiles horizontally or vertically adjacent to an already played word. If any words other than the main word are formed by the play, they are scored as well and are subject to the same criteria of acceptability. See [[Scrabble#Scoring|Scoring]] for more details.\n\nA blank tile may represent any letter, and scores zero points, regardless of its placement or what letter it represents. Its placement on a double-word or triple-word square causes the corresponding premium to be applied to the word(s) in which it is used. Once a blank tile is placed, it remains that particular letter for the remainder of the game.\n\nAfter making a play, the player announces the score for that play, and then, if the game is being played with a [[Chess clock|clock]], starts the opponent's clock. The player can change their play as long as the player's clock is running, but commits to the play when they start the opponent's clock. The player then draws tiles from the bag to replenish their rack to seven tiles. If there are not enough tiles in the bag to do so, the player takes all the remaining tiles.\n\nIf a player has made a play and has not yet drawn a tile, the opponent may choose to [[Challenge (Scrabble)|challenge]] any or all words formed by the play. The player challenged must then look up the words in question using a specified word source (such as [[Official Tournament and Club Word List|OTCWL]], the ''[[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]]'', or [[SOWPODS|CSW]]) and if any one of them is found to be unacceptable, the play is removed from the board, the player returns the newly played tiles to their rack, and the turn is forfeited. In tournament play, a challenge may be to the entire play or any one or more words formed in the play, and judges (human or computer) are used, so players are not entitled to know which word(s) are invalid. Penalties for unsuccessfully challenging an acceptable play vary in club and tournament play and are described in greater detail below.\n\n====End of game====\nUnder North American tournament rules, the game ends when either:\n# one player plays every tile on their rack, and there are no tiles remaining in the bag (regardless of the tiles on the opponent's rack)\n# at least six successive scoreless turns have occurred and either player decides to end the game\n# either player uses more than 10 minutes of overtime. (For several years, a game could not end with a cumulative score of 0\u20130, but that is no longer the case, and such games have since occurred a number of times in tournament play, the winner being the player with the lower total point value on their rack.<ref>{{cross-tables player-tournament|pid=560|pname=Marlon Hill|tid=6898|tname=Albany, NY July 2010}}</ref>)\n\nWhen the game ends, each player's score is reduced by the sum of their unplayed letters. In addition, if a player has used all of their letters (known as \"going out\" or \"playing out\"), the sum of the other player's unplayed letters is added to that player's score; in tournament play, a player who goes out adds twice that sum, and their opponent is not penalized.\n\n====Examples====\nPlays can be made in a number of ways (in what follows, it is assumed that the word JACK has been played on a previous turn; letters in parentheses represent tiles already on the board):\n* Adding one or more letters to an existing word, e.g. (JACK)S, HI(JACK), HI(JACK)ING, (JACK)FRUIT.\n* \"Hooking\" a word and playing perpendicular to that word, e.g. playing IONIZES with the S hooked on (JACK) to make (JACK)S.\n* Playing perpendicular to a word, e.g. YEU(K)Y through the K in JACK.\n* Playing parallel to a word(s) forming several short words, e.g. CON played under (JACK) simultaneously forming (J)O and (A)N.\n\nAny combination of these is allowed in a play, as long as all the letters placed on the board in one play lie in one row or column and are connected by a main word, and any run of tiles on two or more consecutive squares along a row or column constitutes a valid word.\n\nWords must read either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. Diagonal plays are not allowed.\n\n===Scoring===\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Premium square colors\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Square !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Original and Mattel version !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Hasbro Version (2008\u20132014)\n|-\n| Double letter\n| style=\"background:#6cf;\"| Light blue\n| style=\"background:#09f;\"| {{white|Blue}}\n|-\n| Triple letter\n| style=\"background:#06f;\"| {{white|Dark blue}}\n| style=\"background:#290;\"| {{white|Green}}\n|-\n| Double word\n| style=\"background:#f9f;\"| Pink\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"| {{white|Red}}\n|-\n| Triple word\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"| {{white|Red}}\n| style=\"background:#f90;\"| {{white|Orange}}\n|}\n</div>\nThe score for any play is determined this way:\n* Each new word formed in a play is scored separately, and then those scores are added up. The value of each tile is indicated on the tile, and blank tiles are worth zero points.\n* The main word (defined as the word containing every played letter) is scored. The letter values of the tiles are added up, and tiles placed on Double Letter Score (DLS) and Triple Letter Score (TLS) squares are doubled or tripled in value, respectively. Tiles placed on Double Word Score (DWS) or Triple Word Score (TWS) squares double or triple the value of the word(s) that include those tiles, respectively. In particular, the center square (H8) is considered a DWS, and the first play is doubled in value.\n* If any \"hook\" words are played (e.g. playing ANEROID while \"hooking\" the A to BETTING to make ABETTING), the scores for each word are added separately. This is common for \"parallel\" plays that make up to eight words in one turn.\n* Premium squares apply only when newly placed tiles cover them. Any subsequent plays do not count those premium squares.\n* If a player covers both letter and word premium squares with a single word, the letter premium(s) is/are calculated first, followed by the word premium(s).\n* If a player makes a play where the main word covers two DWS squares, the value of that word is doubled, then redoubled (i.e. 4\u00d7 the word value). Similarly, if the main word covers two TWS squares, the value of that word is tripled, then retripled (9\u00d7 the word value). Such plays are often referred to as \"double-doubles\" and \"triple-triples\" respectively. It is theoretically possible to achieve a play covering three TWS squares (a 27\u00d7 word score), although this is extremely improbable without constructive setup and collaboration. Plays covering a DWS and a TWS simultaneously (6\u00d7 the word value, or 18\u00d7 if a DWS and two TWS squares are covered) are only possible if a player misses the center star on the first turn, and the play goes unchallenged (this is valid under North American tournament rules).\n* Finally, if seven tiles have been laid on the board in one turn, known as a \"[[bingo (Scrabble)|bingo]]\" in North America and as a \"bonus\" elsewhere, after all of the words formed have been scored, 50 bonus points are added.\n\nWhen the letters to be drawn have run out, the final play can often determine the winner. This is particularly the case in close games with more than two players.\n\nScoreless turns can occur when a player passes, exchanges tiles, or loses a challenge. The latter rule varies slightly in international tournaments. A scoreless turn can also theoretically occur if a play consists of only blank tiles, but this is extremely unlikely in actual play.\n\n====Example====\nSuppose Player 1 plays QUANT 8D, with the Q on a DLS and T on the center star. The score for this play would be (2 \u00d7 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 2 = 48 (following the [[order of operations]]).\n\nPlayer 2 extends the play to ALI(QUANT) 8A with the A on the TWS at 8A. The score for this play would be (1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 3 = 51. Note that the Q is not doubled for this play.\n\nPlayer 1 has DDIIIOO and plays OIDIOID 9G. The score for the word OIDIOID would be (2 \u00d7 1 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 2) = 14. Additionally, Player 1 formed NO and TI, which score 1 + 2 \u00d7 1 = 3 and 1 + 1 = 2 points respectively. Therefore, the sum of all the values of the words formed is 14+3+2 = 19. But since this is a seven-letter play, 50 points are added, resulting in a total score of 69. Player 1 now has a 117\u201351 lead.\n\nThe player with the highest final score wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest score before adjusting for unplayed tiles wins the game. In tournament play, a tie counts as 1/2 a win for both players.\n\n===Acceptable words===\nAcceptable words are the primary entries in some chosen [[dictionary]], and all of their [[inflection|inflected]] forms. Words that are hyphenated, capitalized (such as [[proper noun]]s), or apostrophized are not allowed, unless they also appear as acceptable entries; JACK is a proper noun, but the word ''[[wikt:jack|JACK]]'' is acceptable because it has other usages as a common noun (automotive, [[vexillology|vexillological]], etc.) and verb that are acceptable. Acronyms or abbreviations, other than those that have acceptable entries (such as ''[[AWOL]]'', ''[[RADAR]]'', ''[[LASER]]'', and ''[[Scuba diving|SCUBA]]'') are not allowed. Variant spellings, slang or offensive terms, archaic or obsolete terms, and specialized jargon words are allowed if they meet all other criteria for acceptability, but archaic spellings (e.g. ''NEEDE'' for ''NEED'') are generally not allowed. Foreign words are not allowed in English-language ''Scrabble'' unless they have been incorporated into the English language, as with PATISSERIE, KILIM, and QI. Vulgar and offensive words are generally excluded from the OSPD4 but allowed in club and tournament play.\n\nProper nouns and other exceptions to the usual rules are allowed in some limited contexts in the spin-off game [[Trickster (board game)|''Scrabble Trickster'']]. Names of recognized computer programs are permitted as an acceptable proper noun (For example, WinZIP).\n\nThe memorization of two-letter words is considered an essential skill in this game.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=[Loopful] Two Letter Words Allowed In Scrabble |publisher=Word Buff\n|url=http://www.word-buff.com/two-letter-words.html\n|accessdate=2015-06-08\n }}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:PocketScrabble.JPG|thumb|left|250 px|A near-ending game board, tiles and racks of the magnetic Pocket ''Scrabble'' (International, Mattel, Inc.)]]\n\nThere are two popular competition word lists used in various parts of the world:\n* [[Tournament Word List|TWL]] (also known as OTCWL, OWL, or TWL)\n* [[SOWPODS]] (also called \"Collins\" or \"CSW\")\nThe first is used in America, Canada, Israel and Thailand, and the second in all other English-speaking countries\n\n====TWL, OWL2 and OSPD5====\nThe North American 2006 ''[[Official Tournament and Club Word List]], Second Edition'' (OWL2) went into official use in American, Canadian, Israeli and Thai club and tournament play on March 1, 2006 (or, for school use, the [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] ''[[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]], Fifth Edition'' (OSPD5)). North American competitions use the ''Long Words List'' for longer words.\n\nThe OWL2 and the OSPD5 are compiled using four (originally five) major college-level dictionaries, including Merriam-Webster (10th and 11th editions, respectively). If a word appears, at least historically, in any one of the dictionaries, it will be included in the OWL2 and the OSPD5. If the word has only an offensive meaning, it is only included in the OWL2. The key difference between the OSPD5 and the OWL2 is that the OSPD5 is marketed for \"home and school\" use, with expurgated words which their source dictionaries judged offensive, rendering the ''Official Scrabble Players Dictionary'' less fit for official ''Scrabble'' play. The OSPD5, released in 2014, is available in bookstores, whereas the OWL2 is only available through [[North American Scrabble Players Association|NASPA]]).\n\n====''Collins Scrabble Words''====\nIn all other English-speaking countries, the competition word list is ''Collins Scrabble Words'' 2019 edition, known as ''CSW19''. Versions of this lexicon prior to 2007 were known as [[SOWPODS]]. The lexicon includes all allowed words of length 2 to 15 letters. This list contains all OWL2 words plus words sourced from Chambers and Collins English dictionaries. This book is used to adjudicate at the [[World Scrabble Championship]] and all other major international competitions outside North America.\n\nTournaments are also occasionally played to CSW in North America, particularly since 2010. [[North American Scrabble Players Association|NASPA]] officially rates CSW tournaments alongside OWL tournaments, using a separate rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scrabbleplayers.org/w/SOWPODS|title=SOWPODS - NASPAWiki|publisher=North American Scrabble Players Association}}</ref>\n\n===Challenges===\n{{Main|Challenge (Scrabble)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\nThe penalty for a successfully challenged play is nearly universal: the offending player removes the tiles played and forfeits his or her turn. (In some online games, an option known as \"void\" may be used, wherein unacceptable words are automatically rejected by the program. The player is then required to make another play, with no penalty applied.)\n\nThe penalty for an unsuccessful challenge (where all words formed by the play are deemed valid) varies considerably, including:\n* \"Double Challenge\", in which an unsuccessfully challenging player must forfeit the next turn. This penalty governs North American (NASPA-sanctioned) OWL tournament play, and is the standard for North American, Israeli, and Thai clubs.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because loss of a turn generally constitutes the greatest risk for an unsuccessful challenge, it provides the greatest incentive for a player to \"bluff\", or play a \"phony\" \u2013 a plausible word that they know or suspect to be unacceptable, hoping his or her opponent will not call him on it. Or a player can put down a legal word that appears to be a phony hoping the other player will incorrectly challenge it and lose their turn.\n* \"Single Challenge\"/\"Free Challenge\", in which no penalty whatsoever is applied to a player who unsuccessfully challenges. This is the default rule in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as for many tournaments in Australia, although these countries do sanction occasional tournaments using other challenge rules.\n* Modified \"Single Challenge\", in which an unsuccessful challenge does not result in the loss of the challenging player's turn, but is penalized by the loss of a specified number of points. The most common penalty is five points. The rule has been adopted in Singapore (since 2000), Malaysia (since 2002), South Africa (since 2003), New Zealand (since 2004), and Kenya, as well as in contemporary [[World Scrabble Championship]]s (since 2001) and North American (NASPA-sanctioned) Collins tournaments, and particularly prestigious Australian tournaments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrabble.org.au/ratings/selective/2018AMSC.html|title=Australian Masters and State Team Challenge|website=www.scrabble.org.au|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> Some countries and tournaments (including Sweden) use a 10-point penalty instead. In most game situations, this penalty is much lower than that of the \"double challenge\" rule. Consequently, such tournaments encourage greater willingness to challenge and discourage playing dubious words.\n\nUnder NASPA tournament rules, a player may request to \"hold\" the opponent's play in order to consider whether to challenge it, provided that the opponent has not yet drawn replacement tiles. If player A holds, player A's clock still runs, and player B may not draw provisional replacement tiles until 15 seconds after the hold was announced (which tiles must then be kept separate). There is no limit on how long player A may hold the play. If player A successfully challenges after player B drew provisional replacement tiles, player B must show the drawn tiles before returning them to the bag.\n\n==Club and tournament play==\n{{Main|English-language Scrabble}}\n\nTens of thousands play club and tournament ''Scrabble'' worldwide. All tournament (and most club) games are played with a [[game clock]] and a set [[time control]]. Although casual games are often played with unlimited time, this is problematic in competitive play among players for whom the number of evident legal plays is immense. Almost all tournament games involve only two players; typically, each has 25 minutes in which to make all of their plays. For each minute by which a player oversteps the time control, a penalty of 10 points is assessed. The number of minutes is rounded up, so, for example, if a player oversteps time control by two minutes and five seconds, the penalty is 30 points. Also, most players use molded plastic tiles, not engraved like the original wooden tiles, eliminating the potential for a cheating player to \"braille\" (feel for particular tiles, especially blanks, in the bag).<ref name=\"slate2012\"/>\n\nPlayers are allowed \"tracking sheets\", pre-printed with the letters in the initial pool, from which tiles can be crossed off as they are played. [[Tile tracking|Tracking tiles]] is an important aid to strategy, especially during the endgame, when no tiles remain to be drawn and each player can determine exactly what is on the opponent's rack.\n\nNotable and regularly held tournaments include:\n# ''The [[World Scrabble Championship]]'': held in odd years up until 2013, when it was announced by [[Mattel]] that it would be called the '''Scrabble Champions Tournament''' and be held annually in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wespa.org/news/2013xchampions.shtml|title=WESPA News: Scrabble Champions Tournament Announcement|publisher=WESPA}}</ref>\n# ''The [[North American Scrabble Championship]]'': an open event attracting several hundred players, held around July\u2013August every year or two in the United States.\n# ''The [[National Scrabble Championship (UK)|National Scrabble Championship]]'', organized by the [[Association of British Scrabble Players]] (ABSP) and held every year in the United Kingdom.\n# ''The [[Brand's Crossword Game King's Cup]]'': the largest tournament in the world. Held annually in Thailand around the end of June or beginning of July.\n# ''The [[UK Open (Scrabble)|UK Open]]'': the largest Scrabble tournament in Europe, held annually in [[Coventry]], United Kingdom since 2008.\n\nOther important tournaments include:\n# ''The [[World Youth Scrabble Championships]]'': entry by country qualification, restricted to under 18 years old. Held annually since 2006.\n# ''The [[National School Scrabble Championship]]'': entry open to North American school students. Held annually since 2003.\n# ''The [[Canadian Scrabble Championship]]'': entry by invitation only to the top fifty Canadian players. Held every two to three years.\n# ''The [[Singapore Open Scrabble Championship]]'': international Singapore championship held annually since 1997.\n\nClubs in North America typically meet one day a week for three or four hours and some charge a small admission fee to cover their expenses and prizes. Clubs also typically hold at least one open tournament per year. Tournaments are usually held on weekends, and between six and nine games are played each day.\n\nThere are also clubs in the UK and many other countries. There are a number of internationally rated [[SOWPODS]] tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~rjackman/irsowev.html |title=Internationally Rated SOWPODS Events |publisher=Members.ozemail.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\nDuring off hours at tournaments, many players socialize by playing consultation (team) ''Scrabble'', [[Clabbers]], [[Anagrams]], [[Boggle]], Words with Friends, Scramble with Friends and other games.\n<!--strategy and tactics excised; DO NOT re-add without sources-->\n\n==Computer players==\n[[Maven (Scrabble)|Maven]] is a computer opponent for the game, created by Brian Sheppard.

Play in this system \"encourages elaborate setups often independently mined by the two players\",<ref name=stevena /> and is significantly different from the standard game in which defensive considerations play a major role. While the \"high score\" rule has led to impressively high records, it is currently out of favor.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n* High game score of 1,049 by Phil Appleby of Lymington, [[Hampshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], on June 25, 1989 in Wormley, [[Hertfordshire]], UK. his opponent scored just 253 points, giving Appleby a record victory margin of 796 points.\n* High single-turn score of 392, by Dr. Saladin Karl Khoshnaw<ref name=\"khoshnaw\"/> in [[Manchester]], UK, in April 1982.

Alfapet is now another crossword game, created by the owners of the name Alfapet. A Russian version is called ''Erudit''. Versions have been prepared for [[Dakota language|Dakotah]], [[Haitian Creole]], [[Dakelh]] ([[Carrier language]]), and [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]].<ref>Voinov, Vitaly. 2010. Words should be fun: Scrabble as a tool for language preservation in Tuvan and other local languages. ''[[Language Documentation & Conservation]]'' 4. 213\u2013230.</ref>\n\nFor languages with [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] counted as single letters, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the game features separate tiles for those digraphs.\n\nAn Irish-language version of Scrabble was published by Gl\u00f3r na nGael in 2010. The previous year the same organisation published the Junior version of the game and two years later it republished Junior Scrabble using a two-sided (and two skill level) board.\n\n==Variations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\n{{Main|Scrabble variants}}\n\nThere are numerous variations of the game. While they are similar to the original ''Scrabble'' game, they include minor variations. For example, Literati draws random tiles instead of providing a finite number of tiles for the game, assigns different point levels to each letter and has a slightly different board layout, whereas Lexulous assigns eight letters to each player instead of seven. [[Words with Friends]] uses a different board layout and different letter values, as does [[Words of Gold]].\n\n[[File:ScrabbleDuplicate.jpg|thumb|A duplicate ''Scrabble'' tournament in [[La Bresse]], France]]\n[[Duplicate Scrabble]] is a popular variant in [[Francophonie|French speaking countries]]. Every player has the same letters on the same board and the players must submit a paper slip at the end of the allotted time (usually 3 minutes) with the highest scoring word they have found. This is the format used for the [[French World Scrabble Championships]] but it is also used in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. There is no limit to the number of players that can be involved in one game, and at [[Vichy]] in 1998 there were 1485 players, a record for French ''Scrabble'' tournaments.\n\n{{Interlanguage link|Scarabeo|lt=Scarabeo|it|Scarabeo (gioco)|WD=}} is a variant that is much more popular in Italy than the original game. It features a 17\u00d717 grid of cells and peculiar rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.editricegiochi.it/gioco/12/Scarabeo.htm|title=Scarabeo \u2013 Sito ufficiale |publisher=editricegiochi.it|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn one variation of ''Scrabble'', blanks score points corresponding to the letters the blanks are used to represent. For example, if one played blank to represent a Z, it would get ten; a blank to represent a V or an H would get four; a blank to represent a D would get 2 and blank to represent a T, N, L, S or R or any of the vowels would get one.\n\nPopular among tournament Scrabble players is ''Clabbers''. In Clabbers, any move that consists of anagrams of allowable words is allowed. For example, because ETAERIO is allowable in ordinary Collins Scrabble, EEAIORT would be allowable in Clabbers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Warren|first1=Jane|url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/879354/Allan-Simmons-banned-for-cheating-scrabble |title=Cut-throat world of competitive Scrabble as Allan Simmons is BANNED for cheating|newspaper=The Express|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA junior version, called ''Junior Scrabble'', has been marketed. This has slightly different distributions of frequencies of letter tiles to the standard ''Scrabble'' game.\n\nWord games similar to or influenced by ''Scrabble'' include [[Bananagrams]], [[Boggle]], [[Dabble]], [[Nab-It!]], [[Perquackey]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Quiddler]], [[Scribbage]], [[Tapple]], [[Upwords]], and [[WordSpot]].\n\nThere are also number-based variations, such as [[Equate (game)]], GoSum, Mathable, [[Numble]], Numbler, Triolet, Yushino and Numenko.\n\n==Gameboard formats==\nThe game has been released in numerous gameboard formats appealing to various user groups. The original boards included wood tiles and many \"deluxe\" sets still do.\n\n===Tile Lock Scrabble and Tile Lock Super Scrabble Editions===\nBoth games are made by [[Winning Moves]] and feature smaller, plastic tiles that are held in place on the board with little plastic posts. The standard version features exactly the same 100 tiles as regular ''Scrabble''. The Tile Lock Super Scrabble features the same 200 tiles that are in [[Super Scrabble]].\n\n===Travel editions===\nEditions are available for travelers who may wish to play in a conveyance such as a train or plane, or to pause a game in progress and resume later. Many versions thus include methods to keep letters from moving, such as pegboards, recessed tile holders and magnetic tiles. Players' trays are also designed with stay-fast holders. Such boards are also typically designed to be reoriented by each player to put the board upright during the game, as well as folded and stowed with the game in progress.\n* Production and Marketing Company, 1954 \u2013 metal hinged box, Bakelite tiles inlaid with round magnets, chrome tile racks, silver colored plastic bag and cardboard box covered with decorative paper. The box, when opened flat, measures {{cvt|8+1/2|\u00d7|7+3/4|in|cm}} and the tiles measure {{cvt|1/2|in|mm}} square.\n* Spear's Games, 1980s \u2013 boxed edition with pegboard, plastic tiles with small feet to fit snugly in the pegboard. Racks are clear plastic, allowing some sorting while holding tiles fairly snugly. Set comes with a drawstring plastic bag to draw tiles and a cardboard box. It is possible to save a game in progress by returning the board to the box. There is risk of players' trays being mixed and upset, and the box lid, held on by friction, is subject to upset.\n* Selchow & Righter, 1980s \u2013 pocket edition with plastic \"magnetic\" board and tiles. Tile racks are also plastic with asymmetrical shape to provide handhold. All elements fit in a plastic envelope for travel and to permit a pause in the game. Plastic letters are very small and tend to lose their grip if not placed with slight lateral movement and if they are not perfectly clean. Game format is extremely small, allowing ''Scrabble'' games for backpackers and others concerned about weight and size.\n* Hasbro Games, 2001 \u2013 hinged plastic board with clear tile-shaped depressions to hold tiles in play. Board is in a black, zippered folio such that board and tiles may be folded for travel, even with game in play. Reverse side of board contains numbered mounts for racks, holding tiles face down, allowing secure and confidential storage of tiles while game is paused. Some versions have tile racks with individual tile slots, thus not permitting easy sorting of tiles in rack. The board, when opened up, measures {{cvt|24.5|\u00d7|21.0|cm|in|frac=4}}, and the tiles are {{cvt|12.3|\u00d7|12.3|\u00d7|6.7|mm|in|frac=16}} in size.\n\n===Deluxe editions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAt the opposite end, some \"deluxe\" editions offer superior materials and features. These include editions on a rotating turntable, so players can always face the board, with the letters upright and a raised grid that holds the tiles in place. More serious players often favor custom ''Scrabble'' boards, often made of [[acrylic glass]] or [[hardwood]], that have superior rotating mechanisms and personalized graphics.\n\n===Large print edition===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAn edition has been released (in association with the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] (RNIB)) with larger board and letters for players with impaired vision. The colours on the board are more contrasting, and the font size has been increased from 16 to 24 point. The tiles are in bold 48 point.\n\n==Works detailing tournament ''Scrabble''==\nAn introduction to tournament ''Scrabble'' and its players can be found in the book ''[[Word Freak]]'' by [[Stefan Fatsis]]. In the process of writing, Fatsis himself became a high-rated tournament player.\n\nThe ''Scrabble Player's Handbook'', edited by Stewart Holden and written by an international group of tournament players, gives the information a serious player needs to advance to successful tournament play.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scrabble Player's Handbook |publisher=scrabbleplayershandbook.com|url=http://scrabbleplayershandbook.com/}}</ref>\n\nThere have been numerous documentaries made about the game, including:\n* ''[[Scrabylon]]'' (2003), by Scott Petersen, which \"gives an up-close look at why people get so obsessed with that seemingly benign game\"\n* ''[[Word Slingers]]'' (2002), by Eric Siblin and Stefan Vanderland (produced for [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC)), which follows four expert Canadian players at the 2001 World Championship in Las Vegas\n* ''[[Word Wars]]'' (2004) by Eric Chaikin and Julian Petrillo, about the \"tiles and tribulations on the ''Scrabble'' game circuit\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anagrams]] Public domain game, predecessor to Scrabble\n* [[Anamonic]]\n* [[Blanagram]]\n* ''[[Boggle]]''\n* [[Countdown (game show)|''Countdown'' (game show)]]\n* [[RSVP (board game)|''RSVP'' (board game)]]\n* [[Scrabble in Hong Kong|''Scrabble'' in Hong Kong]]\n* ''[[Upwords]]''\n* ''[[Words with Friends]]''\n* ''[[Wordscraper]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|website=The Spruce Crafts|url=https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/win-at-scrabble-words-with-friends-409528|title=How To Win at Scrabble and Words With Friends: How to Practice, Play, and Win Strategically|author=Arneson, Erik|date=June 26, 2019}}\n* {{cite magazine |first=Kevin |last=McElwee |title=Does Scrabble Need To Be Fixed? |magazine=[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]] |date=December 13, 2018 |url=http://nautil.us/issue/67/reboot/does-scrabble-need-to-be-fixed }}\n* {{cite web|website=ScholarSpace|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4480/voinov.pdf;jsessionid=DE838E2995BAA6E7354F7DEEDEE2043B?sequence=1| title= ''Scrabble'' as a tool for language preservation in Tuvan|location=Manoa, Hawaii}}  An article relating how ''Scrabble'' has been adapted to other languages, describing how it was prepared for the Tuvan languages, and giving directions about how to adapt it.\n* {{cite news|author=Wallace, Robert|work=LIFE Magazine |date=December 14, 1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA92&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=A Man Makes a Best-Selling Game - ''Scrabble'' - and Achieves His Ambition (Spelled Out Above): Little Business In the Country |page=101}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- PLEASE do not add links to online play sites. -->\n<!-- This is not a link farm. -->\n{{Commons category}}\n* Hasbro's [http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/ ''Scrabble'' website] at Hasbro.com\n* Mattel's [http://www.mattelscrabble.com/en/adults/index.html ''Scrabble'' website] at MattelScrabble.com\n<!-- Yes, both are correct. -->\n* [http://www.poslfit.com/scrabble/gcg/ .GCG specification] describes a computer file format for recording and annotating ''Scrabble'' games.\n* [http://www.absp.org.uk Association of British Scrabble Players]\n* [http://www.scrabbleplayers.org North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA)] (sanctions Club and Tournament play in North America)\n* [http://www.scrabble.org.au/ Scrabble Australia]\n* [http://www.scrabbledb.com Scrabble Word Database (Multi-language)]\n* [http://www.wespa.org/ World English-Language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA)]\n* {{US patent|2752158}} \u2013 ''Game apparatus'' \u2013 This patent used to protect the jagged edges of bonus squares, which were added so that one need not lift previously placed tiles in order to see the bonus.

The number of points for each lettered tile is based on the letter's frequency in standard English; commonly used letters such as vowels are worth one point, while less common letters score higher, with Q and Z each worth 10 points. The game also has two blank tiles that are unmarked and carry no point value. The blank tiles can be used as substitutes for any letter; once laid on the board, however, the choice is fixed. Other language sets use different letter set distributions with different point values.\n\nTiles are usually made of wood or plastic and are {{convert|19|x|19|mm}} square and {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on}} thick, making them slightly smaller than the squares on the board. Only the rosewood tiles of the deluxe edition vary in width up to {{convert|2|mm|2|abbr=on}} for different letters. Travelling versions of the game often have smaller tiles (e.g. {{convert|13|x|13|mm|abbr=on}}); sometimes they are magnetic to keep them in place. The capital letter is printed in black at the centre of the tile face and the letter's point value printed in a smaller font at the bottom right corner.

Q is considered the most troublesome letter, as almost all words with it also contain U; a similar problem occurs in other languages like French, Dutch, Italian and German.

(On ''Scrabble'' boards manufactured by Mattel as well as on the [[Internet Scrabble Club]], rows are lettered while columns are numbered instead.) A play is usually identified in the format ''xy WORD score'' or ''WORD xy score'', where ''x'' denotes the column or row on which the play's main word extends, ''y'' denotes the second coordinate of the main word's first letter, and ''WORD'' is the main word. Although it is unnecessary, additional words formed by the play are sometimes listed after the main word and a slash. When the play of a single tile forms words in each direction, one of the words is arbitrarily chosen to serve as the main word for purposes of notation.\n\nWhen a blank tile is employed in the main word, the letter it has been chosen to represent is indicated with a lower case letter, or, in handwritten notation, with a square around the letter. When annotating a play, previously existing letters on the board are usually enclosed in parentheses.\n\nExchanges are often annotated by a minus sign followed by the tiles that were exchanged alphabetically; for example, if a player holds EIIISTU, exchanging two I's and a U would be denoted as \"\u2212IIU.\"\n\nThe image at right gives examples of valid plays and how they would typically be annotated using the notation system.\n\n[[File:Scrabble-example.png|thumb|An example of a Scrabble game in progress using Quackle, an open-source program. The first few plays are JOKED 8D 50, followed by REV(O)TInG E5 94 and YEX# F4 56.]]\n\nAdditionally, a number of symbols have been employed to indicate the validity of words in different lexica:\n* '''<nowiki>*</nowiki>''' means an illegal, or phony, word.\n* '''<nowiki>#</nowiki>''' means a word valid in games using the British-originated word list ([[Collins Scrabble Words|CSW12]]) only.\n* '''$''' means a word valid in games using the American-originated word list ([[Official Tournament and Club Word List|TWL2]]) only.\n* '''!''' means a word judged to be offensive, and thus valid in tournament games only.\n\n===Sequence of play===\nBefore the game, a resource, either a word list or a dictionary, is selected for the purpose of adjudicating any challenges during the game. The tiles are either put in an opaque bag or placed face down on a flat surface. Opaque cloth bags and customized tiles are staples of clubs and tournaments, where games are rarely played without both.\n[[File:Scrabble 2015.jpg|right|thumb|A game of ''Scrabble'' in [[French language|French]]]]\n\nNext, players decide the order in which they play. The normal approach is for players to each draw one tile: The player who picks the letter closest to the beginning of the alphabet goes first, with blank tiles taking precedence over the letter A. In most North American tournaments, the rules of the US-based [[North American Scrabble Players Association]] (NASPA) stipulate instead that players who have gone first in the fewest previous games in the tournament go first, and when that rule yields a tie, those who have gone second the most go first. If there is still a tie, tiles are drawn as in the standard rules.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, each player draws seven tiles from the bag and places them on their rack, concealed from the other player(s).\n\n====Making a play====\nThe first played word must be at least two letters long, and cover H8 (the center square). Thereafter, any move is made by using one or more tiles to place a word on the board. This word may use one or more tiles already on the board and must join with the cluster of tiles already on the board.\n\nOn each turn, the player has three options:\n* Pass, forfeiting the turn and scoring nothing\n* Exchange one or more tiles for an equal number from the bag, scoring nothing, an option available only if at least seven tiles remain in the bag\n* Play at least one tile on the board, adding the value of all words formed to the player's cumulative score\n\nA proper play uses one or more of the player's tiles to form a continuous string of letters that make a word (the play's \"main word\") on the board, reading either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. The main word must either use the letters of one or more previously played words or else have at least one of its tiles horizontally or vertically adjacent to an already played word. If any words other than the main word are formed by the play, they are scored as well and are subject to the same criteria of acceptability. See [[Scrabble#Scoring|Scoring]] for more details.\n\nA blank tile may represent any letter, and scores zero points, regardless of its placement or what letter it represents. Its placement on a double-word or triple-word square causes the corresponding premium to be applied to the word(s) in which it is used. Once a blank tile is placed, it remains that particular letter for the remainder of the game.\n\nAfter making a play, the player announces the score for that play, and then, if the game is being played with a [[Chess clock|clock]], starts the opponent's clock. The player can change their play as long as the player's clock is running, but commits to the play when they start the opponent's clock. The player then draws tiles from the bag to replenish their rack to seven tiles. If there are not enough tiles in the bag to do so, the player takes all the remaining tiles.\n\nIf a player has made a play and has not yet drawn a tile, the opponent may choose to [[Challenge (Scrabble)|challenge]] any or all words formed by the play. The player challenged must then look up the words in question using a specified word source (such as [[Official Tournament and Club Word List|OTCWL]], the ''[[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]]'', or [[SOWPODS|CSW]]) and if any one of them is found to be unacceptable, the play is removed from the board, the player returns the newly played tiles to their rack, and the turn is forfeited. In tournament play, a challenge may be to the entire play or any one or more words formed in the play, and judges (human or computer) are used, so players are not entitled to know which word(s) are invalid. Penalties for unsuccessfully challenging an acceptable play vary in club and tournament play and are described in greater detail below.\n\n====End of game====\nUnder North American tournament rules, the game ends when either:\n# one player plays every tile on their rack, and there are no tiles remaining in the bag (regardless of the tiles on the opponent's rack)\n# at least six successive scoreless turns have occurred and either player decides to end the game\n# either player uses more than 10 minutes of overtime. (For several years, a game could not end with a cumulative score of 0\u20130, but that is no longer the case, and such games have since occurred a number of times in tournament play, the winner being the player with the lower total point value on their rack.<ref>{{cross-tables player-tournament|pid=560|pname=Marlon Hill|tid=6898|tname=Albany, NY July 2010}}</ref>)\n\nWhen the game ends, each player's score is reduced by the sum of their unplayed letters. In addition, if a player has used all of their letters (known as \"going out\" or \"playing out\"), the sum of the other player's unplayed letters is added to that player's score; in tournament play, a player who goes out adds twice that sum, and their opponent is not penalized.\n\n====Examples====\nPlays can be made in a number of ways (in what follows, it is assumed that the word JACK has been played on a previous turn; letters in parentheses represent tiles already on the board):\n* Adding one or more letters to an existing word, e.g. (JACK)S, HI(JACK), HI(JACK)ING, (JACK)FRUIT.\n* \"Hooking\" a word and playing perpendicular to that word, e.g. playing IONIZES with the S hooked on (JACK) to make (JACK)S.\n* Playing perpendicular to a word, e.g. YEU(K)Y through the K in JACK.\n* Playing parallel to a word(s) forming several short words, e.g. CON played under (JACK) simultaneously forming (J)O and (A)N.\n\nAny combination of these is allowed in a play, as long as all the letters placed on the board in one play lie in one row or column and are connected by a main word, and any run of tiles on two or more consecutive squares along a row or column constitutes a valid word.\n\nWords must read either left-to-right or top-to-bottom. Diagonal plays are not allowed.\n\n===Scoring===\n<div style=\"float: right;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|+ Premium square colors\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Square !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Original and Mattel version !! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:80px;\"| Hasbro Version (2008\u20132014)\n|-\n| Double letter\n| style=\"background:#6cf;\"| Light blue\n| style=\"background:#09f;\"| {{white|Blue}}\n|-\n| Triple letter\n| style=\"background:#06f;\"| {{white|Dark blue}}\n| style=\"background:#290;\"| {{white|Green}}\n|-\n| Double word\n| style=\"background:#f9f;\"| Pink\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"| {{white|Red}}\n|-\n| Triple word\n| style=\"background:#f00;\"| {{white|Red}}\n| style=\"background:#f90;\"| {{white|Orange}}\n|}\n</div>\nThe score for any play is determined this way:\n* Each new word formed in a play is scored separately, and then those scores are added up. The value of each tile is indicated on the tile, and blank tiles are worth zero points.\n* The main word (defined as the word containing every played letter) is scored. The letter values of the tiles are added up, and tiles placed on Double Letter Score (DLS) and Triple Letter Score (TLS) squares are doubled or tripled in value, respectively. Tiles placed on Double Word Score (DWS) or Triple Word Score (TWS) squares double or triple the value of the word(s) that include those tiles, respectively. In particular, the center square (H8) is considered a DWS, and the first play is doubled in value.\n* If any \"hook\" words are played (e.g. playing ANEROID while \"hooking\" the A to BETTING to make ABETTING), the scores for each word are added separately. This is common for \"parallel\" plays that make up to eight words in one turn.\n* Premium squares apply only when newly placed tiles cover them. Any subsequent plays do not count those premium squares.\n* If a player covers both letter and word premium squares with a single word, the letter premium(s) is/are calculated first, followed by the word premium(s).\n* If a player makes a play where the main word covers two DWS squares, the value of that word is doubled, then redoubled (i.e. 4\u00d7 the word value). Similarly, if the main word covers two TWS squares, the value of that word is tripled, then retripled (9\u00d7 the word value). Such plays are often referred to as \"double-doubles\" and \"triple-triples\" respectively. It is theoretically possible to achieve a play covering three TWS squares (a 27\u00d7 word score), although this is extremely improbable without constructive setup and collaboration. Plays covering a DWS and a TWS simultaneously (6\u00d7 the word value, or 18\u00d7 if a DWS and two TWS squares are covered) are only possible if a player misses the center star on the first turn, and the play goes unchallenged (this is valid under North American tournament rules).\n* Finally, if seven tiles have been laid on the board in one turn, known as a \"[[bingo (Scrabble)|bingo]]\" in North America and as a \"bonus\" elsewhere, after all of the words formed have been scored, 50 bonus points are added.\n\nWhen the letters to be drawn have run out, the final play can often determine the winner. This is particularly the case in close games with more than two players.\n\nScoreless turns can occur when a player passes, exchanges tiles, or loses a challenge. The latter rule varies slightly in international tournaments. A scoreless turn can also theoretically occur if a play consists of only blank tiles, but this is extremely unlikely in actual play.\n\n====Example====\nSuppose Player 1 plays QUANT 8D, with the Q on a DLS and T on the center star. The score for this play would be (2 \u00d7 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 2 = 48 (following the [[order of operations]]).\n\nPlayer 2 extends the play to ALI(QUANT) 8A with the A on the TWS at 8A. The score for this play would be (1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) \u00d7 3 = 51. Note that the Q is not doubled for this play.\n\nPlayer 1 has DDIIIOO and plays OIDIOID 9G. The score for the word OIDIOID would be (2 \u00d7 1 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 \u00d7 2) = 14. Additionally, Player 1 formed NO and TI, which score 1 + 2 \u00d7 1 = 3 and 1 + 1 = 2 points respectively. Therefore, the sum of all the values of the words formed is 14+3+2 = 19. But since this is a seven-letter play, 50 points are added, resulting in a total score of 69. Player 1 now has a 117\u201351 lead.\n\nThe player with the highest final score wins the game. In case of a tie, the player with the highest score before adjusting for unplayed tiles wins the game. In tournament play, a tie counts as 1/2 a win for both players.\n\n===Acceptable words===\nAcceptable words are the primary entries in some chosen [[dictionary]], and all of their [[inflection|inflected]] forms. Words that are hyphenated, capitalized (such as [[proper noun]]s), or apostrophized are not allowed, unless they also appear as acceptable entries; JACK is a proper noun, but the word ''[[wikt:jack|JACK]]'' is acceptable because it has other usages as a common noun (automotive, [[vexillology|vexillological]], etc.) and verb that are acceptable. Acronyms or abbreviations, other than those that have acceptable entries (such as ''[[AWOL]]'', ''[[RADAR]]'', ''[[LASER]]'', and ''[[Scuba diving|SCUBA]]'') are not allowed. Variant spellings, slang or offensive terms, archaic or obsolete terms, and specialized jargon words are allowed if they meet all other criteria for acceptability, but archaic spellings (e.g. ''NEEDE'' for ''NEED'') are generally not allowed. Foreign words are not allowed in English-language ''Scrabble'' unless they have been incorporated into the English language, as with PATISSERIE, KILIM, and QI. Vulgar and offensive words are generally excluded from the OSPD4 but allowed in club and tournament play.\n\nProper nouns and other exceptions to the usual rules are allowed in some limited contexts in the spin-off game [[Trickster (board game)|''Scrabble Trickster'']]. Names of recognized computer programs are permitted as an acceptable proper noun (For example, WinZIP).\n\nThe memorization of two-letter words is considered an essential skill in this game.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=[Loopful] Two Letter Words Allowed In Scrabble |publisher=Word Buff\n|url=http://www.word-buff.com/two-letter-words.html\n|accessdate=2015-06-08\n }}\n</ref>\n\n[[File:PocketScrabble.JPG|thumb|left|250 px|A near-ending game board, tiles and racks of the magnetic Pocket ''Scrabble'' (International, Mattel, Inc.)]]\n\nThere are two popular competition word lists used in various parts of the world:\n* [[Tournament Word List|TWL]] (also known as OTCWL, OWL, or TWL)\n* [[SOWPODS]] (also called \"Collins\" or \"CSW\")\nThe first is used in America, Canada, Israel and Thailand, and the second in all other English-speaking countries\n\n====TWL, OWL2 and OSPD5====\nThe North American 2006 ''[[Official Tournament and Club Word List]], Second Edition'' (OWL2) went into official use in American, Canadian, Israeli and Thai club and tournament play on March 1, 2006 (or, for school use, the [[Thomas Bowdler|bowdlerized]] ''[[Official Scrabble Players Dictionary]], Fifth Edition'' (OSPD5)). North American competitions use the ''Long Words List'' for longer words.\n\nThe OWL2 and the OSPD5 are compiled using four (originally five) major college-level dictionaries, including Merriam-Webster (10th and 11th editions, respectively). If a word appears, at least historically, in any one of the dictionaries, it will be included in the OWL2 and the OSPD5. If the word has only an offensive meaning, it is only included in the OWL2. The key difference between the OSPD5 and the OWL2 is that the OSPD5 is marketed for \"home and school\" use, with expurgated words which their source dictionaries judged offensive, rendering the ''Official Scrabble Players Dictionary'' less fit for official ''Scrabble'' play. The OSPD5, released in 2014, is available in bookstores, whereas the OWL2 is only available through [[North American Scrabble Players Association|NASPA]]).\n\n====''Collins Scrabble Words''====\nIn all other English-speaking countries, the competition word list is ''Collins Scrabble Words'' 2019 edition, known as ''CSW19''. Versions of this lexicon prior to 2007 were known as [[SOWPODS]]. The lexicon includes all allowed words of length 2 to 15 letters. This list contains all OWL2 words plus words sourced from Chambers and Collins English dictionaries. This book is used to adjudicate at the [[World Scrabble Championship]] and all other major international competitions outside North America.\n\nTournaments are also occasionally played to CSW in North America, particularly since 2010. [[North American Scrabble Players Association|NASPA]] officially rates CSW tournaments alongside OWL tournaments, using a separate rating system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scrabbleplayers.org/w/SOWPODS|title=SOWPODS - NASPAWiki|publisher=North American Scrabble Players Association}}</ref>\n\n===Challenges===\n{{Main|Challenge (Scrabble)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\nThe penalty for a successfully challenged play is nearly universal: the offending player removes the tiles played and forfeits his or her turn. (In some online games, an option known as \"void\" may be used, wherein unacceptable words are automatically rejected by the program. The player is then required to make another play, with no penalty applied.)\n\nThe penalty for an unsuccessful challenge (where all words formed by the play are deemed valid) varies considerably, including:\n* \"Double Challenge\", in which an unsuccessfully challenging player must forfeit the next turn. This penalty governs North American (NASPA-sanctioned) OWL tournament play, and is the standard for North American, Israeli, and Thai clubs.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Because loss of a turn generally constitutes the greatest risk for an unsuccessful challenge, it provides the greatest incentive for a player to \"bluff\", or play a \"phony\" \u2013 a plausible word that they know or suspect to be unacceptable, hoping his or her opponent will not call him on it. Or a player can put down a legal word that appears to be a phony hoping the other player will incorrectly challenge it and lose their turn.\n* \"Single Challenge\"/\"Free Challenge\", in which no penalty whatsoever is applied to a player who unsuccessfully challenges. This is the default rule in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as for many tournaments in Australia, although these countries do sanction occasional tournaments using other challenge rules.\n* Modified \"Single Challenge\", in which an unsuccessful challenge does not result in the loss of the challenging player's turn, but is penalized by the loss of a specified number of points. The most common penalty is five points. The rule has been adopted in Singapore (since 2000), Malaysia (since 2002), South Africa (since 2003), New Zealand (since 2004), and Kenya, as well as in contemporary [[World Scrabble Championship]]s (since 2001) and North American (NASPA-sanctioned) Collins tournaments, and particularly prestigious Australian tournaments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrabble.org.au/ratings/selective/2018AMSC.html|title=Australian Masters and State Team Challenge|website=www.scrabble.org.au|access-date=2018-05-01}}</ref> Some countries and tournaments (including Sweden) use a 10-point penalty instead. In most game situations, this penalty is much lower than that of the \"double challenge\" rule. Consequently, such tournaments encourage greater willingness to challenge and discourage playing dubious words.\n\nUnder NASPA tournament rules, a player may request to \"hold\" the opponent's play in order to consider whether to challenge it, provided that the opponent has not yet drawn replacement tiles. If player A holds, player A's clock still runs, and player B may not draw provisional replacement tiles until 15 seconds after the hold was announced (which tiles must then be kept separate). There is no limit on how long player A may hold the play. If player A successfully challenges after player B drew provisional replacement tiles, player B must show the drawn tiles before returning them to the bag.\n\n==Club and tournament play==\n{{Main|English-language Scrabble}}\n\nTens of thousands play club and tournament ''Scrabble'' worldwide. All tournament (and most club) games are played with a [[game clock]] and a set [[time control]]. Although casual games are often played with unlimited time, this is problematic in competitive play among players for whom the number of evident legal plays is immense. Almost all tournament games involve only two players; typically, each has 25 minutes in which to make all of their plays. For each minute by which a player oversteps the time control, a penalty of 10 points is assessed. The number of minutes is rounded up, so, for example, if a player oversteps time control by two minutes and five seconds, the penalty is 30 points. Also, most players use molded plastic tiles, not engraved like the original wooden tiles, eliminating the potential for a cheating player to \"braille\" (feel for particular tiles, especially blanks, in the bag).<ref name=\"slate2012\"/>\n\nPlayers are allowed \"tracking sheets\", pre-printed with the letters in the initial pool, from which tiles can be crossed off as they are played. [[Tile tracking|Tracking tiles]] is an important aid to strategy, especially during the endgame, when no tiles remain to be drawn and each player can determine exactly what is on the opponent's rack.\n\nNotable and regularly held tournaments include:\n# ''The [[World Scrabble Championship]]'': held in odd years up until 2013, when it was announced by [[Mattel]] that it would be called the '''Scrabble Champions Tournament''' and be held annually in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wespa.org/news/2013xchampions.shtml|title=WESPA News: Scrabble Champions Tournament Announcement|publisher=WESPA}}</ref>\n# ''The [[North American Scrabble Championship]]'': an open event attracting several hundred players, held around July\u2013August every year or two in the United States.\n# ''The [[National Scrabble Championship (UK)|National Scrabble Championship]]'', organized by the [[Association of British Scrabble Players]] (ABSP) and held every year in the United Kingdom.\n# ''The [[Brand's Crossword Game King's Cup]]'': the largest tournament in the world. Held annually in Thailand around the end of June or beginning of July.\n# ''The [[UK Open (Scrabble)|UK Open]]'': the largest Scrabble tournament in Europe, held annually in [[Coventry]], United Kingdom since 2008.\n\nOther important tournaments include:\n# ''The [[World Youth Scrabble Championships]]'': entry by country qualification, restricted to under 18 years old. Held annually since 2006.\n# ''The [[National School Scrabble Championship]]'': entry open to North American school students. Held annually since 2003.\n# ''The [[Canadian Scrabble Championship]]'': entry by invitation only to the top fifty Canadian players. Held every two to three years.\n# ''The [[Singapore Open Scrabble Championship]]'': international Singapore championship held annually since 1997.\n\nClubs in North America typically meet one day a week for three or four hours and some charge a small admission fee to cover their expenses and prizes. Clubs also typically hold at least one open tournament per year. Tournaments are usually held on weekends, and between six and nine games are played each day.\n\nThere are also clubs in the UK and many other countries. There are a number of internationally rated [[SOWPODS]] tournaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~rjackman/irsowev.html |title=Internationally Rated SOWPODS Events |publisher=Members.ozemail.com.au |date= |accessdate=2010-04-06}}</ref>\n\nDuring off hours at tournaments, many players socialize by playing consultation (team) ''Scrabble'', [[Clabbers]], [[Anagrams]], [[Boggle]], Words with Friends, Scramble with Friends and other games.\n<!--strategy and tactics excised; DO NOT re-add without sources-->\n\n==Computer players==\n[[Maven (Scrabble)|Maven]] is a computer opponent for the game, created by Brian Sheppard.

Play in this system \"encourages elaborate setups often independently mined by the two players\",<ref name=stevena /> and is significantly different from the standard game in which defensive considerations play a major role. While the \"high score\" rule has led to impressively high records, it is currently out of favor.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n* High game score of 1,049 by Phil Appleby of Lymington, [[Hampshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], on June 25, 1989 in Wormley, [[Hertfordshire]], UK. his opponent scored just 253 points, giving Appleby a record victory margin of 796 points.\n* High single-turn score of 392, by Dr. Saladin Karl Khoshnaw<ref name=\"khoshnaw\"/> in [[Manchester]], UK, in April 1982.

A longer record was never recorded by ''Guinness Book of Records'', as the publishers decided that duration records of this nature were becoming too dangerous and stopped accepting them.<ref>{{cite book|last=McWhirter|first=Norris|title=Guinness Book of World Records 1985|year=1985|publisher=Sterling Publishing|isbn=0-8069-0264-7}}{{page needed|date=August 2012}}</ref>\n\n==National versions==\n{{Further|Scrabble letter distributions}}\nVersions of the game have been released in several other languages.\n\nThe game was called [[Alfapet]] when it was introduced in [[Sweden]] in 1954, but since the mid-1990s, the game has also been known as Scrabble in Sweden. Alfapet is now another crossword game, created by the owners of the name Alfapet. A Russian version is called ''Erudit''. Versions have been prepared for [[Dakota language|Dakotah]], [[Haitian Creole]], [[Dakelh]] ([[Carrier language]]), and [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]].<ref>Voinov, Vitaly. 2010. Words should be fun: Scrabble as a tool for language preservation in Tuvan and other local languages. ''[[Language Documentation & Conservation]]'' 4. 213\u2013230.</ref>\n\nFor languages with [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] counted as single letters, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the game features separate tiles for those digraphs.\n\nAn Irish-language version of Scrabble was published by Gl\u00f3r na nGael in 2010. The previous year the same organisation published the Junior version of the game and two years later it republished Junior Scrabble using a two-sided (and two skill level) board.\n\n==Variations==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2012}}\n{{Main|Scrabble variants}}\n\nThere are numerous variations of the game. While they are similar to the original ''Scrabble'' game, they include minor variations. For example, Literati draws random tiles instead of providing a finite number of tiles for the game, assigns different point levels to each letter and has a slightly different board layout, whereas Lexulous assigns eight letters to each player instead of seven. [[Words with Friends]] uses a different board layout and different letter values, as does [[Words of Gold]].\n\n[[File:ScrabbleDuplicate.jpg|thumb|A duplicate ''Scrabble'' tournament in [[La Bresse]], France]]\n[[Duplicate Scrabble]] is a popular variant in [[Francophonie|French speaking countries]]. Every player has the same letters on the same board and the players must submit a paper slip at the end of the allotted time (usually 3 minutes) with the highest scoring word they have found. This is the format used for the [[French World Scrabble Championships]] but it is also used in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. There is no limit to the number of players that can be involved in one game, and at [[Vichy]] in 1998 there were 1485 players, a record for French ''Scrabble'' tournaments.\n\n{{Interlanguage link|Scarabeo|lt=Scarabeo|it|Scarabeo (gioco)|WD=}} is a variant that is much more popular in Italy than the original game. It features a 17\u00d717 grid of cells and peculiar rules.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.editricegiochi.it/gioco/12/Scarabeo.htm|title=Scarabeo \u2013 Sito ufficiale |publisher=editricegiochi.it|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn one variation of ''Scrabble'', blanks score points corresponding to the letters the blanks are used to represent. For example, if one played blank to represent a Z, it would get ten; a blank to represent a V or an H would get four; a blank to represent a D would get 2 and blank to represent a T, N, L, S or R or any of the vowels would get one.\n\nPopular among tournament Scrabble players is ''Clabbers''. In Clabbers, any move that consists of anagrams of allowable words is allowed. For example, because ETAERIO is allowable in ordinary Collins Scrabble, EEAIORT would be allowable in Clabbers.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Warren|first1=Jane|url=https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/879354/Allan-Simmons-banned-for-cheating-scrabble |title=Cut-throat world of competitive Scrabble as Allan Simmons is BANNED for cheating|newspaper=The Express|accessdate=April 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA junior version, called ''Junior Scrabble'', has been marketed. This has slightly different distributions of frequencies of letter tiles to the standard ''Scrabble'' game.\n\nWord games similar to or influenced by ''Scrabble'' include [[Bananagrams]], [[Boggle]], [[Dabble]], [[Nab-It!]], [[Perquackey]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Quiddler]], [[Scribbage]], [[Tapple]], [[Upwords]], and [[WordSpot]].\n\nThere are also number-based variations, such as [[Equate (game)]], GoSum, Mathable, [[Numble]], Numbler, Triolet, Yushino and Numenko.\n\n==Gameboard formats==\nThe game has been released in numerous gameboard formats appealing to various user groups. The original boards included wood tiles and many \"deluxe\" sets still do.\n\n===Tile Lock Scrabble and Tile Lock Super Scrabble Editions===\nBoth games are made by [[Winning Moves]] and feature smaller, plastic tiles that are held in place on the board with little plastic posts. The standard version features exactly the same 100 tiles as regular ''Scrabble''. The Tile Lock Super Scrabble features the same 200 tiles that are in [[Super Scrabble]].\n\n===Travel editions===\nEditions are available for travelers who may wish to play in a conveyance such as a train or plane, or to pause a game in progress and resume later. Many versions thus include methods to keep letters from moving, such as pegboards, recessed tile holders and magnetic tiles. Players' trays are also designed with stay-fast holders. Such boards are also typically designed to be reoriented by each player to put the board upright during the game, as well as folded and stowed with the game in progress.\n* Production and Marketing Company, 1954 \u2013 metal hinged box, Bakelite tiles inlaid with round magnets, chrome tile racks, silver colored plastic bag and cardboard box covered with decorative paper. The box, when opened flat, measures {{cvt|8+1/2|\u00d7|7+3/4|in|cm}} and the tiles measure {{cvt|1/2|in|mm}} square.\n* Spear's Games, 1980s \u2013 boxed edition with pegboard, plastic tiles with small feet to fit snugly in the pegboard. Racks are clear plastic, allowing some sorting while holding tiles fairly snugly. Set comes with a drawstring plastic bag to draw tiles and a cardboard box. It is possible to save a game in progress by returning the board to the box. There is risk of players' trays being mixed and upset, and the box lid, held on by friction, is subject to upset.\n* Selchow & Righter, 1980s \u2013 pocket edition with plastic \"magnetic\" board and tiles. Tile racks are also plastic with asymmetrical shape to provide handhold. All elements fit in a plastic envelope for travel and to permit a pause in the game. Plastic letters are very small and tend to lose their grip if not placed with slight lateral movement and if they are not perfectly clean. Game format is extremely small, allowing ''Scrabble'' games for backpackers and others concerned about weight and size.\n* Hasbro Games, 2001 \u2013 hinged plastic board with clear tile-shaped depressions to hold tiles in play. Board is in a black, zippered folio such that board and tiles may be folded for travel, even with game in play. Reverse side of board contains numbered mounts for racks, holding tiles face down, allowing secure and confidential storage of tiles while game is paused. Some versions have tile racks with individual tile slots, thus not permitting easy sorting of tiles in rack. The board, when opened up, measures {{cvt|24.5|\u00d7|21.0|cm|in|frac=4}}, and the tiles are {{cvt|12.3|\u00d7|12.3|\u00d7|6.7|mm|in|frac=16}} in size.\n\n===Deluxe editions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAt the opposite end, some \"deluxe\" editions offer superior materials and features. These include editions on a rotating turntable, so players can always face the board, with the letters upright and a raised grid that holds the tiles in place. More serious players often favor custom ''Scrabble'' boards, often made of [[acrylic glass]] or [[hardwood]], that have superior rotating mechanisms and personalized graphics.\n\n===Large print edition===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAn edition has been released (in association with the [[Royal National Institute of Blind People]] (RNIB)) with larger board and letters for players with impaired vision. The colours on the board are more contrasting, and the font size has been increased from 16 to 24 point. The tiles are in bold 48 point.\n\n==Works detailing tournament ''Scrabble''==\nAn introduction to tournament ''Scrabble'' and its players can be found in the book ''[[Word Freak]]'' by [[Stefan Fatsis]]. In the process of writing, Fatsis himself became a high-rated tournament player.\n\nThe ''Scrabble Player's Handbook'', edited by Stewart Holden and written by an international group of tournament players, gives the information a serious player needs to advance to successful tournament play.<ref>{{cite book|title=Scrabble Player's Handbook |publisher=scrabbleplayershandbook.com|url=http://scrabbleplayershandbook.com/}}</ref>\n\nThere have been numerous documentaries made about the game, including:\n* ''[[Scrabylon]]'' (2003), by Scott Petersen, which \"gives an up-close look at why people get so obsessed with that seemingly benign game\"\n* ''[[Word Slingers]]'' (2002), by Eric Siblin and Stefan Vanderland (produced for [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC)), which follows four expert Canadian players at the 2001 World Championship in Las Vegas\n* ''[[Word Wars]]'' (2004) by Eric Chaikin and Julian Petrillo, about the \"tiles and tribulations on the ''Scrabble'' game circuit\"\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anagrams]] Public domain game, predecessor to Scrabble\n* [[Anamonic]]\n* [[Blanagram]]\n* ''[[Boggle]]''\n* [[Countdown (game show)|''Countdown'' (game show)]]\n* [[RSVP (board game)|''RSVP'' (board game)]]\n* [[Scrabble in Hong Kong|''Scrabble'' in Hong Kong]]\n* ''[[Upwords]]''\n* ''[[Words with Friends]]''\n* ''[[Wordscraper]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite web|website=The Spruce Crafts|url=https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/win-at-scrabble-words-with-friends-409528|title=How To Win at Scrabble and Words With Friends: How to Practice, Play, and Win Strategically|author=Arneson, Erik|date=June 26, 2019}}\n* {{cite magazine |first=Kevin |last=McElwee |title=Does Scrabble Need To Be Fixed? |magazine=[[Nautilus (science magazine)|Nautilus]] |date=December 13, 2018 |url=http://nautil.us/issue/67/reboot/does-scrabble-need-to-be-fixed }}\n* {{cite web|website=ScholarSpace|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4480/voinov.pdf;jsessionid=DE838E2995BAA6E7354F7DEEDEE2043B?sequence=1| title= ''Scrabble'' as a tool for language preservation in Tuvan|location=Manoa, Hawaii}}  An article relating how ''Scrabble'' has been adapted to other languages, describing how it was prepared for the Tuvan languages, and giving directions about how to adapt it.\n* {{cite news|author=Wallace, Robert|work=LIFE Magazine |date=December 14, 1953|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkkEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA92&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=true|title=A Man Makes a Best-Selling Game - ''Scrabble'' - and Achieves His Ambition (Spelled Out Above): Little Business In the Country |page=101}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- PLEASE do not add links to online play sites. -->\n<!-- This is not a link farm. -->\n{{Commons category}}\n* Hasbro's [http://www.hasbro.com/scrabble/ ''Scrabble'' website] at Hasbro.com\n* Mattel's [http://www.mattelscrabble.com/en/adults/index.html ''Scrabble'' website] at MattelScrabble.com\n<!-- Yes, both are correct. -->\n* [http://www.poslfit.com/scrabble/gcg/ .GCG specification] describes a computer file format for recording and annotating ''Scrabble'' games.\n* [http://www.absp.org.uk Association of British Scrabble Players]\n* [http://www.scrabbleplayers.org North American Scrabble Players Association (NASPA)] (sanctions Club and Tournament play in North America)\n* [http://www.scrabble.org.au/ Scrabble Australia]\n* [http://www.scrabbledb.com Scrabble Word Database (Multi-language)]\n* [http://www.wespa.org/ World English-Language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA)]\n* {{US patent|2752158}} \u2013 ''Game apparatus'' \u2013 This patent used to protect the jagged edges of bonus squares, which were added so that one need not lift previously placed tiles in order to see the bonus.
