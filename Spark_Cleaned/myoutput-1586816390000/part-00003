The main gate is located on Swains Lane just north of Oakshott Avenue. There is another disused gate on Chester Road. The cemetery is in the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]]. The nearest transport link is [[Transport for London]] C11 bus Brookfield Park stop or [[Archway tube station]].\n\n==History and setting==\nThe cemetery in its original form\u2014the northwestern wooded area\u2014opened in 1839, as part of a plan to provide seven large, modern cemeteries, now known as the \"[[Magnificent Seven, London|Magnificent Seven]]\", around the outside of central London. The inner-city cemeteries, mostly the graveyards attached to individual churches, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. The initial design was by architect and entrepreneur [[Stephen Geary]].\n\nOn Monday 20 May 1839, Highgate (West) Cemetery was dedicated to [[James, son of Alphaeus|St. James]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|website=Highgate Cemetery|publisher=Highgate Cemetery|accessdate=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124082617/http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|archive-date=24 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> by the Right Reverend [[Charles James Blomfield]], Lord [[Bishop of London]]. Fifteen acres were consecrated for the use of the [[Church of England]], and two acres set aside for [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. Rights of burial were sold for either limited period or in perpetuity. The first burial was Elizabeth Jackson of Little Windmill Street, [[Soho]], on 26 May.\n\nHighgate, like the others of the Magnificent Seven, soon became a fashionable place for burials and was much admired and visited. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] attitude to death and its presentation led to the creation of a wealth of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] tombs and buildings. It occupies a spectacular south-facing hillside site slightly downhill from the top of the hill of Highgate itself, next to Waterlow Park. In 1854 the area to the east of the original area across Swains Lane was bought to form the eastern part of the cemetery. Both the cemeteries are still used today for burials, but these areas are closed to the public. Most of the open unforested area in the East Cemetery still has fairly few graves on it.\n\nThe cemetery's grounds are full of trees, shrubbery and wildflowers, most of which have been planted and grown without human influence. The grounds are a haven for birds and small animals such as foxes.\n\nBecause of the Karl Marx association a variety of [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders and thinkers are buried within the cemetery grounds.\n\nHighgate Cemetery was featured in the popular media from the 1960s to the late 1980s for its so-called [[occult]] past, particularly as being the alleged site of the \"[[Highgate Vampire]]\".\n\n==Friends of Highgate Cemetery==\nThe Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust was set up in 1975 and acquired the freehold of both East and West Cemeteries by 1981, since when they have had responsibility for the maintenance of the location. In 1984 they published ''Highgate Cemetery: Victorian Valhalla'' by [[John Gay (photographer)|John Gay]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/ | title = A Brief History of Highgate Cemetery}}</ref>\n\n==East Cemetery==\n[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tomb of Karl Marx]],  East Cemetery]]\nMany famous or prominent people are buried in Highgate cemetery; the most famous burial is arguably that of [[Karl Marx]], whose tomb was the site of attempted bombings on 2 September 1965<ref>{{citation | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XnIsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2MsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6238%2C1047342 | publisher = Google | title = News}}</ref> and in 1970.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/111705/cn111705_11.htm | title = Camden New Journal | place = UK | contribution = Tomb raiders\u2019 failed attack on Marx grave}}</ref> The tomb of [[Karl Marx]] is a Grade I [[listed building]] for reasons of historical importance.\n\n===East Cemetery interments===\n\n[[File:WFGgrave.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grave of [[William Friese-Greene]] by [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]], East Cemetery]]\n* [[Douglas Adams]], (ashes) author of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and other novels\n* [[Farzad Bazoft]], journalist, executed by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime\n* [[Jeremy Beadle]], television presenter \n* Adolf Beck, the [[Adolph Beck case]] was a celebrated case of mistaken identity \n* [[Hercules Bellville]], American film producer\n* [[Kate Booth]], English Salvationist and evangelist.

The main gate is located on Swains Lane just north of Oakshott Avenue. There is another disused gate on Chester Road. The cemetery is in the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]]. The nearest transport link is [[Transport for London]] C11 bus Brookfield Park stop or [[Archway tube station]].\n\n==History and setting==\nThe cemetery in its original form\u2014the northwestern wooded area\u2014opened in 1839, as part of a plan to provide seven large, modern cemeteries, now known as the \"[[Magnificent Seven, London|Magnificent Seven]]\", around the outside of central London. The inner-city cemeteries, mostly the graveyards attached to individual churches, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. The initial design was by architect and entrepreneur [[Stephen Geary]].\n\nOn Monday 20 May 1839, Highgate (West) Cemetery was dedicated to [[James, son of Alphaeus|St. James]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|website=Highgate Cemetery|publisher=Highgate Cemetery|accessdate=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124082617/http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|archive-date=24 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> by the Right Reverend [[Charles James Blomfield]], Lord [[Bishop of London]]. Fifteen acres were consecrated for the use of the [[Church of England]], and two acres set aside for [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. Rights of burial were sold for either limited period or in perpetuity. The first burial was Elizabeth Jackson of Little Windmill Street, [[Soho]], on 26 May.\n\nHighgate, like the others of the Magnificent Seven, soon became a fashionable place for burials and was much admired and visited. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] attitude to death and its presentation led to the creation of a wealth of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] tombs and buildings. It occupies a spectacular south-facing hillside site slightly downhill from the top of the hill of Highgate itself, next to Waterlow Park. In 1854 the area to the east of the original area across Swains Lane was bought to form the eastern part of the cemetery. Both the cemeteries are still used today for burials, but these areas are closed to the public. Most of the open unforested area in the East Cemetery still has fairly few graves on it.\n\nThe cemetery's grounds are full of trees, shrubbery and wildflowers, most of which have been planted and grown without human influence. The grounds are a haven for birds and small animals such as foxes.\n\nBecause of the Karl Marx association a variety of [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders and thinkers are buried within the cemetery grounds.\n\nHighgate Cemetery was featured in the popular media from the 1960s to the late 1980s for its so-called [[occult]] past, particularly as being the alleged site of the \"[[Highgate Vampire]]\".\n\n==Friends of Highgate Cemetery==\nThe Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust was set up in 1975 and acquired the freehold of both East and West Cemeteries by 1981, since when they have had responsibility for the maintenance of the location. In 1984 they published ''Highgate Cemetery: Victorian Valhalla'' by [[John Gay (photographer)|John Gay]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/ | title = A Brief History of Highgate Cemetery}}</ref>\n\n==East Cemetery==\n[[File:Grave of Karl Marx Highgate Cemetery in London 2016 (10).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tomb of Karl Marx]],  East Cemetery]]\nMany famous or prominent people are buried in Highgate cemetery; the most famous burial is arguably that of [[Karl Marx]], whose tomb was the site of attempted bombings on 2 September 1965<ref>{{citation | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XnIsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=2MsEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6238%2C1047342 | publisher = Google | title = News}}</ref> and in 1970.<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/111705/cn111705_11.htm | title = Camden New Journal | place = UK | contribution = Tomb raiders\u2019 failed attack on Marx grave}}</ref> The tomb of [[Karl Marx]] is a Grade I [[listed building]] for reasons of historical importance.\n\n===East Cemetery interments===\n\n[[File:WFGgrave.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grave of [[William Friese-Greene]] by [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]], East Cemetery]]\n* [[Douglas Adams]], (ashes) author of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' and other novels\n* [[Farzad Bazoft]], journalist, executed by [[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime\n* [[Jeremy Beadle]], television presenter \n* Adolf Beck, the [[Adolph Beck case]] was a celebrated case of mistaken identity \n* [[Hercules Bellville]], American film producer\n* [[Kate Booth]], English Salvationist and evangelist.
