He wrote the [[DeCSS]] software, which decodes the [[Content Scramble System]] used for [[DVD]] licensing enforcement. Johansen is a [[autodidact|self-trained]] [[software engineer]], who quit high school during his first year to spend more time with the DeCSS case. He moved to the United States and worked as a software engineer from October 2005 until November 2006.  He then moved to Norway but moved back to the United States in June 2007.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://nanocr.eu/about/ | title=About | publisher=nanocr.eu | first=Jon Lech | last=Johansen | year=2004 | accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nIn a post on his blog, he said that in the 1990s he started with a book (''Programming the 8086/8088''), the web (\"[[Fravia]]'s site was a goldmine\") and [[IRC]] (\"Lurked in a x86 assembly IRC channel and picked up tips from wise wizards.\")<ref>Jon Lech Johansen\u2019s blog, [http://nanocr.eu/2006/02/09/reverse-engineering/ \"Reverse Engineering\"], 2006-02-09. Retrieved on 2010-06-29.</ref>\n\n== DeCSS prosecution ==\nAfter Johansen released [[DeCSS]], he was taken to court in Norway for computer hacking in 2002. The prosecution was conducted by the [[Norwegian National Authority for the Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime]] (''\u00d8kokrim'' in Norwegian), after a complaint by the US [[DVD Copy Control Association]] (DVD-CCA) and the [[Motion Picture Association]] (MPA).  Johansen has denied writing the decryption code in DeCSS, saying that this part of the project originated from someone in Germany. He only developed the GUI component of the software. His defense was assisted by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. The trial opened in the [[Oslo District Court]] on 9 December 2002 with Johansen pleading not guilty to charges that had a maximum penalty of two years in prison or large fines. The defense argued that no illegal access was obtained to anyone else's information, since Johansen owned the [[DVD]]s himself. They also argued that it is legal under Norwegian law to make copies of such data for personal use. The verdict was announced on 7 January 2003, [[acquittal|acquitting]] Johansen of all charges.\n\nTwo further levels of [[appeal]]s were available to the prosecutors, to the appeals court and then to the Supreme Court. \u00d8kokrim filed an appeal on 20 January 2003 and it was reported on 28 February that the [[Borgarting Court of Appeal]] had agreed to hear the case. Johansen's second DeCSS trial began in Oslo on 2 December 2003, and resulted in an acquittal on 22 December 2003. \u00d8kokrim announced on 5 January 2004 that it would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court.\n\n==Other projects==\n{{proseline|section|date=December 2016}}\n\nIn the first decade of the 21st century, Johansen's career has included many other projects.\n\n===2001===\nIn 2001, Johansen released OpenJaz, a reverse-engineered set of drivers for Linux, BeOS and Windows 2000 that allow operation of the JazPiper MP3 digital audio player without its proprietary drivers.\n\n===2003===\nIn November 2003, Johansen released [[QTFairUse]], an open source program which dumps the raw output of a QuickTime Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) stream to a file, which could bypass the [[Digital Rights Management]] (DRM) software used to encrypt content of music from media such as those distributed by the iTunes Music Store, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]'s online music store.
