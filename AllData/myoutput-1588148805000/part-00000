The park contains the city's only remaining [[velodrome]], a lake of the same name, two war memorials, and various playgrounds and sports fields.\n\nThe site of Kissena Park was originally part of a tree nursery operated by Samuel Parsons in the late 19th century, though parts of the park were also the site of a [[Long Island Rail Road]] line. The lake on Parsons's property was named \"Kissena\", which comes from the [[Chippewa language]] meaning \"it is cold\", \"cold place\", or \"cool water\", and the park was later named after the lake. After Parsons died in 1906, part of his former nursery was incorporated in the modern-day park. The name \"Kissena Park\" can also refer to a residential section of Flushing just north of the park.\n\nKissena Park opened in 1910, and it was incorporated into [[Kissena Corridor Park]] in the mid-1950s. Various improvement projects have been conducted during Kissena Park's history, including the addition of the velodrome in 1962 and restorations of the lake in 1942 and 1983. Subsequently, the Kissena Velodrome was restored and rededicated in 2004, and a [[Korean War]] memorial was dedicated in 2007.\n\n==Description==\nKissena Park is bounded by Booth Memorial Avenue to the south; Kissena Boulevard to the west;  Rose, Oak, Underhill, and Lithonia Avenues to the north; and Fresh Meadows Lane to the east.<ref name=\"NYCPks-KissenaPark\" /> The south side of the park is mostly meadow land.<ref name=\"KissenaPk-WildSide-1988\" />{{Rp|5}} Kissena Park contains a small lake, Kissena Lake, on the northeast corner.

The park contains the city's only remaining [[velodrome]], a lake of the same name, two war memorials, and various playgrounds and sports fields.\n\nThe site of Kissena Park was originally part of a tree nursery operated by Samuel Parsons in the late 19th century, though parts of the park were also the site of a [[Long Island Rail Road]] line. The lake on Parsons's property was named \"Kissena\", which comes from the [[Chippewa language]] meaning \"it is cold\", \"cold place\", or \"cool water\", and the park was later named after the lake. After Parsons died in 1906, part of his former nursery was incorporated in the modern-day park. The name \"Kissena Park\" can also refer to a residential section of Flushing just north of the park.\n\nKissena Park opened in 1910, and it was incorporated into [[Kissena Corridor Park]] in the mid-1950s. Various improvement projects have been conducted during Kissena Park's history, including the addition of the velodrome in 1962 and restorations of the lake in 1942 and 1983. Subsequently, the Kissena Velodrome was restored and rededicated in 2004, and a [[Korean War]] memorial was dedicated in 2007.\n\n==Description==\nKissena Park is bounded by Booth Memorial Avenue to the south; Kissena Boulevard to the west;  Rose, Oak, Underhill, and Lithonia Avenues to the north; and Fresh Meadows Lane to the east.<ref name=\"NYCPks-KissenaPark\" /> The south side of the park is mostly meadow land.<ref name=\"KissenaPk-WildSide-1988\" />{{Rp|5}} Kissena Park contains a small lake, Kissena Lake, on the northeast corner.
