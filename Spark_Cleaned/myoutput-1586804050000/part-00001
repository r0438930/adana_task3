[[Brahma]] created an army of [[vanara]] (intelligent warrior monkeys) to aid Rama. Led by [[Nila (Ramayana)|Nila]] and under the engineering direction of [[Nala (Ramayana)|Nala]], the vanara constructed a bridge to Lanka in five days.\n\nRama crossed the sea on this bridge, and pursued Ravana for many days. He fired hundreds of golden arrows which became serpents that cut off Ravana's heads, but ultimately had to use the divine arrow of Brahma (which had the power of the gods in it and cannot miss its target) to slay Ravana.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/cult/inside/gallery/ravanadeath/ravanaheads.html |title=Ravana loses his heads |publisher=British Library |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hakai>{{cite web |url=https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/god-or-geology-genesis-rams-bridge/ |title=God or Geology?
