It was he who really began to shape the medieval town. In 1200 he obtained a market charter, arguably the earliest for a town in Wiltshire, and one of the earliest in England. His officials were to lay out [[burgage]] plots for traders, artisans, and shopkeepers. The outline of these plots can still be seen today in the footprints of some of the present shops in Fore Street.\n\nWithin Trowbridge Castle was a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon church. Henry de Bohun turned this to secular use and instead had a new church built outside the Castle; this was the first St James's Church. In the base of the tower of the present day church, below the subsequently added spire, can be seen the Romanesque architecture of the period.\n\nIn 1200 Henry de Bohun was created [[Earl of Hereford]] by King John. Like other barons, Henry was later threatened by King John and his caput of Trowbridge was taken from him. Henry then joined with the other barons to oppose John's arbitrary rule and forced him to seal [[Magna Carta]] (the Great Charter) at [[Runnymede]]; and was elected as one of the 25 enforcers of the charter. Some years after Runnymede, Henry regained control of Trowbridge.\n\n===Woollen cloth industry===\nTrowbridge developed as a centre for woollen cloth production from the 14th century. Thus before the start of the [[Tudor period]], the towns of south-west Wiltshire stood out from the rest of the county with all the signs of increasing wealth and prosperity during the period of trade recovery led by exports begun under Yorkist [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and, still more, during expansion under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], when England's annual woollen exports increased from some 60,000 to some 80,000 cloths of assize{{clarify|date=October 2016}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=102811 |title=The woollen industry before 1550 |editor=Elizabeth Crittall |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1959 |work=A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 4 |accessdate=27 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century, the production of woollen cloth became increasingly industrialised. However, mechanisation was resisted by workers in traditional trades; there were riots in 1785 and 1792 and again in the era of [[Luddite|Luddism]] (1811-1816) owing to the introduction of the [[flying shuttle]].<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=25149563|volume=55 |title= Machine-breaking in England and France during the Age of Revolution  |date=Spring 2005 |pages=143\u2013166 |author=Jeff Horn}}</ref> [[Thomas Helliker]], a shearman's apprentice, became one of the martyrs of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 1803 when he was hanged at Fisherton Jail [[Salisbury]].

It was he who really began to shape the medieval town. In 1200 he obtained a market charter, arguably the earliest for a town in Wiltshire, and one of the earliest in England. His officials were to lay out [[burgage]] plots for traders, artisans, and shopkeepers. The outline of these plots can still be seen today in the footprints of some of the present shops in Fore Street.\n\nWithin Trowbridge Castle was a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon church. Henry de Bohun turned this to secular use and instead had a new church built outside the Castle; this was the first St James's Church. In the base of the tower of the present day church, below the subsequently added spire, can be seen the Romanesque architecture of the period.\n\nIn 1200 Henry de Bohun was created [[Earl of Hereford]] by King John. Like other barons, Henry was later threatened by King John and his caput of Trowbridge was taken from him. Henry then joined with the other barons to oppose John's arbitrary rule and forced him to seal [[Magna Carta]] (the Great Charter) at [[Runnymede]]; and was elected as one of the 25 enforcers of the charter. Some years after Runnymede, Henry regained control of Trowbridge.\n\n===Woollen cloth industry===\nTrowbridge developed as a centre for woollen cloth production from the 14th century. Thus before the start of the [[Tudor period]], the towns of south-west Wiltshire stood out from the rest of the county with all the signs of increasing wealth and prosperity during the period of trade recovery led by exports begun under Yorkist [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and, still more, during expansion under [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], when England's annual woollen exports increased from some 60,000 to some 80,000 cloths of assize{{clarify|date=October 2016}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=102811 |title=The woollen industry before 1550 |editor=Elizabeth Crittall |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1959 |work=A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 4 |accessdate=27 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th century, the production of woollen cloth became increasingly industrialised.
