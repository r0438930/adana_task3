Rather than existing as separate individuals, people come together as dynamic groups to share resources and knowledge. It has also developed as a way of describing how an entire community comes together to share similar values. This has also been termed \"hive mind\", \"[[Collective intelligence|group mind]]\", \"'''mass mind'''\", and \"'''social mind'''\".<ref>John D. Greenwood ''The Disappearance of the Social in American Social Psychology'' 2004, p. 110</ref>\n\nAccording to a theory the character of collective consciousness depends on the type of mnemonic encoding used within a group (Tsoukalas, 2007). The specific type of encoding used has a predictable influence on the groups behavior and collective ideology. Informal groups, that meet infrequently and spontaneously, have a tendency to represent significant aspects of their community as episodic memories. This usually leads to strong social cohesion and solidarity, an indulgent atmosphere, an exclusive ethos and a restriction of social networks. Formal groups, that have scheduled and anonymous meetings, tend to represent significant aspects of their community as semantic memories which usually leads to weak social cohesion and solidarity, a more moderate atmosphere, an inclusive ethos and an expansion of social networks.<ref name=\"Tsoukalas\u00b42007\">Tsoukalas, I.

Engdahl, E. (1998) The Social Construction of Consciousness.

Burns and Egdahl note that during the [[Second World War]] different nations behaved differently [[the Holocaust|towards their Jewish populations]].<ref>Burns, T.R. Engdahl, E.

It is suggested that these different national behaviors vary according to the different collective consciousness between nations. This illustrates that differences in collective consciousness can have practical significance.\n\nEdmans, Garcia, and Norlia examined national sporting defeats and correlated them with decreases in the value of stocks.  They examined 1,162 football matches in thirty-nine countries and discovered that stock markets of those countries dropped on average forty-nine points after being eliminated from the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and thirty-one points after being eliminated in other tournaments.<ref>Edmans, A.

''[[Journal of Finance]]'' 62 (4) pp. 1967-1998.</ref> Edmans, Garcia, and Norli found similar but smaller effects with international [[cricket]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[ice hockey]], and [[basketball]] games.\n\n== In Durkheimian social theory ==\n\nDurkheim used the term in his books ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893), ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895), ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), and ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]'' (1912). In ''The Division of Labour'', Durkheim argued that in traditional/primitive societies (those based around clan, family or tribal relationships), [[totem]]ic religion played an important role in uniting members through the creation of a common consciousness (''conscience collective'' in the original French). In societies of this type, the contents of an individual's consciousness are largely shared in common with all other members of their society, creating a [[solidarity (sociology)|mechanical solidarity]] through mutual likeness.\n\n{{quote|The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own.

This relates to the concept of collective consciousness, as if there is a lack of integration or solidarity in society then suicide rates will be higher.<ref>Durkheim, E. Suicide, 1897.</ref>\n\n== Gramsci and collective consciousness ==\n\nAccording to Michelle Filippini\u2019s book ''Using Gramsci'', on [[Antonio Gramsci]], \u201cA collective consciousness, which is to say a living organism, is formed only after the unification of the multiplicity through friction on the part of the individuals; nor can one say that \u2018silence\u2019 is not a multiplicity.\u201d<ref>Filippini, Michelle. 2017. \u201cCollective Organisms.\u201d Pp. 58-59 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.</ref> Essentially, a form of collective consciousness can be based on fact that Gramsci\u2019s conception of [[hegemony]] vis-\u00e0-vis the hegemony of the [[ruling class]] played a role in mobilizing the collective consciousness of those who are [[oppressed]] by the ruling ideas of [[society]], or the ruling hegemony. Collective consciousness in this sense can refer to a [[multitude]] of different individual forms of consciousness coalescing into a greater whole. As to whether this whole is unified, this is up for debate. In Gramsci\u2019s view, a unified whole is composed of [[solidarity]] among its different constituent parts, and therefore, this whole cannot be uniformly the same. Rather, it can and should embrace different forms of consciousness (or individual experiences of social reality), which coexist to reflect the different experiences of the [[marginalized]] peoples in a given society. This is in accordance with Gramsci\u2019s theory of Marxism and [[class struggle]] applied to cultural contexts. [[Cultural Marxism]] (as distinguished from the right-wing use of the term) embodies the concept of collective consciousness. It incorporates [[social movements]] that are based on some sort of collective identity; these identities can include, for instance, [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and [[Aptitude|ability]], and can be incorporated by collective-based movements into a broader historical material analysis of class struggle.\n \nGramsci\u2019s theory of collective consciousness thus departs from conventional stereotypes of [[Marxism]] as being a purely deterministic, [[anti-humanist]] \u2018ideology.\u2019 Marxism is often attacked as being somewhat devoid of the interpersonal experiences of the subaltern. Yet, as Gramsci points out, \u201cModern politics thus \u2018abolishes the state as a federation of classes \u2013 but certain forms of the internal life of the subaltern classes are reborn as parties, trade unions, cultural associations.\u2019<big>6</big> \u201c<ref>Filippini, Michelle. 2017. \u201cCollective Organisms.\u201d Pp. 44 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.</ref> Thus, the essential collective consciousness of the [[subaltern]] manifests itself in the forms of free associations like the aforementioned as a unifying force of diversity in the realm of society and the state. The [[state (polity)|state]] itself is an entity that is made up of civil society, in which different groups compete for political power. Thus, a multiple collective consciousness can exist within the [[body politic]]. This collective consciousness is often used to advocate for basic [[human rights]] at the national and international level. Collective consciousness in these instances can lead to a greater [[social consciousness]] among people and can act as a reinforcing framework for Marxist thought.\n\nAccording to Filippini, \u201cThe nature and workings of collective organisms \u2013 not only parties, but also trade unions, associations and intermediate bodies in general \u2013 represent a specific sphere of reflection in the Prison Notebooks, particularly in regard to the new relationship between State and society that in Gramsci\u2019s view emerged during the age of mass politics.\u201d<ref>Filippini, Michelle. 2017. \u201cCollective Organisms.\u201d Pp. 43 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.</ref> Collective organisms can express collective consciousness. Whether this form of expression finds itself in the realm of the state or the realm of society is up to the direction that the subjects take in expressing their collective consciousness. In Gramsci\u2019s famous [[Prison Notebooks]], the ongoing conflict between [[civil society]], the [[bureaucracy]], and the state necessitates the emergence of a collective consciousness that can often act as an intermediary between these different realms. The public organizations of protest, such as [[labor unions]] and anti-war organizations, are vehicles that can unite multiple types of collective consciousness. Although identity-based movements are necessary for the progress of [[democracy]] and can generate collective consciousness, they cannot completely do so without a unifying framework. This is why [[anti-war]] and [[labor movements]] provide an avenue that has united various social movements under the banner of a multiple collective consciousness. This is also why future social movements need to have an [[ethos]] of collective consciousness if they are to succeed in the long-term.\n\n== Cognitive knowledge and collective consciousness ==\n\nAccording to Zukerfield, \u201cThe different disciplines that have studied knowledge share an understanding of it as a product of human subjects \u2013 individual, collective, etc.\u201d<ref>Zukerfield, M. 2017. \u201cHow to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.\u201d Pp. 31 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</ref> [[Knowledge]] in a sociological sense is derived from social conditions and [[social realities]]. Collective consciousness also reflects social realities, and sociological knowledge can be gained through the adoption of a collective consciousness. Many different disciplines such as [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] examine collective consciousness from different lenses. These different disciplines reach a similar understanding of a collective consciousness despite their different approaches to the subject. The inherent humanness in the idea of collective consciousness refers to a shared way of thinking among human beings in the pursuit of knowledge. Individual knowledge can be distinguished from collective knowledge by its emphasis on individual people as opposed to groups of people. Collective consciousness is thus group-oriented rather than individualistic.\n\nCollective consciousness, to some degree, can be distinguished from social consciousness. Indeed, according to Zukerfeld, \u201cthe problem is the integration of the subject in the web of 'social relations'. These, particularly those of production, are what determine \u2018social consciousness.\u2019 \u201c<ref>Zukerfeld, M. 2017. \u201cHow to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.\u201d Pp. 25 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</ref> If social consciousness is determined by social relations, then collective consciousness is determined by collective relations. There is a big difference between the two. Social relations refer to material, historically determined relations, primarily of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Exchange (economics)|exchange]], between people. Collective relations, on the other hand, refers to the co-existence of different groups of people or the 'collective'. Coexistence is what ultimately determines the level of collective consciousness in any given society. Societies with a higher level of collective consciousness are more likely to accept the principle of human [[cooperation]] versus the principle of human [[competition]].\n\nCollective consciousness can provide a new understanding of the relationship between [[self]] and society.  As Zukerfeld states, \u201cEven though it impels us, as a first customary gesture, to analyse the subjective (such as individual consciousness) or intersubjective bearers (such as the values of a given society), in other words those which Marxism and sociology examine, now we can approach them in an entirely different light.\u201d<ref>Zukerfeld, M. 2017. \u201cHow to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.\u201d Pp. 36 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</ref> Unlike previous modes of thought, \u201ccognitive materialism\u201d<ref>Zukerfeld, M. 2017. \u201cHow to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.\u201d Pp. 31 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</ref> is presented in the work by Zukerfeld as a sort of \u2018third way\u2019 between sociological knowledge and Marxism. Cognitive materialism is based on a kind of collective consciousness of the [[mind]]. This consciousness in turn can be used, with cognitive materialism as a guiding force, by human beings in order to critically analyze society and social conditions. [[Critical analysis]] will then spur collective action to solve these social problems. Once the goals of solving these problems have been achieved, the creation of a new, humane society will involve some degree of collective consciousness. Collective consciousness, in this case, is a mechanism to analyze subjective societal factors and integrate them into the overall framework of social analysis.\n\n== Collective consciousness in literary and oral tradition ==\nIn a work using a Serbian folk story as a case study on the collective experience of oral and literary traditions, Wolfgang Ernst examines collective consciousness in terms of forms of [[Media (communication)|media]]. \"Current discourse analysis drifts away from the 'culturalist turn' of the last two or three decades and its concern with individual and collective memory as an extended target of historical research\".<ref>Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. \"Electrified Voices: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory\".  Pp. 41 in ''Memory in Motion'', edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5.</ref> Despite this turn away from questions of individual and collective knowledge, there is still a collective consciousness present in terms of the shared appreciation of [[folk stories]] and [[oral traditions]]. Folk stories enable the subject and the audiences to come together around a common experience and a shared heritage. In the case of the Serbian folk \u201cgusle\u201d,<ref>Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. \u2018Electrified Voices\u2019: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.\u201d  Pp. 45 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5.</ref> the Serbian people take pride in this musical instrument of epic poetry and oral tradition and play it at social gatherings. Expressions of [[art]] and [[culture]] are, ultimately, expressions of a collective consciousness. They can also be expressions of multiple social realities. Regardless, a permeating collective consciousness exists in society and can be expressed through multiple modes of communication.\n\nCollective consciousness has a relationship with [[collective memory]]. \u201cCollective memory is thus no longer a reference to a remembered past but a way of analyzing the present as a collection of big (meta-)data in real-time for future prediction.\u201d<ref>Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. \u2018Electrified Voices\u2019: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.\u201d  Pp. 55 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5.</ref> In other words, the collective consciousness of the people, manifested through forms of [[literary]] and cultural media, can be quantified by [[big data]]. Big data can be a representation of collective consciousness insofar as it tries to quantify the experiences of the public on the Internet. However, there is a limit to quantifying social experiences. Collective consciousness that is independent of any sort of quantifiable data, namely through oral tradition, has always been a part of human culture and will continue to remain so. In the future, collective consciousness will also remain as a huge part of human society. However, the form it will take will be very different from the form it is taking now.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember the realness involved in creating a collective consciousness. [[Reality]] is socially defined, and is based on the social experiences of human beings. Indeed, as Ernst argues, \u201cPhonographic recordings of real voices irritate the historical consciousness of cultural memory.\u201d<ref>Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. \u2018Electrified Voices\u2019: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.\u201d  Pp. 51 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5.</ref> The emphasis laid here on [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is also what makes up the lived experience of collective consciousness. The authenticity of collective consciousness necessitates human participation in order to provide it with a deeper meaning. If reality is not authentic and does not represent the social experiences of the collective, collective consciousness will also cease to have any significant meaning. Rather, it will become submerged in favor of an inauthentic, [[artificial]] sense of reality and society. Therefore, the final attribute of collective consciousness is its fundamental essence of reality as opposed to unreality.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Society}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Abilene paradox]]\n* [[Agenda 21]]\n* [[Anonymous (group)]]\n* [[Antonio Gramsci]]\n* [[Borg (Star Trek)#Borg Collective|Borg Collective]]\n* [[Collective effervescence]]\n* [[Collective identity]]\n* [[Collective intelligence]]\n* [[Collective memory]]\n* [[Collective unconscious]]\n* [[Communal reinforcement]]\n* [[Crowd psychology]]\n* [[Deep social mind]]\n* [[Dharma|Pr\u00e1\u0144a Dharma]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ampsnews.org/portfolio/prana-dharma/|title=Pr\u00e1\u0144a Dharma-The Sine Qua Non of Human Existence|date=16 February 1967|location= [[Ranchi]], India| first = Prabhat Ranjan | last = Sarkar |author-link= Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar | work=[[PROUT]] in a Nutshell Part 6|publisher=\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Publications|accessdate=2015-03-02}}</ref>\n* [[Egregor]] \n* [[Global brain]]\n* [[Global goals]]\n* [[Group behaviour]]\n* [[Group mind (science fiction)|Group mind]]\n* [[Higher consciousness]]\n* [[Human spirit]]\n* [[Materialism]]\n* [[Noogenesis]]\n* [[Noosphere]]\n* [[Paradigm]]\n* [[Paradigm shift]]\n* [[Peer pressure]]\n* [[Reality tunnel]]\n* [[Schema (psychology)]]\n* [[Social rustice]]\n* [[Social representation]]\n* [[Superorganism]]\n* [[Unanimism]]\n* [[United Nations]]\n* [[Zeitgeist]]\n\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n; Works by Durkheim\n* ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893)\n* ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895)\n* ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]'' (1912)\n; Works by others\n* [[Gad Barzilai]], ''Communities and Law: Politics and Cultures of Legal Identities'' University of Michigan Press, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-472-03079-8}}\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Ernst\n  | first = Wolfgang\n  |editor= Ina Blom |editor2=Trond Lundemo |editor3=Eivind R\u00f8ssaak\n  | title = Memory in Motion\n  | publisher = [[Amsterdam University Press]]\n  | year = 2017\n  | location = Amsterdam\n  | pages = 41\u201359 }}\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Filippini\n  | first = Michelle\n  | title = Using Gramsci\n  | publisher = [[Pluto Press]]\n  | year = 2017\n  | location = London\n  | pages = 43\u201364 }}\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Zukerfeld\n  | first = Mariano\n  | title = Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism\n  | publisher = [[University of Westminster Press]]\n  | year = 2017\n  | location = London\n  | pages = 32\u201351 }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Jary\n  | first = David\n  | authorlink = \n  | author2 = Julia Jary\n  | title = Collins Dictionary of Sociology\n  | publisher = [[Harper Collins]]\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = Glasgow\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/collinsdictionar0000jary/page/774\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 978-0-00-470804-1\n  | page = [https://archive.org/details/collinsdictionar0000jary/page/774 774]\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n\n  | last = Williams\n  | first = Swatos (editor)\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = \u00c9mile Durkheim\n  | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion and Society\n  | publisher = Altamira Press\n  | year = 1998\n  | url = http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/durkheim.htm\n  | format = Web and Print\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2007-02-03 }}\n* {{cite news\n\n  | last = Lloyd\n  | first = Annemaree\n  | title = Guarding Against Collective Amnesia?

(1998) The Social Construction of Consciousness.

It is suggested that these different national behaviors vary according to the different collective consciousness between nations. This illustrates that differences in collective consciousness can have practical significance.\n\nEdmans, Garcia, and Norlia examined national sporting defeats and correlated them with decreases in the value of stocks.  They examined 1,162 football matches in thirty-nine countries and discovered that stock markets of those countries dropped on average forty-nine points after being eliminated from the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], and thirty-one points after being eliminated in other tournaments.<ref>Edmans, A.

''[[Journal of Finance]]'' 62 (4) pp. 1967-1998.</ref> Edmans, Garcia, and Norli found similar but smaller effects with international [[cricket]], [[rugby football|rugby]], [[ice hockey]], and [[basketball]] games.\n\n== In Durkheimian social theory ==\n\nDurkheim used the term in his books ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893), ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895), ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), and ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]'' (1912). In ''The Division of Labour'', Durkheim argued that in traditional/primitive societies (those based around clan, family or tribal relationships), [[totem]]ic religion played an important role in uniting members through the creation of a common consciousness (''conscience collective'' in the original French). In societies of this type, the contents of an individual's consciousness are largely shared in common with all other members of their society, creating a [[solidarity (sociology)|mechanical solidarity]] through mutual likeness.\n\n{{quote|The totality of beliefs and sentiments common to the average members of a society forms a determinate system with a life of its own. It can be termed the collective or common consciousness.|[[Emile Durkheim]]<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-108\">{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Allan|author2=Kenneth D.

This relates to the concept of collective consciousness, as if there is a lack of integration or solidarity in society then suicide rates will be higher.<ref>Durkheim, E. Suicide, 1897.</ref>\n\n== Gramsci and collective consciousness ==\n\nAccording to Michelle Filippini\u2019s book ''Using Gramsci'', on [[Antonio Gramsci]], \u201cA collective consciousness, which is to say a living organism, is formed only after the unification of the multiplicity through friction on the part of the individuals; nor can one say that \u2018silence\u2019 is not a multiplicity.\u201d<ref>Filippini, Michelle. 2017. \u201cCollective Organisms.\u201d Pp. 58-59 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.</ref> Essentially, a form of collective consciousness can be based on fact that Gramsci\u2019s conception of [[hegemony]] vis-\u00e0-vis the hegemony of the [[ruling class]] played a role in mobilizing the collective consciousness of those who are [[oppressed]] by the ruling ideas of [[society]], or the ruling hegemony. Collective consciousness in this sense can refer to a [[multitude]] of different individual forms of consciousness coalescing into a greater whole. As to whether this whole is unified, this is up for debate. In Gramsci\u2019s view, a unified whole is composed of [[solidarity]] among its different constituent parts, and therefore, this whole cannot be uniformly the same. Rather, it can and should embrace different forms of consciousness (or individual experiences of social reality), which coexist to reflect the different experiences of the [[marginalized]] peoples in a given society. This is in accordance with Gramsci\u2019s theory of Marxism and [[class struggle]] applied to cultural contexts. [[Cultural Marxism]] (as distinguished from the right-wing use of the term) embodies the concept of collective consciousness. It incorporates [[social movements]] that are based on some sort of collective identity; these identities can include, for instance, [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Race (human categorization)|race]], and [[Aptitude|ability]], and can be incorporated by collective-based movements into a broader historical material analysis of class struggle.\n \nGramsci\u2019s theory of collective consciousness thus departs from conventional stereotypes of [[Marxism]] as being a purely deterministic, [[anti-humanist]] \u2018ideology.\u2019 Marxism is often attacked as being somewhat devoid of the interpersonal experiences of the subaltern. Yet, as Gramsci points out, \u201cModern politics thus \u2018abolishes the state as a federation of classes \u2013 but certain forms of the internal life of the subaltern classes are reborn as parties, trade unions, cultural associations.\u2019<big>6</big> \u201c<ref>Filippini, Michelle. 2017. \u201cCollective Organisms.\u201d Pp. 44 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.</ref> Thus, the essential collective consciousness of the [[subaltern]] manifests itself in the forms of free associations like the aforementioned as a unifying force of diversity in the realm of society and the state. The [[state (polity)|state]] itself is an entity that is made up of civil society, in which different groups compete for political power. Thus, a multiple collective consciousness can exist within the [[body politic]]. This collective consciousness is often used to advocate for basic [[human rights]] at the national and international level. Collective consciousness in these instances can lead to a greater [[social consciousness]] among people and can act as a reinforcing framework for Marxist thought.\n\nAccording to Filippini, \u201cThe nature and workings of collective organisms \u2013 not only parties, but also trade unions, associations and intermediate bodies in general \u2013 represent a specific sphere of reflection in the Prison Notebooks, particularly in regard to the new relationship between State and society that in Gramsci\u2019s view emerged during the age of mass politics.\u201d<ref>Filippini, Michelle. 2017. \u201cCollective Organisms.\u201d Pp. 43 in Using Gramsci. London: Pluto Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1h64kxd.9.</ref> Collective organisms can express collective consciousness. Whether this form of expression finds itself in the realm of the state or the realm of society is up to the direction that the subjects take in expressing their collective consciousness. In Gramsci\u2019s famous [[Prison Notebooks]], the ongoing conflict between [[civil society]], the [[bureaucracy]], and the state necessitates the emergence of a collective consciousness that can often act as an intermediary between these different realms. The public organizations of protest, such as [[labor unions]] and anti-war organizations, are vehicles that can unite multiple types of collective consciousness. Although identity-based movements are necessary for the progress of [[democracy]] and can generate collective consciousness, they cannot completely do so without a unifying framework. This is why [[anti-war]] and [[labor movements]] provide an avenue that has united various social movements under the banner of a multiple collective consciousness. This is also why future social movements need to have an [[ethos]] of collective consciousness if they are to succeed in the long-term.\n\n== Cognitive knowledge and collective consciousness ==\n\nAccording to Zukerfield, \u201cThe different disciplines that have studied knowledge share an understanding of it as a product of human subjects \u2013 individual, collective, etc.\u201d<ref>Zukerfield, M. 2017. \u201cHow to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.\u201d Pp. 31 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</ref> [[Knowledge]] in a sociological sense is derived from social conditions and [[social realities]]. Collective consciousness also reflects social realities, and sociological knowledge can be gained through the adoption of a collective consciousness. Many different disciplines such as [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] examine collective consciousness from different lenses. These different disciplines reach a similar understanding of a collective consciousness despite their different approaches to the subject. The inherent humanness in the idea of collective consciousness refers to a shared way of thinking among human beings in the pursuit of knowledge. Individual knowledge can be distinguished from collective knowledge by its emphasis on individual people as opposed to groups of people. Collective consciousness is thus group-oriented rather than individualistic.\n\nCollective consciousness, to some degree, can be distinguished from social consciousness. Indeed, according to Zukerfeld, \u201cthe problem is the integration of the subject in the web of 'social relations'. These, particularly those of production, are what determine \u2018social consciousness.\u2019 \u201c<ref>Zukerfeld, M. 2017. \u201cHow to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.\u201d Pp. 25 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</ref> If social consciousness is determined by social relations, then collective consciousness is determined by collective relations. There is a big difference between the two. Social relations refer to material, historically determined relations, primarily of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Exchange (economics)|exchange]], between people. Collective relations, on the other hand, refers to the co-existence of different groups of people or the 'collective'. Coexistence is what ultimately determines the level of collective consciousness in any given society. Societies with a higher level of collective consciousness are more likely to accept the principle of human [[cooperation]] versus the principle of human [[competition]].\n\nCollective consciousness can provide a new understanding of the relationship between [[self]] and society.  As Zukerfeld states, \u201cEven though it impels us, as a first customary gesture, to analyse the subjective (such as individual consciousness) or intersubjective bearers (such as the values of a given society), in other words those which Marxism and sociology examine, now we can approach them in an entirely different light.\u201d<ref>Zukerfeld, M. 2017. \u201cHow to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.\u201d Pp. 36 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</ref> Unlike previous modes of thought, \u201ccognitive materialism\u201d<ref>Zukerfeld, M. 2017. \u201cHow to Know Knowledge? Introducing Cognitive Materialism.\u201d Pp. 31 in Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism. London: University of Westminster Press. URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv6zd9v0.6. License: CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0</ref> is presented in the work by Zukerfeld as a sort of \u2018third way\u2019 between sociological knowledge and Marxism. Cognitive materialism is based on a kind of collective consciousness of the [[mind]]. This consciousness in turn can be used, with cognitive materialism as a guiding force, by human beings in order to critically analyze society and social conditions. [[Critical analysis]] will then spur collective action to solve these social problems. Once the goals of solving these problems have been achieved, the creation of a new, humane society will involve some degree of collective consciousness. Collective consciousness, in this case, is a mechanism to analyze subjective societal factors and integrate them into the overall framework of social analysis.\n\n== Collective consciousness in literary and oral tradition ==\nIn a work using a Serbian folk story as a case study on the collective experience of oral and literary traditions, Wolfgang Ernst examines collective consciousness in terms of forms of [[Media (communication)|media]]. \"Current discourse analysis drifts away from the 'culturalist turn' of the last two or three decades and its concern with individual and collective memory as an extended target of historical research\".<ref>Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. \"Electrified Voices: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory\".  Pp. 41 in ''Memory in Motion'', edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5.</ref> Despite this turn away from questions of individual and collective knowledge, there is still a collective consciousness present in terms of the shared appreciation of [[folk stories]] and [[oral traditions]]. Folk stories enable the subject and the audiences to come together around a common experience and a shared heritage. In the case of the Serbian folk \u201cgusle\u201d,<ref>Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. \u2018Electrified Voices\u2019: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.\u201d  Pp. 45 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5.</ref> the Serbian people take pride in this musical instrument of epic poetry and oral tradition and play it at social gatherings. Expressions of [[art]] and [[culture]] are, ultimately, expressions of a collective consciousness. They can also be expressions of multiple social realities. Regardless, a permeating collective consciousness exists in society and can be expressed through multiple modes of communication.\n\nCollective consciousness has a relationship with [[collective memory]]. \u201cCollective memory is thus no longer a reference to a remembered past but a way of analyzing the present as a collection of big (meta-)data in real-time for future prediction.\u201d<ref>Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. \u2018Electrified Voices\u2019: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.\u201d  Pp. 55 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5.</ref> In other words, the collective consciousness of the people, manifested through forms of [[literary]] and cultural media, can be quantified by [[big data]]. Big data can be a representation of collective consciousness insofar as it tries to quantify the experiences of the public on the Internet. However, there is a limit to quantifying social experiences. Collective consciousness that is independent of any sort of quantifiable data, namely through oral tradition, has always been a part of human culture and will continue to remain so. In the future, collective consciousness will also remain as a huge part of human society. However, the form it will take will be very different from the form it is taking now.\n\nFinally, it is important to remember the realness involved in creating a collective consciousness. [[Reality]] is socially defined, and is based on the social experiences of human beings. Indeed, as Ernst argues, \u201cPhonographic recordings of real voices irritate the historical consciousness of cultural memory.\u201d<ref>Ernst, Wolfgang. 2017. \u2018Electrified Voices\u2019: Non-Human Agencies of Socio-Cultural Memory.\u201d  Pp. 51 in Memory in Motion, edited by Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak. Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press.  https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1jd94f0.5.</ref> The emphasis laid here on [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is also what makes up the lived experience of collective consciousness. The authenticity of collective consciousness necessitates human participation in order to provide it with a deeper meaning. If reality is not authentic and does not represent the social experiences of the collective, collective consciousness will also cease to have any significant meaning. Rather, it will become submerged in favor of an inauthentic, [[artificial]] sense of reality and society. Therefore, the final attribute of collective consciousness is its fundamental essence of reality as opposed to unreality.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Society}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Abilene paradox]]\n* [[Agenda 21]]\n* [[Anonymous (group)]]\n* [[Antonio Gramsci]]\n* [[Borg (Star Trek)#Borg Collective|Borg Collective]]\n* [[Collective effervescence]]\n* [[Collective identity]]\n* [[Collective intelligence]]\n* [[Collective memory]]\n* [[Collective unconscious]]\n* [[Communal reinforcement]]\n* [[Crowd psychology]]\n* [[Deep social mind]]\n* [[Dharma|Pr\u00e1\u0144a Dharma]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ampsnews.org/portfolio/prana-dharma/|title=Pr\u00e1\u0144a Dharma-The Sine Qua Non of Human Existence|date=16 February 1967|location= [[Ranchi]], India| first = Prabhat Ranjan | last = Sarkar |author-link= Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar | work=[[PROUT]] in a Nutshell Part 6|publisher=\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Publications|accessdate=2015-03-02}}</ref>\n* [[Egregor]] \n* [[Global brain]]\n* [[Global goals]]\n* [[Group behaviour]]\n* [[Group mind (science fiction)|Group mind]]\n* [[Higher consciousness]]\n* [[Human spirit]]\n* [[Materialism]]\n* [[Noogenesis]]\n* [[Noosphere]]\n* [[Paradigm]]\n* [[Paradigm shift]]\n* [[Peer pressure]]\n* [[Reality tunnel]]\n* [[Schema (psychology)]]\n* [[Social rustice]]\n* [[Social representation]]\n* [[Superorganism]]\n* [[Unanimism]]\n* [[United Nations]]\n* [[Zeitgeist]]\n\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n; Works by Durkheim\n* ''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' (1893)\n* ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895)\n* ''[[Suicide (Durkheim book)|Suicide]]'' (1897)\n* ''[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]'' (1912)\n; Works by others\n* [[Gad Barzilai]], ''Communities and Law: Politics and Cultures of Legal Identities'' University of Michigan Press, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-472-03079-8}}\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Ernst\n  | first = Wolfgang\n  | editors = Ina Blom, Trond Lundemo, and Eivind R\u00f8ssaak\n  | title = Memory in Motion\n  | publisher = [[Amsterdam University Press]]\n  | year = 2017\n  | location = Amsterdam\n  | pages = 41\u201359 }}\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Filippini\n  | first = Michelle\n  | title = Using Gramsci\n  | publisher = [[Pluto Press]]\n  | year = 2017\n  | location = London\n  | pages = 43\u201364 }}\n* {{cite book\n\n  | last = Zukerfeld\n  | first = Mariano\n  | title = Knowledge in the Age of Digital Capitalism: An Introduction to Cognitive Materialism\n  | publisher = [[University of Westminster Press]]\n  | year = 2017\n  | location = London\n  | pages = 32\u201351 }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Jary\n  | first = David\n  | authorlink = \n  | author2 = Julia Jary\n  | title = Collins Dictionary of Sociology\n  | publisher = [[Harper Collins]]\n  | year = 1991\n  | location = Glasgow\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/collinsdictionar0000jary/page/774\n  | doi = \n  | isbn = 978-0-00-470804-1\n  | page = [https://archive.org/details/collinsdictionar0000jary/page/774 774]\n  }}\n* {{cite web\n\n  | last = Williams\n  | first = Swatos (editor)\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = \u00c9mile Durkheim\n  | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Religion and Society\n  | publisher = Altamira Press\n  | year = 1998\n  | url = http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/durkheim.htm\n  | format = Web and Print\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2007-02-03 }}\n* {{cite news\n\n  | last = Lloyd\n  | first = Annemaree\n  | title = Guarding Against Collective Amnesia?
