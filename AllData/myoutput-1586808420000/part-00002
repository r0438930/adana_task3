The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>\n\nFor surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>\n\nThe boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>\n\n==War service==\n[[File:Hms g8 submarine.jpg|thumb|left|Submarine ''G8'' (on right) moored alongside 10th Flotilla's [[depot ship]] {{HMS|Lucia}} during World War I]]\nLike the rest of her class, ''G8''\u2032s role was to patrol the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[submarine]]s.\n\n''G8'' belonged to the 10th Flotilla during her war service, but also operated out of [[Scapa Flow]] during most of 1917. Her patrol areas were from north of [[Shetland]] to [[Norway]], the [[Skagerrak]], the [[Kattegat]], and the [[Horns Reef]]. She also made one patrol out of [[Harwich]] for the 9th Flotilla in August 1916 before joining the Tees Flotilla.\n\nHer two [[commanding officer]]s were [[Lieutenant (naval)|Lieutenant]] Charles de Burgh from 30 June 1916 to 30 July 1917 and Lieutenant John F. Tryon from 30 July 1917 until her loss.\n\nHer last patrol began from Tees on 27 December 1917, leaving with the submarine {{HMS|G12||6}} and the [[destroyer]] {{HMS|Medea||6}} for the [[Kattegat]]. She was ordered to start her voyage back on 3 January 1918 or possibly 48 hours later, returning to Tees on or around 6 January 1918. She did not return and was never heard from again. She was officially declared missing on 14 January 1918. The cause remains unknown, but she was found with depth rudders pointing towards the surface, which suggests that the men aboard were trying to get to the surface. Therefore it is thought that a technical error led to the sinking.
