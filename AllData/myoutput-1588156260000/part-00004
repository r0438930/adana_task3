{"title_page": "Non-English-based programming languages", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{cleanup|reason=List inclusion criteria.|date=February 2015}}\n'''Non-English-based programming languages''' are [[programming language]]s that do not use keywords taken from or inspired by [[English language|English]] vocabulary.\n\n== Prevalence of English-based programming languages ==\n{{further|English in computing}}\n\nThe use of the [[English language|English]] language in the inspiration for the choice of elements, in particular for [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s in computer programming languages and code libraries, represents a significant trend in the history of language design. According to the HOPL online database of languages,<ref>In HOPL (History of Programming Languages), advanced search finds languages by country.</ref> out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the [[United States]]<!-- I searched for all US entries, then counted pages, multiplied by entries per page -->, 600 in the [[United Kingdom]], 160 in [[Canada]], and 75 in [[Australia]].\n\nThus, over a third of all programming languages have been developed in countries where English is the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] from the [[Netherlands]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] from [[Japan]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] from [[Brazil]]), and situations where it was based on another language which used English.\n\n== International programming languages ==\nThe concept of international style programming languages was inspired by the work of British [[computer scientist]]s [[Christopher Strachey]], [[Peter Landin]], and others. It represents a class of languages of which the line of the algorithmic languages [[ALGOL]] was exemplary.\n\n[[ALGOL 68]]'s standard document was published in numerous [[natural languages]]. The standard allowed the internationalization of the programming language. On December 20, 1968, the \"Final Report\" (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of [[UNESCO]]'s [[IFIP]] for publication. Translations of the standard were made for [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and then later [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The standard was also available in [[Braille]]. ALGOL 68 went on to become the [[GOST|GOST/\u0413\u041e\u0421\u0422]]-27974-88 standard in the [[Soviet Union]].\n* GOST 27974-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 \u2013 \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u041b\u0413\u041e\u041b 68<ref>{{cite web |url= http://vak.ru/lib/exe/fetch.php/book/gost/pdf/gost-27974-88.pdf |title= GOST 27974-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 - \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u041b\u0413\u041e\u041b 68 |language= Russian |year= 1988 |publisher= [[GOST]] |accessdate= November 15, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170324231641/http://vak.ru/lib/exe/fetch.php/book/gost/pdf/gost-27974-88.pdf |archive-date= March 24, 2017 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n* GOST 27975-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 extended \u2013 \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u041b\u0413\u041e\u041b 68 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439<ref>\n{{cite web | url=http://vak.ru/lib/exe/fetch.php/book/gost/pdf/gost-27975-88.pdf\n | title=GOST 27975-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 extended - \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u041b\u0413\u041e\u041b 68 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439\n | language=Russian | year=1988 | publisher=[[GOST]]\n | accessdate=November 15, 2008 }}</ref>\nIn English, Algol68's case statement reads '''case''' ~ '''in''' ~ '''out''' ~ '''esac'''.

According to the HOPL online database of languages,<ref>In HOPL (History of Programming Languages), advanced search finds languages by country.</ref> out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the [[United States]]<!-- I searched for all US entries, then counted pages, multiplied by entries per page -->, 600 in the [[United Kingdom]], 160 in [[Canada]], and 75 in [[Australia]].\n\nThus, over a third of all programming languages have been developed in countries where English is the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] from the [[Netherlands]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] from [[Japan]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] from [[Brazil]]), and situations where it was based on another language which used English.\n\n== International programming languages ==\nThe concept of international style programming languages was inspired by the work of British [[computer scientist]]s [[Christopher Strachey]], [[Peter Landin]], and others. It represents a class of languages of which the line of the algorithmic languages [[ALGOL]] was exemplary.\n\n[[ALGOL 68]]'s standard document was published in numerous [[natural languages]]. The standard allowed the internationalization of the programming language. On December 20, 1968, the \"Final Report\" (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of [[UNESCO]]'s [[IFIP]] for publication. Translations of the standard were made for [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and then later [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The standard was also available in [[Braille]].
