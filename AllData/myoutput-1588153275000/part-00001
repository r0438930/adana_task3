It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked.  The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player.  Players alternate turns calling \"shots\" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.\n\n''Battleship'' is known worldwide as a [[pencil and paper game]] which dates from [[World War I]]. It was published by various companies as a pad-and-pencil game in the 1930s, and was released as a plastic [[board game]] by [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] in 1967.  The game has spawned electronic versions, video games, smart device apps and a [[Battleship (film)|film]].\n\n==History==\nThe game of ''Battleship'' is thought to have its origins in the French game ''[[L'Attaque]]'' played during [[World War I]], although parallels have also been drawn to E. I. Horsman's 1890 game ''Basilinda'',<ref name=\"hinebaugh\">{{cite book | title=A Board Game Education | publisher=R&L Education | author=Hinebaugh, Jeffrey P. | year=2009 | ISBN=9781607092605}}</ref> and the game is said to have been played by Russian officers before World War I.<ref name=\"milwaukee\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19310701&id=QKtQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KCIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3803,4154106 | title=Salvo Is New Game With a Nautical Air | work=The Milwaukee Journal | date=1 July 1931 | accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> The first commercial version of the game was ''Salvo'', published in 1931 in the United States by the Starex company. Other versions of the game were printed in the 1930s and 1940s, including the Strathmore Company's ''Combat: The Battleship Game'', [[Milton Bradley]]'s ''Broadsides: A Game of Naval Strategy'' and Maurice L. Freedman's ''Warfare Naval Combat''. Strategy Games Co. produced a version called ''Wings'' which pictured planes flying over the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]]. All of these early editions of the game consisted of pre-printed pads of paper.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/>\n\n[[File:Flickr - Official U.S. Navy Imagery - Sailors play \"Battleship\" aboard a carrier..jpg|thumb|Players in a ''Battleship'' tournament aboard a U.S. Navy vessel]]\n\nIn 1967 Milton Bradley introduced a version of the game that used plastic boards and pegs. Conceived by Ed Hutchins, play was on pegboards using miniature plastic ships. In 1977, Milton Bradley also released a computerized ''Electronic Battleship'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4122|title=Electronic Battleship|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref> followed in 1989 by ''Electronic Talking Battleship''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4781|title=Electronic Talking Battleship|website=BoardGameGeek}}</ref> In 2008, an updated version of ''Battleship'' was released, using hexagonal tiles. In the updated version, each player's board contains several [[island]]s on which \"captured man\" figurines can be placed. Ships may be placed only around the islands, and only in the player's half of the board. When the movie ''[[Battleship (film)|Battleship]]'' was released, the board game reverted to the original 1967 style. The 2008 updated version is still available as ''Battleship Islands''.\n\n''Battleship'' was one of the earliest games to be produced as a computer game, with a version being released for the [[Compucolor II|Z80 Compucolor]] in 1979.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/><ref>http://titan.apiit.edu.my/pagol/projectinfo.asp?txtID=TP010249{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Many computer editions of the game have been produced since. In ''[[Clubhouse Games]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]], ''Battleship'' is known as ''Grid Attack''. It is played on an 8\u00d78 grid, and includes slight variations, such as 4-player gameplay, and various ship sizes and shapes. Versions of ''Battleship'' appear as applications on numerous social networking services.\n\n''Battleship'' was also part of ''[[Hasbro Family Game Night]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Wii]], as well as the [[Xbox 360]] (Xbox Live Arcade). These alter the rules, including the size of the grid (8\u00d712 in the [[NES]] version, 8\u00d78 in the [[Game Boy]] version), size of ships (it is common to feature a submarine that takes up a single square) and special shot missiles for each ship. For example, in the NES version the cruiser has a five-shot missile which strikes five squares in an X pattern on the grid in one turn. Submarine-tracking sonar and aerial [[reconnaissance]] to spot ships are also features.\n\nA [[Family Game Night (TV series)#Battleship|minigame version of ''Battleship'']] was used in the third season of [[The Hub (TV channel)|The Hub]]'s ''[[Family Game Night (TV series)|Family Game Night]]'', which uses a 5\u00d75 grid and the first team to sink three ships wins the game.\n\nIn 2012, the [[military science fiction]] action movie ''[[Battleship (film)|Battleship]]'' was released, which was inspired by the board game. A version of ''Battleship'' based on the movie was released in which one side had alien ship playing pieces.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Battleships Paper Game.svg|thumb|upright|A typical pen-and-paper version of the game, showing the large \"primary\" grid and the smaller \"tracking\" grid]]\n\nThe game is played on four [[Grid (spatial index)|grids]], two for each player. The grids are typically square \u2013 usually 10\u00d710 \u2013 and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boardgames.about.com/od/salvo/a/rules.htm|title=Salvo - Complete Rules for Battleships Game|publisher=}}</ref> On one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. On the other grid the player records their own shots.\n\nBefore play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically. The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). The types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player. These may vary depending on the  rules.\n\nThe 1990 Milton Bradley version of the rules specify the following ships:<ref name=\"hasbro\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! No.\n! Class of ship\n! Size\n|-\n|1\n|[[Aircraft carrier|Carrier]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n|-\n|2\n|[[Battleship]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4\n|-\n|3\n|[[Cruiser]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|4\n|[[Submarine]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|5\n|[[Destroyer]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n|}\n\nIn 2002, Hasbro renamed the Cruiser as ''Destroyer'', taking three squares, and substituted a new two-square ship called the ''Patrol Boat''.<ref>https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/BattleShip_(2002).PDF</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! No.\n! Class of ship\n! Size\n|-\n|1\n|[[Aircraft carrier|Carrier]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n|-\n|2\n|[[Battleship]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 4\n|-\n|3\n|[[Destroyer]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|4\n|[[Submarine]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 3\n|-\n|5\n|[[Patrol boat|Patrol Boat]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 2\n|}\n\n\n\nAfter the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship. If it is a \"hit\", the player who is hit marks this on their own or \"ocean\" grid (with a red peg in the pegboard version). The attacking player marks the hit or miss on their own \"tracking\" or \"target\" grid with a pencil marking in the paper version of the game, or the appropriate color peg in the pegboard version (red for \"hit\", white for \"miss\"), in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.\n\nWhen all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship's owner announces the sinking of the Carrier, Submarine, Cruiser/Destroyer/Patrol Boat, or the titular Battleship. If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins. If all ships of both players are sunk by the end of the round, the game is a draw.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/>\n\n==Variations==\nIn the 1931 ''Salvo'' edition of the game, players target a specified number of squares at one time, and all of the squares are attacked simultaneously. A player may initially target five (one for each battleship) squares per turn, and this is decreased as ships are lost.<ref name=\"milwaukee\"/> In other variants of this mechanic, the number of shots a player is allowed to fire each turn may either be fixed at five for the whole game, be equal to the number of unsunk ships belonging to the player, or be equal to the size of the player's largest undamaged ship.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/> The receiving player may either call the result of each shot in turn, or simply announce, say, \"two hits and three misses\", leaving their opponent to work out the consequences of the salvo.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/> In the modern Milton Bradley rules for ''Battleship'', ''Salvo'' is listed as a variation \"for more experienced players\", with the number of shots being equal to the number of ships that the firing player has remaining.<ref name=\"hasbro\">{{cite web | url=http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/battleship.pdf | title=Battleship Rules | publisher=Hasbro | accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nOne variant of Battleship allows players to decline to announce that a ship has been sunk, requiring their opponent to take further shots in order to confirm that an area is clear.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/> Another house rule allows a player to move one of their ships to a new, uncalled location every fourth or fifth move.<ref name=\"hinebaugh\"/>\n\nAnother variant allows multiple players and allow different shapes for the ships as long as each square of a ship touches at least one other square of that ship.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6U7XKG1Dps</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[BattleFleet (game series)|''BattleFleet'' (game series)]]\n* [[Battleship (1993 video game)|''Battleship'' (1993 video game)]]\n* [[Battleship (2012 video game)|''Battleship'' (2012 video game)]]\n* [[Battleship (puzzle)]]\n* [[Battleships (video game)|''Battleships'' (video game)]]\n* ''[[Electronic Battleship: Advanced Mission]]''\n* ''[[Mugwump (game)|Mugwump]]'', a 1973 computer game\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Battleship (game)}}\n* [http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/BattleShip_(2002).PDF Battleship Official Hasbro Rules] \u2013 Rulebook insert for ''Battleship'' (2002 version)\n*{{bgg|2425|Battleship}}\n\n{{Hasbro}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battleship (Game)}}\n[[Category:Children's games]]\n[[Category:Paper-and-pencil games]]\n[[Category:Milton Bradley Company games]]\n[[Category:Games and sports introduced in 1931]]\n[[Category:Board games introduced in 1967]]\n[[Category:Guessing games]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses|Battleship (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:Battleship game board.svg|thumb|A map of one player's ships and the hits against them, from a game in progress.
