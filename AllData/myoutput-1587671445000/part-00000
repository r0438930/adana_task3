Many M\u00e9tis felt Canada was not protecting their rights, their land and their survival as a distinct people. Riel had been invited to lead the movement of protest. He turned it into a military action with a heavily religious tone. This alienated Catholic clergy, whites, most Indigenous tribes and some M\u00e9tis. But he had the allegiance of a couple hundred armed M\u00e9tis, a smaller number of other Indigenous warriors and at least one white man at Batoche in May 1885, confronting 900 Canadian militia plus some armed local residents. About 91 people would die in the fighting that occurred that spring, before the rebellion's collapse.<ref name=\"James Rodger Miller 2004 44\">{{cite book|author=James Rodger Miller|title=Reflections on Native-newcomer Relations: Selected Essays|url=https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonnat0000mill|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonnat0000mill/page/44 44]}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas Flanagan 2000 pp 3-4\">Thomas Flanagan, ''Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered'' (2000) pp 3-4</ref><ref>Robert MacIntosh, Boilermakers on the Prairies, p. 16</ref>\n\nDespite some notable early victories at [[Battle of Duck Lake|Duck Lake]], [[Battle of Fish Creek|Fish Creek]] and [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife]], the rebellion ended when overwhelming government numbers and a critical shortage of supplies brought about the M\u00e9tis' defeat in the four-day [[Battle of Batoche|Siege of Batoche]].

The railway had been completed across the prairies in 1883, though sections were still under construction north of Lake Superior, making it easier for the government to get troops into the area. In addition, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) had been created, developing an armed local force. Riel lacked support from English settlers of the area as well as the great majority of tribes. Riel's claim that God had sent him back to Canada as a prophet caused Catholic officials (who saw it as heresy) to try to minimize his support.

His trial sparked a national controversy between [[English Canada|English]] and [[French Canada]].<ref name=\"The Rebellion of 1885\"/>\n\nThe [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) played a key role in the government's response to the Rebellion, as it was able to transport federal troops to the area quickly. While it had taken three months to get troops to the Red River Rebellion, the government was able to move forces in nine days by train in response to events in the North-West Territories. The successful operation increased political support for the floundering and incomplete railway, which had been close to financial collapse. The government authorized enough funds to finish the line. Thus, Prime Minister [[John A. Macdonald]] was able to realize his National Dream of linking Canada across the continent.\n\nAfter the fighting, new Territorial Council ridings were created in the Territories, although still only covering specific areas of concentrated settlement. The [[1885 Northwest Territories election|North-West Territories election of 1885]] was held.

The French language and Catholic religion faced increasing marginalisation in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba, as exemplified by the emerging controversy surrounding the [[Manitoba Schools Question]]. The M\u00e9tis themselves were increasingly forced to live on undesirable land or in the shadow of [[Indian reserve]]s (as they did not themselves have treaty status as Indians with a right to land).\n\nRiel's trial and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting upset in Quebec, and led to a fundamental francophone distrust of Anglophone politicians.

Many M\u00e9tis felt Canada was not protecting their rights, their land and their survival as a distinct people. Riel had been invited to lead the movement of protest. He turned it into a military action with a heavily religious tone. This alienated Catholic clergy, whites, most Indigenous tribes and some M\u00e9tis. But he had the allegiance of a couple hundred armed M\u00e9tis, a smaller number of other Indigenous warriors and at least one white man at Batoche in May 1885, confronting 900 Canadian militia plus some armed local residents. About 91 people would die in the fighting that occurred that spring, before the rebellion's collapse.<ref name=\"James Rodger Miller 2004 44\">{{cite book|author=James Rodger Miller|title=Reflections on Native-newcomer Relations: Selected Essays|url=https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonnat0000mill|url-access=registration|year=2004|publisher=University of Toronto Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonnat0000mill/page/44 44]}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas Flanagan 2000 pp 3-4\">Thomas Flanagan, ''Riel and the Rebellion: 1885 Reconsidered'' (2000) pp 3-4</ref><ref>Robert MacIntosh, Boilermakers on the Prairies, p. 16</ref>\n\nDespite some notable early victories at [[Battle of Duck Lake|Duck Lake]], [[Battle of Fish Creek|Fish Creek]] and [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife]], the rebellion ended when overwhelming government numbers and a critical shortage of supplies brought about the M\u00e9tis' defeat in the four-day [[Battle of Batoche|Siege of Batoche]]. The remaining Aboriginal allies scattered. Riel was captured and put on trial. He was convicted of treason and despite many pleas across Canada for amnesty, he was hanged.

The railway had been completed across the prairies in 1883, though sections were still under construction north of Lake Superior, making it easier for the government to get troops into the area. In addition, the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (NWMP) had been created, developing an armed local force. Riel lacked support from English settlers of the area as well as the great majority of tribes. Riel's claim that God had sent him back to Canada as a prophet caused Catholic officials (who saw it as heresy) to try to minimize his support. The Catholic priest, [[Albert Lacombe]], worked to obtain assurances from [[Crowfoot]] that his [[Blackfoot]] warriors would not participate in a rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|title=The Early West|year=1957|publisher=Historical Society of Alberta|location=Edmonton|page=21|url=http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=245933|access-date=2013-10-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904074848/http://www.ourfutureourpast.ca/loc_hist/page.aspx?id=245933|archive-date=2015-09-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Location_map+\n|Canada Saskatchewan|relief=yes \n| width = 275\n| float = right\n| caption = The [[District of Saskatchewan]] in 1885 (within the black diamonds) included the central section of Saskatchewan and extended into present-day Alberta and Manitoba.

After Duck Lake, the government immediately commenced the mobilization of some of Canada's ill-equipped part-time militia units (the [[Non-Permanent Active Militia]]), as well as the units of cavalry, artillery and infantry regulars that made up the tiny [[Permanent Active Militia]], Canada's almost-nonexistent regular army. By March 30, after hasty mobilization in Toronto, two trains containing the [[The Royal Regiment of Canada|10th Royal Grenadiers]] and [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada|Queen's Own Rifles]] militia battalions were ready to leave Toronto. Other militia units, the 9th [[Les Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec|Voltigeurs]] from Quebec City, and the [[Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal|65th Mount Royal Rifles]] from Montreal, were also quickly mobilized. Soon every major city in the East was the scene of embarkation for inexperienced young militiamen cheered by immense crowds.\n\nThe first militia to struggle westward had to contend with the many lengthy breaks in the CPR line in northern Ontario. They marched through snow, or were carried in exposed sleighs. Where there were short stretches of track, the militia rode on hastily-constructed railroad flatcars which did nothing to shelter them from the extreme cold. Many of the soldiers suffered greatly from the winter weather.
