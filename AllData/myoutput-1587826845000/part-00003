In the 1850s Minnesota was on the [[American frontier]] and lacked trained teachers.  Winona settler Dr. John Ford lobbied the [[Minnesota Legislature]] to establish normal schools and rallied more than $5,000 in local donations to establish the state's first such institution.<ref name=Gaut>{{cite journal |last=Gaut |first=Greg |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Model School Building and College Hall of the Winona Normal School |url=http://www.mnhs.org/shpo/nrhp/docs_pdfs/0061_winonanormalschool.pdf |publisher=National Park Service |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>  It was also the first tax-funded school west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=History>{{cite web |title=Winona State History |url=http://www.winona.edu/history.asp |publisher=Winona State University |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>\n\nClasses at the Winona Normal School began in September 1860, but the following year most of the male students as well as the principal and other staff left to serve in the [[American Civil War]].  The school closed in March 1862 due to the Civil War, then for another two years due to the [[Sioux]] War of 1862.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of St. Cloud Teachers College|last=Brainard|first=Dudley S.|publisher=St. Cloud State University|year=1953|isbn=|location=St. Cloud State University Institutional Repository|pages=3}}</ref> Its first class graduated in 1866.  The program soon added a [[laboratory school]] in which local children received education from faculty while students observed or, occasionally, led lessons themselves.  The normal school quickly outgrew its original four-room building, but state funding and local donations of money and a plot of land led to the construction of a proper facility in 1869.<ref name=Gaut />\n\nThe campus expanded with two new wings on \"Old Main\" in 1894, a library/gymnasium/kindergarten building\u2014Ogden Hall\u2014in 1909, and a women's dormitory\u2014Morey Hall\u2014in 1910.

Winona State University provides scholarship opportunities for International Students.\n\n'''Cross-Cultural Scholarship'''\n\nThe Cross-Cultural Scholarship offers International Students the ability to pay at the resident rate of tuition. Scholarship recipients share their culture with Americans as part of the requirement of the Cross-Cultural Outreach Program.\n\nThe Cross-Cultural Scholarship is available to all International students who qualify for admission at Winona State University and hold a F-1 Student Visa. These scholarships are equivalent to the difference between the resident rate of tuition and non-resident rate of tuition. Since tuition is based on a tuition band, the amount of the scholarship for the Academic Year of 2004 - 2005 is valued at an estimate of USD $4,534 based on 24 - 36 semester credits. Fall enrollees receive the scholarship for the academic year and Summer School. Spring Semester enrollees receive the scholarship for Spring Semester and Summer School.\n\nApplication And Renewal Process For Cross Cultural Scholarship\nProspective International Students are invited to apply for the Cross-Cultural Scholarship by completing the application. The application will be reviewed as soon as it is received and a decision will be made concerning your possible selection as a scholarship recipient. An award letter clarifying the details of the scholarship will accompany the I-20 form at the time of Admission. Renewing the scholarship for your second year at the University is a simple process by completing the following:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.winona.edu/international-services/ccs-scholarship.asp|title=International Services}}</ref>\n\n- Maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.50 (maximum length of scholarship is 9 semesters)\n\n- Maintain a valid F-1 or J-1 Immigration Status\n\n- Complete (3) Cross-Cultural Outreach projects during the academic year, starting in the fall and ending in the spring semester. These projects are called Minor Projects (2) and Major Project (1), for a total of three (3) projects.\n\nThe Cross-Cultural scholarship is a substantial source of savings for International Students.\n\n'''Presidential Honor Scholarship'''\n\nPresidential Honor Scholarships at Winona State University are designed especially for International Student freshmen with no transfer credits. Students must provide ORIGINAL TOEFL or SAT score to be eligible for the Presidential Honor Scholarship\n\nApplication And Renewal Process for the Presidential Honor Scholarship\nProspective International Students are invited to apply for the Presidential Honor Scholarship by completing the application.

In the 1850s Minnesota was on the [[American frontier]] and lacked trained teachers.  Winona settler Dr. John Ford lobbied the [[Minnesota Legislature]] to establish normal schools and rallied more than $5,000 in local donations to establish the state's first such institution.<ref name=Gaut>{{cite journal |last=Gaut |first=Greg |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Model School Building and College Hall of the Winona Normal School |url=http://www.mnhs.org/shpo/nrhp/docs_pdfs/0061_winonanormalschool.pdf |publisher=National Park Service |date=2013-05-17 |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>  It was also the first tax-funded school west of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref name=History>{{cite web |title=Winona State History |url=http://www.winona.edu/history.asp |publisher=Winona State University |accessdate=2015-07-07}}</ref>\n\nClasses at the Winona Normal School began in September 1860, but the following year most of the male students as well as the principal and other staff left to serve in the [[American Civil War]].  The school closed in March 1862 due to the Civil War, then for another two years due to the [[Sioux]] War of 1862.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of St. Cloud Teachers College|last=Brainard|first=Dudley S.|publisher=St. Cloud State University|year=1953|isbn=|location=St. Cloud State University Institutional Repository|pages=3}}</ref> Its first class graduated in 1866.  The program soon added a [[laboratory school]] in which local children received education from faculty while students observed or, occasionally, led lessons themselves.  The normal school quickly outgrew its original four-room building, but state funding and local donations of money and a plot of land led to the construction of a proper facility in 1869.<ref name=Gaut />\n\nThe campus expanded with two new wings on \"Old Main\" in 1894, a library/gymnasium/kindergarten building\u2014Ogden Hall\u2014in 1909, and a women's dormitory\u2014Morey Hall\u2014in 1910.

Winona State University provides scholarship opportunities for International Students.\n\n'''Cross-Cultural Scholarship'''\n\nThe Cross-Cultural Scholarship offers International Students the ability to pay at the resident rate of tuition. Scholarship recipients share their culture with Americans as part of the requirement of the Cross-Cultural Outreach Program.\n\nThe Cross-Cultural Scholarship is available to all International students who qualify for admission at Winona State University and hold a F-1 Student Visa. These scholarships are equivalent to the difference between the resident rate of tuition and non-resident rate of tuition. Since tuition is based on a tuition band, the amount of the scholarship for the Academic Year of 2004 - 2005 is valued at an estimate of USD $4,534 based on 24 - 36 semester credits. Fall enrollees receive the scholarship for the academic year and Summer School. Spring Semester enrollees receive the scholarship for Spring Semester and Summer School.\n\nApplication And Renewal Process For Cross Cultural Scholarship\nProspective International Students are invited to apply for the Cross-Cultural Scholarship by completing the application. The application will be reviewed as soon as it is received and a decision will be made concerning your possible selection as a scholarship recipient. An award letter clarifying the details of the scholarship will accompany the I-20 form at the time of Admission. Renewing the scholarship for your second year at the University is a simple process by completing the following:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.winona.edu/international-services/ccs-scholarship.asp|title=International Services}}</ref>\n\n- Maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.50 (maximum length of scholarship is 9 semesters)\n\n- Maintain a valid F-1 or J-1 Immigration Status\n\n- Complete (3) Cross-Cultural Outreach projects during the academic year, starting in the fall and ending in the spring semester. These projects are called Minor Projects (2) and Major Project (1), for a total of three (3) projects.\n\nThe Cross-Cultural scholarship is a substantial source of savings for International Students.\n\n'''Presidential Honor Scholarship'''\n\nPresidential Honor Scholarships at Winona State University are designed especially for International Student freshmen with no transfer credits. Students must provide ORIGINAL TOEFL or SAT score to be eligible for the Presidential Honor Scholarship\n\nApplication And Renewal Process for the Presidential Honor Scholarship\nProspective International Students are invited to apply for the Presidential Honor Scholarship by completing the application.
