[[Covalent bond]]s are generally formed between two nonmetals. There are several types of covalent bonds: in [[Chemical polarity#Polarity of molecules|polar covalent bonds]], electrons are more likely to be found around one of the two atoms, whereas in nonpolar covalent bonds, electrons are evenly shared. [[Homonuclear molecule|Homonuclear]] [[diatomic molecule]]s are purely covalent. The polarity of a covalent bond is determined by the [[Electronegativity|electronegativities]] of each atom and thus a polar covalent bond has a [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] pointing from the partial positive end to the partial negative end.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Helmenstine |first1=Anne Marie|title=Understand What a Covalent Bond Is in Chemistry|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-covalent-bond-604414|website=ThoughtCo}}</ref> Polar covalent bonds represent an intermediate type in which the electrons are neither completely transferred from one atom to another nor evenly shared.\n\n===Metallic bond===\n[[Metallic bond]]s generally form within a pure metal or metal [[alloy]].
