At the time, Yaquina Bay frontage was the primary destination of visitors to Newport. Nye Beach lacked any approach by road and was edged by cliffs. A stream (Nye Creek), had carved an opening in the sea cliff, an access point that would become the heart of the Nye Beach district. This spot later became known as \"the Turnaround.\"\n\nBy the 1890s, summer vacationers found their way to Nye Creek. In 1891, a boardwalk connected Nye Creek to the bay front. Within two years, the boardwalk had become a road, and summer crowds gathered on the beach at Nye Creek for band concerts and other entertainment.\n\nNye Beach attracted artists, writers and students of natural science. This tradition dates back to 1896 when a four-day summer teachers' conference was held in Newport.  In 1897, a group of summer residents associated with various colleges and known as the Summer Educational Association (SEA) achieved the building of an auditorium in the Nye Creek area. Summer teaching sessions were held for four seasons between 1897 and 1902. Classes in \"Science, Music, Mirth, Art and Religion\" were offered. SEA summer sessions were discontinued in 1903, but the reputation of Nye Creek as a mecca for the literary, scholarly and artistic was established. The SEA auditorium fell into disuse and was demolished in 1910, its lumber probably reused to build summer cabins.<ref>Price, Richard L.

The enthusiastic building of vacation beach cottages continued through 1920s, with guests arriving from Albany by train, ferryboat, and \"coaches\" (buses). Visitors to Nye Creek could choose lodgings from the Rose City Cottages, the Panama Cottages, the Sunny Side, the Cherry City Cottages, the Hub Cottages, Sunset Cottages, Linger Longer Lodge, the Model Campground, the Nicolai Hotel and the Hotel Gilmore.\n\nEarly transportation to Newport had relied mainly on rail, with trains from [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] arriving at [[Yaquina City, Oregon|Yaquina City]], where passengers could board a ferryboat to Yaquina Bay. Optimism for Newport's early growth was based on the expectation that the railway would eventually reach Newport. It never did. In 1928, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] stopped service to Yaquina City. This may have put a temporary damper on the tourist business, but by 1930 highway projects were underway that would make the area more accessible than ever.\n\nConstruction of the [[Roosevelt Highway (Oregon)|\"Roosevelt\" Highway (now Coast Highway)]] began in 1919. It was to run the length of the Oregon Coast. Newport would soon have a highway connection with Lincoln City to the north and with Waldport to the south (though ferries were required to cross both Yaquina Bay and Alsea Bay).\n\nThe new Salmon River Highway (now Highway 18) would connect Grand Ronde and Otis (north of Lincoln City), opening a new route to the coastal highway.\n\nBy 1936 bridges across the Rogue River, Alsea River, Yaquina Bay, Coos Bay, and Umpqua River were all complete and the Oregon Coast was fully accessible to automobile traffic.\n\nThroughout the 1940s,  Nye Beach continued to evolve its unique character. During World War II, the beach was patrolled by blimps and by local citizens with dogs and rifles, guarding the country from the threat of marine invasion. Also in the 1940s some distinctive homes were built, contributing to what became known as the \"Nye Beach style.\" Many of these homes have endured, for example, the Grand Victorian, now a bed-and-breakfast.\n\nThe Graphic Novel ''Gilmore By the Sea'' by Ed Cameron describes 1980s Nye Beach as a rough and tumble neighborhood.<ref>[http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2011/07/graphic_novel_chronicles_a_time_gone_by_at_newports_gilmore_by_the_sea_hotel.html Graphic novel chronicles a time gone by at Newport's 'Gilmore by the Sea' hotel]</ref> But by the twenty-first century, Nye Beach was on its way to becoming a self-conscious community with its own merchant organization, modern architecture and community cultural events. In 2007 the multimillion-dollar ''Archway Place'' with upscale shopping at ground level and costly condos on its second and third floors was constructed on the former site of ''Cozy Corner Confectionery'' (a 1920s grocery). Similar projects followed. The densely commercial Coast Street was refurbished with retro paving stones and custom curbs. Two cement archways were constructed over the approach to the Turnaround and behind the Visual Arts Center.\n\nFew of the historic cottages survived. Some are rentals or shops, though most have fallen to the demand for renovation. Many were replaced in the 1980s by condominiums. Others later yielded ground to modern hotels like the ''Elizabeth Street Inn'' and the Inn at Nye Beach], the first hotel on the Oregon coast designed to minimize its environmental impact via such things as a 58-panel solar array that can produce over 16,000 watts of electricity.<ref>http://www.innatnyebeach.com/green-initiatives.php</ref> Built in 2010, the Inn at Nye Beach (formerly the Greenstone Inn) acquired the site of the original Hub Cottages (later known as the Viking's Cottages, for decades the oldest continuously operating motel in Oregon).\n\nIn the 21st century, the Performing Arts Center(1988) and the Visual Arts Center(1985) share their neighborhood with the Yaquina Art Gallery.  Rare book stores, boutiques, an astrologer, spas, galleries, bistros, pubs, wine shops, and restaurants share the scene with an animal hospital, a historic laundry, a real estate office, and an ambulance service.\n\n==People==\n\n===John Nye===\nJohn Nye was born in Ohio in 1832. In 1859 he headed west with a team oxen which he traded for horses in Salt Lake City, Utah. He reached Corvallis, Oregon in 1860. After plying several trades, including a stint at the Rock Creek mines in British Columbia, soldiering in the Union Army, and road building on present-day Highway 20, he found his way to the Oregon coast.\n\nIn 1865 he acquired a homestead on the section of land known afterward as Nye Creek and later as Nye Beach. He built a cabin at what would be the corner of Brook and Third Streets in Nye Beach. He probably attempted mining the creek, which ran by his cabin. After 19 months, he had fulfilled the homestead residence requirement. Then he traveled to Indiana, married Olive Kist, returned to Oregon and settled for a time in Corvallis. When Nye had his coastal property platted, he named Olive Street after his bride. In 1874 the Nyes returned to Newport, moving onto another homestead property, east of town. On those {{convert|160|acre|ha}}, he and Olive farmed, raised eight children, and lived for the rest of their lives.\n\nJohn Nye sold the Nye Creek claim to developer Sam Irvin in 1880.<ref>[http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=sbenton&id=I23284 Pioneers of Benton County: John Nye]</ref> Irvin promoted Newport tourism in the 1880s.\n\n===Ed Seidler===\nIn 1901 Ed Seidler built the original bathhouse at Nye Creek, now the Nye Beach Turnaround.\n\n===John Minthorn===\nIn 1902 Minthorn, a physician, established a sanitarium in Nye Creek.
