2017</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Paramount Pictures]] has been involved in the pay television industry since the 1950s. From 1953 to 1961, Paramount owned [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], an ambitious but expensive theater television system that transmitted using [[closed-circuit television|closed circuitry]] \u2013 as opposed to broadcast frequencies \u2013 over which customers could purchase broadcasts by inserting coins into a collection box.\n\nIn April 1980, Paramount (then owned by [[Gulf and Western|Gulf+Western]]), [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios]], [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] partnered with [[Getty Oil]] to jointly develop a pay cable service called Premiere. The proposed channel would have maintained exclusive first-run rights to newer feature films distributed by each of the studios (which would have aired nine months before to their initial telecasts on other premium channels), along with carrying films cherry-picked from other studios without any exclusivity. Displeased that the venture would likely give the four studios disproportionate control of the pay television marketplace, [[Time-Life]], [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]] and [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]]/[[TelePrompTer Corporation|TelePrompTer]] (the then respective owners of [[HBO]], [[The Movie Channel]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]) proceeded to file an antitrust lawsuit against the studios with the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] later that year. After reviewing the case, the Justice Department issued an injunction blocking Premiere's planned January 1, 1981 launch, deeming the venture to be an illegal boycott of the existing pay services that would subject them to possible financial damage if its presence resulted in price fixing of film titles. Paramount, MCA, Fox and Columbia decided to scrap the venture after the ruling was handed down.<ref>{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|date=January 1, 1985|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1982, MCA/Universal and Gulf+Western reached an agreement with [[Warner Communications]] to each acquire 25% interests in The Movie Channel, a struggling pay service then-owned by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, a cable television venture of Warner and [[American Express]] that would retain the remaining 25%. This proposal was driven by the studios wanting to increase revenue received from licensing their films to premium television services, and industry concerns that dominant premium service HBO would hold undue negotiating power for these rights through its acquisitions of film titles prior to their theatrical release. In January 1983, the proposal was amended to include Viacom International, which proposed to consolidate The Movie Channel  and Showtime (of which Viacom had acquired the 50% interest inherited by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W Cable]] through its prior merger with TelePrompTer for $75 million in August 1982) into one unit. Four of the partners would respectively own 22.58% of both networks, with American Express owning the remaining 9.68%. As with the earlier Premiere proposal, the Justice Department subjected the proposal to regulatory scrutiny as Warner, Universal and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services; the 30% share that would be held by the Showtime-TMC combination would have also formed an oligopoly in the pay cable market with HBO and [[Cinemax]] (which, even with the presence of smaller competitors at the time like [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Home Theater Network]], controlled the remaining 60% of the market).<ref>{{cite news|title=5 COMPANIES IN VENTURE TO RUN 2 PAY-TV UNITS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/08/business/5-companies-in-venture-to-run-2-pay-tv-units.html|author=Sally Bedell|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 8, 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|page=167|date=January 1, 1985|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe proposal was revised twice to address these issues and others cited by HBO executives in responses to a civil antitrust lawsuit against the Showtime-Movie Channel merger that was filed by the Justice Department on June 10, 1983. This culminated in Paramount and Universal being dropped from the partnership in the final revision submitted on July 28, 1983; Warner Communications, Viacom and Warner-Amex became the only partners remaining in the proposal, which a Justice Department memorandum cited would \"prevent any anti-competitive effect [against other premium services wishing to enter the market] from arising,\" currying the Department's formal approval of the proposal on August 13 (three weeks before it was finalized on September 6). Shortly afterward, Paramount signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Showtime, which had already maintained a licensing deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that gave the service exclusive pay cable rights to MGM's films.<ref name=\"ParamountSues\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=MGM/UA, Showtime renew deal|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR116021/|author=Christian Moerk|author2=John Dempsey|periodical=Variety|publisher=[[Fairchild Publications]]|date=November 22, 1993|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBoth of Showtime's tenures with Paramount ended in acrimony. In the spring of 1989, Paramount struck an exclusive licensing agreement with HBO; subsequently that May, Paramount filed a lawsuit against [[Showtime Networks]], its parent Viacom, and the corporate parent of both entities, [[National Amusements]] over Showtime's alleged refusal to pay a total of $88 million in fees for five films \u2013 all of which had underperformed in their theatrical release \u2013 to reduce the minimum liability for its 75-film package from the studio.<ref name=\"ParamountSues\">{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Paramount Sues Viacom Over Fees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/12/business/the-media-business-paramount-sues-viacom-over-fees.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 12, 1989|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> Showtime regained first-run pay cable rights to Paramount's films through a seven-year distribution deal signed in May 1995, in a byproduct of Viacom's merger with Paramount Pictures parent [[Paramount Communications]] the year prior; this agreement gave the services of Showtime Networks \u2013 Showtime, The Movie Channel and [[Flix (TV network)|Flix]] \u2013 exclusive rights to all films released by the studio from 1997 onward starting in January 1998, following the expiration of Paramount's contract with HBO.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Showtime Networks (SNI) and Paramount Pictures announce exclusive output deal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Showtime+Networks+%28SNI%29+and+Paramount+Pictures+announce+exclusive...-a016877979|agency=[[Business Wire]]|via=The Free Library|date=May 18, 1995|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) signed an exclusive first-run premium cable rights agreement with Showtime in 1981, encompassing the studio's films and releases through its [[United Artists]] subsidiary; Showtime and MGM renewed this agreement in April 1985 (for ten years, initially split with HBO and [[Cinemax]]),<ref>{{cite news|title=CABLE TV NOTES; EXPERIMENTATION SHAPES 'CAST IRON TV'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/14/arts/cable-tv-notes-experimentation-shapes-cast-iron-tv.html|author=Steve Schneider|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 14, 1985|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> September 1993 (for six years, with an extension signed in March 1998),<ref>{{cite news|title=MGM/UA, Showtime renew deal|url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/mgm-ua-showtime-renew-deal-116021/|author=Christian Moerk|author2=John Dempsey|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=November 22, 1993|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MGM, Showtime re-up|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/mgm-showtime-re-up-1117468574/|author=Ray Richmond|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=March 9, 1998|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> and in April 2000 (for nine years).

2017</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[Paramount Pictures]] has been involved in the pay television industry since the 1950s. From 1953 to 1961, Paramount owned [[Telemeter (pay television)|Telemeter]], an ambitious but expensive theater television system that transmitted using [[closed-circuit television|closed circuitry]] \u2013 as opposed to broadcast frequencies \u2013 over which customers could purchase broadcasts by inserting coins into a collection box.\n\nIn April 1980, Paramount (then owned by [[Gulf and Western|Gulf+Western]]), [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]/[[Universal Studios]], [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[20th Century Fox]] partnered with [[Getty Oil]] to jointly develop a pay cable service called Premiere. The proposed channel would have maintained exclusive first-run rights to newer feature films distributed by each of the studios (which would have aired nine months before to their initial telecasts on other premium channels), along with carrying films cherry-picked from other studios without any exclusivity. Displeased that the venture would likely give the four studios disproportionate control of the pay television marketplace, [[Time-Life]], [[Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment]] and [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]]/[[TelePrompTer Corporation|TelePrompTer]] (the then respective owners of [[HBO]], [[The Movie Channel]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]) proceeded to file an antitrust lawsuit against the studios with the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] later that year. After reviewing the case, the Justice Department issued an injunction blocking Premiere's planned January 1, 1981 launch, deeming the venture to be an illegal boycott of the existing pay services that would subject them to possible financial damage if its presence resulted in price fixing of film titles. Paramount, MCA, Fox and Columbia decided to scrap the venture after the ruling was handed down.<ref>{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|date=January 1, 1985|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1982, MCA/Universal and Gulf+Western reached an agreement with [[Warner Communications]] to each acquire 25% interests in The Movie Channel, a struggling pay service then-owned by Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment, a cable television venture of Warner and [[American Express]] that would retain the remaining 25%. This proposal was driven by the studios wanting to increase revenue received from licensing their films to premium television services, and industry concerns that dominant premium service HBO would hold undue negotiating power for these rights through its acquisitions of film titles prior to their theatrical release. In January 1983, the proposal was amended to include Viacom International, which proposed to consolidate The Movie Channel  and Showtime (of which Viacom had acquired the 50% interest inherited by [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W Cable]] through its prior merger with TelePrompTer for $75 million in August 1982) into one unit. Four of the partners would respectively own 22.58% of both networks, with American Express owning the remaining 9.68%. As with the earlier Premiere proposal, the Justice Department subjected the proposal to regulatory scrutiny as Warner, Universal and Paramount received 50% of their respective total revenue from film releases and licensing fees from premium services; the 30% share that would be held by the Showtime-TMC combination would have also formed an oligopoly in the pay cable market with HBO and [[Cinemax]] (which, even with the presence of smaller competitors at the time like [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo]] and [[Home Theater Network]], controlled the remaining 60% of the market).<ref>{{cite news|title=5 COMPANIES IN VENTURE TO RUN 2 PAY-TV UNITS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/08/business/5-companies-in-venture-to-run-2-pay-tv-units.html|author=Sally Bedell|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 8, 1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Joint Ventures, Alliances, and Corporate Strategy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JeY_afXHSnEC&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Kathryn Rudie Harrigan|publisher=Beard Books|page=167|date=January 1, 1985|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Hollywood in the Information Age: Beyond the Silver Screen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuuuBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78#v=onepage&q&f=false|author=Janet Wasko|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|page=167|date=June 26, 2013|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe proposal was revised twice to address these issues and others cited by HBO executives in responses to a civil antitrust lawsuit against the Showtime-Movie Channel merger that was filed by the Justice Department on June 10, 1983. This culminated in Paramount and Universal being dropped from the partnership in the final revision submitted on July 28, 1983; Warner Communications, Viacom and Warner-Amex became the only partners remaining in the proposal, which a Justice Department memorandum cited would \"prevent any anti-competitive effect [against other premium services wishing to enter the market] from arising,\" currying the Department's formal approval of the proposal on August 13 (three weeks before it was finalized on September 6). Shortly afterward, Paramount signed an exclusive distribution agreement with Showtime, which had already maintained a licensing deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that gave the service exclusive pay cable rights to MGM's films.<ref name=\"ParamountSues\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=MGM/UA, Showtime renew deal|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR116021/|author=Christian Moerk|author2=John Dempsey|periodical=Variety|publisher=[[Fairchild Publications]]|date=November 22, 1993|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBoth of Showtime's tenures with Paramount ended in acrimony. In the spring of 1989, Paramount struck an exclusive licensing agreement with HBO; subsequently that May, Paramount filed a lawsuit against [[Showtime Networks]], its parent Viacom, and the corporate parent of both entities, [[National Amusements]] over Showtime's alleged refusal to pay a total of $88 million in fees for five films \u2013 all of which had underperformed in their theatrical release \u2013 to reduce the minimum liability for its 75-film package from the studio.<ref name=\"ParamountSues\">{{cite news|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Paramount Sues Viacom Over Fees|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/12/business/the-media-business-paramount-sues-viacom-over-fees.html|author=Geraldine Fabrikant|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=May 12, 1989|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> Showtime regained first-run pay cable rights to Paramount's films through a seven-year distribution deal signed in May 1995, in a byproduct of Viacom's merger with Paramount Pictures parent [[Paramount Communications]] the year prior; this agreement gave the services of Showtime Networks \u2013 Showtime, The Movie Channel and [[Flix (TV network)|Flix]] \u2013 exclusive rights to all films released by the studio from 1997 onward starting in January 1998, following the expiration of Paramount's contract with HBO.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Showtime Networks (SNI) and Paramount Pictures announce exclusive output deal|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Showtime+Networks+%28SNI%29+and+Paramount+Pictures+announce+exclusive...-a016877979|agency=[[Business Wire]]|via=The Free Library|date=May 18, 1995|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) signed an exclusive first-run premium cable rights agreement with Showtime in 1981, encompassing the studio's films and releases through its [[United Artists]] subsidiary; Showtime and MGM renewed this agreement in April 1985 (for ten years, initially split with HBO and [[Cinemax]]),<ref>{{cite news|title=CABLE TV NOTES; EXPERIMENTATION SHAPES 'CAST IRON TV'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/04/14/arts/cable-tv-notes-experimentation-shapes-cast-iron-tv.html|author=Steve Schneider|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 14, 1985|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> September 1993 (for six years, with an extension signed in March 1998),<ref>{{cite news|title=MGM/UA, Showtime renew deal|url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/mgm-ua-showtime-renew-deal-116021/|author=Christian Moerk|author2=John Dempsey|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=November 22, 1993|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=MGM, Showtime re-up|url=https://variety.com/1998/biz/news/mgm-showtime-re-up-1117468574/|author=Ray Richmond|periodical=Variety|publisher=Cahners Business Information|date=March 9, 1998|accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref> and in April 2000 (for nine years).
