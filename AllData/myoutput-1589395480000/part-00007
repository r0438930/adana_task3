The 54th Battalion, as the most depleted battalion in the 14th Brigade, was chosen for amalgamation and was merged with the 56th Battalion on 11 October forming the \"54th/56th Battalion\".{{sfn|54th Battalion ||}} In response, the battalion's enlisted soldiers briefly went on strike in an effort to maintain their battalion identity, before complying with the order. Ultimately, the newly merged unit did not see any action before the war ended in November 1918. During the winter, the 54th/56th billeted at [[Charleroi]], as the demobilisation process began.{{sfn|Dickinson|1939|p=24}} As its personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia and its numbers dwindled, the amalgamated battalion was also merged with the rest of the 14th Brigade into one unit, with the 54th/56th Battalion disbanding on 10 April 1919.{{sfn|56th Battalion ||}} During the fighting, the 54th Battalion lost 544 killed in action or died on active service and 1,592 wounded.{{sfn|54th Battalion ||}} A total of 16 [[battle honour]]s were bestowed upon the 54th for its involvement in the war in 1927.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=111}}\n\n===Inter-war years and World War II===\nThe battalion was reformed in 1921 as a unit of the [[Australian Army Reserve|Citizens Forces]], Australia's part-time military force, following a re-organisation of the Army to perpetuate the numerical designations of the AIF.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=125}} Based in New South Wales, it drew personnel from the 2nd Battalion, 54th Infantry Regiment and the 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment. In 1927, when territorial titles were adopted by the Army, the battalion became known as the \"Lachlan-Macquarie Regiment\", due to its location in the [[New South Wales]] region of the [[Lachlan River|Lachlan]] and [[Macquarie River]]s,{{sfn|Northern Star|13 July 1929|p=3}} which were named after [[Lachlan Macquarie]], a former governor of New South Wales; at the same time the battalion adopted the motto of ''Deo Patriae Tigi''.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=111}} Upon formation, the Citizen Forces battalions were maintained through a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service; however, in 1929, the Universal Training Scheme was abolished by the [[James Scullin|Scullin]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=125 & 138}} As a result, in a decline in numbers, on 1 July 1929, the battalion was amalgamated with the [[20th Battalion (Australia)|20th Battalion]], forming the 20th/54th Battalion,{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=111}} as Australia's part-time military force was re-organised as an all volunteer force called the \"Militia\".{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=44}}  Later, as the Australian military was hastily expanded on the eve of [[World War II]],{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=48\u201349}} the 20th/54th Battalion was delinked and the 54th Battalion raised in its own right.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=111}} This occurred on 1 September 1939.{{sfn|Australian Infantry Colour Patches ||}}\n\nDuring World War II, the battalion was mobilised for full-time service as part of the [[5th Brigade (Australia)|5th Brigade]] of the [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]].{{sfn|Orders of Battle||}}{{sfn|Brief History of the 2nd Division||}} Initially, due to the provisions of the ''Defence Act'', it was precluded from being sent overseas to fight,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=5}} but in 1943 it was gazetted as an AIF unit.{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=111}} This meant that it could be sent outside the [[South West Pacific Area]];{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=183}} regardless, the battalion remained in Australia and undertook garrison duties in New South Wales and [[Western Australia]] to defend against a possible invasion.{{sfn|Orders of Battle||}} The invasion never came and, on 9 January 1944, the battalion was disbanded,{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=111}} as part of a partial [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation]] of the Australian military that took place at that time as manpower was redirected back towards industry.{{sfn|Grey|2008|p=188}}\n\n==Battle honours==\nThe 54th Battalion received the following battle honours:\n*'''World War I''': [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme 1916]]\u2013[[Operation Michael|18]], [[Second Battle of Bullecourt|Bullecourt]], [[Third Battle of Ypres|Ypres 1917]], [[Battle of Menin Road|Menin Road]], [[Battle of Polygon Wood|Polygon Wood]], [[Battle of Poelcappelle|Poelcappelle]], [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], [[Battle of the Ancre|Ancre 1918]], [[First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux|Villers-Bretonneux]], [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]], [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Albert 1918]], [[Hindenburg Line]], [[Battle of the St Quentin Canal|St. Quentin Canal]], [[Western Front (World War I)|France and Flanders 1916\u201318]], and [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Egypt 1916]].{{sfn|54th Battalion ||}}{{sfn|Festberg|1972|p=111}}\n\n==Notes==\n;Citations\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11241.asp|title=54th Battalion |work=First World War, 1914\u20131918 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=17 November 2011 |ref=CITEREF54th Battalion}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11243.asp|title=56th Battalion |work=First World War, 1914\u20131918 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=17 November 2011 |ref=CITEREF56th Battalion}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.ordersofbattle.com/UnitData.aspx?UniX=6227&Tab=Uhi&Titl=5%20Australian%20Infantry%20Brigade|title=5 Australian Infantry Brigade|publisher=Orders of Battle.com|accessdate=3 March 2010|ref=CITEREFOrders of Battle}}\n* {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712164357/http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-badges/patches/infantry.htm |url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-badges/patches/infantry.htm |title=Australian Infantry Unit Colour Patches 1929\u20131949 |publisher=Digger History |archivedate=12 July 2007 |accessdate=8 January 2012 |ref=CITEREFAustralian Infantry Colour Patches}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/army/AHU/docs/Brief_History_of_2nd_Division.pdf |title=Brief History of the 2nd Division |publisher=Army History Unit |accessdate=7 September 2009 |ref=CITEREFBrief History of the 2nd Division |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iVZn8Akl?url=http://www.defence.gov.au/army/ahu/docs/Brief_History_of_2nd_Division.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2009 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Baldwin |first=Hanson |title=World War I: An Outline History |year=1962| publisher=Hutchinson|location=London |oclc=988365 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Bean|first=Charles|authorlink=Charles Bean|title=The Australian Imperial Force in France, 1916 |series= [[Official History of Australia in the War of 1914\u20131918]]|volume=Volume III|edition=12th|year=1941|publisher=Australian War Memorial|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RCDIG1069752/|oclc=220623454 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Cox |first=Reginald |title=Military Badges of the British Empire 1914\u201318 |year=1982 |publisher=E.
