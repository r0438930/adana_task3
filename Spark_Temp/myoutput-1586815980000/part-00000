The church is dedicated to [[Our Lady of Help]] and belongs to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Help was built in the 18th century. It replaced a simple [[wattle and daub]] chapel and school built by the [[Jesuits]] in early 1700s; they arrived in present-day Jaguaripe from Salvador via [[Ilha dos Frades]]. It was renovated in the 19th century in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] style, typical of church renovations in Bahia in the same century.<ref name=\"bahia\" /><ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is located at the highest point of the historic center of Jaguaripe. A winding, paved street connects Largo da Matriz, the church yard, to the town hall below. The church has broad views of the small historic center of Jaguaripe, the [[Jaguaripe River]], and rolling hills of the region.<ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is constructed of lime and stone masonry and covers {{convert|1480|m2|ft2}}. The division of the plan of the church into three sections (a nave and two side corridors) is emphasized on the fa\u00e7ade by [[pilaster]]s. The church has gable roofs, one on the central body and one over the sacristies. The fa\u00e7ade has three portals with five windows at the choir level. Each of the windows has an arched lintel.<ref name=\"hpip\" />\n\nThe church has a single bell tower with a bulbous dome. The church has a monumental, rococo-style pediment with volutes, a stylized oculus at center, and tracings in terra-cotta painted yellow. The church has three bronze bells with heavy wooden bell yolks painted green.\n\nThe church opens to a broad church yard, now known as the Largo da Matriz. It has a concrete platform with small stair constructed in the 20th century. Two large yards are located to the sides of the church, a feature not found in other churches of the region.<ref name=\"hpip\" /><ref name=\"ipac-ba\" />\n\n===Interior===\n\nThe interior of the church consists of a nave and side corridors surmounted by tribunes, a plan typical of Bahian churches of the 18th century. The church has two side chapels at the front of the church, one dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament. The church, somewhat unusually, has two sacristies, one on side of the chancel. The sacristies are accessed via the chancel and side chapels. The high altars and side altars are in the Neoclassical style with [[talha dourado]], or gilded wood carvings; they replace the baroque altars of the original structures. The church interior once had numerous baroque-style paintings; they were removed during renovations of the church in the 18th century. The church has numerous examples of wood carving, including those located in the chancel, tribune handrails, a screen of the side chapel dedicated to the Blessed Sacrament, the chancel, and the tribune handrail.\n\n===Sacristies===\n\nThe sacristies of the Parish Church of Our Lady of Help retain their 18th-century appearance. They have carved rococo alterpieces, a sacristy cabinet, and built-in closets. One altar is in the style typical during the reign of [[John V of Portugal]]. Its design is based on an altar originally in the [[Monastery of St. Benedict]] in Salvador and now located in the [[Church and Monastery of Our Lady of Monserrate]]. The other is in the late Rococo style, and is similar to that found in the [[Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar]] in Salvador.<ref name=\"b\" />\n\n==Access==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Help is open to the public and may be visited.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|2|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"b\">{{cite book |last=Bazin |first1=Germain |title=L'architecture religieuse baroque au Br\u00e9sil |volume=2 |location=Sao Paulo |publisher=Museu de Arte |year=1956 |page=16 |language=fr}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"bahia\">{{cite journal |title=Jaguaripe |journal=Bahia Tradicional e Moderna |year=1939 |volume=2 |page=40}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"hpip\">{{cite web | last = Lins | first = Eug\u00e9nio \u00c1vila |url= https://www.hpip.org/en/Heritage/Details/1027\n|title= Parish Church of Our Lady of Help |place= Lisbon, Portugal |year = 2013 |publisher=Heritage of Portuguese Influence/Patrim\u00f3nio de Influ\u00eancia Portuguesa |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ipac-ba\">{{cite book |last=Secretaria da Ind\u00fastria, Com\u00e9rcio e Turismo (Bahia, Brazil) |title=IPAC-BA: invent\u00e1rio de prote\u00e7\u00e3o do acervo cultural |volume = 2 |location=Salvador, Brazil |publisher=Secretaria da Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio |year=1978 |pages=169-170}}</ref>\n\n}}\n\n{{commons category|Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda (Jaguaripe)}}\n{{Subject bar |portal1= Catholicism |portal2= Brazil}}\n\n[[Category:Roman Catholic churches in Bahia]]\n[[Category:Portuguese Colonial architecture in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Baroque church buildings in Brazil]]\n[[Category:18th-century Roman Catholic church buildings]]\n[[Category:National heritage sites of Bahia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox religious building\n| name = Parish Church of Our Lady of Help\n| native_name = Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda\n| native_name_lang = pt\n| image = Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda, Jaguaripe 01.jpg\n| image_size = \n| alt = \n| caption = Parish Church of Our Lady of Help, Jaguaripe, Bahia\n| map_type = Brazil\n| map_size = \n| map_alt = \n| map_relief = \n| map_caption = Location of the Parish Church of Our Lady of Help in Brazil\n| coordinates = {{coord|-13.113989|-38.895878}}\n| coordinates_footnotes = \n| religious_affiliation=[[Catholic]]\n| rite=[[Roman Rite|Roman]]\n| sect = \n| tradition = \n| festival = <!-- or | festivals = -->\n| cercle = \n| sector = \n| municipality = [[Jaguaripe]]\n| district = \n| territory = \n| prefecture = \n| state = [[Bahia]]\n| province = \n| region = \n| country = [[Brazil]]\n| administration = \n| consecration_year = \n| organisational_status = <!-- or | organizational_status = -->\n| functional_status = \n| heritage_designation = 1958\n| ownership = [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S\u00e3o Salvador da Bahia]]\n| governing_body = \n| leadership = \n| bhattaraka = \n| patron = \n| website = \n| architect = \n| architecture_type = \n| architecture_style = Baroque, Neo-Classical\n| founded_by = \n| creator = \n| funded_by = \n| general_contractor = \n| established = \n| groundbreaking = \n| year_completed = 18th century\n| construction_cost = \n| date_demolished = <!-- or | date_destroyed = -->\n| facade_direction = South-East\n| capacity = \n| length = \n| width = \n| width_nave = \n| interior_area = {{convert|1480|m2|ft2}}\n| height_max = \n| dome_quantity = \n| dome_height_outer = \n| dome_height_inner = \n| dome_dia_outer = \n| dome_dia_inner = \n| spire_quantity = \n| spire_height = \n| site_area = \n| temple_quantity = \n| monument_quantity = \n| shrine_quantity = \n| inscriptions = \n| materials = \n| elevation_m = \n| elevation_footnotes = \n| nrhp = \n| designated = \n| added = \n| refnum = \n| footnotes = \n}}\n\nThe '''Parish Church of Our Lady of Help''' ({{lang-pt|Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Ajuda}}) is a 19th-century [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church located in [[Jaguaripe]], [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]].
