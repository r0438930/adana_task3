Most European countries also have local pornography producers, from [[Portugal]] (e.g. ''Naturalvideo'') to [[Serbia]] (e.g. ''Hexor''), who face varying levels of competition with international producers. The legal status of pornography varies widely in Europe; its production and distribution are illegal in countries such as Ukraine, Belarus and Bulgaria, while [[Hungary]] is noted for having liberal pornography laws.\n\n== Albania ==\nIn [[Albania]], pornography is illegal only for producing, delivery, advertising, import, selling and publication of pornographic materials in persons under 18 years old. Child pornography is strictly prohibited.<ref>{{cite web|title=Criminal Code of the Republic of Albania|url=http://pbosnia.kentlaw.edu/resources/legal/albania/crim_code.htm|work=Article 117|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Austria ==\nIn 1990, the \"Federal Act Against Obscene Publications and for the Protection of Youth Morally Endangered\" was passed to regulate pornography in Austria. In 1994 a prohibition on child pornography was added to the law. Under these regulations the minimum age for buying softcore pornography in Austria is 16 and the minimum age for buying hardcore pornography is 18. Publication of pornography or material depicting bestiality is illegal.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dciuj1-F3fYC|first1=Robert T.|last1=Francoeur|first2=Raymond J.|last2=Noonan|publisher=A&C Black|year=2004|isbn=9780826414885|pages=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n== Azerbaijan ==\n{{Main article|Pornography in Azerbaijan}}\nIn [[Azerbaijan]] in accordance with article 3 of the Media Act of 7 December 1999, \"pornographic materials\" are defined as works of art, photographic reproductions of paintings, information and other materials the main content of which is the crude and undignified depiction of the anatomical and physiological aspects of sexual relations.

What pornographic materials there were (mostly magazines and videocassettes) were smuggled into the country. The abandonment of censorship in the early post-communist period resulted in pornography becoming widely available. In the early 1990s pornographic magazines were sold at newsstands, pirated foreign pornographic videocassettes became available and foreign pornographic television stations were accessible.

Since then, pornography has been a growing economy in [[France]], now existing in various forms from magazines to satellite TV broadcasting.\n\n==Germany==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}\nThe world's first [[sex shop]] was opened in [[Flensburg]] in 1962 by [[Beate Uhse AG]]. Post-WW2 commercial movie pornography [[Germany|German]] began with the softcore film ''Graf Porno und seine M\u00e4dchen'' (Count Porno and his girls) in 1968. The movie's success (more than 3 million admissions) lead to a whole series of films that was and is referred to in German media as the ''Sex-Welle'' (sex wave). The most well known film of this period is ''[[Schulm\u00e4dchen-Report]]: Was Eltern nicht f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich halten'' (The School-Girl Report, what the parents don't believe possible) by [[Ernst Hofbauer]] in 1970. The sex scenes had become bolder with time and by 1975, when the legal ban of pornography was lifted, the era of German [[hardcore pornography]] began.\n\nDirector [[Hans Billian]] was the protagonist of the period and the films were usually in line with the so-called \"[[Bavarian porn|Bavarian porn sex comedies]]\", often depicting male performers as comic characters, like Sepp Gnei\u00dfl in ''Kasimir der Kuckuckskleber'' (1977). This era was also characterised by several [[Josephine Mutzenbacher]] films.\n\nToday's German pornography is generally very similar to the American \"[[glamour (charm)|glamour]]\" pornography though often tailored primarily for the German market. In contrast several German labels focus on a more \"home-made\" amateur flair, often focusing on intense hardcore themes such as [[gang bang]]s, [[Bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]] and [[urine fetishism]]; most notably 'German Goo Girls' and other series by [[John Thompson Productions]].\n\nDue to popular belief outside of Germany, [[coprophilia|fecal pornography]] known as \"Scheisse porn\" (using the German slang word for faeces) or, more commonly, as \"[[Coprophilia|Kaviar]]\" (a generic term) supposedly is particularly popular in Germany, with companies like ''SG-Video'' and performers like Austrian [[Veronica Moser]] and [[Simon Thaur]] or English [[Ben Chambers]] specializing in the concept. Although German companies have their fair world market share in producing for this niche market, the major percentage is sold into export.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[MindGeek]]'s age-verification software AgeID, which is used to verify the ages of users of pornographic Internet websites, has been in use in Germany since 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Porn check critics fear data breach|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-43292457|date=6 March 2018|author=Zoe Kleinman|work=BBC News|access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Greece ==\nIn [[Greece]] selling or publication of pornography is legal,but is illegal to people under 18 years old, although the law weakly enforced.

Production, however, was not explicitly illegal, thus both photo and movie shoots occurred. One could acquire pornography abroad, on the Internet, or via satellite TV. Illegal porn shops also existed, especially in larger cities. To satisfy legal requirements, editors of erotic magazines, domestic TV channels, and cable TV obscured ''sexual organs in activity'' using black rectangles and the like. After the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] unanimously acquitted a former magazine editor on 7 December 2005 for publishing unobscured hardcore pornography in 2002, it became understood that printed hardcore pornography was no longer illegal. Pornography became legal on March 14th, 2006. Regular and cable TV tend to abide by the old standards, seeing that edited TV is regulated by a separate law and thus is not affected by the Supreme Court decision. Video-on-demand, however, is not regulated by the TV laws, and, thus, pornography is legal to order.\n\nThe depiction of illegal sexual activities, including those involving children, animals, necrophilia, rape, violence, or the use of force, remains illegal.<!--Some references in Norwegian:--><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/12/07/451567.html | title=H\u00f8yesterett sier ja til porno&nbsp;\u2014 Dagbladet.no | accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1174004.ece | title=Porno-frifinnelse i H\u00f8yesterett | accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/5301377.html | title=NRK.no&nbsp;\u2014 Kultur | accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> <!--Illegal to show hardcore material on cable TV while satellite TV remains a grey area and graphically demonstrates the legal ambivalence Norway has towards hard pornography.

In practice, hardcore material on video and DVD was until recently banned by the requirement under the Video Recordings Act to be certified by the [[BBFC]], while mainstream hardcore material in other forms such as magazines and websites is essentially unrestricted. Continental European, American and British hardcore pornographic magazines are now openly sold in many British newsagents, for instance.

Post-WW2 commercial movie pornography [[Germany|German]] began with the softcore film ''Graf Porno und seine M\u00e4dchen'' (Count Porno and his girls) in 1968. The movie's success (more than 3 million admissions) lead to a whole series of films that was and is referred to in German media as the ''Sex-Welle'' (sex wave). The most well known film of this period is ''[[Schulm\u00e4dchen-Report]]: Was Eltern nicht f\u00fcr m\u00f6glich halten'' (The School-Girl Report, what the parents don't believe possible) by [[Ernst Hofbauer]] in 1970. The sex scenes had become bolder with time and by 1975, when the legal ban of pornography was lifted, the era of German [[hardcore pornography]] began.\n\nDirector [[Hans Billian]] was the protagonist of the period and the films were usually in line with the so-called \"[[Bavarian porn|Bavarian porn sex comedies]]\", often depicting male performers as comic characters, like Sepp Gnei\u00dfl in ''Kasimir der Kuckuckskleber'' (1977). This era was also characterised by several [[Josephine Mutzenbacher]] films.\n\nToday's German pornography is generally very similar to the American \"[[glamour (charm)|glamour]]\" pornography though often tailored primarily for the German market. In contrast several German labels focus on a more \"home-made\" amateur flair, often focusing on intense hardcore themes such as [[gang bang]]s, [[Bukkake (sex act)|bukkake]] and [[urine fetishism]]; most notably 'German Goo Girls' and other series by [[John Thompson Productions]].\n\nDue to popular belief outside of Germany, [[coprophilia|fecal pornography]] known as \"Scheisse porn\" (using the German slang word for faeces) or, more commonly, as \"[[Coprophilia|Kaviar]]\" (a generic term) supposedly is particularly popular in Germany, with companies like ''SG-Video'' and performers like Austrian [[Veronica Moser]] and [[Simon Thaur]] or English [[Ben Chambers]] specializing in the concept.

Production, however, was not explicitly illegal, thus both photo and movie shoots occurred. One could acquire pornography abroad, on the Internet, or via satellite TV. Illegal porn shops also existed, especially in larger cities. To satisfy legal requirements, editors of erotic magazines, domestic TV channels, and cable TV obscured ''sexual organs in activity'' using black rectangles and the like. After the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] unanimously acquitted a former magazine editor on 7 December 2005 for publishing unobscured hardcore pornography in 2002, it became understood that printed hardcore pornography was no longer illegal. Pornography became legal on March 14th, 2006. Regular and cable TV tend to abide by the old standards, seeing that edited TV is regulated by a separate law and thus is not affected by the Supreme Court decision. Video-on-demand, however, is not regulated by the TV laws, and, thus, pornography is legal to order.\n\nThe depiction of illegal sexual activities, including those involving children, animals, necrophilia, rape, violence, or the use of force, remains illegal.<!--Some references in Norwegian:--><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kultur/2005/12/07/451567.html | title=H\u00f8yesterett sier ja til porno&nbsp;\u2014 Dagbladet.no | accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article1174004.ece | title=Porno-frifinnelse i H\u00f8yesterett | accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/5301377.html | title=NRK.no&nbsp;\u2014 Kultur | accessdate=2006-08-26}}</ref> <!--Illegal to show hardcore material on cable TV while satellite TV remains a grey area and graphically demonstrates the legal ambivalence Norway has towards hard pornography.
