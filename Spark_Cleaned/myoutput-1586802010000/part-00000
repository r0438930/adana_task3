He was considered one of the finest political interviewers in the history of British broadcasting, tenacious and ruthless. He won awards for broadcasting including the [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] Richard Dimbleby Award for television in 1986,<ref name=\"BAFTA\">{{Cite news | url= http://awards.bafta.org/keyword-search?keywords=richard%20dimbleby%20award | title= BAFTA Awards Search | work=BAFTA | access-date=12 May 2019 | language=en-GB}}</ref> and in 1991 was named ITV personality of the year.<ref name=\"BBCWaldenDead\">{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48245853 | title= Brian Walden: Broadcaster and former Labour MP dies aged 86 | publisher=BBC News | access-date=12 May 2019 | language=en-GB}}</ref> He was known for interviews of politicians, especially [[Margaret Thatcher]].

He won an open scholarship to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College, Oxford]]. In 1957 he was elected president of the [[Oxford Union]].<ref>'Fall-Out The Biggest Worry For Oswestry Electors', ''The Times'' (30 October 1961), p. 6.</ref> After [[Oswald Mosley]] was invited to speak at a debate held on 24 October 1957, Walden was asked by a fellow undergraduate why Mosley had been invited. He replied, \"This society was founded many years ago to enshrine a very great principle, that of free speech. The society has had to fight against many authorities to ensure that minority points of view shall be put\".<ref>'Sir Oswald Mosley At Oxford Union', ''The Times'' (25 October 1957), p. 10.</ref> Walden apparently \"narrowly missed a first\" in history in his finals. The following year he undertook a speaking tour of the United States with Stuart Griffiths, during which he took part in 47 debates.<ref>'Debating Tour Of The U.S.', ''The Times'' (25 September 1958), p. 12.</ref>\n\nHe completed a postgraduate degree at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], before becoming a university lecturer.\n\n==Political career==\nWalden unsuccessfully contested the safe Conservative [[constituency of Oswestry]] in the [[1961 Oswestry by-election|1961 by-election]], coming third for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].\n\nAt a debate at the Oxford Union held on 11 June 1964, Walden caused uproar by calling [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who had died two days previously, \"evil and repellent\" and for attacking the \"evil and despicable influence\" of his ''Express'' group of newspapers.<ref>'News in Brief', ''The Times'' (12 June 1964), p. 8.</ref>\n\nAt the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] Walden was elected [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Birmingham All Saints (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham All Saints]] in an election where [[Smethwick in the 1964 general election|race dominated the Birmingham campaign]]. He was re-elected in the general elections of [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. When All Saints was abolished Walden sought and gained the Labour nomination for [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]], and was elected there in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]] and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].\n\nIn the aftermath of [[Enoch Powell]]'s November 1968 Eastbourne speech advocating the repatriation of immigrants, Walden urged the Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], not to waver in his opposition to Powell's proposals: \"If the Government did waver and harass and bully some of Her Majesty's subjects towards the boats, British politics would sink to the gutter\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1968/nov/21/minister-for-repatriation#S5CV0773P0_19681121_HOC_219 HC Deb 21 November 1968 vol 773 c. 1532-1533]</ref> In January 1970, Walden introduced his unsuccessful [[private member's bill]], the Right of Privacy Bill, that was designed to protect people's right to privacy from the press.<ref>George Clark and Pat Healy, 'Safeguards for journalists in privacy Bill', ''The Times'' (21 January 1970), p. 8.</ref>\n\nIn October 1971 Walden told an anti-[[European Economic Community|EEC]] meeting in Brighton that [[Roy Jenkins]] and others in the labour movement favoured Britain joining because they despaired of their country: \"They have grown sick of crisis after crisis and they do not believe that Britain, as an independent country, can solve her own problems. ... But they are wrong\".<ref>'Loyalty vital, Market rebels told', ''The Times'' (4 October 1971), p. 2.</ref> After Jenkins resigned from the deputy leadership in April 1972, Wilson appointed Walden to a junior position on Labour's shadow treasury team.<ref>'Promotion for EEC men in Mr Wilson's new Front Bench team', ''The Times'' (12 April 1972), p. 1.</ref> In October 1972 Walden attacked [[Dick Taverne]]'s \"apostasy\" for leaving the Labour Party: \"Of course an MP must have strong opinions of his own, and I have defied the Labour Party whip more than Dick Taverne has. We owe the Labour Party an unpayable debt and Dick has ratted on a lifetime of obligation\".<ref>'Mr Taverne 'not asking aid of MPs', ''The Times'' (9 October 1972), p. 2.</ref>\n\nAt a December 1973 meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the state of the party, Walden doubted whether party unity and getting policies across to the public would alone suffice; the party's failure lay in not answering the questions ordinary people were asking.<ref>Michael Hatfield, 'Mr Wilson tells MPs to 'get back to the people' ', ''The Times'' (6 December 1973), p. 4.</ref> After [[Edward Heath]] called the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Walden called it a \"fraudulent and rather ridiculous election\": \"The fault lies with the Prime Minister. I have as yet read no explanation of why the national interest requires that there should be a strike and an election before miners can be paid money they could be given without either taking place\".<ref name=\"Times1974\">Brian Walden, 'Perils of a battle only the losers can win', ''The Times'' (25 February 1974), p. 12.</ref> Walden lamented that \"the nation has been invited to nourish its fear and express class malice...I am living through the death of all my hopes of what this country could be\".<ref name=\"Times1974\"/> He called Heath's belief that the election was called to ensure moderation \"the most staggering misjudgment of my political lifetime\".<ref name=\"Times1974\"/>\n\nFollowing Labour's return to office after the election, Walden declined the office of Minister of State for Industry, citing \"personal reasons\".<ref name=\"Times100674\">'MP explains job decision', ''The Times'' (10 June 1974), p. 4.</ref> The Selly Oak [[Constituency Labour Party]] passed a resolution criticising his \"massive consultancy fees\", which Walden earned as a parliamentary consultant to, among others, the Business Equipment Trades Association, the Amusement Trades Association and the Amusement Caterers Association.<ref name=\"Times100674\"/>\n\nThe [[Birmingham pub bombings]] of 21 November 1974 occurred in Walden's constituency, and soon afterwards, the Commons debated whether the death penalty should be restored for terrorist murderers. Walden opened the debate by opposing capital punishment, declaring it to be \"judicial execution\" and \"a cold-blooded act of the state to take a life\".<ref>Hugh Noyes, 'Death penalty would mean more violence, Home Secretary says', ''The Times'' (12 December 1974), p. 2.</ref> During the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] on Britain's membership of the EEC, Walden spoke in favour of Britain remaining a member. Walden told the Commons: \"I think that the anti-Market campaign will in the end...degenerate into narrow nationalism, the plea for a siege economy, for Socialism in one country. I was never very enchanted by the rhapsodies of the Eurofanatics but I certainly prefer their version of the future to that grim and barren alternative which it seems to me the anti-Marketeers will end up with\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1975/apr/08/european-community-membership#column_1040 HC Deb 08 April 1975 vol 889 c. 1040]</ref>\n\nWalden became disillusioned with the Labour Party due to the rise of the left and in May 1975 (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s election as Conservative leader) he told the [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Conservative Chief Whip]], [[Humphrey Atkins]], that he could bring six Labour MPs with him in [[crossing the floor]].<ref name=\"Moore\">Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume One: Not For Turning'' (London: Allen Lane, 2013), p. 345.</ref> According to Thatcher's biographer [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], Walden was \"considered the most eloquent of his generation of Labour MPs\" and was \"more clear-sighted than most in seeing that Mrs Thatcher stood for real change\", commenting that \"as a grammar school meritocrat who had originally looked for social progress from the Labour Party, Walden recognized her as offering what he sought\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/>\n\nAt a meeting of the [[Warley East (UK Parliament constituency)|Warley East]] Labour Party in February 1976, Walden defended the government's policy and the benefits of the [[mixed economy]] against [[Stuart Holland]]'s proposals for more socialist policies.<ref>George Clark, 'Mr Faulds joins list of Labour MPs under attack from left-wingers in constituencies', ''The Times'' (1 March 1976), p. 2.</ref> In the [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election]] that was held after Harold Wilson announced his resignation, Walden voted for [[Michael Foot]] rather than [[James Callaghan]] because he considered Foot \"a man of principle\".<ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Michael Foot'' (London: Harper Perennial, 2008), p. 329.</ref> After the first 100 days of Callaghan's premiership, Walden remarked: \"If I had thought he was going to be as good as this I would have voted for him\".<ref>Geoffrey Smith, 'The calm strength of Mr Callaghan after his first 100 days', ''The Times'' (15 July 1976), p. 16.</ref>\n\nIn November 1976, Walden joined fellow right-wing Labour MP [[John Mackintosh (Scottish politician)|John Mackintosh]] in abstaining on the vote for the government's Dock Works Regulation Bill, thereby wrecking its passage through Parliament.<ref>'\u2018Rebel\u2019 Labour MPs have no regrets', ''The Times'' (12 November 1976), p. 2.</ref> The Bill would have ensured that dock workers within five miles of any port or important inland waterway would have to belong to the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]].<ref>David Wood, 'Double defeat for Government wrecks docks Bill', ''The Times'' (11 November 1976), p. 1</ref> The executive committee of Walden's constituency Labour Party supported his stance,<ref>'Support for 'rebel' ', ''The Times'' (22 November 1976), p. 5.</ref> although he was criticised by left-wing demonstrators.<ref>David Leigh, 'Demonstrators air their complaints to MPs', ''The Times'' (18 November 1976),  p. 2.</ref> After the 1977 Budget, Walden claimed that: \"Our level of direct taxation\u2014income tax\u2014is ludicrously high, and our rate of indirect taxation is not taking enough of the burden\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1977/may/09/hydrocarbon-oil-etc#column_972 HC Deb 09 May 1977 vol 931 c. 972]</ref>\n\nHe campaigned for the liberalisation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]<ref>In 1967 Walden signed a petition to the Home Secretary calling for the legalisation of cannabis. ''The Times'' (24 July 1967), p. 5.</ref> and [[gambling]] laws; he was nicknamed by some \"the bookies' MP\" when he was revealed to be receiving more from the National Association of Bookmakers than his parliamentary salary.\n\nOn 16 June 1977, Walden [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned]] from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] by taking the [[Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]] in order to become a full-time journalist and broadcaster.<ref name=\"Times1977\">George Clark, 'Mr Walden to leave Commons for TV', ''The Times'' (17 June 1977), p. 1.</ref> Walden said: \"I am not leaving because of any disenchantment with the Government. I have gone for positive, not negative reasons\".<ref name=\"Times1977\"/>\n\n==Journalistic career==\nWalden went on to present television programmes, mostly for [[London Weekend Television]], such as ''[[Weekend World]]'', ''The Walden Interview'' and ''Walden''. He was also a member of the board of [[ITV Central|Central Television]] between 1981 and 1984.\n\nIn 1978, Walden told Conservative MP [[Bernard Weatherill]] that \"the only way the Tories can lose the next general election is if they are not Conservative enough\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/> By 1979, Walden passionately believed that trade union power should be broken, telling Margaret Thatcher that \"the trade unions have become an estate of the realm, above the law\".<ref name=\"Moore2\">Moore, ''Volume One'', p. 509, n.</ref> The week after this conversation, Walden's programme focused on the necessity of legislation against [[Solidarity action|secondary action]] by trade unions.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/>\n\nIn 1981, Geoffrey Wansell claimed that ''Weekend World'' had  become \"the flagship of national current affairs shows, quietly stealing the title from its more august rival at the BBC, Panorama\":\n\n<blockquote>The secret of Weekend World's success, I suspect, lies in the character of its presenter and interviewer. Lacking the suave public school confidence of his predecessor in the job, [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Walden runs on adrenalin and a determination to wring a bit of political revelation and a slice of history out of whichever politician happens to be in the studio with him. In spite of his voice, which vibrates on eardrums like a buzz-saw, Walden has become the second best political interviewer on television\u2014only Sir [[Robin Day]] is better. ... Explaining his success, Walden simply says: \"I know I understand politicians, but even more I detest ambiguity. It's always my instinct to ask people exactly what they mean\".<ref>Geoffrey Wansell, 'Why Walden's World grabs headlines', ''The Times'' (11 September 1981), p. 40.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring an interview with Thatcher in 1983, Walden coined the term \"Victorian values\" to describe her beliefs, which she accepted and repeated on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105087 |title=TV Interview for London Weekend Television Weekend World (\"Victorian Values\") |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 16 January 1983|accessdate= 8 June 2019}}</ref><ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 182.</ref><ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants'' (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 8.</ref> Walden wrote Thatcher's speech to the Wembley rally during the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] campaign.<ref>Campbell, p. 201.</ref> In 1988, he called Thatcher \"a unique politician...the master spirit of our age\".<ref>Campbell, p. 470.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Rupert Murdoch]] moved the production of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from Fleet Street to a new plant in [[Wapping]] in January 1986, the print unions voted to [[Wapping dispute|strike]] in protest. Many journalists deserted the paper but Walden lent it his support by becoming one of its senior columnists. He wrote to the paper's editor, [[Andrew Neil]]: \"I don't ''need'' to write for ''The Sunday Times''. I ''want'' to\".<ref>Andrew Neil, ''Full Disclosure'' (Pan, 1997), p. 173.</ref> In April 1988 Walden joined [[Norman Tebbit]], [[Frank Chapple|Lord Chapple]] and [[Lord Marsh]] in founding the Radical Society, designed to combat \"privilege, hierarchy, bureaucracy and collectivism\" and to put in their place individualist solutions.<ref>John Horam, 'The age of new enlightenment', ''The Times'' (25 April 1988), p. 12.</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 1989 the Chancellor, [[Nigel Lawson]], resigned because Thatcher was unwilling to sack her economics adviser, Sir [[Alan Walters]]. Although the interview had been planned months in advance, Walden interviewed Thatcher for the 29 October edition of ''The Walden Interview''. Walden told Thatcher's confidante [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on the day Lawson resigned that he wanted Wyatt to ask Thatcher what questions he should put to her so that he could phrase them in a helpful way.<ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Two'' (London: Pan, 1999), p. 179.</ref> However, as [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] notes, Walden's \"journalistic instinct and her lack of candour made for a devastating expos\u00e9, watched by three million people with their Sunday lunch\".<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, p. 692.</ref> Although Thatcher repeatedly claimed that Lawson's position was \"unassailable\", she floundered when Walden asked what Campbell calls \"the killer question\":\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Brian Walden''': Do you deny that Nigel would have stayed if you had sacked Professor Alan Walters?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I don't know. I don't know.<br>'''Brian Walden''': You never even thought to ask him that?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I ... that is not ... I don't know. Nigel had determined that he was going to put in his resignation. I did everything possible to stop him.<br>'''Brian Walden''': But...<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I was not successful. No, you're going on asking the same question.<br>'''Brian Walden''': Of course, but that's a terrible admission, Prime Minister.<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I have nothing further to ... I don't know ... of course I just don't know ... I'm not going on with this.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nLater in the interview Walden put to her:\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Brian Walden''': You come over as being someone who one of your backbenchers said is slightly off her trolley, authoritarian, domineering, refusing to listen to anybody else \u2013 why? Why cannot you publicly project what you have just told me is your private character?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': Brian, if anyone's coming over as domineering in this interview, it's you.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107808 |title=TV Interview for ''The Walden Interview'' (Lawson's resignation) |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 28 October 1989|accessdate= 23 May 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe following Sunday, Walden interviewed Lawson. In his memoirs Lawson said that Walden was \"at that time probably the most formidable and serious political interviewer in the business\".<ref>Nigel Lawson, ''The View From No. 11. Memoirs of a Tory Radical'' (London: Bantam, 1992), p. 967.</ref>\n\nUpon leaving ''Weekend World'' as presenter in 1986, Walden was succeeded by [[Matthew Parris]],<ref name=\"BFIWalden\" /> formerly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[West Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Derbyshire]]; the series came to an end two years later. In 2005, Walden presented 10-minute programmes, ''A Point of View'', on [[BBC Radio 4]], in a spot formerly occupied by [[Alistair Cooke|Alistair Cooke's]] ''Letter From America''.\n\n==Political satire==\nAs a well known public figure, Walden appeared in cameo as an interviewer for political comedy shows such as ''[[The New Statesman]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brian Walden (II) (1932\u20132019) |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0907062/ |website=IMDB |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> He was the subject of parody in ''[[Spitting Image]]'' as a puppet with a slight speech impediment, voiced by impressionist [[Steve Nallon]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Spitting Image (1984\u20131996) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086807/characters/nm0620575 |website=IMDB |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWalden lived in [[Guernsey]] in retirement.

He won an open scholarship to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|Queen's College, Oxford]]. In 1957 he was elected president of the [[Oxford Union]].<ref>'Fall-Out The Biggest Worry For Oswestry Electors', ''The Times'' (30 October 1961), p. 6.</ref> After [[Oswald Mosley]] was invited to speak at a debate held on 24 October 1957, Walden was asked by a fellow undergraduate why Mosley had been invited. He replied, \"This society was founded many years ago to enshrine a very great principle, that of free speech. The society has had to fight against many authorities to ensure that minority points of view shall be put\".<ref>'Sir Oswald Mosley At Oxford Union', ''The Times'' (25 October 1957), p. 10.</ref> Walden apparently \"narrowly missed a first\" in history in his finals. The following year he undertook a speaking tour of the United States with Stuart Griffiths, during which he took part in 47 debates.<ref>'Debating Tour Of The U.S.', ''The Times'' (25 September 1958), p. 12.</ref>\n\nHe completed a postgraduate degree at [[Nuffield College, Oxford]], before becoming a university lecturer.\n\n==Political career==\nWalden unsuccessfully contested the safe Conservative [[constituency of Oswestry]] in the [[1961 Oswestry by-election|1961 by-election]], coming third for [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].\n\nAt a debate at the Oxford Union held on 11 June 1964, Walden caused uproar by calling [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who had died two days previously, \"evil and repellent\" and for attacking the \"evil and despicable influence\" of his ''Express'' group of newspapers.<ref>'News in Brief', ''The Times'' (12 June 1964), p. 8.</ref>\n\nAt the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]] Walden was elected [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Birmingham All Saints (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham All Saints]] in an election where [[Smethwick in the 1964 general election|race dominated the Birmingham campaign]]. He was re-elected in the general elections of [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]] and [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970]]. When All Saints was abolished Walden sought and gained the Labour nomination for [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]], and was elected there in [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974]] and [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]].\n\nIn the aftermath of [[Enoch Powell]]'s November 1968 Eastbourne speech advocating the repatriation of immigrants, Walden urged the Prime Minister, [[Harold Wilson]], not to waver in his opposition to Powell's proposals: \"If the Government did waver and harass and bully some of Her Majesty's subjects towards the boats, British politics would sink to the gutter\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1968/nov/21/minister-for-repatriation#S5CV0773P0_19681121_HOC_219 HC Deb 21 November 1968 vol 773 c. 1532-1533]</ref> In January 1970, Walden introduced his unsuccessful [[private member's bill]], the Right of Privacy Bill, that was designed to protect people's right to privacy from the press.<ref>George Clark and Pat Healy, 'Safeguards for journalists in privacy Bill', ''The Times'' (21 January 1970), p. 8.</ref>\n\nIn October 1971 Walden told an anti-[[European Economic Community|EEC]] meeting in Brighton that [[Roy Jenkins]] and others in the labour movement favoured Britain joining because they despaired of their country: \"They have grown sick of crisis after crisis and they do not believe that Britain, as an independent country, can solve her own problems. ... But they are wrong\".<ref>'Loyalty vital, Market rebels told', ''The Times'' (4 October 1971), p. 2.</ref> After Jenkins resigned from the deputy leadership in April 1972, Wilson appointed Walden to a junior position on Labour's shadow treasury team.<ref>'Promotion for EEC men in Mr Wilson's new Front Bench team', ''The Times'' (12 April 1972), p. 1.</ref> In October 1972 Walden attacked [[Dick Taverne]]'s \"apostasy\" for leaving the Labour Party: \"Of course an MP must have strong opinions of his own, and I have defied the Labour Party whip more than Dick Taverne has. We owe the Labour Party an unpayable debt and Dick has ratted on a lifetime of obligation\".<ref>'Mr Taverne 'not asking aid of MPs', ''The Times'' (9 October 1972), p. 2.</ref>\n\nAt a December 1973 meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the state of the party, Walden doubted whether party unity and getting policies across to the public would alone suffice; the party's failure lay in not answering the questions ordinary people were asking.<ref>Michael Hatfield, 'Mr Wilson tells MPs to 'get back to the people' ', ''The Times'' (6 December 1973), p. 4.</ref> After [[Edward Heath]] called the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Walden called it a \"fraudulent and rather ridiculous election\": \"The fault lies with the Prime Minister. I have as yet read no explanation of why the national interest requires that there should be a strike and an election before miners can be paid money they could be given without either taking place\".<ref name=\"Times1974\">Brian Walden, 'Perils of a battle only the losers can win', ''The Times'' (25 February 1974), p. 12.</ref> Walden lamented that \"the nation has been invited to nourish its fear and express class malice...I am living through the death of all my hopes of what this country could be\".<ref name=\"Times1974\"/> He called Heath's belief that the election was called to ensure moderation \"the most staggering misjudgment of my political lifetime\".<ref name=\"Times1974\"/>\n\nFollowing Labour's return to office after the election, Walden declined the office of Minister of State for Industry, citing \"personal reasons\".<ref name=\"Times100674\">'MP explains job decision', ''The Times'' (10 June 1974), p. 4.</ref> The Selly Oak [[Constituency Labour Party]] passed a resolution criticising his \"massive consultancy fees\", which Walden earned as a parliamentary consultant to, among others, the Business Equipment Trades Association, the Amusement Trades Association and the Amusement Caterers Association.<ref name=\"Times100674\"/>\n\nThe [[Birmingham pub bombings]] of 21 November 1974 occurred in Walden's constituency, and soon afterwards, the Commons debated whether the death penalty should be restored for terrorist murderers. Walden opened the debate by opposing capital punishment, declaring it to be \"judicial execution\" and \"a cold-blooded act of the state to take a life\".<ref>Hugh Noyes, 'Death penalty would mean more violence, Home Secretary says', ''The Times'' (12 December 1974), p. 2.</ref> During the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|1975 referendum]] on Britain's membership of the EEC, Walden spoke in favour of Britain remaining a member. Walden told the Commons: \"I think that the anti-Market campaign will in the end...degenerate into narrow nationalism, the plea for a siege economy, for Socialism in one country. I was never very enchanted by the rhapsodies of the Eurofanatics but I certainly prefer their version of the future to that grim and barren alternative which it seems to me the anti-Marketeers will end up with\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1975/apr/08/european-community-membership#column_1040 HC Deb 08 April 1975 vol 889 c. 1040]</ref>\n\nWalden became disillusioned with the Labour Party due to the rise of the left and in May 1975 (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s election as Conservative leader) he told the [[Chief Whip of the Conservative Party|Conservative Chief Whip]], [[Humphrey Atkins]], that he could bring six Labour MPs with him in [[crossing the floor]].<ref name=\"Moore\">Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume One: Not For Turning'' (London: Allen Lane, 2013), p. 345.</ref> According to Thatcher's biographer [[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], Walden was \"considered the most eloquent of his generation of Labour MPs\" and was \"more clear-sighted than most in seeing that Mrs Thatcher stood for real change\", commenting that \"as a grammar school meritocrat who had originally looked for social progress from the Labour Party, Walden recognized her as offering what he sought\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/>\n\nAt a meeting of the [[Warley East (UK Parliament constituency)|Warley East]] Labour Party in February 1976, Walden defended the government's policy and the benefits of the [[mixed economy]] against [[Stuart Holland]]'s proposals for more socialist policies.<ref>George Clark, 'Mr Faulds joins list of Labour MPs under attack from left-wingers in constituencies', ''The Times'' (1 March 1976), p. 2.</ref> In the [[1976 Labour Party leadership election|Labour leadership election]] that was held after Harold Wilson announced his resignation, Walden voted for [[Michael Foot]] rather than [[James Callaghan]] because he considered Foot \"a man of principle\".<ref>Kenneth O. Morgan, ''Michael Foot'' (London: Harper Perennial, 2008), p. 329.</ref> After the first 100 days of Callaghan's premiership, Walden remarked: \"If I had thought he was going to be as good as this I would have voted for him\".<ref>Geoffrey Smith, 'The calm strength of Mr Callaghan after his first 100 days', ''The Times'' (15 July 1976), p. 16.</ref>\n\nIn November 1976, Walden joined fellow right-wing Labour MP [[John Mackintosh (Scottish politician)|John Mackintosh]] in abstaining on the vote for the government's Dock Works Regulation Bill, thereby wrecking its passage through Parliament.<ref>'\u2018Rebel\u2019 Labour MPs have no regrets', ''The Times'' (12 November 1976), p. 2.</ref> The Bill would have ensured that dock workers within five miles of any port or important inland waterway would have to belong to the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]].<ref>David Wood, 'Double defeat for Government wrecks docks Bill', ''The Times'' (11 November 1976), p. 1</ref> The executive committee of Walden's constituency Labour Party supported his stance,<ref>'Support for 'rebel' ', ''The Times'' (22 November 1976), p. 5.</ref> although he was criticised by left-wing demonstrators.<ref>David Leigh, 'Demonstrators air their complaints to MPs', ''The Times'' (18 November 1976),  p. 2.</ref> After the 1977 Budget, Walden claimed that: \"Our level of direct taxation\u2014income tax\u2014is ludicrously high, and our rate of indirect taxation is not taking enough of the burden\".<ref>[https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1977/may/09/hydrocarbon-oil-etc#column_972 HC Deb 09 May 1977 vol 931 c. 972]</ref>\n\nHe campaigned for the liberalisation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]<ref>In 1967 Walden signed a petition to the Home Secretary calling for the legalisation of cannabis.

I have gone for positive, not negative reasons\".<ref name=\"Times1977\"/>\n\n==Journalistic career==\nWalden went on to present television programmes, mostly for [[London Weekend Television]], such as ''[[Weekend World]]'', ''The Walden Interview'' and ''Walden''. He was also a member of the board of [[ITV Central|Central Television]] between 1981 and 1984.\n\nIn 1978, Walden told Conservative MP [[Bernard Weatherill]] that \"the only way the Tories can lose the next general election is if they are not Conservative enough\".<ref name=\"Moore\"/> By 1979, Walden passionately believed that trade union power should be broken, telling Margaret Thatcher that \"the trade unions have become an estate of the realm, above the law\".<ref name=\"Moore2\">Moore, ''Volume One'', p. 509, n.</ref> The week after this conversation, Walden's programme focused on the necessity of legislation against [[Solidarity action|secondary action]] by trade unions.<ref name=\"Moore2\"/>\n\nIn 1981, Geoffrey Wansell claimed that ''Weekend World'' had  become \"the flagship of national current affairs shows, quietly stealing the title from its more august rival at the BBC, Panorama\":\n\n<blockquote>The secret of Weekend World's success, I suspect, lies in the character of its presenter and interviewer. Lacking the suave public school confidence of his predecessor in the job, [[Peter Jay (diplomat)|Peter Jay]], Walden runs on adrenalin and a determination to wring a bit of political revelation and a slice of history out of whichever politician happens to be in the studio with him. In spite of his voice, which vibrates on eardrums like a buzz-saw, Walden has become the second best political interviewer on television\u2014only Sir [[Robin Day]] is better. ... Explaining his success, Walden simply says: \"I know I understand politicians, but even more I detest ambiguity. It's always my instinct to ask people exactly what they mean\".<ref>Geoffrey Wansell, 'Why Walden's World grabs headlines', ''The Times'' (11 September 1981), p. 40.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring an interview with Thatcher in 1983, Walden coined the term \"Victorian values\" to describe her beliefs, which she accepted and repeated on numerous occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/105087 |title=TV Interview for London Weekend Television Weekend World (\"Victorian Values\") |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 16 January 1983|accessdate= 8 June 2019}}</ref><ref>John Campbell, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2003), p. 182.</ref><ref>Charles Moore, ''Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: Everything She Wants'' (London: Allen Lane, 2015), p. 8.</ref> Walden wrote Thatcher's speech to the Wembley rally during the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] campaign.<ref>Campbell, p. 201.</ref> In 1988, he called Thatcher \"a unique politician...the master spirit of our age\".<ref>Campbell, p. 470.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Rupert Murdoch]] moved the production of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' from Fleet Street to a new plant in [[Wapping]] in January 1986, the print unions voted to [[Wapping dispute|strike]] in protest. Many journalists deserted the paper but Walden lent it his support by becoming one of its senior columnists. He wrote to the paper's editor, [[Andrew Neil]]: \"I don't ''need'' to write for ''The Sunday Times''. I ''want'' to\".<ref>Andrew Neil, ''Full Disclosure'' (Pan, 1997), p. 173.</ref> In April 1988 Walden joined [[Norman Tebbit]], [[Frank Chapple|Lord Chapple]] and [[Lord Marsh]] in founding the Radical Society, designed to combat \"privilege, hierarchy, bureaucracy and collectivism\" and to put in their place individualist solutions.<ref>John Horam, 'The age of new enlightenment', ''The Times'' (25 April 1988), p. 12.</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 1989 the Chancellor, [[Nigel Lawson]], resigned because Thatcher was unwilling to sack her economics adviser, Sir [[Alan Walters]]. Although the interview had been planned months in advance, Walden interviewed Thatcher for the 29 October edition of ''The Walden Interview''. Walden told Thatcher's confidante [[Woodrow Wyatt]] on the day Lawson resigned that he wanted Wyatt to ask Thatcher what questions he should put to her so that he could phrase them in a helpful way.<ref>Sarah Curtis (ed.), ''The Journals of Woodrow Wyatt. Volume Two'' (London: Pan, 1999), p. 179.</ref> However, as [[John Campbell (biographer)|John Campbell]] notes, Walden's \"journalistic instinct and her lack of candour made for a devastating expos\u00e9, watched by three million people with their Sunday lunch\".<ref name=\"Campbell\">Campbell, p. 692.</ref> Although Thatcher repeatedly claimed that Lawson's position was \"unassailable\", she floundered when Walden asked what Campbell calls \"the killer question\":\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Brian Walden''': Do you deny that Nigel would have stayed if you had sacked Professor Alan Walters?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I don't know. I don't know.<br>'''Brian Walden''': You never even thought to ask him that?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I ... that is not ... I don't know. Nigel had determined that he was going to put in his resignation. I did everything possible to stop him.<br>'''Brian Walden''': But...<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I was not successful. No, you're going on asking the same question.<br>'''Brian Walden''': Of course, but that's a terrible admission, Prime Minister.<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': I have nothing further to ... I don't know ... of course I just don't know ... I'm not going on with this.<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nLater in the interview Walden put to her:\n\n<blockquote>\n'''Brian Walden''': You come over as being someone who one of your backbenchers said is slightly off her trolley, authoritarian, domineering, refusing to listen to anybody else \u2013 why? Why cannot you publicly project what you have just told me is your private character?<br>'''Margaret Thatcher''': Brian, if anyone's coming over as domineering in this interview, it's you.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107808 |title=TV Interview for ''The Walden Interview'' (Lawson's resignation) |publisher= Margaret Thatcher Foundation|date= 28 October 1989|accessdate= 23 May 2009}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe following Sunday, Walden interviewed Lawson. In his memoirs Lawson said that Walden was \"at that time probably the most formidable and serious political interviewer in the business\".<ref>Nigel Lawson, ''The View From No. 11. Memoirs of a Tory Radical'' (London: Bantam, 1992), p. 967.</ref>\n\nUpon leaving ''Weekend World'' as presenter in 1986, Walden was succeeded by [[Matthew Parris]],<ref name=\"BFIWalden\" /> formerly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for [[West Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|West Derbyshire]]; the series came to an end two years later. In 2005, Walden presented 10-minute programmes, ''A Point of View'', on [[BBC Radio 4]], in a spot formerly occupied by [[Alistair Cooke|Alistair Cooke's]] ''Letter From America''.\n\n==Political satire==\nAs a well known public figure, Walden appeared in cameo as an interviewer for political comedy shows such as ''[[The New Statesman]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brian Walden (II) (1932\u20132019) |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0907062/ |website=IMDB |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> He was the subject of parody in ''[[Spitting Image]]'' as a puppet with a slight speech impediment, voiced by impressionist [[Steve Nallon]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Spitting Image (1984\u20131996) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086807/characters/nm0620575 |website=IMDB |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWalden lived in [[Guernsey]] in retirement.
