The region was divided into [[Ducal Prussia]], a [[fief]] of Poland, and [[Royal Prussia]], which was an integral part of Poland under direct rule. Ducal Prussia became part of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] in 1618, and became the Kingdom of Prussia upon the [[coronation]] of King [[Frederick I of Prussia]] in 1701.

Royal Prussia was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772 during the [[First Partition of Poland]], placing the entirety of the Prussia region under Prussian rule.
