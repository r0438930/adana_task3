The company offered cable television services in [[Brasov]] and [[Timisoara]]. In 1993 Zolt\u00e1n Tesz\u00e1ri co-founded Kappa cable company in Bucharest. In 1996, the shareholders decided to divide the Kappa network into two equal parts. Half owned by Zolta Tzesari merged with Analog CATV SA cable company in Bucharest. The other half was bought in 2000 by [[Astral Telecom]], which in 2005 was merged with [[UPC Romania]] (now [[Vodafone Romania]]). This separation of the company led to the division of the areas in Bucharest between the two companies for 10 years. \n\nA cable network was built in [[Chisinau]], [[Republic of Moldova]] in 1995, which was later sold.\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1997 the company changed its name to '''Romania Cable Systems SA''' ('''RCS'''). Same year it is established '''Romania Data System SA''' ('''RDS''') which offers internet services. Among the investors in the company from the beginning until the listing on the stock exchange were Carpathian Cable Investments S.a.R.L. from 1998 and Celest Limited from 1999. \n\nThe company entered Hungary in November 1998 after buying 15 small and medium cable companies in [[Budapest]] and 3 other cities. Between December 1999 and January 2000, the first cable networks were acquired in [[Slovakia]], where Slovakia Cable Systems (SCS) was 95% owned by RCS.\n\nIn April 2000, the project to build a 4,200 km national [[fiber optic]] network was initiated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcs.ro/despre.php |title=Romania Cable Systems |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608074723/http://www.rcs.ro/despre.php |archivedate=8 June 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, after the liberalization of the market, the [[landline|fixed telephony]] service was launched in Romania. Digi TV [[satellite television]] platform was first launched in Romania in December 2004, followed by launches in Hungary in February 2006, in the [[Czech Republic]] and Slovakia in August 2006 and in [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] in December 2006.\n\n=== 2005-2014 ===\n[[Image:RCS & RDS Logo.png|thumb|RCS & RDS logo (2005-2012)|160px]]\nRCS and RDS merged to form RCS & RDS on 26 April 2005. The company focused on rapid development both organically and through acquisitions. The C-Zone network was acquired in 2006, entering certain areas in Bucharest that were not covered due to zone exclusivity. In these areas RCS & RDS kept the brand until 2009.\n\nDigi Slovakia, including the Digi Sport television channels in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, were sold to [[Slovak Telekom]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://technology.informa.com/435165/slovak-telekom-to-buy-digi-slovakia |title=Slovak Telekom to buy Digi Slovakia |publisher=informa.com |date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Also, satellite television subsidiary in the Czech Republic was sold to Lama Energy in march 2015,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2015/03/23/czech-digi-tv-to-be-sold/ |title=Czech Digi TV to be sold |publisher=broadbandtvnews.com |date=23 March 2015}}</ref> which continued to use the Digi brand for other acquired internet and IPTV provider until 1 April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mediaguru.cz/clanky/2020/03/digi-tv-se-od-dubna-meni-na-telly-zavadi-nove-balicky/ |title=Digi TV se od dubna m\u011bn\u00ed na Telly, zav\u00e1d\u00ed nov\u00e9 bal\u00ed\u010dky |publisher=mediaguru.cz |date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\nThe subsidiary in Croatia was sold to [[A1 Telekom Austria]]'s Vipnet (now [[A1 Hrvatska|A1 Croatia]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.filmneweurope.com/news/croatia-news/item/105095-rcsrds-sells-digi-tv-croatia-to-vipnet |title=RCS&RDS Sells Digi TV Croatia to Vipnet |publisher=filmneweurope.com |date=13 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile development ===\nIn 2014, the mobile phone service was relaunched, followed by the launch of [[4G]] service in 2015. \n\nSatellite television subsidiary in Serbia was sold to Kopernikus Technology, which in turn was sold to [[Telekom Srbija]] (mts) in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parabola.cz/clanky/6523/srbska-digi-tv-prodana-spolecnosti-kopernikus-ta-srbskemu-telekomu/ |title=Srbsk\u00e1 Digi TV prod\u00e1na spole\u010dnosti Kopernikus.

Then followed the implementation of GPON in 2008, covering the houses as well. In 2013 started replacing FFTB with [[Fiber to the home|FTTH]]. In 2018 Digi started offering internet services through FTTH in Spain.\n\n=== Mobile telephony ===\n\nThe company launched Digi Mobil in Romania in December 2007 wich offered mobile telephony limited to [[3G]] service only at the time. In 2014, the mobile phone service was relaunched, followed by the launch of [[4G]] service on band 38 in 2015 and on band 1 in 2018.\n\nAfter winning a mobile operator licence in 2014 and numerous delays, the company launched mobile services in Hungary in 2019.\n\nIn Spain, due to the number of Romanians, [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] mobile telephony services were launched through [[Movistar]] in 2008. Initially, the company attracted Romanians because it offered cheap calls with Romanian networks. Vodafone Spain reacted after 1 year when it started losing customers by offering free calls with Vodafone Romania. This was followed by offers for Latin Americans.\nThen the company started offering internet at a low price, attracting Spanish customers. Digi became the second MVNO operator by number of customers. \n\nFollowing the model in Spain, in 2010 Digi Mobil was launched as MVNO in Italy through [[Telecom Italia|TIM]], but it was not as successful despite the fact that in Italy is a larger number of Romanians. Vodafone Italia began to offer free calls with Vodafone Romania and fixed networks before the launch of Digi Mobil.\n\n=== Cable television ===\n\nThe company offers all channels in one package except premium channels.\n\n=== Television channels ===\n\nIn July 2009, Digi launched the [[Digi Sport]] channels in Romania and Hungary. Then followed the Digi Sport channels in Slovakia and the Czech Republic in August 2010, which have been operated separately since 2013 following the takeover of Digi Slovakia by Slovak Telekom. \n\nIn the summer of 2010, it acquired 50% of Music Channel, which launched Hit Music Channel in January 2012. The company launched a generalist channel in December 2010, but due to the low audience it was closed. The [[premium]] movie channel Digi Film (now Film Now) was launched on 1 February 2011. In 2011 acquired the UTV music TV channel.\n\n[[Digi 24]] TV news channel was launched on 1 March 2012. Following disagreements with [[Discovery Inc.|Discovery]], the company launched 3 thematic channels in October 2012: Digi World, Digi Life and Digi Animal World. On 10 December 2018 was launched Digi 4K.\n\n=== Energy supplier === \n\nIn April 2015, Digi launched the energy supply service. The company had in 2017 the most subscribers on the competitive market from the companies that do not have the distribution infrastructure. In 2019, it increased tariffs by 30% due to a tax added by the government and then by 20%. The company announced that it is gradually giving up the supply service due to the unusual volatility of the electricity price.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://energyreport.ro/index.php/2013-electricitate/2013-stiri-electricitate/2013-energie-electrica/5020-digi-retrage-furnizarea-de-energie-din-grila-de-programe-a-companiei |title=Digi retrage furnizarea de energie din grila de programe a companiei |publisher=energyreport.ro |date=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Digi brand ==\n\nRCS & RDS introduced the Digi TV brand for satellite television services in December 2004 in Romania and in 2006 in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Serbia. In 2006 the company unified under the Digi brand the cable television, internet and telephony services in Hungary, followed by Slovakia in June 2007.

The company offered cable television services in [[Brasov]] and [[Timisoara]]. In 1993 Zolt\u00e1n Tesz\u00e1ri co-founded Kappa cable company in Bucharest. In 1996, the shareholders decided to divide the Kappa network into two equal parts. Half owned by Zolta Tzesari merged with Analog CATV SA cable company in Bucharest. The other half was bought in 2000 by [[Astral Telecom]], which in 2005 was merged with [[UPC Romania]] (now [[Vodafone Romania]]). This separation of the company led to the division of the areas in Bucharest between the two companies for 10 years. \n\nA cable network was built in [[Chisinau]], [[Republic of Moldova]] in 1995, which was later sold.\n\n=== Development ===\n\nIn 1997 the company changed its name to '''Romania Cable Systems SA''' ('''RCS'''). Same year it is established '''Romania Data System SA''' ('''RDS''') which offers internet services. Among the investors in the company from the beginning until the listing on the stock exchange were Carpathian Cable Investments S.a.R.L. from 1998 and Celest Limited from 1999. \n\nThe company entered Hungary in November 1998 after buying 15 small and medium cable companies in [[Budapest]] and 3 other cities. Between December 1999 and January 2000, the first cable networks were acquired in [[Slovakia]], where Slovakia Cable Systems (SCS) was 95% owned by RCS.\n\nIn April 2000, the project to build a 4,200 km national [[fiber optic]] network was initiated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rcs.ro/despre.php |title=Romania Cable Systems |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608074723/http://www.rcs.ro/despre.php |archivedate=8 June 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, after the liberalization of the market, the [[landline|fixed telephony]] service was launched in Romania. Digi TV [[satellite television]] platform was first launched in Romania in December 2004, followed by launches in Hungary in February 2006, in the [[Czech Republic]] and Slovakia in August 2006 and in [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]] in December 2006.\n\n=== 2005-2014 ===\n[[Image:RCS & RDS Logo.png|thumb|RCS & RDS logo (2005-2012)|160px]]\nRCS and RDS merged to form RCS & RDS on 26 April 2005. The company focused on rapid development both organically and through acquisitions. The C-Zone network was acquired in 2006, entering certain areas in Bucharest that were not covered due to zone exclusivity. In these areas RCS & RDS kept the brand until 2009.\n\nDigi Slovakia, including the Digi Sport television channels in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, were sold to [[Slovak Telekom]] in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://technology.informa.com/435165/slovak-telekom-to-buy-digi-slovakia |title=Slovak Telekom to buy Digi Slovakia |publisher=informa.com |date=22 May 2013}}</ref> Also, satellite television subsidiary in the Czech Republic was sold to Lama Energy in march 2015,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2015/03/23/czech-digi-tv-to-be-sold/ |title=Czech Digi TV to be sold |publisher=broadbandtvnews.com |date=23 March 2015}}</ref> which continued to use the Digi brand for other acquired internet and IPTV provider until 1 April 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mediaguru.cz/clanky/2020/03/digi-tv-se-od-dubna-meni-na-telly-zavadi-nove-balicky/ |title=Digi TV se od dubna m\u011bn\u00ed na Telly, zav\u00e1d\u00ed nov\u00e9 bal\u00ed\u010dky |publisher=mediaguru.cz |date=18 March 2020}}</ref>\nThe subsidiary in Croatia was sold to [[A1 Telekom Austria]]'s Vipnet (now [[A1 Hrvatska|A1 Croatia]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.filmneweurope.com/news/croatia-news/item/105095-rcsrds-sells-digi-tv-croatia-to-vipnet |title=RCS&RDS Sells Digi TV Croatia to Vipnet |publisher=filmneweurope.com |date=13 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Mobile development ===\nIn 2014, the mobile phone service was relaunched, followed by the launch of [[4G]] service in 2015. \n\nSatellite television subsidiary in Serbia was sold to Kopernikus Technology, which in turn was sold to [[Telekom Srbija]] (mts) in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.parabola.cz/clanky/6523/srbska-digi-tv-prodana-spolecnosti-kopernikus-ta-srbskemu-telekomu/ |title=Srbsk\u00e1 Digi TV prod\u00e1na spole\u010dnosti Kopernikus.

After initially receiving approval in May 2018, it was revoked in November 2018, due to finding non-competitive issues in certain areas. These have been resolved and the transaction was completed in March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.media-max.ro/digi-primeste-o-noua-aprobare-privind-tranzactia-invitel/ |title=Digi primeste o noua aprobare privind tranzactia Invitel |publisher=media-max.ro |date=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Corporate structure ==\n\nRCS & RDS SA it's the Romanian company founded in 1994 by Zolt\u00e1n Tesz\u00e1ri. It's incorporated in the Netherlands since 2000 when Cable Communications NV was establised.

Then followed the implementation of GPON in 2008, covering the houses as well. In 2013 started replacing FFTB with [[Fiber to the home|FTTH]]. In 2018 Digi started offering internet services through FTTH in Spain.\n\n=== Mobile telephony ===\n\nThe company launched Digi Mobil in Romania in December 2007 wich offered mobile telephony limited to [[3G]] service only at the time. In 2014, the mobile phone service was relaunched, followed by the launch of [[4G]] service on band 38 in 2015 and on band 1 in 2018.\n\nAfter winning a mobile operator licence in 2014 and numerous delays, the company launched mobile services in Hungary in 2019.\n\nIn Spain, due to the number of Romanians, [[Mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] mobile telephony services were launched through [[Movistar]] in 2008. Initially, the company attracted Romanians because it offered cheap calls with Romanian networks. Vodafone Spain reacted after 1 year when it started losing customers by offering free calls with Vodafone Romania. This was followed by offers for Latin Americans.\nThen the company started offering internet at a low price, attracting Spanish customers. Digi became the second MVNO operator by number of customers. \n\nFollowing the model in Spain, in 2010 Digi Mobil was launched as MVNO in Italy through [[Telecom Italia|TIM]], but it was not as successful despite the fact that in Italy is a larger number of Romanians. Vodafone Italia began to offer free calls with Vodafone Romania and fixed networks before the launch of Digi Mobil.\n\n=== Cable television ===\n\nThe company offers all channels in one package except premium channels.\n\n=== Television channels ===\n\nIn July 2009, Digi launched the [[Digi Sport]] channels in Romania and Hungary. Then followed the Digi Sport channels in Slovakia and the Czech Republic in August 2010, which have been operated separately since 2013 following the takeover of Digi Slovakia by Slovak Telekom. \n\nIn the summer of 2010, it acquired 50% of Music Channel, which launched Hit Music Channel in January 2012. The company launched a generalist channel in December 2010, but due to the low audience it was closed. The [[premium]] movie channel Digi Film (now Film Now) was launched on 1 February 2011. In 2011 acquired the UTV music TV channel.\n\n[[Digi 24]] TV news channel was launched on 1 March 2012. Following disagreements with [[Discovery Inc.|Discovery]], the company launched 3 thematic channels in October 2012: Digi World, Digi Life and Digi Animal World. On 10 December 2018 was launched Digi 4K.\n\n=== Energy supplier === \n\nIn April 2015, Digi launched the energy supply service. The company had in 2017 the most subscribers on the competitive market from the companies that do not have the distribution infrastructure. In 2019, it increased tariffs by 30% due to a tax added by the government and then by 20%. The company announced that it is gradually giving up the supply service due to the unusual volatility of the electricity price.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://energyreport.ro/index.php/2013-electricitate/2013-stiri-electricitate/2013-energie-electrica/5020-digi-retrage-furnizarea-de-energie-din-grila-de-programe-a-companiei |title=Digi retrage furnizarea de energie din grila de programe a companiei |publisher=energyreport.ro |date=3 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Digi brand ==\n\nRCS & RDS introduced the Digi TV brand for satellite television services in December 2004 in Romania and in 2006 in Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Serbia. In 2006 the company unified under the Digi brand the cable television, internet and telephony services in Hungary, followed by Slovakia in June 2007.
