It also hosted the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final]]. Various national [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] and qualification matches for World and European tournaments have been played there as well as matches in European club competitions.\n\n==History==\nPlans to construct a new stadium were drawn up in the 1960s, as the need arose to expand and refurbish the traditional ground of Borussia Dortmund, the [[Stadion Rote Erde]] (\"Red Soil Stadium\"). Following the historic triumph in the [[1965\u201366 European Cup Winners' Cup|1966 Cup Winners' Cup]] (Dortmund was the first German team to win a European club title), it became clear that the Stadion Rote Erde was too small for the increasing number of Borussia Dortmund supporters. The city of Dortmund, however, was not able to finance a new stadium and federal institutions were unwilling to help.\n\nIn 1971, Dortmund was selected to replace the city of [[Cologne]], which was forced to withdraw its plans to host games in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. The funds originally set aside for the projected stadium in Cologne were thus re-allocated to Dortmund. However, architects and planners had to keep an eye on the costs due to a tight budget. This meant that plans for a 60 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] oval stadium featuring the traditional athletic facilities and holding 60,000 spectators had to be discarded. Instead, plans for a much cheaper 54,000 spectator football arena, built of pre-fabricated concrete sections, became a reality. Ultimately, the costs amounted to 32.7 million DM, of which 1.6 million DM were invested in the refurbishment of the Stadion Rote Erde. The city of Dortmund, initially burdened with 6 million DM, only had to pay 800,000 DM, and quickly profited from the stadium's high revenues.\nOn 2 April 1974, Borussia Dortmund officially moved into their new home and has played in the Westfalenstadion ever since. Having been [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] in 1972, Borussia Dortmund was the only member of the [[2. Bundesliga]] (second Division) to host the 1974 World Cup games in a completely new stadium. In 1976, after promotion to the [[Bundesliga]], Borussia Dortmund played its first game in Germany's highest division in their new home stadium.\n\nOn 16 May 2001, the Westfalenstadion hosted the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final]] between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Deportivo Alav\u00e9s|Alav\u00e9s]].\n\n==1974 FIFA World Cup==\nIn the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], the Westfalenstadion hosted three group stage games and one final group game. The maximum capacity of the stadium was 54,000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!Date !!

The eastern and western stands (Ost- und Westtrib\u00fcne) run the entire length of the field, while the breadth is covered by the north and south stands (Nord- und S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne).\n\nOriginally, the corners between the four grandstands remained empty and the spectators appreciated the extensive roof, which covered over 80% of the stands. The eastern and western stands housed the stadium's 17,000 seats, while the 37,000 standing places were housed in the northern and southern stands.\n\n{{wide image|Signal Iduna Park Panorama.jpg|900px|align-cap=center|The panoramic view of Westfalenstadion}}\n\nLocated on the southern terrace of the stadium is Dortmund's \"Yellow Wall\", which is the largest free-standing grandstand in Europe with a capacity of 25,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2012/dec/02/borussia-dortmund-yellow-wall-in-pictures|title=Borussia Dortmund's Yellow Wall - in pictures|first=Gary|last=Calton|date=2 December 2012|website=the Guardian}}</ref> The \"Yellow Wall\" gives Westfalenstadion one of the most intimidating home atmospheres in all of Europe, aiding Borussia Dortmund to an unbeaten home campaign in [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League]].<ref name=\"espnfc.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/stats?league=uefa.champions# |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230071715/http://espnfc.com/stats?league=uefa.champions# |archive-date=30 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> then-[[Bayern Munich]] midfielder [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], when asked whether he feared Dortmund's players or their manager, more, responded by saying \"It is the Yellow Wall that scares me the most.\" <ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/29624410|title=Price of Football 2014: Why fans flock to Borussia Dortmund|date=15 October 2014|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>\n\n==Expansions==\n[[File:Leeres Westfalenstadion.jpg|thumb|left|Westfalenstadion seen from inside.]]\n\nThe first expansion plans are dated back to 1961, although the funding required was not available until 4 October 1971 when the city council decided to rebuild the stadium between 1971 and 1974 for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. As part of the extensions an additional roof was added around the stadium that weighed 3000 tons.\n\nThe original capacity of 54,000 was reduced in 1992 due to [[UEFA]] regulations. As the standing rows on the entire northern, the lower eastern and the lower western grandstands were converted into seats, the capacity shrank to 42,800. With 26,000 seats (of which 23,000 were covered), the seating in the Westfalenstadion now outnumbered the standing rows.\n\n[[File:Suedtribuene.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The south stand, ''Die S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne'', is the largest free-standing grandstand in Europe. Fans call it \"Die gelbe Wand\", which means \"The Yellow Wall\"]]<ref name=\"espnfc.com\"/>\nAfter Borussia Dortmund won the Bundesliga in 1995, the Westfalenstadion was expanded yet again. In the first private venture stadium expansion in German history, the two main grandstands, the eastern and the western blocks, received a second tier. Covered by a new roof-construction, each section housed an additional 6,000 seats. Thus, the stadium's capacity was restored to the original 54,000, of which the majority (38,500) were now covered seats. Following Dortmund's [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|1997]] UEFA Champions League victory, success and an ever-growing number of enthusiastic fans made it necessary to enlarge the Westfalenstadion yet again. The southern and northern grandstands were enlarged this time, boosting the total capacity to 68,800 spectators. The southern standing ranks (''\"Die S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne\"'', where the home team's supporters gather) became the largest free-standing grandstand of its kind in the whole of Europe, with a capacity of 25,000.\n\n[[File:Westfalenstadion-207-.JPG|thumb|left|The yellow pylons that give the stadium its characteristic exterior.]]\nNow it is considered one of the biggest and most comfortable stadiums in Europe. The last renovation was made for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The stadium has a glass front, under-soil heating (allowing matches in winter) and the biggest terraced stand. It is Germany\u2019s largest stadium capacity of 81,360. The expansion was realised by the German architectural firm of [[Architekten Schr\u00f6der Schulte-Ladbeck]]. There are four video screens inside the stadium. The fifth screen on the outside of the north stands is smaller, measuring 28 square meters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSince 1 December 2005, Westfalenstadion carries the name of Signal Iduna Park, under an agreement which lasts until 2021.\n\n[[File:Borusseum.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Borusseum'', a museum about [[Borussia Dortmund]], opened in 2008.]]\n\nWhen Germany won the World Cup bid in 2000, it became clear that Westfalenstadion would play a leading role in hosting the tournament. However, as the Westfalenstadion failed to fulfill [[FIFA]] requirements for hosting semi-finals, it had to be enlarged a third time. Four new stands were built to fill the corners between the existing grandstands, raising the [[seating capacity]] for international games from 52,000 to 67,000. Additionally, the new corner elements provide seating and catering to VIP guests, increasing the total number of VIP seats to 5,000. In order to provide the new sections with an unblocked view of the field, the existing interior roof supports were removed and replaced by exterior pylons, which were painted yellow to suit the Borussia Dortmund colors. During the course of those renovations, construction workers found an undetonated 1,000\u2013pound (450&nbsp;kg) bomb dropped by an Allied bomber in [[World War II]] that was only about one metre below the halfway line on the pitch. Bomb disposal experts had to evacuate the stadium and surrounding neighbourhood in Dortmund, which as part of Germany's industrial centre was bombed heavily, before taking an hour to defuse the device.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url          = http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-02-06/Berlin_airport_a_graveyard_of_WW2_bombs.html\n |title        = Berlin airport a graveyard of WW2 bombs\n |author       = Ciaran Walsh\n |date         = 6 February 2009\n |publisher    = RT\n |accessdate   = 19 March 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100410192129/http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-02-06/Berlin_airport_a_graveyard_of_WW2_bombs.html#\n |archive-date = 10 April 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium now hosts up to 81,365 fans (standing and seated) for league matches, and 65,829 seated spectators for international games where the characteristic Southern grandstand is re-equipped with seats to conform with FIFA regulations.

Following that, Westfalenstadion was in the possession of [[Florian Homm]] for about two years,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} it was sold back to a real estate trust with Borussia Dortmund intending to repurchase the stadium gradually up to 2017. However the club was not able to pay the regular rates in spring 2005 and the holders of the trust agreed in cutting back the asset's interest rates and allowed the club to pay the rates after financial reorganisation. Because of these measures, bankruptcy of the club was avoided and the future of the facility was secured. In 2006 Borussia Dortmund became the new owner by buying the stadium back with the help of a loan from Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn order to reduce debt, the naming rights to the stadium was sold to an insurance company, [[Signal Iduna]]. From 2005 until 2021, the stadium will be known as the \"Signal Iduna Park\". During the 2006 World Cup, however, the stadium was called \"FIFA World Cup Stadium Dortmund\", since FIFA controls all naming rights in connection with the World Cup.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Dortmund M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke HDR.jpg|thumb|Subway Station M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke]]\nSignal Iduna Park can be reached with the [[Dortmund Stadtbahn]] (light rail) lines U42 (''Theodor-Fliedner-Heim'' Station), U45 (''Stadion'' Station), U46 (''[[Westfalenhallen (VRR)|Westfalenhallen]]'' Station and also ''Stadion''). The U45 and U46 are unique in that they serve the special station, ''Stadion'', that is open on game days only. Additionally ''[[Deutsche Bahn]]'' serves the ''[[Dortmund Signal-Iduna-Park station|Dortmund Signal-Iduna-Park]]'' station with both regularly scheduled and special game-day trains. This station can be reached using regional [[Regionalbahn|RB]] trains from [[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof|Dortmund Central Station]], as well as from other cities in the metropolitan area, such as [[Hagen]], [[Iserlohn]], and [[L\u00fcdenscheid]]. However, some supporters usually alight the U42 and S4 at the ''[[Dortmund M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke station|M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke]]'' station and walk to Signal Iduna Park through the ''Kreuzviertel'' via ''Lindemannstra\u00dfe'' or ''Arneckestra\u00dfe''.\n\nThe stadium can be reached from [[Dortmund Airport]] by taking the shuttle bus to the Holzwickede/Dortmund Airport train station, taking train [[Hellweg Net#RB 59: Hellweg-Bahn|RB59]] towards Dortmund Central Station and getting out at ''Signal Iduna Park''.\n\nBy car the stadium can be reached via the B 1 ''Ruhrschnellweg'' and B 54. Parking is also available at [[Dortmund University of Technology]], where shuttle busses take fans to the stadium.\n\n===Surroundings===\n[[File:Kreuzviertel Althoffblock alte Hoeschzentrale von Florianturm.jpg|thumb|Surrounding Area - Kreuzviertel.]]\nFrom the subway station ''[[Dortmund M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke station|M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke]]'' visitors approach the stadium through the [[Kreuzviertel]]. It is well known for its many bars, clubs, pubs, and cafes, concentrated in the vicinity of Kreuzstra\u00dfe and Vinkeplatz and create a day and nightlife atmosphere unique from the rest of the city. That's the reason why the subway station and the city quarter is popular by local fans and those visiting of Borussia Dortmund as a last resort for drinking a cheap beer in the numerous Pubs around the Stadium. On match days, many traders sell beer, sausages (Bratwurst) and jerseys on the street. The north side of the stadium is also the site of a lot of exhibition hotels, apartments and the \"Mit Schmackes\", a football-themed restaurant and fan clubhouse conceived by former Borussia Dortmund player [[Kevin Grosskreutz]].\n\nOn the other side of the Autobahn, the [[Trade fair]] with its [[Westfalenhallen]] and TV Tower called [[Florianturm]] affords a marvellous view on the stadium.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Werner Skrentny (Hrsg.), ''Das grosse Buch der Deutschen Fussball-Stadien'', G\u00f6ttingen: Verlag Die Werkstatt, 2001\n*Gernot Stick, ''Stadien 2111'', Basel: Birkh\u00e4user 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Signal Iduna Park}}\n* [http://www.signal-iduna-park.de Signal Iduna Park, official site] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.bvb.de/?%99%5B%1B%E4%F4%9D Stadium page at the official Borussia Dortmund website]\n* [http://www.football-match.de/dortmund/ Atmosphere at Signal Iduna Park]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box|\n  title=[[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]<br>[[List of UEFA Cup and Europa League finals|Final venue]]|\n  before=[[Parken Stadium]] <br> [[Copenhagen]]|\n  after=[[De Kuip]] <br> [[Rotterdam]]|\n  years=[[2001 UEFA Cup Final|2001]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Borussia Dortmund}}\n{{Bundesliga venues}}\n{{FIFA World Cup 1974 stadiums}}\n{{World Cup 2006 stadiums}}\n{{UEFA Euro 2024 stadiums}}\n\n{{Coord|51|29|33.25|N|7|27|6.63|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1974 FIFA World Cup stadiums]]\n[[Category:2006 FIFA World Cup stadiums]]\n[[Category:UEFA Euro 2024 stadiums]]\n[[Category:Football venues in Germany]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Dortmund]]\n[[Category:Borussia Dortmund]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:1974 establishments in West Germany]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1974]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox stadium\n| stadium_name      = Signal Iduna Park\n| nickname          = Westfalenstadion<br />BVB Stadion Dortmund ([[UEFA competitions]])\n| logo_image        = SIGNAL IDUNA PARK Logo.svg\n| image             = [[File:Signal iduna park stadium dortmund 4.jpg|300px]]\n| caption           = '''[[UEFA Elite stadium|UEFA]]''' {{rating|4|4}}\n| fullname          = Signal Iduna Park\n| location          = Strobelallee 50<br />44139 [[Dortmund]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]\n| built             = 1971\u20131974\n| opened            = 2 April 1974\n| renovated         = 1992, 1995\u201399, 2002\u201303, 2006\n| owner             = Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co.

It also hosted the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final]]. Various national [[Exhibition game|friendlies]] and qualification matches for World and European tournaments have been played there as well as matches in European club competitions.\n\n==History==\nPlans to construct a new stadium were drawn up in the 1960s, as the need arose to expand and refurbish the traditional ground of Borussia Dortmund, the [[Stadion Rote Erde]] (\"Red Soil Stadium\"). Following the historic triumph in the [[1965\u201366 European Cup Winners' Cup|1966 Cup Winners' Cup]] (Dortmund was the first German team to win a European club title), it became clear that the Stadion Rote Erde was too small for the increasing number of Borussia Dortmund supporters. The city of Dortmund, however, was not able to finance a new stadium and federal institutions were unwilling to help.\n\nIn 1971, Dortmund was selected to replace the city of [[Cologne]], which was forced to withdraw its plans to host games in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. The funds originally set aside for the projected stadium in Cologne were thus re-allocated to Dortmund. However, architects and planners had to keep an eye on the costs due to a tight budget. This meant that plans for a 60 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] oval stadium featuring the traditional athletic facilities and holding 60,000 spectators had to be discarded. Instead, plans for a much cheaper 54,000 spectator football arena, built of pre-fabricated concrete sections, became a reality. Ultimately, the costs amounted to 32.7 million DM, of which 1.6 million DM were invested in the refurbishment of the Stadion Rote Erde. The city of Dortmund, initially burdened with 6 million DM, only had to pay 800,000 DM, and quickly profited from the stadium's high revenues.\nOn 2 April 1974, Borussia Dortmund officially moved into their new home and has played in the Westfalenstadion ever since. Having been [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] in 1972, Borussia Dortmund was the only member of the [[2. Bundesliga]] (second Division) to host the 1974 World Cup games in a completely new stadium. In 1976, after promotion to the [[Bundesliga]], Borussia Dortmund played its first game in Germany's highest division in their new home stadium.\n\nOn 16 May 2001, the Westfalenstadion hosted the [[2001 UEFA Cup Final]] between [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Deportivo Alav\u00e9s|Alav\u00e9s]].\n\n==1974 FIFA World Cup==\nIn the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], the Westfalenstadion hosted three group stage games and one final group game. The maximum capacity of the stadium was 54,000.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"100%\"\n|-\n!Date !!

The eastern and western stands (Ost- und Westtrib\u00fcne) run the entire length of the field, while the breadth is covered by the north and south stands (Nord- und S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne).\n\nOriginally, the corners between the four grandstands remained empty and the spectators appreciated the extensive roof, which covered over 80% of the stands. The eastern and western stands housed the stadium's 17,000 seats, while the 37,000 standing places were housed in the northern and southern stands.\n\n{{wide image|Signal Iduna Park Panorama.jpg|900px|align-cap=center|The panoramic view of Westfalenstadion}}\n\nLocated on the southern terrace of the stadium is Dortmund's \"Yellow Wall\", which is the largest free-standing grandstand in Europe with a capacity of 25,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2012/dec/02/borussia-dortmund-yellow-wall-in-pictures|title=Borussia Dortmund's Yellow Wall - in pictures|first=Gary|last=Calton|date=2 December 2012|website=the Guardian}}</ref> The \"Yellow Wall\" gives Westfalenstadion one of the most intimidating home atmospheres in all of Europe, aiding Borussia Dortmund to an unbeaten home campaign in [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League]].<ref name=\"espnfc.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://espnfc.com/stats?league=uefa.champions# |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230071715/http://espnfc.com/stats?league=uefa.champions# |archive-date=30 December 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> then-[[Bayern Munich]] midfielder [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]], when asked whether he feared Dortmund's players or their manager, more, responded by saying \"It is the Yellow Wall that scares me the most.\" <ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/29624410|title=Price of Football 2014: Why fans flock to Borussia Dortmund|date=15 October 2014|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref>\n\n==Expansions==\n[[File:Leeres Westfalenstadion.jpg|thumb|left|Westfalenstadion seen from inside.]]\n\nThe first expansion plans are dated back to 1961, although the funding required was not available until 4 October 1971 when the city council decided to rebuild the stadium between 1971 and 1974 for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. As part of the extensions an additional roof was added around the stadium that weighed 3000 tons.\n\nThe original capacity of 54,000 was reduced in 1992 due to [[UEFA]] regulations. As the standing rows on the entire northern, the lower eastern and the lower western grandstands were converted into seats, the capacity shrank to 42,800. With 26,000 seats (of which 23,000 were covered), the seating in the Westfalenstadion now outnumbered the standing rows.\n\n[[File:Suedtribuene.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The south stand, ''Die S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne'', is the largest free-standing grandstand in Europe. Fans call it \"Die gelbe Wand\", which means \"The Yellow Wall\"]]<ref name=\"espnfc.com\"/>\nAfter Borussia Dortmund won the Bundesliga in 1995, the Westfalenstadion was expanded yet again. In the first private venture stadium expansion in German history, the two main grandstands, the eastern and the western blocks, received a second tier. Covered by a new roof-construction, each section housed an additional 6,000 seats. Thus, the stadium's capacity was restored to the original 54,000, of which the majority (38,500) were now covered seats. Following Dortmund's [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|1997]] UEFA Champions League victory, success and an ever-growing number of enthusiastic fans made it necessary to enlarge the Westfalenstadion yet again. The southern and northern grandstands were enlarged this time, boosting the total capacity to 68,800 spectators. The southern standing ranks (''\"Die S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne\"'', where the home team's supporters gather) became the largest free-standing grandstand of its kind in the whole of Europe, with a capacity of 25,000.\n\n[[File:Westfalenstadion-207-.JPG|thumb|left|The yellow pylons that give the stadium its characteristic exterior.]]\nNow it is considered one of the biggest and most comfortable stadiums in Europe. The last renovation was made for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The stadium has a glass front, under-soil heating (allowing matches in winter) and the biggest terraced stand. It is Germany\u2019s largest stadium capacity of 81,360. The expansion was realised by the German architectural firm of [[Architekten Schr\u00f6der Schulte-Ladbeck]]. There are four video screens inside the stadium. The fifth screen on the outside of the north stands is smaller, measuring 28 square meters.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSince 1 December 2005, Westfalenstadion carries the name of Signal Iduna Park, under an agreement which lasts until 2021.\n\n[[File:Borusseum.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Borusseum'', a museum about [[Borussia Dortmund]], opened in 2008.]]\n\nWhen Germany won the World Cup bid in 2000, it became clear that Westfalenstadion would play a leading role in hosting the tournament. However, as the Westfalenstadion failed to fulfill [[FIFA]] requirements for hosting semi-finals, it had to be enlarged a third time. Four new stands were built to fill the corners between the existing grandstands, raising the [[seating capacity]] for international games from 52,000 to 67,000. Additionally, the new corner elements provide seating and catering to VIP guests, increasing the total number of VIP seats to 5,000. In order to provide the new sections with an unblocked view of the field, the existing interior roof supports were removed and replaced by exterior pylons, which were painted yellow to suit the Borussia Dortmund colors. During the course of those renovations, construction workers found an undetonated 1,000\u2013pound (450&nbsp;kg) bomb dropped by an Allied bomber in [[World War II]] that was only about one metre below the halfway line on the pitch. Bomb disposal experts had to evacuate the stadium and surrounding neighbourhood in Dortmund, which as part of Germany's industrial centre was bombed heavily, before taking an hour to defuse the device.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url          = http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-02-06/Berlin_airport_a_graveyard_of_WW2_bombs.html\n |title        = Berlin airport a graveyard of WW2 bombs\n |author       = Ciaran Walsh\n |date         = 6 February 2009\n |publisher    = RT\n |accessdate   = 19 March 2010\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100410192129/http://rt.com/Top_News/2009-02-06/Berlin_airport_a_graveyard_of_WW2_bombs.html#\n |archive-date = 10 April 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nThe stadium now hosts up to 81,365 fans (standing and seated) for league matches, and 65,829 seated spectators for international games where the characteristic Southern grandstand is re-equipped with seats to conform with FIFA regulations.

Following that, Westfalenstadion was in the possession of [[Florian Homm]] for about two years,{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} it was sold back to a real estate trust with Borussia Dortmund intending to repurchase the stadium gradually up to 2017. However the club was not able to pay the regular rates in spring 2005 and the holders of the trust agreed in cutting back the asset's interest rates and allowed the club to pay the rates after financial reorganisation. Because of these measures, bankruptcy of the club was avoided and the future of the facility was secured. In 2006 Borussia Dortmund became the new owner by buying the stadium back with the help of a loan from Morgan Stanley.\n\nIn order to reduce debt, the naming rights to the stadium was sold to an insurance company, [[Signal Iduna]]. From 2005 until 2021, the stadium will be known as the \"Signal Iduna Park\". During the 2006 World Cup, however, the stadium was called \"FIFA World Cup Stadium Dortmund\", since FIFA controls all naming rights in connection with the World Cup.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Dortmund M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke HDR.jpg|thumb|Subway Station M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke]]\nSignal Iduna Park can be reached with the [[Dortmund Stadtbahn]] (light rail) lines U42 (''Theodor-Fliedner-Heim'' Station), U45 (''Stadion'' Station), U46 (''[[Westfalenhallen (VRR)|Westfalenhallen]]'' Station and also ''Stadion'').

This station can be reached using regional [[Regionalbahn|RB]] trains from [[Dortmund Hauptbahnhof|Dortmund Central Station]], as well as from other cities in the metropolitan area, such as [[Hagen]], [[Iserlohn]], and [[L\u00fcdenscheid]]. However, some supporters usually alight the U42 and S4 at the ''[[Dortmund M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke station|M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke]]'' station and walk to Signal Iduna Park through the ''Kreuzviertel'' via ''Lindemannstra\u00dfe'' or ''Arneckestra\u00dfe''.\n\nThe stadium can be reached from [[Dortmund Airport]] by taking the shuttle bus to the Holzwickede/Dortmund Airport train station, taking train [[Hellweg Net#RB 59: Hellweg-Bahn|RB59]] towards Dortmund Central Station and getting out at ''Signal Iduna Park''.\n\nBy car the stadium can be reached via the B 1 ''Ruhrschnellweg'' and B 54. Parking is also available at [[Dortmund University of Technology]], where shuttle busses take fans to the stadium.\n\n===Surroundings===\n[[File:Kreuzviertel Althoffblock alte Hoeschzentrale von Florianturm.jpg|thumb|Surrounding Area - Kreuzviertel.]]\nFrom the subway station ''[[Dortmund M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke station|M\u00f6llerbr\u00fccke]]'' visitors approach the stadium through the [[Kreuzviertel]]. It is well known for its many bars, clubs, pubs, and cafes, concentrated in the vicinity of Kreuzstra\u00dfe and Vinkeplatz and create a day and nightlife atmosphere unique from the rest of the city. That's the reason why the subway station and the city quarter is popular by local fans and those visiting of Borussia Dortmund as a last resort for drinking a cheap beer in the numerous Pubs around the Stadium. On match days, many traders sell beer, sausages (Bratwurst) and jerseys on the street. The north side of the stadium is also the site of a lot of exhibition hotels, apartments and the \"Mit Schmackes\", a football-themed restaurant and fan clubhouse conceived by former Borussia Dortmund player [[Kevin Grosskreutz]].\n\nOn the other side of the Autobahn, the [[Trade fair]] with its [[Westfalenhallen]] and TV Tower called [[Florianturm]] affords a marvellous view on the stadium.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*Werner Skrentny (Hrsg.), ''Das grosse Buch der Deutschen Fussball-Stadien'', G\u00f6ttingen: Verlag Die Werkstatt, 2001\n*Gernot Stick, ''Stadien 2111'', Basel: Birkh\u00e4user 2005\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Signal Iduna Park}}\n* [http://www.signal-iduna-park.de Signal Iduna Park, official site] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.bvb.de/?%99%5B%1B%E4%F4%9D Stadium page at the official Borussia Dortmund website]\n* [http://www.football-match.de/dortmund/ Atmosphere at Signal Iduna Park]\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box|\n  title=[[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]]<br>[[List of UEFA Cup and Europa League finals|Final venue]]|\n  before=[[Parken Stadium]] <br> [[Copenhagen]]|\n  after=[[De Kuip]] <br> [[Rotterdam]]|\n  years=[[2001 UEFA Cup Final|2001]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{Borussia Dortmund}}\n{{Bundesliga venues}}\n{{FIFA World Cup 1974 stadiums}}\n{{World Cup 2006 stadiums}}\n{{UEFA Euro 2024 stadiums}}\n\n{{Coord|51|29|33.25|N|7|27|6.63|E|type:landmark|display=title}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1974 FIFA World Cup stadiums]]\n[[Category:2006 FIFA World Cup stadiums]]\n[[Category:UEFA Euro 2024 stadiums]]\n[[Category:Football venues in Germany]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Dortmund]]\n[[Category:Borussia Dortmund]]\n[[Category:Sports venues in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:1974 establishments in West Germany]]\n[[Category:Sports venues completed in 1974]]\n", "name_user": "TheInimitableECypher", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion"}
