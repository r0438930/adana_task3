Wazir Khan nevertheless had the Sahibzadas tortured and bricked into a section of wall while still alive. At this, the Nawab of Malerkotla walked out of the court in protest. Guru Gobind Singh on learning this kind and humanitarian approach profusely thanked the Nawab of Malerkotla and blessed him with his [[Hukamnama]], [[Kirpan]], etc. In recognition of this act, the State of Malerkotla did not witness a single incident of violence during partition.<ref name=Tribune2006/> Many local people attribute this peaceful strain to the presence of the shrine of 'Baba Haidar Sheikh', the Sufi saint, who founded the town of Malerkotla more than 500 years ago.<ref>[https://www.nationalfilmnetwork.com/Store/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=644&Title=The%20Legend%20of%20Malerkotla:%20A%20Tale%20from%20the%20Punjab&RefPage=ProductsList.aspx&CategoryID=79 The Legend of Malerkotla: A Tale from the Punjab (2004)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019094523/https://www.nationalfilmnetwork.com/store/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=644&Title=The%20Legend%20of%20Malerkotla:%20A%20Tale%20from%20the%20Punjab&RefPage=ProductsList.aspx&CategoryID=79 |date=19 October 2007 }} 48 min, DVD, {{ISBN|978-0-8026-0761-4}}.</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Anna B | last = Bigelow | title = Malerkotla: A heritage going to seed | date = 2 December 2000 | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20001202/windows/main1.htm | work = [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | accessdate = 2013-03-24}}</ref>\n\nNawab Sher Mohammed Khan married a lady of [[Guru Gobind Singh|Guru Gobind Singh's]] family who converted to Islam, hence all the succeeding Nawabs descend in the female line from [[Guru Hargobind|Guru Hargobind Singh]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buyers |first1=Cristopher |title=malerk6 |url=https://www.royalark.net/India/malerk6.htm |website=www.royalark.net}}</ref> \n\nFollowing [[Independence Day (India)|Indian independence]] and the signing of the [[instrument of accession]] to the [[Indian Union]] in 1948, Maler Kotla joined the newly established state of [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] (PEPSU) until its merger with [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] in 1956.\n\n===Rulers===\nThe rulers were titled '[[Nawab]]'.
