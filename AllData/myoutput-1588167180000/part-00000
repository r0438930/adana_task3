{"title_page": "Gender neutrality in English", "text_new": "{{short description|Gender neutrality in the English language}}\n[[Gender-neutral language]] is language that minimizes assumptions about the social [[gender]] or biological [[sex]] of people referred to in speech or writing. In contrast to most other [[Indo-European languages]], English does not retain [[grammatical gender]] and most of its nouns, adjectives and pronouns are therefore not gender-specific. In most other Indo-European languages, nouns are grammatically masculine (as in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el humano'') or grammatically feminine (as in [[French language|French]] ''la personne''), or sometimes grammatically neuter (as in [[German language|German]] ''das M\u00e4dchen''), regardless of the actual gender of the referent.\n\nIn addressing [[Grammatical_gender#Natural gender|natural gender]], English speakers use linguistic strategies that may reflect the speaker's attitude to the issue or the perceived [[Acceptance#Social acceptance|social acceptability]] of such strategies.\n\n==Debate==\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that making language less biased is not only laudable but also achievable. \nMany people find non-neutral language to be offensive.<ref>{{cite web |last = Chappell |first = Virginia |title = Tips for Using Inclusive, Gender Neutral Language |work=Marquette.edu |date=2007 |url=http://www.marquette.edu/wac/neutral/NeutralInclusiveLanguage.shtml | accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[There is] a growing awareness that language does not merely reflect the way we think: it also shapes our thinking.

Some translations of the Bible in recent years have used gender-inclusive pronouns, but these translations have not been universally accepted.<ref name=\"bresearcher\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/inclusive.html | title=The Gender-Neutral Language Controversy | publisher=Bible Research | accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Naming practices===\n{{See also|Married and maiden names}}\nSome critics oppose the practice of women changing their names upon marriage, on the grounds that it makes women historically invisible: \"In our society 'only men have real names' in that their names are permanent and they have 'accepted the permanency of their names as one of the rights of being male.'... Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\"<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|p=24}}</ref> Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to the professions they were less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations.<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|pp=164-166}}</ref> However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2011/05/08/the-name-change-dilemma/ |title=The Name Change Dilemma - The Juggle |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 8, 2011 |author=Sue Shelenbarger |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed.\n\nThe practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the [[Reverend]] Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[Lucretia Mott]] quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=3}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\".<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=4}}</ref> The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of [[coverture]], the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"<ref>Henry Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere is a tendency to refer to women by their first name and to men by their surname. People therefore often assume it is a male when hearing a surname. \"Cusack, the actor\" can refer to both John Cusack and Joan Cusack but is now \"owned\" by John Cusack. Referring to women by their surname more will change this expectation pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172515-calling-men-by-their-surname-gives-them-an-unfair-career-boost|title=Calling men by their surname gives them an unfair career boost|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and their resolution==\n\n===Job titles===\n{{Main|Gender-specific job title}}\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''; and ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' instead of ''chairman'' or ''chairwoman''.\n\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including ''man''), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include ''actor'' and ''actress''; ''usher'' and ''usherette''; ''comedian'' and ''comedienne''. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using ''comedian'' rather than ''comedienne'', for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\n\nTerms such as ''male nurse'', ''male model'' or ''female judge'' are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with ''lady'', as in ''lady doctor'': here ''woman'' or ''female'' is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender.\n\n===Generic words for humans===\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words ''man'', ''men'' and ''mankind'' to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\n\nAlthough [[man (word)|the word ''man'']] originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=11-17}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the word ''[[were|wer]]'' referred to males only and ''wif'' to females only, while ''man'' referred to both,<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=134}}</ref> although in practice ''man'' was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males.<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=163}}</ref> In time, ''wer'' fell out of use, and ''man'' came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\"<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref> By the 18th century, ''man'' had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. [[Anthony Trollope]], for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=26}}</ref> and when \"[[Edmund Burke]], writing of the [[French Revolution]], used ''men'' in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\"<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\">{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic. Miller and Swift illustrate with the following quotation:\n<blockquote>\"As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth....\"\n</blockquote>\n\"If ''man'' and ''he'' were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been ''he has difficulties in childbirth''\", Miller and Swift comment.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=15}}</ref> Writing for the [[American Philosophical Association]], Virginia L. Warren follows Janice Moulton and suggests truly generic uses of the word ''man'' would be perceived as \"false, funny, or insulting\", offering as an example the sentence \"Some men are female.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warren |first1=Virginia L. |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Use of Language |url=https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]] |accessdate=29 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302025159/https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |archivedate=2 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurther, some commentators point out that the ostensibly gender-neutral use of ''man'' has in fact sometimes been used to exclude women:<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=492}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] did not make the same distinction in declaring that \"all men are created equal\" and \"governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].\" In a time when women, having no vote, could neither give nor withhold consent, Jefferson had to be using the word ''men'' in its principal sense of ''males'', and it probably never occurred to him that anyone would think otherwise.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\"/>\n</blockquote>\nFor reasons like those above, proponents of gender-neutral language argue that linguistic clarity as well as equality would be better served by having ''man'' and ''men'' refer unambiguously to males, and ''human(s)'' or ''people'' to all persons;<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=493}}</ref> similarly, the word ''mankind'' replaced by ''humankind'' or ''humanity''<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=27}}</ref><!--\n\nIn gender-neutral language, when the description of defined genders has a practical need, the words \"Male and Female\" are often used as opposed to \"Men and Women\" in an attempt to make emphasis on the scientific features of male and female humans as opposed to cultural associations and baggage that may come with the words \"Men and Women\". {{clarification needed|date=January 2013}}-->\n\nThe use of the word ''man'' as a generic word referring to all humans has been declining, particularly among female speakers and writers.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988\"/>\n\n===Pronouns===\n{{See also|Third-person pronoun#English}}\nAnother target of frequent criticism by proponents of gender-neutral language is the use of the masculine [[English personal pronouns|pronoun]] ''he'' (and its derived forms ''him'', ''his'' and ''himself'') to refer to antecedents of [[Grammatical gender#Mixed and indeterminate gender|indeterminate gender]]. Although this usage is traditional, its critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority.<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|pp=147}}. Among writers defending the usage of generic ''he'', the author cites a Thomas Wilson, writing in 1553, and grammarian Joshua Poole (1646).</ref> The use of the generic ''he'' was approved in an Act of Parliament, the [[Interpretation Act 1850]] (the provision continues in the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). However, despite its putative inclusiveness, it has been used to deny women's entry into professions and schools.<ref name=\"UPenn\">{{cite web |author=Carolyn Jacobsen |title=Some Notes on Gender-Neutral Language |work=english.upenn.edu |url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702092056/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archivedate=2 July 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProposed alternatives to the generic ''he'' include ''he or she'' (or ''she or he''), ''s/he'', or the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']]. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. Some feel the use of singular ''they'' to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, ''they'', ''their'' and ''them'' have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the [[Middle Ages]], including by a number of prominent authors, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Churchyard |first=Henry |title=Jane Austen and other famous authors violate what everyone learned in their English class |url=http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html | accessdate=14 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430053036/http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html |archivedate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Linguist [[Steven Pinker]] goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \"they\" are themselves incorrect:\n<blockquote>The logical point that you, [[Holden Caulfield]], and everyone but the language mavens intuitively grasp is that ''everyone'' and ''they'' are not an \"antecedent\" and a \"pronoun\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force them to agree in number. They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to. The ''their'' there does not, in fact, have plural number, because it refers neither to one thing nor to many things; it does not refer at all.<ref>{{harvp|Pinker |2000}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSome [[style guide]]s {{which|date=April 2020}} accept singular ''they'' as grammatically correct,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Guide to English Usage |last=Peters |first=Pam |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-62181-6 |page= |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgeguideto00pete_0 |ref= }}</ref> while others reject it.

Several are listed below:\n\n* The \"[http://www.apastyle.org/pubmanual.html Publication Manual]\" of the American Psychological Association has an oft-cited section on \"Guidelines to Reduce Bias in Language\". {{ISBN|1-55798-791-2}}\n* [http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/texts/nonsexist.html American Philosophical Association]\u2014published 1986\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/page/0,5817,184837,00.html The Guardian]\u2014see section \"gender issues\"\n* [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/language.aspx Avoiding Heterosexual Bias in Language], published by the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns, [[American Psychological Association]].\n\nIn addition, gender-neutral language has gained support from some major textbook publishers, and from professional and academic groups such as the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[Associated Press]]. [[Newspaper]]s such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' use gender-neutral language. Many law journals, psychology journals, and literature journals will only print articles or papers that use gender-inclusive language.<ref name=\"UPenn\" />\n\nEmployee policy manuals sometimes include strongly worded statements prescribing avoidance of language that potentially could be considered discriminatory.

Essentially this practice means that women's family names do not count and that there is one more device for making women invisible.\"<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|p=24}}</ref> Up until the 1970s, as women were granted greater access to the professions they were less likely to change their names, either professionally or legally; names were seen as tied to reputations and women were less likely to change their names when they had higher reputations.<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|pp=164-166}}</ref> However, that trend was reversed starting in the 1970s; since that time, increasingly more women have been taking their husband's surname upon marriage, especially among well-educated women in high-earning occupations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/juggle/2011/05/08/the-name-change-dilemma/ |title=The Name Change Dilemma - The Juggle |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=May 8, 2011 |author=Sue Shelenbarger |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> Increasingly, studies have shown women's decisions on the issue are guided by factors other than political or religious ideas about women's rights or marital roles, as often believed.\n\nThe practice of referring to married women by their husband's first and last names, which only died out in the late 20th century, has been criticized since the 19th century. When the [[Reverend]] Samuel May \"moved that Mrs Stephen Smith be placed on a Committee\" of the [[National Women's Rights Convention]] in [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]], [[Lucretia Mott]] quickly replied: \"Woman's Rights' women do not like to be called by their husbands' names, but by their own\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=3}}</ref> [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] refused to be addressed as \"Mrs Henry B. Stanton\".<ref>{{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=4}}</ref> The practice was developed in the mid-18th century and was tied to the idea of [[coverture]], the idea that \"By marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law; that is, the very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the marriage.\"<ref>Henry Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'', quoted in {{harvp|Stannard|1977|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThere is a tendency to refer to women by their first name and to men by their surname. People therefore often assume it is a male when hearing a surname. \"Cusack, the actor\" can refer to both John Cusack and Joan Cusack but is now \"owned\" by John Cusack. Referring to women by their surname more will change this expectation pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2172515-calling-men-by-their-surname-gives-them-an-unfair-career-boost|title=Calling men by their surname gives them an unfair career boost|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Problems and their resolution==\n\n===Job titles===\n{{Main|Gender-specific job title}}\nGender-neutral job titles do not specify the gender of the person referred to, particularly when the gender is not in fact known, or is not yet specified (as in job advertisements). Examples include ''firefighter'' instead of ''fireman''; ''flight attendant'' instead of ''steward'' or ''stewardess''; ''bartender'' instead of ''barman'' or ''barmaid''; and ''chairperson'' or ''chair'' instead of ''chairman'' or ''chairwoman''.\n\nThere are also cases where a distinct female form exists, but the basic (or \"male\") form does not intrinsically indicate a male (such as by including ''man''), and can equally well be applied to any member of the profession, whether male or female or of unspecified sex. Examples include ''actor'' and ''actress''; ''usher'' and ''usherette''; ''comedian'' and ''comedienne''. In such cases, proponents of gender-neutral language generally advocate the non-use of the distinct female form (always using ''comedian'' rather than ''comedienne'', for example, even if the referent is known to be a woman).\n\nTerms such as ''male nurse'', ''male model'' or ''female judge'' are sometimes used in cases where the gender is irrelevant or already understood (as in \"my brother is a male nurse\"). Many advisors on non-sexist usage discourage such phrasing, as it implies that someone of that gender is an inferior or atypical member of the profession. Another discouraged form is the prefixing of an ordinary job title with ''lady'', as in ''lady doctor'': here ''woman'' or ''female'' is preferred if it is necessary to specify the gender.\n\n===Generic words for humans===\nAnother issue for gender-neutral language concerns the use of the words ''man'', ''men'' and ''mankind'' to refer to a person or people of unspecified sex or to persons of both sexes.\n\nAlthough [[man (word)|the word ''man'']] originally referred to both males and females, some feel that it no longer does so unambiguously.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=11-17}}</ref> In [[Old English]], the word ''[[were|wer]]'' referred to males only and ''wif'' to females only, while ''man'' referred to both,<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=134}}</ref> although in practice ''man'' was sometimes also used in Old English to refer only to males.<ref>{{harvp|Curzan|2003|p=163}}</ref> In time, ''wer'' fell out of use, and ''man'' came to refer sometimes to both sexes and sometimes to males only; \"[a]s long as most generalizations about men were made by men about men, the ambiguity nestling in this dual usage was either not noticed or thought not to matter.\"<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref> By the 18th century, ''man'' had come to refer primarily to males; some writers who wished to use the term in the older sense deemed it necessary to spell out their meaning. [[Anthony Trollope]], for example, writes of \"the infinite simplicity and silliness of mankind and womankind\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=26}}</ref> and when \"[[Edmund Burke]], writing of the [[French Revolution]], used ''men'' in the old, inclusive way, he took pains to spell out his meaning: 'Such a deplorable havoc is made in the minds of men (both sexes) in France....'\"<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\">{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=12}}</ref>\n\nProponents of gender-neutral language argue that seemingly generic uses of the word \"man\" are often not in fact generic. Miller and Swift illustrate with the following quotation:\n<blockquote>\"As for man, he is no different from the rest. His back aches, he ruptures easily, his women have difficulties in childbirth....\"\n</blockquote>\n\"If ''man'' and ''he'' were truly generic, the parallel phrase would have been ''he has difficulties in childbirth''\", Miller and Swift comment.<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|p=15}}</ref> Writing for the [[American Philosophical Association]], Virginia L. Warren follows Janice Moulton and suggests truly generic uses of the word ''man'' would be perceived as \"false, funny, or insulting\", offering as an example the sentence \"Some men are female.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Warren |first1=Virginia L. |title=Guidelines for Non-Sexist Use of Language |url=https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |publisher=[[American Philosophical Association]] |accessdate=29 March 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302025159/https://www.apaonline.org/page/nonsexist |archivedate=2 March 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nFurther, some commentators point out that the ostensibly gender-neutral use of ''man'' has in fact sometimes been used to exclude women:<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=492}}</ref>\n<blockquote>\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] did not make the same distinction in declaring that \"all men are created equal\" and \"governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the [[consent of the governed]].\" In a time when women, having no vote, could neither give nor withhold consent, Jefferson had to be using the word ''men'' in its principal sense of ''males'', and it probably never occurred to him that anyone would think otherwise.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988 12\"/>\n</blockquote>\nFor reasons like those above, proponents of gender-neutral language argue that linguistic clarity as well as equality would be better served by having ''man'' and ''men'' refer unambiguously to males, and ''human(s)'' or ''people'' to all persons;<ref>{{harvp|Freeman|1979|p=493}}</ref> similarly, the word ''mankind'' replaced by ''humankind'' or ''humanity''<ref>{{harvp|Miller|Swift|1988|pp=27}}</ref><!--\n\nIn gender-neutral language, when the description of defined genders has a practical need, the words \"Male and Female\" are often used as opposed to \"Men and Women\" in an attempt to make emphasis on the scientific features of male and female humans as opposed to cultural associations and baggage that may come with the words \"Men and Women\". {{clarification needed|date=January 2013}}-->\n\nThe use of the word ''man'' as a generic word referring to all humans has been declining, particularly among female speakers and writers.<ref name=\"Miller and Swift 1988\"/>\n\n===Pronouns===\n{{See also|Third-person pronoun#English}}\nAnother target of frequent criticism by proponents of gender-neutral language is the use of the masculine [[English personal pronouns|pronoun]] ''he'' (and its derived forms ''him'', ''his'' and ''himself'') to refer to antecedents of [[Grammatical gender#Mixed and indeterminate gender|indeterminate gender]]. Although this usage is traditional, its critics argue that it was invented and propagated by males, whose explicit goal was the linguistic representation of male superiority.<ref>{{harvp|Spender|1980|pp=147}}. Among writers defending the usage of generic ''he'', the author cites a Thomas Wilson, writing in 1553, and grammarian Joshua Poole (1646).</ref> The use of the generic ''he'' was approved in an Act of Parliament, the [[Interpretation Act 1850]] (the provision continues in the [[Interpretation Act 1978]], although this states equally that the feminine includes the masculine). However, despite its putative inclusiveness, it has been used to deny women's entry into professions and schools.<ref name=\"UPenn\">{{cite web |author=Carolyn Jacobsen |title=Some Notes on Gender-Neutral Language |work=english.upenn.edu |url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702092056/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~cjacobso/gender.html |archivedate=2 July 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nProposed alternatives to the generic ''he'' include ''he or she'' (or ''she or he''), ''s/he'', or the use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']]. Each of these alternatives has met with objections. Some feel the use of singular ''they'' to be a grammatical error, but according to most references, ''they'', ''their'' and ''them'' have long been grammatically acceptable as gender-neutral singular pronouns in English, having been used in the singular continuously since the [[Middle Ages]], including by a number of prominent authors, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Jane Austen]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Churchyard |first=Henry |title=Jane Austen and other famous authors violate what everyone learned in their English class |url=http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html | accessdate=14 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430053036/http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html |archivedate=2009-04-30}}</ref> Linguist [[Steven Pinker]] goes further and argues that traditional grammar proscriptions regarding the use of singular \"they\" are themselves incorrect:\n<blockquote>The logical point that you, [[Holden Caulfield]], and everyone but the language mavens intuitively grasp is that ''everyone'' and ''they'' are not an \"antecedent\" and a \"pronoun\" referring to the same person in the world, which would force them to agree in number. They are a \"quantifier\" and a \"bound variable\", a different logical relationship. Everyone returned to their seats means \"For all X, X returned to X's seat.\" The \"X\" does not refer to any particular person or group of people; it is simply a placeholder that keeps track of the roles that players play across different relationships. In this case, the X that comes back to a seat is the same X that owns the seat that X comes back to.

Several are listed below:\n\n* The \"[http://www.apastyle.org/pubmanual.html Publication Manual]\" of the American Psychological Association has an oft-cited section on \"Guidelines to Reduce Bias in Language\". {{ISBN|1-55798-791-2}}\n* [http://www.apa.udel.edu/apa/publications/texts/nonsexist.html American Philosophical Association]\u2014published 1986\n* [https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/page/0,5817,184837,00.html The Guardian]\u2014see section \"gender issues\"\n* [http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/language.aspx Avoiding Heterosexual Bias in Language], published by the Committee on Lesbian and Gay Concerns, [[American Psychological Association]].\n\nIn addition, gender-neutral language has gained support from some major textbook publishers, and from professional and academic groups such as the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[Associated Press]]. [[Newspaper]]s such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' use gender-neutral language. Many law journals, psychology journals, and literature journals will only print articles or papers that use gender-inclusive language.<ref name=\"UPenn\" />\n\nEmployee policy manuals sometimes include strongly worded statements prescribing avoidance of language that potentially could be considered discriminatory.
