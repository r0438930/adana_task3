Before the frustrated backman knew it, Hudson had taken a nice comfortable mark on his chest for a simple goal.\n\n== VFL career ==\nIn a Victorian Football League career beginning with the Hawthorn Football Club in 1967, he kicked 727 goals at an average of 5.64 a game.\n\nHudson won the [[Coleman Medal]] for the League's leading goal kicker four times in his career: in 1968 (125 goals); 1970 (146); 1971 (150); and 1977 (110). He also became the first player to kick 100 goals in a VFL season five times (the other year he exceeded 100 goals being 1969 when he kicked 120, but did not win the Coleman).\n\nIn 1971 he equalled [[Bob Pratt]]'s [[List of VFL/AFL records|record]] of 150 goals in a season after kicking three goals in Hawthorn's winning [[1971 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]] side. Hudson kicked into the man-on-the-mark Barry Lawrence ([[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]]) in one of his attempts to break the record during the grand final.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/afls-150-greatest-moments-no73/story-e6frf9lx-1111116502629 |title=AFL's 150 greatest moments \u2013 No.73 |date=1 June 2008 |publisher=Sunday Herald Sun |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the first round of 1972 he seriously injured his knee just before half time. He had already kicked 8 goals and had just taken a mark within distance when he fell awkwardly. It was thought that his career had finished.<ref name=encyc />\n\nOn 25 August 1973 he returned from [[Tasmania]] to kick eight goals against Collingwood at [[VFL Park]]. After playing Rounds 1 and 2 in 1974, he again injured his knee and returned to Tasmania.  After hurting his knee playing netball later that year he decided to have knee surgery in the summer. He did not play another VFL game until lured back for the 1977 season when he ended up kicking 110 goals for the season.<ref name=\"age2\">{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zgMQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UJIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5133,7252632&dq=peter-hudson+hawthorn&hl=en |title=Hawks \u2013 class of '76 |last=Beames |first=Percy |date=28 September 1976 |work=The Age |publisher=Google News Archive |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"heraldsun2\">{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/liberty-bell-has-a-hollow-ring/story-e6frf9lf-1111115906644 |title=Liberty Bell has a hollow ring |last=Ralph |first=Jon |date=28 March 2008 |publisher=Herald Sun |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref>\n\n==VFL statistics==\n:<ref>[http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/P/Peter_Hudson.html Peter Hudson's player profile at AFL Tables]</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#CFECEC; width:1em\"|\n| Led the league for the season only*\n|-\n| style=\"background:#b7e718; width:1em\"|\n| Led the league after finals only*\n|-\n| style=\"background:#DD6E81; width:1em\"|\n| Led the league after season and finals*\n|}\n{{AFL player statistics start}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1967 VFL season|1967]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | {{AFL Haw}}\n| 26 || 17 || 57 || bgcolor=\"b7e718\" | '''55''' || 179 || 29 || 208 || 90 || {{n/a}} || 3.4 || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''3.2''' || 10.5 || 1.7 || 12.2 || 5.3 || {{n/a}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1968 VFL season|1968]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | {{AFL Haw}}\n| 26 || 19 || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''125''' || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''62''' || 274 || 31 || 305 || 113 || {{n/a}} || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''6.6''' || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''3.3''' || 14.4 || 1.6 || 16.1 || 5.9 || {{n/a}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1969 VFL season|1969]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | {{AFL Haw}}\n| 26 || 19 || 120 || 40 || 217 || 16 || 233 || 111 || {{n/a}} || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''6.3''' || 2.1 || 11.4 || 0.8 || 12.3 || 5.8 || {{n/a}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1970 VFL season|1970]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | {{AFL Haw}}\n| 26 || 22 || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''146''' || 44 || 282 || 19 || 301 || 140 || {{n/a}} || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''6.6''' || 2.0 || 12.8 || 0.9 || 13.7 || 6.4 || {{n/a}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[1971 VFL season|1971]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]\n| 26 || 24 || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''150''' || 72 || 346 || 41 || 387 || 180 || {{n/a}} || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''6.3''' || 3.0 || 14.4 || 1.7 || 16.1 || 7.5 || {{n/a}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1972 VFL season|1972]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | {{AFL Haw}}\n| 26 || 1 || 8 || 1 || 12 || 1 || 13 || 9 || {{n/a}} || 8.0 || 1.0 || 12.0 || 1.0 || 13.0 || 9.0 || {{n/a}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1973 VFL season|1973]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | {{AFL Haw}}\n| 26 || 1 || 8 || 3 || 15 || 0 || 15 || 10 || {{n/a}} || 8.0 || 3.0 || 15.0 || 0.0 || 15.0 || 10.0 || {{n/a}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1974 VFL season|1974]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | {{AFL Haw}}\n| 26 || 2 || 3 || 3 || 10 || 7 || 17 || 6 || {{n/a}} || 1.5 || 1.5 || 5.0 || 3.5 || 8.5 || 3.0 || {{n/a}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1977 VFL season|1977]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" | {{AFL Haw}}\n| 1 || 24 || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''110''' || 50 || 243 || 32 || 275 || 123 || {{n/a}} || bgcolor=\"DD6E81\" | '''4.6''' || 2.3 || 10.1 || 1.3 || 11.5 || 5.1 || {{n/a}}\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3 | Career\n! 129\n! 727\n! 330\n! 1578\n! 176\n! 1754\n! 782\n! {{n/a}}\n! 5.6\n! 2.6\n! 12.2\n! 1.4\n! 13.6\n! 6.1\n! {{n/a}}\n|}\n\n== Post VFL ==\nHudson coached and played for Glenorchy Football Club in the TFL in 1975 and 1976, taking them to a premiership in his first year.
