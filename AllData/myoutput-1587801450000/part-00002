En route, d'Orves changed his objectif from [[Trincomalee]] to [[Madras]].{{sfnp|Cunat|1852|p=97}}<ref group=Note>Present-day [[Chennai]]</ref> On 19 January, ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' detected a strange sail, and d'Orves detached ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Art\u00e9sien'' to investigate. Suffren closed in, making signals according to tables captured at Porto Praya on the East Indiaman [[Hinchinbrooke (1780 ship)|''Hinchinbrooke'']], until the ship made signals that he was unable to answer. A chase ensued, and with the night Suffren abandonned the pursuit to rejoin the fleet. On 21, the fleet encountered the same ship again, and again detached ''H\u00e9ros'', ''Art\u00e9sien'' and ''Vengeur'', but this time with other ships deploying as to ensure communication between the pursuers and the main body of the fleet, allowing Suffren to press on his chase. Suffren caught up with his quarry on 22 around noon and forced her to surrender. She was the 50-gun [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|HMS ''Hannibal'']], under Captain Christy, which the French pressed into their service as ''Petit Annibal''.{{sfnp|Cunat|1852|p=99}}\n\n==== Battle of Sadras ====\n{{Main|Battle of Sadras}}\nIn the following days, d'Orves' failing health deteriorated to the point where he was not fit for duty, and he delegated command to Suffren.<ref name=cunat100>Cunat, p.100</ref> The French intended to surprise the British ships anchored in the roads of Madras. The fleet arrived North of Madras on 5 February 1782, and its light units started praying on coastal merchantmen and capturing cargo of rice.<ref name=cunat101>Cunat, p.101</ref> However, the [[monsoon]] caused strong winds from the South which trapped the French North of Madras, while at the same time favouring the return of Hughes' squadron from Ceylon to Madras.<ref name=cunat102>Cunat, p.102</ref> Upon Hughes' arrival, [[George Macartney, 1st Earl Macartney|Lord Macartney]] warned him of the presence of the French squadron, and Hughes anchored his ships under the protection of [[Fort St. George, India|Fort St. George]] and [[George Town, Chennai|Black Town]]. On 9 February 1782, Hughes received reinforcements with the arrival of a squadron comprising the 64-gun [[HMS Monmouth (1772)|HMS ''Monmouth'']], the [[74-gun]] [[HMS Hero (1759)|''Hero'']], the 50-gun [[HMS Isis (1774)|''Isis'']] and the armed transport ''Manilla'', under [[James Alms]]. \n\nD'Orves died the same day at 1600.

In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports. Suffren rushed with his warships to protect the convoy, and Hughes ordered his ships to regroup and form a [[line of battle]].<ref name=cunat109>Cunat, p.109</ref> In the morning of 17 February, the fleets were about 6 km apart{{refn|one [[League (unit)|League]] and a half<ref name=cunat109 />|group=Note}}, the British forming a line and had captured ''Lawriston'', while the French were scattered due to an error in interpreting night signals.

After consulting [[Hyder Ali]], he decided not to land his troops in Pondich\u00e9ry, and rather to head for [[Parangipettai|Porto Nove]], where he arrived on 23 February. <ref name=hennequin299>Hennequin, p.299</ref> Hyder Ali despatched [[Andr\u00e9 Piveron de Morlat]], the French ambassador, to act as an intermediary between Suffren and himself, along with two of his officiers. Suffren negotiated an agreement that French troops would retain their own command; that a 4,000-man cavalry and 6,000-man infantry force would reinforce them; and that they be paid 24 [[Lakh]] rupee a year.<ref name=hennequin302>Hennequin, p.302</ref> Suffren landed his troops at Porto Nove, and departed on 23 March to search for the British fleet.\n\nOn 10 April, the two fleet came into view, and they spent two days in manoeuvers, trying to gain an advantage on the other.<ref name=hennequin302 /> In the morning, ''Fine'' captured a British courier and managed to retrieve the despatches that her captain had thrown overboard, revealing British plans to expel the Dutch from Ceylon.<ref name=cunat127>Cunat, p. 127</ref>   On 12, the [[Battle of Providien]] broke out, leaving both squadrons damaged.

The French troops reembarked on their transports, when ''Bellone'', which had been left to patrol, came with news that Hughes' squadron was at Nagapattinam. Suffren ordered an immediate departure and found the British ships anchored when he arrived on 6 July 1782.<ref name=Hennequin303>Hennequin, p.303</ref> Before the battle, Suffren despatched [[French frigate Pourvoyeuse (1772)|''Pourvoyeuse'']] to [[Malacca]], [[HMS Resolution (1771)|''R\u00e9solution'']] to [[Manila]], and [[Fortitude (1780 EIC ship)|''Fortitude'']] and [[Yarmouth (1782 ship)|''Yarmouth'']] to Isle de France, to purchase spare [[Spar (sailing)|spars]], food and ammunition to resupply his fleet.

The next day, a 500-man cavalry troop under General Ghulam Ali Khan escorted Suffren, six of his captains and several officers to the encampment of Hyder Ali's army for a meeting with him.<ref name=Hennequin306 /> Suffren announced that Bussy-Castelnau had arrived to Isle de France with 6 ships of the line, 2 frigates and transports carrying 5,000 soldiers. He also informed Hyder Ali that a French frigate had intercepted a British schooner carrying Colonal Horn to Nagapattinam. Hyder Ali responded with luxurious gifts to Suffren and his officers, or with gifts represented by their equivalent value in rupees. He then ajourned the meeting until the next day.<ref name=Hennequin308>Hennequin, p.308</ref>{{refn|Suffren received 10,000 rupees symbolising the gift of an elephant, which would have been inconvenient on ''H\u00e9ros''; his officers received 1,000 symbolising horses, for the same reason.<ref name=Hennequin308 />|group=Note}}\n\nOn 27, Hyder Ali invited Suffren and Piveron to a private dinner, with European-style seating in deference to his guests.<ref name=Hennequin309>Hennequin, p.309</ref>{{refn|The previous day, Suffren, who was overweight, had suffered from the Indian-style seating and Hyder Ali had graciously bent the etiquette to accomodate him.<ref name=Hennequin308 />|group=Note}} Suffren reported on the battles against Hughes, and they reviewed plans of operations against the British. Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived. Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the [[Battle of Trincomalee]].<ref name=Hennequin314>Hennequin, p.314</ref> The French line fought desorganised, especially after ''Vengeur'' caught fire and have to distance herself from other ships. The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n=== Post-War ===\nWith the war over, both the French fleet under Suffren and the British fleet under Hughes returned to Europe. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. [[HMS Exeter (1763)|HMS ''Exeter'']] ran aground,<ref name=cunat338>Cunat, p.338</ref> and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance.<ref name=Hennequin329>Hennequin, p.329</ref>\n\nSuffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister [[Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix|Castrie]] and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. <ref name=Hennequin329 /> A fourth position of [[Vice-Admiral]] was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death.<ref name=Hennequin330>Hennequin, p.330</ref>\n\nIn October 1787, with the implementation of the [[Eden Agreement]], tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louix XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788.<ref name=Hennequin331>Hennequin, p.331</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Assessment ===\nSuffren was generally recognised as an able commander.

In the evening, [[French frigate Fine (1779)|''Fine'']], under Perrier de Salvert, came in view of Madras harbour and Hughes' squadron. Seeing Hugues anchored in a very strong defensive position, Suffren decided to sail off the coast, <ref name=cunat105>Cunat, p.105</ref> but to his surprise, Hugues left the safety of the forts and gave chase.<ref name=cunat106>Cunat, p.106</ref> Suffren deployed a frigate screen to warn his squadron of Hugues' moves, but during the night ''Pourvoyeuse'' drifted away from the fleet due to a navigation error, while  ''Fine'' lost sight of the British ships, and both thus failed to keep Suffren appraised of Hughes's position.<ref name=cunat108>Cunat, p.108</ref> In the morning, signals from ''Fine'' informed Suffren that HMS ''Montmouth'', ''Hero'', ''Isis'', ''Aigle'' and ''Burford'' where approaching the French transports.

The French troops reembarked on their transports, when ''Bellone'', which had been left to patrol, came with news that Hughes' squadron was at Nagapattinam. Suffren ordered an immediate departure and found the British ships anchored when he arrived on 6 July 1782.<ref name=Hennequin303>Hennequin, p.303</ref> Before the battle, Suffren despatched [[French frigate Pourvoyeuse (1772)|''Pourvoyeuse'']] to [[Malacca]], [[HMS Resolution (1771)|''R\u00e9solution'']] to [[Manila]], and [[Fortitude (1780 EIC ship)|''Fortitude'']] and [[Yarmouth (1782 ship)|''Yarmouth'']] to Isle de France, to purchase spare [[Spar (sailing)|spars]], food and ammunition to resupply his fleet.

Hyder Ali was especially concerned by British advance on the [[Malabar Coast]] and the risk that the [[Maratha Empire]] would switch sides, ally with the British and start a war with Mysore.{{refn|The [[Maratha\u2013Mysore War]] was to start three years later.|group=Note}}\n\nMeanwhile, the French squadron was effecting repairs, especially to its rigging, and ''Pourvoyeuse'' sailed to [[Malacca]] to pick up [[Spar (sailing)|spars]].<ref name=Hennequin311>Hennequin, p.311</ref> In early August, Suffren learnt that the British fleet had departed Nagapattinam and was embarking troops in Madras, bound for an unknown destination. Suffren departed at once for [[Tharangambadi]] in the hope of undercovering the British plans. Failing to do so, he sailed to Batticaloa, where he arrived on 8 August to find ''Consolante'', arrived from Isle de France three days earlier. From ''Consolante'', Suffren learnt that two French ships of the line escorting 8 transports were anchored at [[Galle]], waiting to join up with him. Suffren had sent a light ship to Trincomalee, which returned announcing that the British ship were not there. Suffren then decided to lay siege to Trincomalee.<ref name=Hennequin311 />\n\nOn 21 August, the two ships of the convoy arrived. Suffren had ammunition from the convoy distributed among his warships to replenish their magazines, and explained his intentions to the captains. <ref name=Hennequin311 /> The same day, the cutter ''L\u00e9zard'' arrived from France, bringing despatches. The letter notably carried official approval of Suffren's conduct at the Battle of Porto Praya, and granted the requests he had made to appoint his officers. Furthermore, a letter from [[Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc]], [[List of Grand Masters of the Knights Hospitaller|Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller]], informed him that he was promoted to Bailiff of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]].<ref name=Hennequin312>Hennequin, p.312</ref>\n\nOn 25 August, the fleet set sail and formed a battle line, soon arriving in view of the forts of Trincomalee. 2,000 men quickly landed, with siege artillery, ammunition and three days worth of rations. By 29, the French had completed their siege battery emplacements, and they started bombarding the fort. On 30, at 0900, Suffren sent a message to [[Fort Ostenburg]] to negotiate its capitulation. The British surrendered the fort in exchange for its 1,000-man garrison to be sent to Madras.<ref name=Hennequin312 />\n\nOn 3 September, the British fleet arrived. Suffren reembarked his troops and moved to intercept, leading to the [[Battle of Trincomalee]].<ref name=Hennequin314>Hennequin, p.314</ref> The French line fought desorganised, especially after ''Vengeur'' caught fire and have to distance herself from other ships. The flag of ''H\u00e9ros'' was shot away by British fire and Suffren had new French ensigns hoisted to continue the fight. After one hour and a half, night fell and the battle ended. Suffren was furious at the conduct of his captains, whom he accused of abandonning him.<ref name=Hennequin316>Hennequin, p.316</ref> The next day, the British fleet had disappeared, and Suffren returned to Trincomalee, where he arrived in the evening of 7 September 1782.<ref name=Hennequin317>Hennequin, p.317</ref> \n\n==== Battle of Cuddalore ====\n{{Main|Battle of Cuddalore (1783)}}\nWhen the French squadron arrived at Trincomalee in the evening of 7 September 1782 after the Battle of Trincomalee, its ships were seriously damaged. ''H\u00e9ros'', in particular, was leaking and had lost her foremast and mainmast. The ships anchored to effect repairs, which the crew completed in two weeks. Meanwhile, Suffren received news that Hyder Ali had left Cuddalore with his army to fight in the North, leaving the city vulnerable to a British attack fom Madras. As Cuddalore was a crucial supply depot, it was imperative for Suffren to protect it. Suffren departed Trincomalee on 1 October to reinforce Cuddalore, <ref name=Hennequin317 /> arriving on 4 October. The expected British attack did not happen, and on 12 October, the change in monsoon forced both fleets to shelter in harbour. Hughes anchored at Bombay, <ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref> while Suffren chose to sail to [[Aceh]]. By choosing Aceh, Suffren avoided both being driven away from the battlefield as he would have by chosing Isle de France, and the climate of Trincomalee which he feared would be detrimental to his crew.<ref name=Hennequin318>Hennequin, p.318</ref>\n\nThe French squadron left Cuddalore on 15 October 1782 and arrived at Aceh on 1 November. ''Pourvoyeuse'' and ''Bellone'' arrived shortly after with spare parts, and the fleet spent the following weeks tending to the sick and effecting repairs.<ref name=Hennequin319>Hennequin, p.319</ref> After a while, a corvette arrived from Isle de France, bringing news that a 3-ship squadron under [[Antoine de Thomassin de Peynier]] was about to arrive, escorting a convoy ferrying troops and ammunitions, as well as Bussy-Castelnau.<ref name=Hennequin320>Hennequin, p.320</ref>\n\nSuffren's fleet set sail on 20 December to return to Coromandel. On the way, it raided the British colony of [[Ganjam]], destroying a number of merchantmen. On 12 january 1783, the frigate [[HMS Coventry (1757)|HMS ''Coventry'']], unaware of the presence of the French fleet and mistaking its ships for East Indiamen, approached and had to surrender. From the prisoners, Suffren learnt of  Hyder Ali's death. The fleet continued to Cuddalore, arriving there on 1 February.<ref name=Hennequin320 /> Peynier's squadron of 3 ships and 1 frigate arrived shortly afterwards with 30 transports, survivors of a much larger convoy that had lost a number of ships to the elements and to the British. <ref name=Hennequin321>Hennequin, p.321</ref>\n\nWith the return of favourable weather, Suffren expected and feared Hughes' attack, as his own ships were either damaged after long cruises, or had at best only received field repair at Aceh. He therefore quickly landed his troops at Cuddalore and set sail for Trincomalee. Unfavourable winds made progression difficult and as Suffren's squadron entered the bay, ''Fine'' reported 17 sails closing in.<ref name=Hennequin321 /> The French squadron retreated into the safety of Trincomalee and started repairing. <ref name=Hennequin322>Hennequin, p.322</ref>\n\nOn 24 May, Hughes' squadron passed off Trincomalee. A few days later, a ship brought letters from Bussy-Castelnau announcing that Cuddalore was besieged and blockaded.<ref name=Hennequin322 /> Suffren departed Trincomalee on 11 June 1783 and passed off Tharangambadi on 16, when the frigate screen signaled 18 ships in view. Suffren transfered onto the frigate [[French frigate Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (1781)|''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'']] to personnally reconnoitre the situation. The two fleets approached each other in the evening manoeuvered without engaging. In the morning, the French found themselves at the entrance of Cuddalore Bay, while the British squadron was further off at sea.<ref name=Hennequin323>Hennequin, p.323</ref> Suffren anchored his ships and spent the night reinforcing his crew with 1,200 soldiers from ashore.<ref name=Hennequin324>Hennequin, p.324</ref> On 18 June, Suffren set sail and the two squadrons chased each other for two days, trying to gain an advantage. Finally, on 20, the two fleets came in contact and engaged, starting the [[Battle of Cuddalore (1783)|Battle of Cuddalore]] at 1530. <ref name=Hennequin324 /> \n\nOn 25, Hughes retreated to Madras,<ref name=Hennequin326>Hennequin, p.326</ref> and on 29, a British frigate came as a cartel,<ref name=Hennequin327>Hennequin, p.327</ref> bringing news of the preliminary agreements to the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that had been signed on 9 February 1783, and Hughes' offer of a cease-fire. Suffren accepted. On 25 July, the frigate [[French frigate Surveillante (1778)|''Surveillante'']] arrived from Europe with news of the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Peace of Paris]] and orders to Suffren to return to France, leaving 5 ships under Peynier in the Indian Ocean.<ref name=Hennequin328>Hennequin, p.328</ref>\n\n=== Post-War ===\nWith the war over, both the French fleet under Suffren and the British fleet under Hughes returned to Europe. On his way, Suffren called the Cape of Good Hope, and had stayed there for a few days when Hughes' squadron arrived, with unfavourable winds. [[HMS Exeter (1763)|HMS ''Exeter'']] ran aground,<ref name=cunat338>Cunat, p.338</ref> and both the British and French ships launched their boats to provide assistance.<ref name=Hennequin329>Hennequin, p.329</ref>\n\nSuffren arrived at Toulon on 26 March 1784. Summoned to Versailles, he was received by Navy Minister [[Charles Eug\u00e8ne Gabriel de La Croix|Castrie]] and by Louis XVI, and much celebrated. <ref name=Hennequin329 /> A fourth position of [[Vice-Admiral]] was created especially for Suffren, the decree stipulating that it would be suppressed after his death.<ref name=Hennequin330>Hennequin, p.330</ref>\n\nIn October 1787, with the implementation of the [[Eden Agreement]], tensions again flared up between France and England, and it was feared that a new conflict was looming. As a precaution, Louix XVI ordered the Brest squadron be readied, and he appointed Suffren to command it, leaving him the choice of his captains. As he prepared for the journey to Brest, Suffren's health suddenly declined. He died in Paris on 8 December 1788.<ref name=Hennequin331>Hennequin, p.331</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n=== Assessment ===\nSuffren was generally recognised as an able commander. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] called him \"perhaps the ablest sea-commander that France ever produced'.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hughes, Sir Edward |volume=13 |page=660}}</ref> In ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'', [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Mahan]] writes:\n\n{{quote|The military situation... demanded first the disabling of the hostile fleet, next the capture of certain strategic ports. That this diagnosis was correct is as certain as that it reversed the common French maxims, which would have put the port first and the fleet second as objectives.<ref>Mahan, A.T., ''The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660\u20131783, p. 433 {{ISBN|0-486-25509-3}}</ref>}}\n\n[[R\u00e9mi Monaque]] offers a more nuanced assessment, finding Suffren an aggressive and innovative commander comparable to Ruyter and Nelson,<ref name=Monaque-pon-91>Monaque, ''A Precursor of Nelson'', p.91</ref> but also one whose lack of didactic qualities and social graces made misunderstood and disliked by his captains, and thus failed to develop its full potential. <ref name=Monaque-pon-90>Monaque, ''A Precursor of Nelson'', p.90</ref>\n\n=== Monuments and memorials ===\n{{see also|French ship Suffren}}\n[[French ship Suffren|Eight ships]] of the French Navy have been named ''Suffren'' in honour of Suffren de Saint Tropez. \n\nA number of streets and avenues through France are named in Suffren's honour. In Paris, the {{ill|Avenue de Suffren|fr}} runs alongside the [[Champ de Mars]].\n\n{{Gallery\n |title=Depictions of Suffren\n |align=center\n |BailliDeSuffrenByBatoni.jpg|Suffren, by [[Pompeo Batoni]].\n |Saint-Tropez Suffren (1)-white.jpg|Suffren's statue in [[Saint Tropez]].\n |Lestevenon-buys-1784.jpg|The envoys [[Mattheus Lestevenon]] and [[Gerard Brantsen]] presenting vice-admiral Pierre Andr\u00e9 Bailly de Suffren de Saint Tropez with a golden sword in 1784\n |Suffren mg 7244.jpg|Bust of Suffren by [[Isidore-Hippolyte Brion|Brion]], on display at [[Paris naval museum]].\n}}\n\n== Sources and references ==\n''' Notes'''\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n'''References'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n''' Bibliography'''\n* {{EB1911|wstitle=Suffren Saint Tropez, Pierre Andr\u00e9 de|volume=26}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Cunat |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cunat|title=Histoire du Bailli de Suffren |date=1852 |publisher=A.
