During [[World War II]], he served in both the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] and [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theaters of Operations]], one of a few senior American commanders to do so.<ref>{{cite video| title= Video: Dragon's Teeth| url= https://archive.org/details/gov.dod.dimoc.30141| publisher= [[U.S. Army Pictorial Service]]| accessdate= February 21, 2012}}</ref> He was [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]].\n\nCollins' elder brother, Major General [[James Lawton Collins]], was also in the United States Army. His nephew, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[James Lawton Collins Jr.]] served in World War II, the Korean War and the [[Vietnam War]]. Another nephew, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], was the [[Apollo command module|command module]] pilot on the [[Apollo 11]] mission in 1969 that put the first two men on the [[Moon]] and would retire as a major general from the [[United States Air Force]].\n\n==Early life and military career==\nCollins was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], into a large [[Irish Catholic]] family on May 1, 1896. He entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]] in June 1913, at the age of 17, and graduated on April 20, 1917, exactly two weeks after the [[American entry into World War I]], and shortly before his 21st birthday. Due to the outbreak of war, the graduation was several weeks early. He graduated 35th in his class of 139. Among those he graduated alongside were [[Matthew Ridgway]], [[Mark W. Clark]] (who shared the same birthday as Collins and, as the two youngest cadets, were both known as the \"class babies\"), [[Bryant Moore]], [[Ernest N. Harmon]], William C. McMahon, [[Norman Cota]], [[Laurence B. Keiser]], William W. Eagles, [[William Kelly Harrison, Jr.]] and [[Frederick Augustus Irving]]. All of these men were, like Collins, destined to become [[general officer]]s and later to achieve high rank in the army, with Ridgway, along with Collins, becoming [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chiefs of Staff]] and Clark becoming a [[four-star rank|four-star]] [[General (United States)|general]].\n\nCollins was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry Branch]] of the [[United States Army]] and was assigned as a [[platoon]] and later [[company commander]] with the [[22nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|22nd Infantry Regiment]]. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] in May 1917, and temporary [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in August. He attended the United States Army Infantry School of Arms at [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]] and served with the regiment at various locations between 1917 and 1919. He was promoted to captain in June 1918, and to temporary [[Major (United States)|major]] in September, and took command of the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment the following month. World War I came to an end soon afterwards, on [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November 11, 1918]]. Unable to fight overseas during the war, Collins commanded the 3rd Battalion, [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]] in France in June 1919, and was assistant chief of staff, as a [[Staff (military)|G-3 staff officer]] with the American Forces in Germany from 1920\u20131921. During this time, Collins served in the [[Allied occupation of the Rhineland|Army of Occupation]] in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Paul M. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Korean War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scZN59DXeOwC&lpg=PA163&dq=Philippine%20%22Korean%20War%22&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q=Philippine%20%22Korean%20War%22&f=false |accessdate=19 March 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810874619 |page=65 |series=Volume 41 of Historical Dictionaries of War, Revolution, and Civil Unrest }}</ref>\n\n==Between the wars==\nCollins married Gladys Easterbrook in 1921 and, reverting to the rank of captain in 1920, he was instructor in the department of [[chemistry]] at the United States Military Academy from 1921 to 1925. He graduated from the company officer course at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1926, and from the advanced course at the [[United States Army Field Artillery School]] at Fort Sill, Oklahoma the year after. He was an instructor in weapons and tactics at the United States Army Infantry School from 1927 to 1931 and, promoted to major in August 1932, was [[executive officer]] of the 23rd Brigade in [[Manila]], and assistant chief of staff, as a G-2 staff officer, with the [[Philippine Division]] from 1933\u20131934.\n\nCollins graduated from the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy|United States Army Industrial College]] in 1937, and the [[United States Army War College]] the following year. He was then an instructor at the Army War College from 1938 to 1940. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in June 1940 and, now a full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], was [[chief of staff]] of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in 1941.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Two Soldiers on New Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|On the right, Major General J.

In February 1942 he was promoted to the [[one-star rank|one-star general officer rank]] of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] and the [[two-star rank|two-star]] general officer rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in May.<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_collins_j_lawton.html | title=J. Lawton Collins, 1896\u20131987 (Lighting Joe) | website=HistoryOfWar.org}}</ref>\n\nCollins was chief of staff of the [[Hawaiian Department]] from 1941 to 1942 and served as the [[Commanding officer|Commanding General]] of the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]]\u2014nicknamed the \"Tropic Lightning\" Division\u2014on [[Oahu]] and in operations against the Japanese on [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]] between 1942 and 1943 and on [[New Georgia Campaign|New Georgia]] in from July to October 1943. At the time of his appointment he was the youngest division commander in the United States Army, aged 46. It was during this campaign that Collins gained his nickname of \"Lightning Joe\".<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" />\n\nCollins was later transferred to the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]], where he commanded the [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]] and on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] through to the [[end of World War II in Europe]] in May 1945. Collins was chosen by Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]], who had served with Collins at the Army Infantry School before the war and was then commanding the [[First United States Army|First Army]] in England, as a replacement for Major General [[Roscoe B. Woodruff]], the original commander of VII Corps and one of Bradley's West Point classmates, who was senior to Collins but, unlike Collins, had no recent combat experience. Collins was appointed after a brief interview with Bradley and General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], about his combat experience after Collins summed up his tactical approach in the Pacific as always targeting the high ground in an attack. Bradley turned to Eisenhower, claiming that Collins \"talks our language.\"<ref>Alan Axelrod, ''Bradley: A Biography'', p. 115</ref> At the age of 47, this made Collins the youngest corps commander in the United States Army. Among the units serving under Collins' command in Normandy was the veteran [[82nd Airborne Division]], commanded by Major General [[Matthew Ridgway]], a fellow graduate of the West Point class of 1917.\n[[File:General Joseph Lawton Collins, the Rhine River pontoon bridge and \"THE BEER BRIDGE Shortest Route to C.B.I.\" beer party art, from- General Pays Off - NARA - 12007749 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|General Joseph Lawton Collins challenged the 1106 Engineers Combat Group to build the [[Rhine river|Rhine River]] pontoon bridge at [[Bonn]], Germany in 10 hours and he would have a beer party.

Collins was a favorite of the [[21st Army Group]] commander, General [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]], who after [[Operation Goodwood]] laid the path for VII Corps to break out in Operation Cobra on 27 July 1944.<ref>Colin F. Baxter, ''Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1887\u20131976: A Selected Bibliography'', p. 76</ref> After Cobra was the [[Falaise Pocket|Battle of the Falaise Pocket]], which completed the destruction of the [[Wehrmacht]] in Normandy, the corps then took part in the [[liberation of Paris]] and the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine]], where the corps broke through the [[Siegfried Line]] and endured heavy fighting in the [[Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest]]. VII Corps later played a major role in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the largest battle on the Western Front during World War II, and finally took part in the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]]. VII Corps is perhaps best known for the leading role it played in Operation Cobra; less well known is Collins' contribution to that plan.<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" />\n\n[[File:GENERAL COLLINS, FIELD MARSHAL MONTGOMERY, AND GENERAL RIDGWAY.jpg|thumb|right|Major General J. L. Collins, commanding VII Corps, with Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]], commander of the [[21st Army Group]], and Major General [[Matthew Ridgway]], Commanding [[XVIII Airborne Corps]], December 1944.]]\n\nOne of the few senior United States commanders to fight in both Europe and the Pacific, against the Germans and Japanese respectively, Collins contrasted the nature of the enemy in the two [[Theater (warfare)|theaters of war]]:\n{{quote|The German was far more skilled than the Japanese. Most of the Japanese that we fought were not skilled men. Not skilled leaders. The German had a professional army... The Japanese.. didn't know how to handle combined arms \u2013 the artillery and the support of the infantry \u2013 to the same extent we did. They were gallant soldiers, though... They fought very, very hard, but they were not nearly as skillful as the Germans. But the German didn't have the tenacity of the Japanese.<ref>Maj.

He was very highly regarded by General Omar Bradley, Collins' superior for most of the war, and many German senior commanders believed Collins, along with Lieutenant General [[Troy H. Middleton]], commanding the [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]], to be one of the best American corps commanders on the Western Front.<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" /> Bradley commented that \"Had we created another ETO [[Field army|Army]], despite his youth and lack of seniority, Collins certainly would have been named the commander.\" For his service during the war Collins was three times awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Army Distinguished Service Medal]], twice awarded the [[Silver Star]] and twice the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/100086 | title=Joseph Lawton Collins | website=The Hall of Valor Project}}</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n[[File:Joseph Lawton Collins.jpg|left|thumb|Joseph Lawton Collins painted by Lloyd Bowers Embrey in 1972]]\nAfter the war, Collins was deputy commanding general and chief of staff of [[Army Ground Forces]] from August to December 1945. Later, he was director of information (later chief of [[public information]]) of the United States Army from 1945 to 1947. He was deputy, later [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] from 1947 to 1949 and was promoted to temporary general and permanent major general in January 1948.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://unithistories.com/officers/US_Army_officers_C01.html | title=US Army Officers 1939\u20131945 (last names starting with 'C') | website=World War II unit histories & officers}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Walker Church Collins.jpg|thumb|Collins with [[Walton Walker]] and [[John H. Church]] in Korea.|alt=]]\n\nCollins was [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] from August 16, 1949 to August 15, 1953; as such he was the Army's senior officer throughout the [[Korean War]]. As a wartime chief of staff his primary responsibility was to ensure that adequately trained and equipped soldiers were sent to fight in Korea. He directed the Army's operation of the railroads, brought the first [[Special Forces]] group into the [[order of battle]], and was closely associated with the development of the army's contribution to the newly established [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).\n\nCollins was representative of the United States to the Military Committee and the Standing Group of NATO from 1953 to 1954. He was special representative of the United States in [[Vietnam]] with ambassadorial rank, 1954 to 1955, and returned to his NATO assignment. He retired from active service in March 1956, after almost 40 years of military service.\n\nGeneral Joseph Lawton Collins died in [[Washington, D.C.]], on September 12, 1987. He is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], [[Virginia]].\n\n==Awards==\n\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\"|{{Ribbon devices|number=3|type=oak|ribbon=Distinguished Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}{{Ribbon devices|number=1|type=oak|ribbon=Silver Star ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=2|type=oak|ribbon=Legion of Merit ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Bronze Star ribbon.svg|width=106}}<span style=\"position:relative; top: 0px; left: -63px; display: inline-block; width: 0;\">[[File:Valor device.svg|21px]]</span>\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=World War I Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Army of Occupation of Germany ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=American Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106|alt=}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=2|type=service-star|ribbon=Asiatic-Pacific Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106|alt=}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=5|type=service-star|ribbon=European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=World War II Victory Medal ribbon.svg|width=106|alt=}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Army of Occupation ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=National Defense Service Medal ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order of the Bath (ribbon).svg|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Legion Honneur GO ribbon.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Grand Officer Ordre de Leopold.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order_of_Suvorov_106x30.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=service-star|ribbon=Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945 stripe bronsepalme.svg|width=106}}\n|-\n|} \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |[[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]]<br/>with three oak leaf clusters\n|colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |[[Silver Star]]<br/>with oak leaf cluster\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Legion of Merit]]<br/>with two oak leaf clusters\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Bronze Star Medal]]<br/>with [[\"V\" device]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[World War I Victory Medal (United States)|World War I Victory Medal]]\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Army of Occupation of Germany Medal]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\"|[[American Defense Service Medal]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]]<br/>with two campaign stars\n|-\n!4th Row\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal]] <br/>with five campaign stars\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[World War II Victory Medal (United States)|World War II Victory Medal]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Army of Occupation Medal]]\n|-\n!5th Row\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[National Defense Service Medal]]\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]]<br/>(United Kingdom)\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Legion of Honour|Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour]]<br/>(France)\n|-\n!6th Row\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Grand Officer of the Order of Leopold]]<br/>(Belgium)\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Order of Suvorov|Order of Suvorov, 2nd Class]]<br/>(USSR)\n|colspan=\"3\" align=\"center\" |[[Croix de guerre 1939\u20131945 (France)|Croix de Guerre with palm]]<br/>(France)\n|-\n|}\n</center>\n\n==Promotions==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white\"\n!

During [[World War II]], he served in both the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] and [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theaters of Operations]], one of a few senior American commanders to do so.<ref>{{cite video| title= Video: Dragon's Teeth| url= https://archive.org/details/gov.dod.dimoc.30141| publisher= [[U.S. Army Pictorial Service]]| accessdate= February 21, 2012}}</ref> He was [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]].\n\nCollins' elder brother, Major General [[James Lawton Collins]], was also in the United States Army. His nephew, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[James Lawton Collins Jr.]] served in World War II, the Korean War and the [[Vietnam War]]. Another nephew, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], was the [[Apollo command module|command module]] pilot on the [[Apollo 11]] mission in 1969 that put the first two men on the [[Moon]] and would retire as a major general from the [[United States Air Force]].\n\n==Early life and military career==\nCollins was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], into a large [[Irish Catholic]] family on May 1, 1896. He entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]] in June 1913, at the age of 17, and graduated on April 20, 1917, exactly two weeks after the [[American entry into World War I]], and shortly before his 21st birthday. Due to the outbreak of war, the graduation was several weeks early. He graduated 35th in his class of 139. Among those he graduated alongside were [[Matthew Ridgway]], [[Mark W. Clark]] (who shared the same birthday as Collins and, as the two youngest cadets, were both known as the \"class babies\"), [[Bryant Moore]], [[Ernest N. Harmon]], William C. McMahon, [[Norman Cota]], [[Laurence B. Keiser]], William W. Eagles, [[William Kelly Harrison, Jr.]] and [[Frederick Augustus Irving]]. All of these men were, like Collins, destined to become [[general officer]]s and later to achieve high rank in the army, with Ridgway, along with Collins, becoming [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chiefs of Staff]] and Clark becoming a [[four-star rank|four-star]] [[General (United States)|general]].\n\nCollins was commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry Branch]] of the [[United States Army]] and was assigned as a [[platoon]] and later [[company commander]] with the [[22nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|22nd Infantry Regiment]]. He was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] in May 1917, and temporary [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] in August. He attended the United States Army Infantry School of Arms at [[Fort Sill]], [[Oklahoma]] and served with the regiment at various locations between 1917 and 1919. He was promoted to captain in June 1918, and to temporary [[Major (United States)|major]] in September, and took command of the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment the following month. World War I came to an end soon afterwards, on [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|November 11, 1918]]. Unable to fight overseas during the war, Collins commanded the 3rd Battalion, [[18th Infantry Regiment (United States)|18th Infantry Regiment]] in France in June 1919, and was assistant chief of staff, as a [[Staff (military)|G-3 staff officer]] with the American Forces in Germany from 1920\u20131921. During this time, Collins served in the [[Allied occupation of the Rhineland|Army of Occupation]] in [[Weimar Republic|Germany]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Paul M. |title=Historical Dictionary of the Korean War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=scZN59DXeOwC&lpg=PA163&dq=Philippine%20%22Korean%20War%22&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q=Philippine%20%22Korean%20War%22&f=false |accessdate=19 March 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810874619 |page=65 |series=Volume 41 of Historical Dictionaries of War, Revolution, and Civil Unrest }}</ref>\n\n==Between the wars==\nCollins married Gladys Easterbrook in 1921 and, reverting to the rank of captain in 1920, he was instructor in the department of [[chemistry]] at the United States Military Academy from 1921 to 1925. He graduated from the company officer course at the [[United States Army Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 1926, and from the advanced course at the [[United States Army Field Artillery School]] at Fort Sill, Oklahoma the year after. He was an instructor in weapons and tactics at the United States Army Infantry School from 1927 to 1931 and, promoted to major in August 1932, was [[executive officer]] of the 23rd Brigade in [[Manila]], and assistant chief of staff, as a G-2 staff officer, with the [[Philippine Division]] from 1933\u20131934.\n\nCollins graduated from the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower School for National Security and Resource Strategy|United States Army Industrial College]] in 1937, and the [[United States Army War College]] the following year. He was then an instructor at the Army War College from 1938 to 1940. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in June 1940 and, now a full [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], was [[chief of staff]] of [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in 1941.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Two Soldiers on New Georgia.jpg|thumb|left|On the right, Major General J.

In February 1942 he was promoted to the [[one-star rank|one-star general officer rank]] of [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] and the [[two-star rank|two-star]] general officer rank of [[Major general (United States)|major general]] in May.<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_collins_j_lawton.html | title=J.

At the time of his appointment he was the youngest division commander in the United States Army, aged 46. It was during this campaign that Collins gained his nickname of \"Lightning Joe\".<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" />\n\nCollins was later transferred to the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]], where he commanded the [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[invasion of Normandy]] and on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] through to the [[end of World War II in Europe]] in May 1945. Collins was chosen by Lieutenant General [[Omar Bradley]], who had served with Collins at the Army Infantry School before the war and was then commanding the [[First United States Army|First Army]] in England, as a replacement for Major General [[Roscoe B. Woodruff]], the original commander of VII Corps and one of Bradley's West Point classmates, who was senior to Collins but, unlike Collins, had no recent combat experience. Collins was appointed after a brief interview with Bradley and General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the [[Supreme Allied Commander]], about his combat experience after Collins summed up his tactical approach in the Pacific as always targeting the high ground in an attack. Bradley turned to Eisenhower, claiming that Collins \"talks our language.\"<ref>Alan Axelrod, ''Bradley: A Biography'', p. 115</ref> At the age of 47, this made Collins the youngest corps commander in the United States Army. Among the units serving under Collins' command in Normandy was the veteran [[82nd Airborne Division]], commanded by Major General [[Matthew Ridgway]], a fellow graduate of the West Point class of 1917.\n[[File:General Joseph Lawton Collins, the Rhine River pontoon bridge and \"THE BEER BRIDGE Shortest Route to C.B.I.\" beer party art, from- General Pays Off - NARA - 12007749 (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|General Joseph Lawton Collins challenged the 1106 Engineers Combat Group to build the [[Rhine river|Rhine River]] pontoon bridge at [[Bonn]], Germany in 10 hours and he would have a beer party.

Collins was a favorite of the [[21st Army Group]] commander, General [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]], who after [[Operation Goodwood]] laid the path for VII Corps to break out in Operation Cobra on 27 July 1944.<ref>Colin F. Baxter, ''Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, 1887\u20131976: A Selected Bibliography'', p. 76</ref> After Cobra was the [[Falaise Pocket|Battle of the Falaise Pocket]], which completed the destruction of the [[Wehrmacht]] in Normandy, the corps then took part in the [[liberation of Paris]] and the [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine]], where the corps broke through the [[Siegfried Line]] and endured heavy fighting in the [[Battle of H\u00fcrtgen Forest]]. VII Corps later played a major role in the [[Battle of the Bulge]], the largest battle on the Western Front during World War II, and finally took part in the [[Western Allied invasion of Germany]]. VII Corps is perhaps best known for the leading role it played in Operation Cobra; less well known is Collins' contribution to that plan.<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" />\n\n[[File:GENERAL COLLINS, FIELD MARSHAL MONTGOMERY, AND GENERAL RIDGWAY.jpg|thumb|right|Major General J.

Most of the Japanese that we fought were not skilled men. Not skilled leaders. The German had a professional army... The Japanese.. didn't know how to handle combined arms \u2013 the artillery and the support of the infantry \u2013 to the same extent we did. They were gallant soldiers, though...

He was very highly regarded by General Omar Bradley, Collins' superior for most of the war, and many German senior commanders believed Collins, along with Lieutenant General [[Troy H. Middleton]], commanding the [[VIII Corps (United States)|VIII Corps]], to be one of the best American corps commanders on the Western Front.<ref name=\"HistoryOfWar\" /> Bradley commented that \"Had we created another ETO [[Field army|Army]], despite his youth and lack of seniority, Collins certainly would have been named the commander.\" For his service during the war Collins was three times awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Army Distinguished Service Medal]], twice awarded the [[Silver Star]] and twice the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://valor.militarytimes.com/hero/100086 | title=Joseph Lawton Collins | website=The Hall of Valor Project}}</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n[[File:Joseph Lawton Collins.jpg|left|thumb|Joseph Lawton Collins painted by Lloyd Bowers Embrey in 1972]]\nAfter the war, Collins was deputy commanding general and chief of staff of [[Army Ground Forces]] from August to December 1945. Later, he was director of information (later chief of [[public information]]) of the United States Army from 1945 to 1947. He was deputy, later [[Vice Chief of Staff of the United States Army]] from 1947 to 1949 and was promoted to temporary general and permanent major general in January 1948.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://unithistories.com/officers/US_Army_officers_C01.html | title=US Army Officers 1939\u20131945 (last names starting with 'C') | website=World War II unit histories & officers}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Walker Church Collins.jpg|thumb|Collins with [[Walton Walker]] and [[John H.

As a wartime chief of staff his primary responsibility was to ensure that adequately trained and equipped soldiers were sent to fight in Korea. He directed the Army's operation of the railroads, brought the first [[Special Forces]] group into the [[order of battle]], and was closely associated with the development of the army's contribution to the newly established [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).\n\nCollins was representative of the United States to the Military Committee and the Standing Group of NATO from 1953 to 1954. He was special representative of the United States in [[Vietnam]] with ambassadorial rank, 1954 to 1955, and returned to his NATO assignment. He retired from active service in March 1956, after almost 40 years of military service.\n\nGeneral Joseph Lawton Collins died in [[Washington, D.C.]], on September 12, 1987.
