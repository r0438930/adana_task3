McKay]] reported microscopic features and geochemical anomalies that they considered to be best explained by the rock having hosted Martian bacteria in the distant past. Some of these features resembled terrestrial bacteria, aside from their being much smaller than any known form of life. Much controversy arose over this claim, and ultimately all of the evidence McKay's team cited as evidence of life was found to be explainable by non-biological processes. Although the scientific community has largely rejected the claim ALH 84001 contains evidence of ancient Martian life, the controversy associated with it is now seen as a historically significant moment in the development of exobiology.<ref name=\"disbelief\">{{cite news | title=After 10 years, few believe life on Mars | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_060806_mars_rock.html | last=Crenson | first=Matt | agency=[[Associated Press]] | work=Space.com | date=August 6, 2006 | url-status=dead | archivedate=August 9, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809161936/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_060806_mars_rock.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1996Sci...273..924M |title=Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible Relic Biogenic Activity in Martian Meteorite ALH84001 |last=McKay |first=David S. |last2=Gibson |first2=Everett K. |last3=Thomas-Keprta |first3=Kathie L. |last4=Vali |first4=Hojatollah |last5=Romanek |first5=Christopher S. |last6=Clemett |first6=Simon J. |last7=Chillier |first7=Xavier D.

Some of these features resembled terrestrial bacteria, aside from their being much smaller than any known form of life. Much controversy arose over this claim, and ultimately all of the evidence McKay's team cited as evidence of life was found to be explainable by non-biological processes. Although the scientific community has largely rejected the claim ALH 84001 contains evidence of ancient Martian life, the controversy associated with it is now seen as a historically significant moment in the development of exobiology.<ref name=\"disbelief\">{{cite news | title=After 10 years, few believe life on Mars | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_060806_mars_rock.html | last=Crenson | first=Matt | agency=[[Associated Press]] | work=Space.com | date=August 6, 2006 | url-status=dead | archivedate=August 9, 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809161936/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_060806_mars_rock.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |bibcode=1996Sci...273..924M |title=Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible Relic Biogenic Activity in Martian Meteorite ALH84001 |last=McKay |first=David S. |last2=Gibson |first2=Everett K. |last3=Thomas-Keprta |first3=Kathie L. |last4=Vali |first4=Hojatollah |last5=Romanek |first5=Christopher S. |last6=Clemett |first6=Simon J. |last7=Chillier |first7=Xavier D.

There was an electrochemistry experiment which analysed the [[ion]]s in the regolith and the amount and type of [[antioxidant]]s on Mars.

Surface conditions and the presence of [[water on Mars]] make it arguably the most [[Planetary habitability|hospitable of the planets]] in the [[Solar System]], other than [[Earth]]. Human colonization of Mars would require ''in situ'' resource utilization ([[In situ resource utilization|ISRU]]); A NASA report states that \"applicable frontier technologies include robotics, machine intelligence, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, [[3D printing|3-D printing/additive]] manufacturing, and autonomy. These technologies combined with the vast natural resources should enable, pre- and post-human arrival ISRU to greatly increase reliability and safety and reduce cost for human colonization of Mars.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160005963.pdf|title=Frontier In-Situ Resource Utilization for Enabling Sustained Human Presence on Mars|date=April 2016|website=NASA|access-date=October 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502223955/https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160005963.pdf|archive-date=May 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"spaceref\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=12418|title=House Science Committee Hearing Charter: Lunar Science & Resources: Future Options|work=spaceref.com|accessdate=June 12, 2015|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120703160557/http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=12418|archive-date=July 3, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"race\">{{Cite news |title=Space Race Rekindled?
