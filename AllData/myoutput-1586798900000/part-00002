In his review of the seventh season for [[DVD Talk]], Ian Jane wrote that the series \"is one of those rare animated shows that can be enjoyed equally as much by both adults and children.\"<ref name=DVD1/> He described the concept of the show as \"utterly ludicrous.\"<ref name=DVD1/> He cited the episodes \"[[SpongeBob's Last Stand]]\" and \"Tentacle-Vision\" as \"interesting stand outs,\" while the episodes \"The Inside Job\", \"Back to the Past\", \"Gary in Love\", and \"The Abrasive Side\" as \"memorable episodes this time around.\"<ref name=DVD1/> However, Jane said that the season is not as good as the previous seasons, writing \"It's not that this more recent material isn't fun, because it is, but by this point in time storylines are beginning to get a little repetitive and as such, the series doesn't seem quite as fresh and original as it once did.\"<ref name=DVD1/> Jane \"recommended\" the DVD set, writing \"This latest collection of episodes is not a high point in the series but it's still decent enough family friendly entertainment, even if it does get too repetitive for its own good.\"<ref name=DVD1/>\n\nJosh Rode of [[DVD Verdict]] said that the season \"has its moments\", but is \"by far the least consistently funny season of the venerable cartoon.\"<ref name=DVD2/> Rode also said that the characters of SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star \"have become the least engaging parts of the show, which is a problem since they dominate screen time.\"<ref name=DVD2/> He perceived that Patrick \"has been dumbed down too far.\"<ref name=DVD2/> As for the character of SpongeBob, he criticized his changing voice that has become \"more nasal over the years.\"<ref name=DVD2/> He described the character \"like a happy, fun-loving, not-overly-intelligent sponge,\" but said that \"[He] has entirely lost the na\u00efvet\u00e9 which has long been the basis of his charm.\"<ref name=DVD2/>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{See also|List of SpongeBob SquarePants episodes}}\nThe episodes are ordered below by production number and not their original broadcast order.\n<onlyinclude>{{#invoke:Episode table|main |background=#A1DFFB |overall=5 |season=5 |title=16 |director=15 |writer=35 |airdate=13 |viewers=11 |country=US |directorT=Animation directors |titleR= |directorR=<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"credits\" /> |writerR=<ref group=\"lower-alpha\" name=\"credits\" /> |airdateR=<ref>{{cite web|title=''SpongeBob SquarePants'', Season 7|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/tv-season/spongebob-squarepants-season/id322975888|work=[[iTunes]]|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</ref> |episodes=\n{{#invoke:Episode list|sublist|SpongeBob SquarePants (season 7)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 127a\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1a\n| Title           = Tentacle-Vision\n| DirectedBy      = [[Alan Smart]]\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|ex1label=Written by|ex1=[[Luke Brookshier]], [[Nate Cash]], and Derek Iversen|ex2label=Storyboarded by|ex2=Luke Brookshier and Nate Cash <small>(directors)</small>}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2009|7|19}}\n| Viewers         = 4.95<ref name=\"ssp\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2009/07/21/wizards-on-deck-w-hannah-montana-sets-annual-cable-top-spongebob-cannot-be-stopped/23180/|title=''Wizards On Deck'' w/ ''Hannah Montana'' Sets Cable Top; ''SpongeBob'' Cannot Be Stopped|author=Gorman, Bill|date=July 21, 2009|accessdate=November 9, 2010|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]] becomes the star of his own [[talk show]], but everyone else wants to join in and they ruin the set.
