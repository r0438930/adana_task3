He was repeatedly punished for his social-critical writing and spent ten years in severe conditions in jail.\n\n==Life==\nBorn at [[Obersontheim]] in [[Swabia]], he entered the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1758 as a student of [[theology]]. He led a dissolute life, and after two years' stay was summoned home by his parents. After attempting to earn a livelihood as private tutor and as assistant preacher, his musical talents gained him the appointment of organist in [[Geislingen an der Steige]]. Meeting Schubart in [[Ludwigsburg]] in 1772, [[Charles Burney]] called him \"the first, real great [[harpsichord]] player that I had hitherto met with in Germany ... He is formed on the Bach school; but is an enthusiast, and original in genius. Many of his pieces are printed in Holland; they are full of taste and fire.

He wrote in his Teutsche Chronik (27 April 1775) that in his opinion, von Beecke played far better than Mozart: \"In Munich... I heard two of the greatest clavier players, Mr Mozart and Captain von Beecke. Mozart\u2019s playing had great weight, and he read at sight everything that we put before him.
