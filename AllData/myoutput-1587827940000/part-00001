Norton, c1995), Barbara Garvey Jackson, ''\"Say Can You Deny Me\": A Guide to Surviving Music by Women from the 16th Through the 18th Centuries'' (Fayetteville: Univ of Arkansas Press, 1994), and Aaron I. Cohen, ''[[International Encyclopedia of Women Composers]]'' (NY: Books & Music, 1987).</ref> Women composers' names are still largely absent from music textbooks and concert programs that constitute the [[Western canon]], even though a large number of women have composed music. The reasons for women's exclusion are various.\n\nThe musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] speculated that women composers were deemed less important than men because women typically wrote smaller works, such as art songs, rather than large works, such as symphonies, for public performance in large halls. Female composers were long barred from the profession, owing in part to the essentialist notion that women could not, in Citron's words, \"control emotion with logic and reason, masculine attributes requisite for composition.\" Women were systematically denied access to compositional training and musical performances, and were castigated by critics for writing music that was either too feebly feminine or too unbecomingly masculine.<ref name=\"auto\">Citron, Marcia J., \"Gender and the Musical Canon,\" Journal of Musicology 8, no. 1 Winter 1990).</ref> Because the discrimination against women composers is related to general societal attitudes about ''gender'' or perceived roles of men and women, many [[Musicology|musicologists]] and critics have come to incorporate [[gender studies]] in assessing the history and practice of the art.\n\nSome notable Western composers and musicians include: [[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098\u20131179), a German Benedictine abbess, writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath; [[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805\u20131847); [[Clara Schumann]] (1819\u20131896); [[Ethel Smyth]] (1858\u20131944); [[Amy Beach]] (1867\u20131944); [[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] (1886\u20131979);  [[Nadia Boulanger]] (1887\u20131979);  [[Germaine Tailleferre]] (1892\u20131983); [[Lili Boulanger]] (1893\u20131918); [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (1931\u2013); and [[Kaija Saariaho]] (1952\u2013).\n\nFemale composers are also listed alphabetically at [[List of female composers by name]].\n\n==Before 16th century==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Enheduanna]] (fl. c. 2300 BCE) \u2013 the earliest writer of literary texts intended for music known to us by name<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burkholder|first1=J.

Cohen, ''[[International Encyclopedia of Women Composers]]'' (NY: Books & Music, 1987).</ref> Women composers' names are still largely absent from music textbooks and concert programs that constitute the [[Western canon]], even though a large number of women have composed music. The reasons for women's exclusion are various.\n\nThe musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] speculated that women composers were deemed less important than men because women typically wrote smaller works, such as art songs, rather than large works, such as symphonies, for public performance in large halls. Female composers were long barred from the profession, owing in part to the essentialist notion that women could not, in Citron's words, \"control emotion with logic and reason, masculine attributes requisite for composition.\" Women were systematically denied access to compositional training and musical performances, and were castigated by critics for writing music that was either too feebly feminine or too unbecomingly masculine.<ref name=\"auto\">Citron, Marcia J., \"Gender and the Musical Canon,\" Journal of Musicology 8, no. 1 Winter 1990).</ref> Because the discrimination against women composers is related to general societal attitudes about ''gender'' or perceived roles of men and women, many [[Musicology|musicologists]] and critics have come to incorporate [[gender studies]] in assessing the history and practice of the art.\n\nSome notable Western composers and musicians include: [[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098\u20131179), a German Benedictine abbess, writer, composer, philosopher, Christian mystic, visionary, and polymath; [[Fanny Mendelssohn]] (1805\u20131847); [[Clara Schumann]] (1819\u20131896); [[Ethel Smyth]] (1858\u20131944); [[Amy Beach]] (1867\u20131944); [[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] (1886\u20131979);  [[Nadia Boulanger]] (1887\u20131979);  [[Germaine Tailleferre]] (1892\u20131983); [[Lili Boulanger]] (1893\u20131918); [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] (1931\u2013); and [[Kaija Saariaho]] (1952\u2013).\n\nFemale composers are also listed alphabetically at [[List of female composers by name]].\n\n==Before 16th century==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Enheduanna]] (fl. c. 2300 BCE) \u2013 the earliest writer of literary texts intended for music known to us by name<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burkholder|first1=J.
