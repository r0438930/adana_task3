It was substantially reduced in 1951 to the current 13,628 hectares, after two [[barrio]]s of Dipolog were converted into Municipalities of [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]], and [[Pi\u00f1an, Zamboanga del Norte|Pi\u00f1an]] under Executive Order of the President No. 467, dated August 22, 1951.\n\n===Barangays===\nDipolog City is politically subdivided into 21 [[barangay]]s.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Barra (Urban)\n* Biasong (Urban)\n* Central (Urban)\n* Cogon  (nature park)\n* Dicayas (Urban)\n* Diwan   (nature park)\n* Estaka (Urban)\n* Galas (Urban)\n* Gulayon (Urban)\n* Lugdungan  (suburban)\n* Minaog     (urban)\n* Miputak (Urban)\n* Olingan (Urban)\n* Punta      (suburban)\n* San Jose  (Agriculture)\n* Sangkol   (Agriculture)\n* Santa Filomena ( Urban)\n* Santa Isabel (Urban)\n* Sicayab (Urban)\n* Sinaman (Agriculture)\n* Turno (Urban)\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nDipolog has a [[tropical rainforest climate]], according to the K\u00f6ppen Climate classification with ample rain distributed quite evenly throughout the year and warm to hot temperatures.

At that time, ''Tulwanan's'' political territory was still part of the Municipality of Dapitan with Don Domingo Ruiz, a native, as its ''capit\u00e1n'' or town executive.\nSometime that year, a Spanish Recollect missionary arrived in Tulwanan looking for its [[barrio]] executive or local chieftain. Upon meeting a native, the missionary asked; \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el capit\u00e1n?\". The native understanding only the word \"capit\u00e1n\" pointed to the west and said in Subanen ''Di-pag'', meaning across the river. Guided by his servant, a Tagalog boy named Antonio Subido, the missionary proceeded down river and upon reaching the Boholano settlement, named the place \"Dipag\".\n\nTechnically, Dipag and Tulwanan were two different settlements at that time with the former composed of Boholano natives and the latter mostly of Subanen ancestry. When the friar returned to Dapitan, he identified the location of the larger Boholano settlement as Dipag but was not officially written. Frequent conversations by the Spaniards pronounced it in Spanish accent ''Dipolog'' which was eventually adopted by the natives. The final political survey surprisingly added the letter 'L' written on it after officially becoming a barrio of Dapitan. From that time Tulwanan's political identity ceased to exist.\nBy the 12th century the Subanen settlers had colonized most of what is now [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] region. It was customary for tribes to establish their settlements at the mouth of large river systems due to the abundant food supply. However, due to frequent raids from seafaring Chinese [[pirates]], they decided to move their settlements inland.\n\nIn the 14th century, '''Tulwanan''' was established 6 kilometers inland, adjoining the river near the present day ''barangay'' center of ''Lugdungan''.\n\nIn the 15th century, settlers from neighboring [[Negros Island|Negros]] and [[Bohol]] islands established coastline settlements in Mindanao but suffered the same raids by Chinese pirates, prompting them to also move their settlements away from the coastline. They established another settlement in what is now called Sianib, a ''barangay'' of present-day [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]] town, some twenty kilometers from the coast at Barrio Gulayon(Barangay Gulayon).\n\nIt was only in 1563 that the first recorded Visayan settlement of some 800 families from Bohol, led by the chieftain Datu Pagbuaya, landed in [[Mindanao]] and established a coastal settlement in what is now called [[Dapitan]]. This settlement was strong enough to repel the Chinese pirates of the Sulu Sea. As a result, Dapitan Bay was scene of many bloody conflicts between Pagbuaya's men and Chinese pirates.\n\n===Mindanao's first Christian settlement===\nIn 1565, Don [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] who was accompanied by famed navigator Fr. [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]], an Augustinian friar, visited the Boholano chieftain Datu Pagbuaya on the invitation of [[Datu Sikatuna]]. There they found the place of Datu Pagbuaya to be a thriving settlement. In his chronicle, Fr. Urdaneta named the place Daquepitan. [[Peter Kaerius]] (Pieter van den Keere) identified the location as ''Dapito'' in his cartographic map of 1598. It was later identified as \"Dapite\" in [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Robert Dudley]]'s map of 1646. Other names ascribed to the location include \"Dapyto\" in Sanson's map of 1652 and \"Dapitan\" which can be found in [[Herman Moll|Moll]]'s map of the East Indies, 1729 and in Murillo Velarde's map of 1734. After [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]]'s visit, the [[Christianization]] of Mindanao was officially initiated by the Augustinian friars who arrived with him.\n\nIn 1581, members of The [[Society of Jesus]] came to the Philippines for the purpose of evangelization. When the country was divided among four [[Religious order#Christian tradition|religious orders]] in 1598, the Jesuits were given the Diocese of Cebu which covered the Visayas and Mindanao. Thus Dapitan came to be under the jurisdiction of the courageous men of St. Ignatius and it was Father Pascual de Acu\u00f1a S.J. who started the Jesuit mission there.\n\nIn 1609, the squadron of Juan Juarez Gallinato S.J. defeated the Manguindanau Muslims in a ferocious battle near Dapitan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221351/http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm |archive-date=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1609, a permanent Dapitan mission was founded and thereafter headed by a Jesuit missionary, Father Pedro Gutierrez, marking Dapitan as the Center of Evangelization in Mindanao.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221438/http://www.dipolog.us/ |archive-date=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mission stations were subsequently established later by the Jesuits in Zamboanga, [[Iligan]], [[History of Basilan|Basilan]] and [[Butuan]]. Outside of these areas, however, the whole of Mindanao remained untouched by the Spanish Cross.\n\n[[File:STA. CRUZ - (Punta Corro).JPG|thumb|upright|The Santa Cruz Marker (Punta Corro) is the spot where migrating Boholanos from the Visayas landed and established settlement.]]\nBy the 18th century, with the [[Armada Espa\u00f1ola#The roots of the Spanish Navy (15th century)|Spanish Naval Fleet]] anchored at Dapitan Bay, much of the piracy&mdash;now conducted mainly by [[Moro people|moro]] bandits&mdash;was under control within the [[Sulu Sea]]. Settlement in coastal areas resumed with new settlers from Negros and Bohol eventually settling in Isab, and Nipaan. The largest settlement, however, was made at the mouth of the Dipolog river by the Boholanos who were not associated with Pagbuaya.\n\nFrom Ruiz, civil administration changed hands in stable succession, with Martino Belarmino, who was popular by the name Maglinte. Francisco Magallanes, Victorio Gobune; another man whose name history record had as Toribio had his chance, followed by Venancio Narvaez, Francisco Orbita, Bautista Narvaez, Martencio Yebes and Sabino Bengua.\n\nBy 1889, administrative designations reverted to ''Capitanes'', and those appointed were Martin Fernandez, Tomas Narvacan, Eustaquio Cajocon, Simplicio Lacaya, Basilio Tabiliran, Maximiano Ruiz and Bruno Ordinaria in 1898.\n\nBy February 1894, the Catholic Chapel constructed by the Jesuits was renovated for the first time, on an altar designed by Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] to which now stands the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral.\n\nBy 1896, the friars established Dipolog as a regular parish and installed Father Esteban Yepes its first administrator in 1897.\n\n===American regime===\nAfter the transfer of Spanish [[sovereignty]] to the United States in 1897, the U.S. occupation forces renamed the ''Capitan'' to Presidente Local, with administrative support from a Vice Presidente Local, a Delegado de Justicia and a Delegado de Policia.\nMartin Fernandez was appointed Presidente Local in the year 1900, followed by Diosdado Mercado, Gaudencio Zorilla and Isidro Patangan as Presidente Municipal between 1901 and March 1904.\n\nBy 1900, Dipolog was a thriving commercial community with new settlers arriving from the island of [[Cebu]], outgrowing its principal town of Dapitan which exclusively remained part of Pagbuaya's clan.\n\nBy 1910, John Helper, who was previously appointed Secretary of Zamboanga Province, visited Dipolog for two days and conversed with its [[principal\u00eda]] and members of the ''Centro Catolico de Dipolog''. He was asked later of the possibility of converting the [[barrio|community]] to an independent Municipality.\n\nBy 1912, Gov. [[John J. Pershing]] of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu decreed the separation of Dipolog from Dapitan.\n\nBy July 1, 1913, Gov. John J. Pershing declared Dipolog as a Municipality. General Pershing also appointed Pascual T. Martinez as its first Municipal Mayor.\n\nThe first public school teachers of Dipolog, during this time, came also from Bohol, particularly Maribojoc and other towns. Most were only elementary graduates. But they were well-educated by the American soldier-teachers in Bohol. One of them was a certain Felisa Ruaya who taught at the American-established schools in Dipolog. She lived first near the beach in Punta Coro. Then she married an Adriatico, a native of Polanco. Because the inhabitants converted to Christianity, it cannot be determined whether or not the residents were of Subanen heritage. Felisa Ruaya was the mother of former Zamboanga del Norte vice governor Concordio Ruaya Adriatico.\n\n===Japanese regime===\n\nIn 1942, Japanese Imperial Occupation forces entered in Dipolog and built of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Army was stationed in the municipality. In the same year, the seat of government of the [[Zamboanga (province)|historical province of Zamboanga]] was transferred from [[Zamboanga City]] to Dipolog.\n\nIn 1942 to 1945, Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military units and the local recognized guerrillas began the conflicts in the town municipality of Dipolog against the Japanese Imperial forces during the occupation was until the retreating local resistance fighters were halted by the Japanese after almost 4 years and before the American liberation forces returned and arrived in the town.\n\nIn 1945, the liberation by the Filipino troops under the 6th, 10th, 102nd and 105th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary entered in Dipolog together with local guerrillas.\n\nGovernor [[Matias Ranillo Sr.|Matias Castillon Ranillo Sr.]] noticed that the waters at Punta Coro wharf were choppy for ships to anchor.  Governor Ranillo was determined to provide an alternative access to southern Zamboanga peninsula.  Governor Ranillo's jurisdiction was then the entire Zamboanga peninsula prior to its division between del Norte and del Sur.  During Governor Ranillo's term, aviation was a young technology but he made sure that an airfield was established in Dipolog.\n\nHe was elected Governor in 1937 and re-elected in 1940 but his term was cut short when Philippine President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] urged him to run as the lone Assemblyman of Zamboanga peninsula.  President Quezon fondly called him \"El Gallo Escondido de Malacanang\".  In November 1941, he was elected as Assemblyman but one week before his scheduled departure for Manila, World War II broke out. On October 30, 1944, upon the request of the recognized guerrillas among them the local regular and constable force of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary during the conflicts against the occupation, he mobilized the able-bodied men of Dipolog and Home guards who cheerfully volunteered to clear the airfield of grass and shrubs.\n\nOn March 8, 1945, on Dipolog airfield, the first American invasion of Zamboanga peninsula took place. The successful landing at Dipolog airfield established a base for the subsequent recapture of Japanese-held San Roque airfield near [[Zamboanga City]], followed by Sanga Sanga in [[Sulu]], and from there to Borneo and the East Indies. The army then established a general headquarters and military camp base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were stationed in Dipolog on March 9, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during the aftermath of [[World War II]].\n\n===Philippine Republic and Cityhood===\n[[File:ZANORTE Provincial Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Zamboanga del Norte Provincial Capitol in Dipolog City prior to renovation, which was commenced by Governor Rolando E.

Dipolog became the capital of Zamboanga del Norte upon creation.\n\nBy June 21, 1969, through the effort of former Congressman Alberto Q. Ubay, Philippine President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed into law '''Republic Act 5520''' or \"'''Charter of the City of Dipolog'''\", making Dipolog a chartered city effective January 1, 1970. The date is both significant and historic as that coincided with the Apollo 11 launching which carried the first men to the moon on June 21, 1969.\nMayor Felicisimo Herrera was made the last Municipal Mayor (1963\u20131970) and the first City Mayor of Dipolog (1970\u20131978). On March 8, 1982 the Sangguniang Panlungsod adopted the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOBPnJSHipc  Dipolog City March] composed by Mrs. Antonina O.

Its earliest settlers all belonged to the ''Subanen Tribe'' called ''Subanon'' or river people with established religion founded in [[animism]].

At that time, ''Tulwanan's'' political territory was still part of the Municipality of Dapitan with Don Domingo Ruiz, a native, as its ''capit\u00e1n'' or town executive.\nSometime that year, a Spanish Recollect missionary arrived in Tulwanan looking for its [[barrio]] executive or local chieftain. Upon meeting a native, the missionary asked; \"\u00bfD\u00f3nde est\u00e1 el capit\u00e1n?\". The native understanding only the word \"capit\u00e1n\" pointed to the west and said in Subanen ''Di-pag'', meaning across the river. Guided by his servant, a Tagalog boy named Antonio Subido, the missionary proceeded down river and upon reaching the Boholano settlement, named the place \"Dipag\".\n\nTechnically, Dipag and Tulwanan were two different settlements at that time with the former composed of Boholano natives and the latter mostly of Subanen ancestry. When the friar returned to Dapitan, he identified the location of the larger Boholano settlement as Dipag but was not officially written. Frequent conversations by the Spaniards pronounced it in Spanish accent ''Dipolog'' which was eventually adopted by the natives. The final political survey surprisingly added the letter 'L' written on it after officially becoming a barrio of Dapitan. From that time Tulwanan's political identity ceased to exist.\nBy the 12th century the Subanen settlers had colonized most of what is now [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] region. It was customary for tribes to establish their settlements at the mouth of large river systems due to the abundant food supply. However, due to frequent raids from seafaring Chinese [[pirates]], they decided to move their settlements inland.\n\nIn the 14th century, '''Tulwanan''' was established 6 kilometers inland, adjoining the river near the present day ''barangay'' center of ''Lugdungan''.\n\nIn the 15th century, settlers from neighboring [[Negros Island|Negros]] and [[Bohol]] islands established coastline settlements in Mindanao but suffered the same raids by Chinese pirates, prompting them to also move their settlements away from the coastline. They established another settlement in what is now called Sianib, a ''barangay'' of present-day [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]] town, some twenty kilometers from the coast at Barrio Gulayon(Barangay Gulayon).\n\nIt was only in 1563 that the first recorded Visayan settlement of some 800 families from Bohol, led by the chieftain Datu Pagbuaya, landed in [[Mindanao]] and established a coastal settlement in what is now called [[Dapitan]]. This settlement was strong enough to repel the Chinese pirates of the Sulu Sea. As a result, Dapitan Bay was scene of many bloody conflicts between Pagbuaya's men and Chinese pirates.\n\n===Mindanao's first Christian settlement===\nIn 1565, Don [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] who was accompanied by famed navigator Fr. [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]], an Augustinian friar, visited the Boholano chieftain Datu Pagbuaya on the invitation of [[Datu Sikatuna]]. There they found the place of Datu Pagbuaya to be a thriving settlement. In his chronicle, Fr. Urdaneta named the place Daquepitan. [[Peter Kaerius]] (Pieter van den Keere) identified the location as ''Dapito'' in his cartographic map of 1598. It was later identified as \"Dapite\" in [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Robert Dudley]]'s map of 1646. Other names ascribed to the location include \"Dapyto\" in Sanson's map of 1652 and \"Dapitan\" which can be found in [[Herman Moll|Moll]]'s map of the East Indies, 1729 and in Murillo Velarde's map of 1734. After [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]]'s visit, the [[Christianization]] of Mindanao was officially initiated by the Augustinian friars who arrived with him.\n\nIn 1581, members of The [[Society of Jesus]] came to the Philippines for the purpose of evangelization. When the country was divided among four [[Religious order#Christian tradition|religious orders]] in 1598, the Jesuits were given the Diocese of Cebu which covered the Visayas and Mindanao. Thus Dapitan came to be under the jurisdiction of the courageous men of St. Ignatius and it was Father Pascual de Acu\u00f1a S.J. who started the Jesuit mission there.\n\nIn 1609, the squadron of Juan Juarez Gallinato S.J. defeated the Manguindanau Muslims in a ferocious battle near Dapitan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221351/http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm |archive-date=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 1609, a permanent Dapitan mission was founded and thereafter headed by a Jesuit missionary, Father Pedro Gutierrez, marking Dapitan as the Center of Evangelization in Mindanao.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221438/http://www.dipolog.us/ |archive-date=2007-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mission stations were subsequently established later by the Jesuits in Zamboanga, [[Iligan]], [[History of Basilan|Basilan]] and [[Butuan]]. Outside of these areas, however, the whole of Mindanao remained untouched by the Spanish Cross.\n\n[[File:STA. CRUZ - (Punta Corro).JPG|thumb|upright|The Santa Cruz Marker (Punta Corro) is the spot where migrating Boholanos from the Visayas landed and established settlement.]]\nBy the 18th century, with the [[Armada Espa\u00f1ola#The roots of the Spanish Navy (15th century)|Spanish Naval Fleet]] anchored at Dapitan Bay, much of the piracy&mdash;now conducted mainly by [[Moro people|moro]] bandits&mdash;was under control within the [[Sulu Sea]]. Settlement in coastal areas resumed with new settlers from Negros and Bohol eventually settling in Isab, and Nipaan. The largest settlement, however, was made at the mouth of the Dipolog river by the Boholanos who were not associated with Pagbuaya.\n\nFrom Ruiz, civil administration changed hands in stable succession, with Martino Belarmino, who was popular by the name Maglinte. Francisco Magallanes, Victorio Gobune; another man whose name history record had as Toribio had his chance, followed by Venancio Narvaez, Francisco Orbita, Bautista Narvaez, Martencio Yebes and Sabino Bengua.\n\nBy 1889, administrative designations reverted to ''Capitanes'', and those appointed were Martin Fernandez, Tomas Narvacan, Eustaquio Cajocon, Simplicio Lacaya, Basilio Tabiliran, Maximiano Ruiz and Bruno Ordinaria in 1898.\n\nBy February 1894, the Catholic Chapel constructed by the Jesuits was renovated for the first time, on an altar designed by Dr. [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] to which now stands the Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral.\n\nBy 1896, the friars established Dipolog as a regular parish and installed Father Esteban Yepes its first administrator in 1897.\n\n===American regime===\nAfter the transfer of Spanish [[sovereignty]] to the United States in 1897, the U.S. occupation forces renamed the ''Capitan'' to Presidente Local, with administrative support from a Vice Presidente Local, a Delegado de Justicia and a Delegado de Policia.\nMartin Fernandez was appointed Presidente Local in the year 1900, followed by Diosdado Mercado, Gaudencio Zorilla and Isidro Patangan as Presidente Municipal between 1901 and March 1904.\n\nBy 1900, Dipolog was a thriving commercial community with new settlers arriving from the island of [[Cebu]], outgrowing its principal town of Dapitan which exclusively remained part of Pagbuaya's clan.\n\nBy 1910, John Helper, who was previously appointed Secretary of Zamboanga Province, visited Dipolog for two days and conversed with its [[principal\u00eda]] and members of the ''Centro Catolico de Dipolog''. He was asked later of the possibility of converting the [[barrio|community]] to an independent Municipality.\n\nBy 1912, Gov. [[John J. Pershing]] of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu decreed the separation of Dipolog from Dapitan.\n\nBy July 1, 1913, Gov. John J. Pershing declared Dipolog as a Municipality. General Pershing also appointed Pascual T. Martinez as its first Municipal Mayor.\n\nThe first public school teachers of Dipolog, during this time, came also from Bohol, particularly Maribojoc and other towns. Most were only elementary graduates. But they were well-educated by the American soldier-teachers in Bohol. One of them was a certain Felisa Ruaya who taught at the American-established schools in Dipolog. She lived first near the beach in Punta Coro. Then she married an Adriatico, a native of Polanco. Because the inhabitants converted to Christianity, it cannot be determined whether or not the residents were of Subanen heritage. Felisa Ruaya was the mother of former Zamboanga del Norte vice governor Concordio Ruaya Adriatico.\n\n===Japanese regime===\n\nIn 1942, Japanese Imperial Occupation forces entered in Dipolog and built of the military garrison of the Imperial Japanese Army was stationed in the municipality. In the same year, the seat of government of the [[Zamboanga (province)|historical province of Zamboanga]] was transferred from [[Zamboanga City]] to Dipolog.\n\nIn 1942 to 1945, Filipino troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military units and the local recognized guerrillas began the conflicts in the town municipality of Dipolog against the Japanese Imperial forces during the occupation was until the retreating local resistance fighters were halted by the Japanese after almost 4 years and before the American liberation forces returned and arrived in the town.\n\nIn 1945, the liberation by the Filipino troops under the 6th, 10th, 102nd and 105th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and 10th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary entered in Dipolog together with local guerrillas.\n\nGovernor [[Matias Ranillo Sr.|Matias Castillon Ranillo Sr.]] noticed that the waters at Punta Coro wharf were choppy for ships to anchor.  Governor Ranillo was determined to provide an alternative access to southern Zamboanga peninsula.  Governor Ranillo's jurisdiction was then the entire Zamboanga peninsula prior to its division between del Norte and del Sur.  During Governor Ranillo's term, aviation was a young technology but he made sure that an airfield was established in Dipolog.\n\nHe was elected Governor in 1937 and re-elected in 1940 but his term was cut short when Philippine President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] urged him to run as the lone Assemblyman of Zamboanga peninsula.  President Quezon fondly called him \"El Gallo Escondido de Malacanang\".  In November 1941, he was elected as Assemblyman but one week before his scheduled departure for Manila, World War II broke out. On October 30, 1944, upon the request of the recognized guerrillas among them the local regular and constable force of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary during the conflicts against the occupation, he mobilized the able-bodied men of Dipolog and Home guards who cheerfully volunteered to clear the airfield of grass and shrubs.\n\nOn March 8, 1945, on Dipolog airfield, the first American invasion of Zamboanga peninsula took place. The successful landing at Dipolog airfield established a base for the subsequent recapture of Japanese-held San Roque airfield near [[Zamboanga City]], followed by Sanga Sanga in [[Sulu]], and from there to Borneo and the East Indies. The army then established a general headquarters and military camp base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and the [[Philippine Constabulary]] were stationed in Dipolog on March 9, 1945 to June 30, 1946 during the aftermath of [[World War II]].\n\n===Philippine Republic and Cityhood===\n[[File:ZANORTE Provincial Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Zamboanga del Norte Provincial Capitol in Dipolog City prior to renovation, which was commenced by Governor Rolando E. Yebes in 2012, was postponed and later resumed renovation works by Governor Roberto Uy in 2018.]]\nIn 1952, Zamboanga province is separated into two provinces of [[Zamboanga del Norte]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]] through '''Republic Act 711'''. Dipolog became the capital of Zamboanga del Norte upon creation.\n\nBy June 21, 1969, through the effort of former Congressman Alberto Q. Ubay, Philippine President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed into law '''Republic Act 5520''' or \"'''Charter of the City of Dipolog'''\", making Dipolog a chartered city effective January 1, 1970. The date is both significant and historic as that coincided with the Apollo 11 launching which carried the first men to the moon on June 21, 1969.\nMayor Felicisimo Herrera was made the last Municipal Mayor (1963\u20131970) and the first City Mayor of Dipolog (1970\u20131978). On March 8, 1982 the Sangguniang Panlungsod adopted the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOBPnJSHipc  Dipolog City March] composed by Mrs. Antonina O.

In comparison, the NCSB estimated [[Zamboanga City]] and [[Pagadian]] as having poverty incidences of 23.81% and 27.15%, respectively. In startling contrast, the poverty rate for the entire province of [[Zamboanga del Norte]] (with individuals in both rural and urban settings) was estimated to be 40.36%.
