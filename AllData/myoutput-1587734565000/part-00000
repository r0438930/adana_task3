Entertainment]], a division of [[AT&T]]'s [[WarnerMedia]]. The channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], mostly children's programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It operates usually from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM (ET/PT) and is targeted at children between ages 7 and 15<!-- Any changes to this information must be sourced, per WP:V. -->. Its overnight [[Dayparting|daypart]] block [[Adult Swim]] is aimed at young adults and is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a separate channel by [[Nielsen Holdings|Nielsen]] for [[Audience measurement|ratings]] purposes.<ref name=\"as_split\">{{cite web|url=https://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6516.html|title=Adult Swim/CN Split Cements Strategy|date=March 3, 2005|work=ICv2|publisher=GCO|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107105221/http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/6516.html|archive-date=November 7, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[Spanish language]] audio track for select programs is accessible via [[second audio program]]ing (SAP); some TV providers offer the Spanish feed as a separate channel by removing the main English-language audio track.\n\n\nCartoon Network was not the first [[cable channel]] to have relied on cartoons to attract an audience; however, it was the first 24-hour single-genre channel with animation as its main theme. Turner Broadcasting System had defied conventional wisdom before by launching [[CNN]], a channel providing 24-hour news coverage. The concept was previously thought unlikely to attract a sufficient audience to be particularly profitable, however the CNN experiment had been successful and Turner hoped that Cartoon Network would also find success.<ref name=\"Genre\">Mittell (2004), p. 80</ref>\n\nInitially, the channel would broadcast cartoons 24 hours a day. Most of the short cartoons were aired in half-hour or hour-long packages, usually separated by character or studio&nbsp;\u2013 ''Down Wit' Droopy D'' aired old [[Droopy|Droopy Dog]] shorts, ''The [[Tom and Jerry]] Show'' presented the classic cat-and-mouse team, and ''Bugs and Daffy Tonight'' provided classic [[Looney Tunes]] shorts. ''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' and ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/><ref name=\"Seibert\">{{cite web|url=https://www.awn.com/articles/people/fred-seibert-interview-part-1|title=The Fred Seibert Interview&nbsp;\u2013 Part 1|first=Joe|last=Strike|date=July 15, 2003|publisher=Animation World Network|accessdate=August 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806012907/http://www.awn.com/articles/people/fred-seibert-interview-part-1|archive-date=August 6, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCartoon Network was able to assess the potential of certain shorts to serve as pilots for spin-off series and signed contracts with their creators to create ongoing series.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/> ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' was the most popular short series according to a vote held in 1995 and eventually became the first [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''What a Cartoon!'' in 1996. Three more series based on shorts debuted from 1997 to 1999: ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'' (the latter two as segments of the same show; ''I Am Weasel'' was later spun off into a separate show), ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', and ''[[Mike, Lu & Og]]''.<ref name=\"Genre4\"/><ref name=\"Seibert\"/><ref name=\"Mike, Lu And Og\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/95956-Mike_Lu_And_Og.html|title=Mike, Lu And Og (1996)&nbsp;\u2013 What A Cartoon!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website. It would later merge with ghostplanet.com as simply \"CartoonNetwork.com\", and featured games, videos, shopping, [[Cartoon Orbit]], which launched in 2000, and even promotions to movies, video games, food items, toys, etc., such as [[Campbell's Soup]], ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', the original ''[[Spy Kids]]'' trilogy, ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|the Cat in the Hat]]'', [[Juicy Drop Pop]], [[Wonder Ball]], ''[[Hot Wheels]]'', and so many more. In addition, CartoonNetwork.com also ran Cartoon Network's first online original series ''Web Premiere Toons'', which mostly featured interactive web cartoons that ran from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea. ''Big Bag'' ran until 1998, and ''Small World'' ran until 2001.\n\nIn 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with [[Time Warner]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Turner To Merge Into Time Warner; A $7.5 Billion Deal|first=Mark|last=Lander|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|date=September 23, 1995|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=July 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513030130/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/23/us/turner-to-merge-into-time-warner-a-7.5-billion-deal.html|archive-date=May 13, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> (ironically, Time Warner's predecessor [[Warner Communications]] had created rival [[Nickelodeon]], now owned by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], in 1977). The merger consolidated ownership of all the Warner Bros. cartoons, allowing the post-July 1948 and the former [[Sunset Productions|Sunset]]-owned black-and-white cartoons (which Warner Bros. had reacquired in the 1960s) releases to be shown on the network. As most of the post-July 1948 cartoons were still contracted to be shown on Nickelodeon and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the network would not air them until September 1999 (from Nickelodeon) and October 2000 (from ABC), however, the majority of the post-July 1948 cartoons that were shown on its now-sibling broadcast network [[The WB]]'s [[Kids' WB]] block began airing on Cartoon Network in January 1997. Newer animated productions by [[Warner Bros.

On April 1, Cartoon Network launched a [[digital cable]] and satellite channel known as [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], which was spun off from one of their programming blocks that featured retro animated series and shorts.\n\nThree new original series premiered in 2001: ''[[Time Squad]]'', ''[[Samurai Jack]]'', and ''[[Grim & Evil]]''. On June 18, [[Betty Cohen]], who had served as Cartoon Network's president since its founding, left due to creative disagreements with [[Jamie Kellner]], then-head of [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]].

By now, nearly all of Cartoon Network's classic programming had been relocated to its sister network [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] to make way for new programming.\n\n2005 saw the debuts of five more original series: ''[[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]]'', ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'', ''[[Robotboy]]'', ''[[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]]'', and ''[[Ben 10 (2005 TV series)|Ben 10]]''.

That show was called ''[[Sunday Pants]]''; it first aired on the day of October 2, 2005. ''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]]. The show was created by Craig \"Sven\" Gordon and Stuart Hill, and was produced at Spitfire Studios. The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.

''Late Night Black and White'' showed early [[black-and-white]] cartoons (mostly from the [[Fleischer Studios]] and [[Walter Lantz]] cartoons from the 1930s, as well as black-and-white Merrie Melodies and MGM cartoons), and ''[[ToonHeads]]'' would show three shorts with a similar theme and provide trivia about the cartoons.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} There was also an afternoon cartoon block called ''[[High Noon Toons]]'', which was hosted by cowboy hand puppets (an example of the simplicity and imagination the network had in its early years). The majority of the classic animation that was shown on Cartoon Network no longer airs on a regular basis, but ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', still aired and lasted until 2017.\n\nA challenge for Cartoon Network was to overcome its low penetration of existing cable systems. When launched on October 1, 1992, the channel was only carried by 233 cable systems. However, it benefited from [[Product bundling|package deals]]. New subscribers to sister channels [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] and [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] could also get access to Cartoon Network through such deals. The high ratings of Cartoon Network over the following couple of years led to more cable systems including it. By the end of 1994, Cartoon Network had become \"the fifth most popular cable channel in the United States\".<ref name=\"Genre\"/>\n\nFor the first few years of Cartoon Network's existence, programming meant for the channel would also be [[simulcast]] on TBS and/or TNT, both of which were still full-service cable networks that carried a variety of different programming genera, in order to increase the shows' (and Cartoon Network's) exposure; examples include ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Cartoon Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'', and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]''.\n\nThe network's first exclusive original show was ''[[The Moxy Show]]'', an animation anthology series first airing in 1993.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Some Fresh Faces to Life|url=https://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|first=Lee|last=Winfrey|date=February 12, 1995|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media]]|accessdate=November 30, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513170405/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-12/features/9502120130_1_world-premiere-toons-powerpuff-girls-cels|archive-date=May 13, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first series produced by Cartoon Network was ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' in 1994, but the show mostly consisted of \"recycled animation cells\" from the archives of Hanna-Barbera, being an ironic [[deconstruction]] of a [[talk show]]. It featured live-action guests, mostly consisting of celebrities which were past their prime or [[counterculture]] figures. A running gag was that the production cost was dubbed \"minimal\". The series found its audience among young adults who appreciated its \"[[Hip (slang)|hip]]\" perspective.<ref name=\"Genre4\">Mittell (2004), p. 82-83</ref>\n\nKevin Sandler considered ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' instrumental in establishing Cartoon Network's appeal to older audiences. [[Space Ghost]], a 1960s [[superhero]] by Hanna-Barbera, was recast as the star of a [[talk show]] spoof. This was arguably the first time the network revived a \"classic animated icon\" in an entirely new context for comedic purposes. Grown-ups who had ceased enjoying the original takes on the characters could find amusement in the \"new ironic and self-referential context\" for them. Promotional shorts such as the \"Scooby-Doo Project\", a parody of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'', gave similar treatments to the Scooby gang.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98-99</ref> However, there were less successful efforts at such revivals. ''[[A Day in the Life of Ranger Smith]]'' and ''[[Boo Boo Runs Wild]]'' (1999) were short cartoons featuring new takes on [[Yogi Bear]]'s supporting cast by [[John Kricfalusi]]. Their style of humor, sexual content and break in tone from the source material was rather out of place among the rest of the Cartoon Network shows, and the network rarely found a place for them in its programming.<ref name=\"Prime Time3\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 100</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanna-Barbera's new division [[Cartoon Network Studios]] was founded and started production on ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons'' and ''Cartoon Cartoons''). This show debuted in 1995, offering original animated shorts commissioned from Hanna-Barbera and various independent animators. The network promoted the series as an attempt to return to the \"classic days\" of studio animation, offering full animator control, high budgets, and no [[limited animation]]. The project was spearheaded by Cartoon Network executives, plus [[John Kricfalusi]] and [[Fred Seibert]]. Kricfalusi was the creator of  ''[[The Ren & Stimpy Show]]'' and served as an advisor to the network, while Seibert was formerly one of the driving forces behind Nickelodeon's [[Nicktoons]] and would go on to produce the similar animation anthology series ''[[Oh Yeah!

[[Linda Simensky]], vice president of original animation, reminded adults and teenage girls that cartoons could appeal to them as well. Kevin Sandler's article of them claimed that these cartoons were both less \"[[Ribaldry|bawdy]]\" than their counterparts at [[Comedy Central]] and less \"[[Social responsibility|socially responsible]]\" than their counterparts at [[Nickelodeon]]. Sandler pointed to the whimsical rebelliousness, high rate of exaggeration and self-consciousness of the overall output each individual series managed.<ref name=\"Prime Time2\"/>\n\nIn 1995, Cartoon Network launched \"Cartoon Network Online\" as an [[AOL|America Online]] exclusive website. It would later merge with ghostplanet.com as simply \"CartoonNetwork.com\", and featured games, videos, shopping, [[Cartoon Orbit]], which launched in 2000, and even promotions to movies, video games, food items, toys, etc., such as [[Campbell's Soup]], ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', the original ''[[Spy Kids]]'' trilogy, ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|the Cat in the Hat]]'', [[Juicy Drop Pop]], [[Wonder Ball]], ''[[Hot Wheels]]'', and so many more. In addition, CartoonNetwork.com also ran Cartoon Network's first online original series ''Web Premiere Toons'', which mostly featured interactive web cartoons that ran from 1999 to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, Cartoon Network decided to air preschool programming and air them every Sunday morning, such as hiring [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the makers of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' on [[PBS Kids]], to make a show called ''[[Big Bag]]'', a live-action/puppet television program targeted at pre-school viewers, as well as ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', a children's animated anthology show and variety show, in which showcased featured several segments from animated TV programs aimed at preschoolers from several countries around the world except for Japan, China, and Korea.

''Sunday Pants'' varies on different types of animation, from traditional hand-drawn animation to Flash, or even CGI, possibly making it similar to other shows such as ''[[Liquid Television]]'' on [[MTV]] or ''[[KaBlam!]]'' on [[Nickelodeon]].

The show has a similar concept to ''What a Cartoon!'', except that the shorts are 1\u20133 minutes long and the show is squeezed to be 23 minutes (without commercials). There are animated and live-action intervals in-between shorts. The live-action ones are performed by American band The Slacks, while the animated ones are animated by WeFail.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'', ''[[Power Players]]'', ''[[Total DramaRama]]'', ''[[DC Super Hero Girls (TV series)|DC Super Hero Girls]]'' and ''[[Unikitty!]]''. In the past, Cartoon Network has also produced live-action programming, such as the live-action/animated hybrids ''[[Out of Jimmy's Head]]'' and ''[[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange]]'', and shows such as ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'', ''[[Tower Prep]],'' and ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.\n\nIn addition, Cartoon Network reruns various ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, which have been in constant rotation from the network's launch in 1992 until 2017. In its early days, Cartoon Network benefited from having access to a large collection of animated programming, including the libraries of [[Warner Bros.]] (''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]''), [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' and other series), and [[Hanna-Barbera]] (''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Snorks]]'', and others). Turner's ownership of Hanna-Barbera gave the network access to an established animation studio, something chief rival Nickelodeon did not yet have.<ref name=\"Prime Time\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 98</ref> Most of these series were removed by 1999 and moved to Boomerang in 2000.\n\n===Original series===\n{{see also|Cartoon Cartoons}}\nMuch of Cartoon Network's original programming originates from the network's in-house studio, [[Cartoon Network Studios]]. Beginning as a division of [[Hanna-Barbera]], this studio would produce some of the network's earliest original series, including ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', ''[[Cow and Chicken]]'', ''[[I Am Weasel]]'', ''[[Johnny Bravo]]'', and ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. '''Cartoon Cartoons''' was once the branding for Cartoon Network's original [[animation|animated]] [[television show|television series]], but it has seldom been used by the network by 2003. The name was eventually discontinued in 2008.\n\n===Programming blocks===\nBy the early 2000s, Cartoon Network had established programming blocks aimed at different age demographics. The shows broadcast during the early morning had [[preschool]]ers as their target audience and mostly had [[prosocial behavior]] as a theme. The [[Toonami]] programming block, featured later in the day, mostly included anime shows and its target audience was [[preadolescence|tweens]] and [[Adolescence|teenagers]]. [[Prime time]] shows mostly included classic cartoons, featured as part of ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[The Chuck Jones Show]]'' and ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]''. Preschool programming was discontinued by 2007.\n\n===Current programming blocks===\n'''''[[Adult Swim]]''''' \u2013 A night time program block aimed at young adults, which airs content that is not suitable for children. It does not feature any advertising for Cartoon Network programming and, due to its long runtime and different demographics, is branded as a separate channel. Adult Swim airs a mix of live-action and animated comedies, including both original series such as ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' and ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', as well as acquired programming like [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] shows and Japanese [[anime]], aired under the [[Toonami]] branding since May 2012, every Saturday night. Adult Swim is currently  broadcast daily from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/schedule|title=On-Air Schedule - Adult Swim|website=www.adultswim.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181103072509/https://www.adultswim.com/schedule/|archive-date=November 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> ET/PT; its starting time has changed various times, from 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. and to 8:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==Marketing==\nCartoon Network shows with established fan followings, such as ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', allowed the network to pursue licensing agreements with companies interested in selling series-related merchandise. For example, agreements with [[Kraft Foods]] led to widespread in-store advertising for Cartoon Network-related products. The network also worked on cross-promotion campaigns with both Kraft and [[Tower Records]]. In product development and marketing, the network has benefited from its relation to corporate parent [[Time Warner]], allowing for mutually beneficial relationships with various subsidiary companies.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 101-102</ref>\n\n[[Time Warner Cable]], the former cable television subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2009), distributes Cartoon Network as part of its packages. [[Turner Broadcasting System]], the subsidiary overseeing various Time Warner-owned networks, helped cross-promote Cartoon Network shows and at times arranged for swapping certain shows between the networks. For example, ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'', one of CN's original shows, was at times seen at [[Kids' WB]] (which was discontinued on May 24, 2008), while ''[[Xiaolin Showdown]]'' and ''[[\u00a1Mucha Lucha!]]'',two of Kids' WB!'s original shows, were seen at Cartoon Network. In each case, the swap intended to cultivate a shared audience for the two networks. [[Time Inc.]], the former subsidiary overseeing the magazines of the corporate parent, ensured favorable coverage of Cartoon Network and advertising space across its publications. Printed advertisements for CN shows could appear in magazines such as ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and ''[[Sports Illustrated Kids]]'' until Time Inc. was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner on June 9, 2014. [[AOL]], a now-former sibling company to Time Warner covering Internet services, helped promote Cartoon Network shows online by offering exclusive content for certain animated series, online [[sweepstakes]] and [[display advertising]] for CN.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n[[Warner Home Video]], the home video subsidiary, distributed VHS tapes, DVDs and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s featuring Cartoon Network shows. Select [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]] VHS releases came with bonus cartoons from Cartoon Network. [[Rhino Entertainment]], the former record label subsidiary of the corporate parent (which was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] from Time Warner in 2004), distributed cassette tapes and CDs with Cartoon Network-related music. These products were also available through the [[Warner Bros. Studio Store]]. [[DC Comics]], the comic book subsidiary, published a series featuring the Powerpuff Girls, indicating it could handle other CN-related characters. [[Warner Bros.]], the film studio subsidiary, released ''[[The Powerpuff Girls Movie]]'' in 2002. Kevin Sandler considered it likely that this film would find its way to [[HBO]] or [[Cinemax]], two television network subsidiaries which regularly broadcast feature films. Sandler also viewed book [[tie-in]]s through [[Warner Books]] as likely, since it was the only area of marketing not covered yet by 2001.<ref name=\"Prime Time5\"/>\n\n==Editing of ''Looney Tunes'' and ''Merrie Melodies'' shorts==\nCartoon Network has, during its history, broadcast most of the [[Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies filmography|Warner Bros. animated shorts]] originally created between the 1920s and the 1960s, but the network edited out scenes depicting discharge of gunfire, alcohol ingestion, cowboys and Indians gags, tobacco, and politically incorrect humor. The unedited versions were kept from both broadcasting and wide release on the video market. ''[[Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs]]'' (1943), a politically incorrect but critically well-regarded short, was notably omitted entirely, while ''[[The Scarlet Pumpernickel]]'' (1950) and ''[[Feed the Kitty]]'' (1952), both well-regarded, had their finales heavily edited due to violence.<ref name=\"Prime Time6\">Stabile, Harrison (2003), p. 105-107</ref>\n\nThere was media attention in June 2001 over a network decision concerning further omissions from broadcasting. Cartoon Network formerly scheduled a 49-hour-long marathon annually known as ''June Bugs'', promising to broadcast every [[List of Bugs Bunny cartoons|Bugs Bunny animated short]] in chronological order. The network originally intended to include 12 shorts for its 2001 airing of the marathon (one of them part of the [[Censored Eleven]] list of ''Merrie Melodies'' and ''Looney Tunes'' cartoons effectively shelved from distribution) that had become controversial for using [[ethnic and national stereotypes]], albeit broadcasting them past midnight to ensure few children were watching, with introductions concerning their historic value as representatives of another time. The network's corporate parent considered it likely that there would be complaints concerning racial insensitivity. This led to all 12 being omitted in their entirety. Laurie Goldberg, vice-president of public relations, defended the decision, stating, \"We're the leader in animation, but we're also one of the top-rated general entertainment networks. There are certain responsibilities that come with that\".<ref name=\"Prime Time6\"/>\n\n==Related projects==\n\n===Adult Swim===\n{{Main|Adult Swim}}\n\nAdult Swim (often stylized as [adult swim] or [as]) is a teen/adult-oriented nighttime programming service that airs on Cartoon Network from usually 8:00 PM to 6:00 AM [[Eastern time|ET]]/[[Pacific time|PT]] everyday in the United States, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]; Adult Swim is treated by [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] as a separate network in its ratings reports (similar to the company's ratings treatment of [[Nickelodeon]], [[Nick at Nite]] and the now-defunct [[Nickmom]]) due to differing target demographics between it and Cartoon Network.<ref name=\"as_split\"/> The network features myriad stylistically variable animated and live-action shows, including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] shows mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content. The programs featured on Adult Swim are geared toward a mature audience, in contrast to the originally all-ages young teen and preteen daytime programming on Cartoon Network. Adult Swim moved its start time up an hour at 8pm on March 31, 2014. The 8pm hour was given back to Cartoon Network on numerous occasions, however, which used it to premiere ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Adventure Time: Stakes]]'' in 2015, new episodes of the [[Regular Show (season 8)|eighth season]] of ''[[Regular Show]]'' in 2016, new episodes of the [[The Amazing World of Gumball (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[The Amazing World of Gumball]]'' in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/2019/11/20/steven-universe-future-official-trailer |title=Steven Universe Future Releases First Official Trailer |work=ComicBook.com |first=Rollin |last=Bishop |date=November 20, 2019 |accessdate=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Toonami===\n{{Main|Toonami}}\nToonami (a portmanteau of \"cartoon\" and \"[[tsunami]]\", suggesting a \"tidal wave\" of animated cartoons) is a brand of Cartoon Network, used initially for action-oriented programming blocks on Cartoon Network television channels worldwide, mostly showing American cartoons and Japanese anime, originating in the United States on March 17, 1997, and ending on September 20, 2008. It was revived on May 26, 2012, as a Saturday night anime block on Adult Swim, reclaiming their Saturday anime lineup, similar to its previous mature-geared \"Midnight Run\" incarnation which was that block's forerunner. The host was a muscular teenage robot named TOM, voiced by [[Steven Blum]].\n\nThe Toonami brand was subsequently used in the United Kingdom as the name of an action-oriented animation channel with two CGI hosts. It replaced a former Cartoon Network-owned channel, CNX, which had been a Toonami/live-action hybrid network.\n\nToonami was launched as a 24-hour channel in [[Toonami (Southeast Asia)|Asia]] in December 2012, in [[Toonami (India)|India]] in February 2015 and in [[Toonami (France)|France]] in February 2016. \"It really is the ultimate home of the action hero,\" said Sunny Saha from Turner International.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|title=Indian Television Dot Com&nbsp;\u2014 Toonami to launch in Hong Kong on 1 December|author=Anil Wanvari|work=indiantelevision.com|access-date=July 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701085333/http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k12/nov/nov211.php|archive-date=July 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Boomerang===\n{{Main|Boomerang (TV network)}}\nBoomerang began as a programming block on Cartoon Network on December 8, 1992, and continued until October 2004, aimed towards the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boom]] generation.
