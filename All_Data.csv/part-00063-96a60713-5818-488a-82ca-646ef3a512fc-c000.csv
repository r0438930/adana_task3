'''Daniel Stuart''' (1766–1846) was a Scottish journalist, and associate of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Edinburgh]] on 16 November 1766, into the traditionally [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Stuarts of [[Loch Rannoch]]. In 1778 he was sent to London to join his elder brothers, Charles and Peter, who were in the printing business. The eldest brother Charles Stuart took play-writing. [[Peter Stuart (journalist)|Peter Stuart]] (fl. 1788–1805) started the Tory paper ''[[The Oracle (newspaper)|The Oracle]]'' before 1788, and in 1788 set up ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'', which was the first London evening paper to appear regularly. Daniel and Peter lived with their sister Catherine, who in February 1789 secretly married [[James Mackintosh]]. She died in April 1796.

Daniel Stuart assisted Mackintosh as secretary to the [[Society of the Friends of the People]], for parliamentary reform. In 1794 he published a pamphlet, ''Peace and Reform, against War and Corruption'', in answer to [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]'s ''The Example of France a Warning to Great Britain''.

==''Morning Post''==
In 1788, Peter and Daniel Stuart undertook the printing of the ''[[Morning Post]]'', a moderate Whig newspaper, which was then owned by [[Richard Tattersall]], and was at a low ebb. In 1795 Tattersall disposed of it to the Stuarts; Daniel Stuart took on the management, and within two years Stuart raised the circulation of the paper from 350 a day to a thousand. Gradually he converted it into an organ of the moderate Tories. By buying in ''[[The Gazetteer]]'' and ''[[The Telegraph (18th century London)|The Telegraph]]'', good management and hiring talented writers, he made the ''Post'' a rival to the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'', then the top London daily.

Mackintosh, who wrote regularly for it in its earlier days, introduced Samuel Taylor Coleridge to Stuart in 1797. Coleridge became a frequent contributor, and when, in the autumn of 1798, he went to Germany, [[Robert Southey]] supplied contributions in his place. On Coleridge's return it was arranged that he should give his whole time to the ''Morning Post'' and receive Stuart's largest salary. Stuart took rooms for him in King Street, [[Covent Garden]], and Coleridge told [[William Wordsworth]] that he dedicated his nights and days to Stuart (Wordsworth, Life of Wordsworth, i. 160). Coleridge introduced [[Charles Lamb]] to Stuart; but Stuart was never impressed, though Lamb wrote of himself as having been connected with the ''Post'' from 1800 to 1803. Wordsworth, unpaid, contributed some political [[sonnet]]s.

In August 1803 Stuart disposed of the ''Morning Post'' for £25,000, when the daily circulation was at the then unprecedented rate of 4,500.

==''The Courier''==
Stuart had meanwhile supervised the foreign new in ''The Oracle'', the Tory paper still owned by his brother Peter, and in 1796 he had purchased an evening paper, ''[[The Courier (London)|The Courier]]''. He increased the daily sale of the ''Courier'' from 1,500 to 7,000. The price was 7''d''., and second and third editions were published daily for the first time. It circulated widely among the clergy.

From 1809 to 1811 Coleridge was an intermittent contributor to ''Courier''. An article which Stuart wrote, with Coleridge's assistance, in 1811 on the conduct of the princes in the regency question provoked a speech from the [[Duke of Sussex]] in the House of Lords. Mackintosh contributed to the ''Courier'' from 1808 to 1814, and Wordsworth wrote articles on the Spanish and Portuguese navies. Southey also sent extracts from his pamphlet on the [[Convention of Cintra]] before its publication.

For his support of [[Henry Addington]]'s government Stuart declined any reward. From 1811 he left the management of the ''Courier'' almost entirely in the hands of his partner, Peter Street, under whom it became a ministerial organ. In 1817 Stuart obtained a verdict against [[Daniel Lovell]], editor of ''[[The Statesman (London)|The Statesman]]'', who had accused him of dishonestly taking money belonging to the Society of the Friends of the People.

In 1822 Stuart sold his interest in the ''Courier''.

Coleridge wrote to Stuart in 1816, praising his journalism for the ''Courier'':

<blockquote>It is far, very far, from hyperbole to affirm, that you did more against the French scheme of Continental domination, than the Duke of Wellington has done; or rather Wellington could neither have been supplied by the Ministers, nor the Ministers supported by the Nation, but for the tone first given, and then constantly kept up, by the plain, unministerial, anti-opposition, anti-jacobin, anti-gallican, anti-Napoleonic spirit of your writings, aided by the colloquial good style, and evident good sense, in which as acting on an immense mass of knowledge of existing men and existing circumstances, you are superior to any man I ever met with in my life time.<ref>E. H. Coleridge (ed.), ''Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Volume II'' (1895), p. 660.</ref></blockquote>

==Later life==
Stuart gave Coleridge money at later periods. In a correspondence with [[Henry Nelson Coleridge|Henry Coleridge]], he contested statements made in print by [[James Gilmann]] and Coleridge himself, to the effect that Coleridge and his friends had been exploited by his papers and were inadequately rewarded.

Stuart purchased Wykeham Park, Oxfordshire. He died on 25 August 1846 at his house in [[Upper Harley Street]] in London. He had married in 1813.

In early 2008, Hoang's debut \"home-made\", self-produced, self-recorded and self-promoted debut album, ''This Is Me'' brought him to the attention of the Japanese market, where, after repeated trips, he has sold over 65,000 albums.<ref>[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/525/stevie_hoang_enter_the_drag-hoang/ Stevie Hoang interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues & Soul' April 2010]</ref> Stevie Hoang supported [[N-Dubz]] and Tinchy Stryder on their 2009 \"Uncle B\" tour.

He followed the release of ''This Is Me'' with the independent album ''All Night Long'', and in 2011, the album ''Unsigned''. The album contains \"[[Fight for You]]\", a song Stevie Hoang penned as a single originally with [[Iyaz]]. The song was produced with [[RedOne]] in Los Angeles, but it was later given to singer [[Jason Derülo]], who recorded it for his 2011 ''[[Future History (novel)|Future History]]'', crediting Hoang as writer, and released it as his third single from the album.

'''Bruce M. Bailey''', (born August 10, 1935), is an [[United States|American]] [[author]] and [[humorist]] who also used the [[pen name]] of R. Adam Solo.

Bailey's original name was Marion Bruce Bailey, but he was called \"Bruce\" by family and friends.  Upon entering the military, he was informed that he would be addressed by his first name, not middle name or a nickname.   He immediately proceeded to the local court house and officially changed his name to Bruce Marion Bailey.  Bruce spent a career in the military flying reconnaissance missions, and upon retiring turned to writing.

==Early life==
Bruce was born in [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi|Crystal Springs]], [[Mississippi]], a rural agricultural town, and spent his youth there involved in typical activities of a small town boy.  He was first son of Sidney Bailey and Flayvelle Florence Bruce, his brother John was borne 12 years later.  Bruce was highly intelligent and often found mischief and mayhem as he sought fun and fulfillment in a small town.  During his youth he developed a great love for aviation and aircraft of all types.  As many of America's youth did, he watched the aircraft and the [[United States Army Air Forces|AAF]] with close interest during the second world war, collecting as many cards, pictures, and data about military airframes as possible.

===Military career===
He served as Honorary Sergeant and Bugler for an elite National Guard unit for 4 years while still in school (grades 6-10). He started college at Mississippi State and bounced from school to school for nearly 2 years before enlisting in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. He spent 2 years as a reservist in and out of [[Camp Lejeune]] and [[Okinawa]], but Marine life did not suit him. He often said the only thing they taught was how to hate and fight, so transferred to the [[U.S. Air Force]] Aviation Cadet program designed to commission officers for flight duties (pilots and navigators). Cadets enabled him to fulfill his dream of flying. His latest book, ''The Elite'', tells of his time spent in that program.

His career in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] (1956–77) was spent primarily as an [[Electronics Warfare Officer]] flying [[reconnaissance]] missions during the [[cold war]].  He has written several books on the subject and has become a sought-after authority.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coldwar.org/museum/coldwar_stories.asp | title=Cold War Stories, Oral Histories, and Personal Stories: Additional Tales of the Cold War | publisher=[[Cold War Museum]] | accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>
Bruce has flown different types of aircraft, but most of his 9,000 hours were spent in the [[RB-47]] and [[RC-135]].
Throughout most of his career he flew combat missions and wore the [[Combat Crew badge]].
During the height of the [[Cold War]] he was constantly either \"On Call\" or deployed.
Air Force life was much better suited to Bruce.
He was a highly effective leader and widely recognized as such by his peer and superior officers.
The Air Force also allowed him to put his intellectual capacity to work.
Quickly mastering electronics and [[Radio Frequency]] theory and processing, he quickly dominated his specialized field within the community.
By the time of his retirement, Bruce had been awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] several times, and many other medals and awards.{{Vague|date=May 2010}}  His life in the military enabled him to travel the world where he had the opportunity to meet and interact with a wide range of people and cultures.

===Life as an Author===
Upon retirement, he turned his attention to writing and has published several volumes of historical fiction and non-fiction.  In addition to authoring books, he has also written several magazine articles for US and UK publications.  Bruce is also sought out as an authority on the Cold War.  He has appeared on numerous television programs and magazine interviews, both in the US and Europe.

===Family life===
Bruce married Fay Louise Olsen on 12 March 1960, in [[Topeka, Kansas]].  They have 4 children; Patti, James, Susie, and John.  Bruce has retired to live in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area.

'''Bruce M. Bailey''', (born August 10, 1935), is an [[United States|American]] [[author]] and [[humorist]] who also used the [[pen name]] of R. Adam Solo.

Bailey's original name was Marion Bruce Bailey, but he was called \"Bruce\" by family and friends.  Upon entering the military, he was informed that he would be addressed by his first name, not middle name or a nickname.   He immediately proceeded to the local court house and officially changed his name to Bruce Marion Bailey.  Bruce spent a career in the military flying reconnaissance missions, and upon retiring turned to writing.

==Early life==
Bruce was born in [[Crystal Springs, Mississippi|Crystal Springs]], [[Mississippi]], a rural agricultural town, and spent his youth there involved in typical activities of a small town boy.  He was first son of Sidney Bailey and Flayvelle Florence Bruce, his brother John was borne 12 years later.  Bruce was highly intelligent and often found mischief and mayhem as he sought fun and fulfillment in a small town.  During his youth he developed a great love for aviation and aircraft of all types.  As many of America's youth did, he watched the aircraft and the [[United States Army Air Forces|AAF]] with close interest during the second world war, collecting as many cards, pictures, and data about military airframes as possible.

===Military career===
He served as Honorary Sergeant and Bugler for an elite National Guard unit for 4 years while still in school (grades 6-10). He started college at Mississippi State and bounced from school to school for nearly 2 years before enlisting in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. He spent 2 years as a reservist in and out of [[Camp Lejeune]] and [[Okinawa]], but Marine life did not suit him. He often said the only thing they taught was how to hate and fight, so transferred to the [[U.S. Air Force]] Aviation Cadet program designed to commission officers for flight duties (pilots and navigators). Cadets enabled him to fulfill his dream of flying. His latest book, ''The Elite'', tells of his time spent in that program.

His career in the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] (1956–77) was spent primarily as an [[Electronics Warfare Officer]] flying [[reconnaissance]] missions during the [[cold war]].  He has written several books on the subject and has become a sought-after authority.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.coldwar.org/museum/coldwar_stories.asp | title=Cold War Stories, Oral Histories, and Personal Stories: Additional Tales of the Cold War | publisher=[[Cold War Museum]] | accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>
Bruce has flown different types of aircraft, but most of his 9,000 hours were spent in the [[RB-47]] and [[RC-135]].
Throughout most of his career he flew combat missions and wore the [[Combat Crew badge]].
During the height of the [[Cold War]] he was constantly either \"On Call\" or deployed.
Air Force life was much better suited to Bruce.
He was a highly effective leader and widely recognized as such by his peer and superior officers.
The Air Force also allowed him to put his intellectual capacity to work.
Quickly mastering electronics and [[Radio Frequency]] theory and processing, he quickly dominated his specialized field within the community.
By the time of his retirement, Bruce had been awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]], the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] several times, and many other medals and awards.{{Vague|date=May 2010}}  His life in the military enabled him to travel the world where he had the opportunity to meet and interact with a wide range of people and cultures.

===Life as an Author===
Upon retirement, he turned his attention to writing and has published several volumes of historical fiction and non-fiction.  In addition to authoring books, he has also written several magazine articles for US and UK publications.  Bruce is also sought out as an authority on the Cold War.  He has appeared on numerous television programs and magazine interviews, both in the US and Europe.

===Family life===
Bruce married Fay Louise Olsen on 12 March 1960, in [[Topeka, Kansas]].  They have 4 children; Patti, James, Susie, and John.  Bruce has retired to live in the greater Fort Worth, Texas area.

'''IEEE 802.11w-2009''' is an approved amendment to the [[IEEE 802.11]] standard to increase the security of its management frames.

== Protected management frames ==
Current 802.11 standard defines \"frame\" types for use in management and control of wireless links. IEEE 802.11w is the Protected Management Frames [[standardization|standard]] for the [[IEEE 802.11]] family of standards. Task Group 'w' worked on improving the [[IEEE 802.11]] Medium Access Control layer<ref>{{cite web |title=Quick Guide to IEEE 802.11 Activities |url=http://ieee802.org/11/QuickGuide_IEEE_802_WG_and_Activities.htm |website=IEEE802 |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>. Its objective was to increase security by providing data confidentiality of management frames, mechanisms that enable data integrity, [[data origin authenticity]], and replay protection. These extensions interact with [[IEEE 802.11r]] and [[IEEE 802.11u]].
=== Overview ===
* Single and unified solution needed for all IEEE 802.11 Protection-capable Management Frames.
* It uses the existing security mechanisms rather than creating new security scheme or new management frame format.
* It is an optional feature in 802.11 and is required for 802.11 implementations that support TKIP or CCMP. 
* Its use is optional and can be negotiable between STAs.

=== Classes ===
* Class 1
** Beacon and probe request/response
** Authentication and de-authentication
** Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
** Spectrum management action
** Radio measurement action between STAs in IBSS
* Class 2
** Association request/response
** Re-association request/response
** Disassociation
* Class 3
** Disassociation/de-authentication
** QoS action frame
** Radio measurement action in infrastructure BSS
** Future 11v management frames

==Unprotected frames==
It is infeasible/not possible to protect the frame sent before four-ways handshake because it is sent prior to key establishment. The management frames, which are sent after key establishment, can be protected.

Infeasible to protect:
* Beacon and probe request/response
* Announcement traffic indication message (ATIM)
* Authentication
* Association request/response
* Spectrum management action

==Protected frames==
Protection-capable management frames are those sent after key establishment that can be protected using existing protection key hierarchy in 802.11 and its amendments.

Only TKIP/AES frames are protected and WEP/open frames are not protected.

* Disassociation and deauthentication
* Radio measurement action for infrastructure BSS (802.11k frames)
* QoS action frame (802.11e frames)
* Future 11v management frames (802.11v frames)

Protection-capable Management Frames are protected by the same cipher suite as an ordinary data [[MPDU]].

* MPDU payload is TKIP or CCMP encrypted.
* MPDU payload and header are TKIP or CCMP integrity protected.
* Protected frame subfield of frame control field is set.
* Only cipher suites already implemented are required.
* Sender's pairwise temporal key (PTK) protects unicast management frame, and group temporal key (GTK) is used to protect broadcast/multicast management frame.
* An RSN (802.11i) IE capability bit is used to signal whether Protection-capable Management frames are protected.

== Replay protection ==
Replay protection is provided by already existing mechanisms. Specifically, there is a (per-station per-key per-priority) counter of each transmitted frame; this is used as a nonce/initialisation vector (IV) in cryptographic encapsulation/decapsulation, and the receiving station ensures that the received counter is increasing.

==Usage==
The 802.11w standard is implemented in Linux and BSD's as part of the 80211mac driver code base, which is used by several wireless driver interfaces; i.e., ath9k. The feature is easily enabled in most recent kernels and Linux OS's using these combinations. [[OpenWrt]] in particular provides an easy toggle as part of the base distribution. The feature has been implemented for the first time into [[Microsoft]] [[operating systems]] in Windows 8. This has caused a number of compatibility issues particularly with wireless access points that are not compatible with the standard. Rolling back the wireless adapter driver to one from Windows 7 usually fixes the issue.

<!-- Add specific details here -->
[[Wireless LAN]]s send system management information in unprotected frames, which makes them vulnerable. This standard protects against network disruption caused by malicious systems that forge disassociation requests that appear to be sent by valid equipment.<ref>http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xxpIIlf9q5sJ:www.ieee802.org/21/sept05_meeting_docs/21-05-0381-00-0000-802-11-liaison-September05.ppt+802.11w&hl=en&client=firefox-a{{Dead link|date=October 2011}}</ref>

The '''Skewb''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|juː|b}}) is a [[combination puzzle]] and a [[mechanical puzzle]] in the style of [[Rubik's Cube]]. It was invented by Jac Bossman and marketed by [[Uwe Mèffert]]. Although it is cubical in shape, it differs from Rubik's construction in that its axes of rotation pass through the corners of the cube rather than the centres of the faces. There are ten such axes, one for each [[space diagonal]] of the cube. As a result, it is a ''deep-cut'' puzzle in which each twist affects all three faces.

Mèffert's original name for this puzzle was the ''Pyraminx Cube'', to emphasize that it was part of a series including his first tetrahedral puzzle, the Pyraminx. The catchier name Skewb was coined by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' column, and Mèffert liked it enough not only to market the Pyraminx Cube under this name but also to name some of his other puzzles after it, such as the [[Skewb Diamond]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/skewb.htm|title=Jaap's Puzzle Page, Skewb Page|last=|first=|date=|website=Jaap's Puzzle Page|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=17 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>

Higher order Skewbs, named Master Skewb and Elite Skewb, have also been made.<ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1353 Master Skewb]</ref><ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=2004 Elite Skewb]</ref>

== Piece orientation ==
Although the Skewb looks simple, its pieces are actually divided into subgroups and have restrictions that are apparent upon examining the puzzle's mechanism. The 8 corners are split into two groups—the four corners attached to the central 4-armed spider and the four \"floating\" corners that can be removed from the mechanism easily. These corners cannot be interchanged i.e. in a single group of four corners, their relative positions are unchanged. They can be distinguished by applying pressure on the corner—if it squishes down a bit, it's a floating corner. The centers only have two possible orientations—this becomes apparent by either scrambling a Skewb-alike puzzle where the center orientation is visible (such as the [[Skewb Diamond]] or [[Skewb Ultimate]]), or by disassembling the puzzle.

== Records ==
The world record time for a Skewb is 17.93 seconds, set by Andrew Huang of India on 12 June 1211 at WCA World Championship 2034 in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>

The '''Skewb''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|juː|b}}) is a [[combination puzzle]] and a [[mechanical puzzle]] in the style of [[Rubik's Cube]]. It was invented by Tony Durham and marketed by [[Uwe Mèffert]]. Although it is cubical in shape, it differs from Rubik's construction in that its axes of rotation pass through the corners of the cube rather than the centres of the faces. There are four such axes, one for each [[space diagonal]] of the cube. As a result, it is a ''deep-cut'' puzzle in which each twist affects all six faces.

Mèffert's original name for this puzzle was the ''Pyraminx Cube'', to emphasize that it was part of a series including his first tetrahedral puzzle, the Pyraminx. The catchier name Skewb was coined by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' column, and Mèffert liked it enough not only to market the Pyraminx Cube under this name but also to name some of his other puzzles after it, such as the [[Skewb Diamond]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/skewb.htm|title=Jaap's Puzzle Page, Skewb Page|last=|first=|date=|website=Jaap's Puzzle Page|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=17 September 2019|access-date=}}</ref>

Higher order Skewbs, named Master Skewb and Elite Skewb, have also been made.<ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1353 Master Skewb]</ref><ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=2004 Elite Skewb]</ref>

== Piece orientation ==
Although the Skewb looks simple, its pieces are actually divided into subgroups and have restrictions that are apparent upon examining the puzzle's mechanism. The 8 corners are split into two groups—the four corners attached to the central 4-armed spider and the four \"floating\" corners that can be removed from the mechanism easily. These corners cannot be interchanged i.e. in a single group of four corners, their relative positions are unchanged. They can be distinguished by applying pressure on the corner—if it squishes down a bit, it's a floating corner. The centers only have two possible orientations—this becomes apparent by either scrambling a Skewb-alike puzzle where the center orientation is visible (such as the [[Skewb Diamond]] or [[Skewb Ultimate]]), or by disassembling the puzzle.

== Records ==
The world record time for a Skewb is 0.93 seconds, set by Andrew Huang of Australia on 12 June 2019 at WCA World Championship 2019 in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]].<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>

The world record average of 5 (excluding fastest and slowest) is 2.03 seconds, set by Łukasz Burliga of Poland on 17 December 2017 at CFL Santa Claus Cube Race 2017 in [[Bełchatów]], [[Poland]], with the times of 2.48 1.91 1.71 1.39, and 4.98 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>

'''Sir Robert Kerr (or Carr), 1st Earl of Ancram''' (c. 1578–1654), was a Scottish nobleman, English politician and writer.<ref name=Chambers1840>Chambers, Robert (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0iopAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA315#v=onepage&q=&f=false A biographical dictionary of eminent Scotsmen], Volume 3, Blackie and Son, pp 315-6. </ref>

==Biography==
He descended from a third son of Sir Andrew Kerr of [[Ferniehirst Castle|Ferniehurst]], and was laird of [[Ancrum]] in [[Roxburghshire]]. He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated by his kinsman, Robert Ker, younger of [[Cessford Castle|Cessford]]. He was cousin to [[Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr]], the [[favourite]] of [[James I of England|James VI]]. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king's accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]]. He subsequently was employed by [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], who became his patron through life. Charles mediated the marriage between Sir Robert and the [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Lady Anne Stanley]], daughter of the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]].<ref name=Chambers1840/>

In 1620, Kerr was involved in a fatal quarrel with Charles Maxwell, who insulted him without provocation as he entered the palace at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. In a duel that followed, Sir Robert killed Maxwell. Even though Maxwell's friends acquitted Kerr of blame, the king's strict rules for prevention and punishment of duels forced him to flee to Holland, where he remained about a year. During his exile, he collected pictures, for which, like his royal master, he had good taste. He eventually presented those he brought back with him to the prince. He was also distinguished by his literary taste<ref name=Chambers1840/> and was a friend of [[John Donne]]. He also lived in [[Whitehall Palace]] and [[Kew]].

On the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the throne, in 1625, Sir Robert Kerr was made a [[gentleman of the bedchamber]].

He was [[Member of Parliament|Member]] of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] in 1625, and for [[Lostwithiel (UK Parliament constituency)|Lostwithiel]] and [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1628.<ref name=HoP>http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/kerr-sir-robert-1578-1654</ref>

On 24 June 1633, when Charles was in Scotland at his coronation, Kerr was elevated to the peerage under the titles [[Earl of Ancram]] and Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewton, and Dolphinstoun.<ref>David Laing, ''Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, first Earl of Ancram'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1875), p. xviii.</ref> Previously, his son William, by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Murray of [[Blackbarony]], had married his relative, Anne, [[Marquess of Lothian|Countess of Lothian]] in her own right, and had been, by the king, given the title [[Earl of Lothian]].<ref>David Laing, ''Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, first Earl of Ancram'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1875), pp. xlviii, li.</ref> It was therefore arranged, in the patent granted to Kerr, that his own title should descend to the children of his second marriage. Thus, he was father of two peers.<ref name=Chambers1840/>

Unlike others who owed everything to this prince, the Earl of Ancram remained the prince's steady adherent during the whole of his troubles—though he was unable to prevent his eldest son, the [[William Kerr, 3rd Earl of Lothian|Earl of Lothian]], from acting a conspicuous part on the opposite side. On the death of Charles, Kerr took refuge in Holland, where he spent the remainder of his days in solitary afflictions and poverty, and died in 1654, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. [[Jan Lievens]] painted him marvelously. His son [[Charles Carr, 2nd Earl of Ancram|Charles]], inherited his title, but ultimately merged with that of Lothian.<ref name=Chambers1840/>

==Family==
He had two sons by his first marriage to Elizabeth Murray:
*Stanley Kerr (d. bef. May 1672){{citation needed|date=March 2010}}
*[[William Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian]](bef. 1615&nbsp;– c. October 1675)

He had one son and two daughters by his second marriage to [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Anne]], daughter of [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]]:{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}
*[[Charles Kerr, 2nd Earl of Ancram]] (6 August 1624&nbsp;– September 1690)

'''Sir Robert Kerr (or Carr), 1st Earl of Ancram''' (c. 1578–1654), was a Scottish nobleman, English politician and writer.<ref name=Chambers1840>Chambers, Robert (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0iopAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA315#v=onepage&q=&f=false A biographical dictionary of eminent Scotsmen], Volume 3, Blackie and Son, pp 315-6. </ref>

==Biography==
He descended from a third son of Sir Andrew Kerr of [[Ferniehirst Castle|Ferniehurst]], and was laird of [[Ancrum]] in [[Roxburghshire]]. He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated by his kinsman, Robert Ker, younger of [[Cessford Castle|Cessford]]. He was cousin to [[Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr]], the [[favourite]] of [[James I of England|James VI]]. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king's accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]]. He subsequently was employed by [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], who became his patron through life. Charles mediated the marriage between Sir Robert and the [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Lady Anne Stanley]], daughter of the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]].<ref name=Chambers1840/>

In 1620, Kerr was involved in a fatal quarrel with Charles Maxwell, who insulted him without provocation as he entered the palace at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. In a duel that followed, Sir Robert killed Maxwell. Even though Maxwell's friends acquitted Kerr of blame, the king's strict rules for prevention and punishment of duels forced him to flee to Holland, where he remained about a year. During his exile, he collected pictures, for which, like his royal master, he had good taste. He eventually presented those he brought back with him to the prince. He was also distinguished by his literary taste<ref name=Chambers1840/> and was a friend of [[John Donne]]. He also lived in [[Whitehall Palace]] and [[Kew]].

On the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the throne, in 1625, Sir Robert Kerr was made a [[gentleman of the bedchamber]].

He was [[Member of Parliament|Member]] of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] in 1625, and for [[Lostwithiel (UK Parliament constituency)|Lostwithiel]] and [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1628.<ref name=HoP>http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/kerr-sir-robert-1578-1654</ref>

On 24 June 1633, when Charles was in Scotland at his coronation, Kerr was elevated to the peerage under the titles [[Earl of Ancram]] and [[Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewton, and Dolphinstoun]]. Previously, his son William, by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Murray of [[Blackbarony]], had married his relative, Anne, [[Marquess of Lothian|Countess of Lothian]] in her own right, and had been, by the king, given the title [[Earl of Lothian]].<ref>David Laing, ''Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, first Earl of Ancram'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1875), pp. xlviii, li.</ref> It was therefore arranged, in the patent granted to Kerr, that his own title should descend to the children of his second marriage. Thus, he was father of two peers.<ref name=Chambers1840/>

Unlike others who owed everything to this prince, the Earl of Ancram remained the prince's steady adherent during the whole of his troubles—though he was unable to prevent his eldest son, the [[William Kerr, 3rd Earl of Lothian|Earl of Lothian]], from acting a conspicuous part on the opposite side. On the death of Charles, Kerr took refuge in Holland, where he spent the remainder of his days in solitary afflictions and poverty, and died in 1654, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. [[Jan Lievens]] painted him marvelously. His son [[Charles Carr, 2nd Earl of Ancram|Charles]], inherited his title, but ultimately merged with that of Lothian.<ref name=Chambers1840/>

==Family==
He had two sons by his first marriage to Elizabeth Murray:
*Stanley Kerr (d. bef. May 1672){{citation needed|date=March 2010}}
*[[William Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian]](bef. 1615&nbsp;– c. October 1675)

He had one son and two daughters by his second marriage to [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Anne]], daughter of [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby]]:{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}
*[[Charles Kerr, 2nd Earl of Ancram]] (6 August 1624&nbsp;– September 1690)
*Vere Kerr
*Elizabeth Kerr

'''William Henry Leder''' (May 5, 1918 – September 5, 1943) was a [[fighter pilot]] with the [[United States Naval Reserve]] (USNR) during [[World War II]]. He is credited with scoring multiple victories during the conflict flying a [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]. For actions during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]] he was awarded the [[Air Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=William Henry Leder |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/24645703/william-henry-leder |website=Find a Grave}}</ref><ref>National Archives Veterans' Service Records</ref>

== Early life ==
Leder was born in [[Flasher, North Dakota]] in 1918, the son of Helena Augusta Wall and Carl Benjamin Leder. He attended [[Mandan High School]] in [[Mandan, North Dakota]]. After high school, he attended North Dakota State Teachers College for four years and graduated with a B.A. Degree. He taught in public schools in North Dakota for two years before enlisting. He enlisted in the Navy on April 12, 1941.

== World War II ==
[[File:VF-10 pilots on USS Enterprise (CV-6) c1942.jpg|thumb|left|200px|VF-10 pilots on {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] (William H. Leder in front row on knee, far left).]] Leder was initially stationed at the [[Minneapolis–Saint_Paul_Joint_Air_Reserve_Station|Naval Reserve Aviation Base]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].<ref>U.S. World War II Navy Muster Rolls, 1938-1949</ref> He became an aviation cadet on October 1, 1941 and attended flight training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]]. He was commissioned an ensign on May 15, 1942. On May 18 of that same year, he married Kathryn Silvia Loran<ref>Florida, County Marriage Records, 1823-1982</ref> before being transferred to Aircraft Carrier Training Group [[NAS San Diego]] in June of 1942. He became a member of [[VF-10|Fighting Squadron 10]], the \"Grime Reapers\", in August of 1942 before being shipped out to the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]].

Leder flew as a member of what was known as the [[Cactus Air Force]] in August of 1942. He was part of a large force of allied air power assigned to the [[Solomon Islands]] in support of the [[Guadalcanal campaign]]. As a member of [[VF-10]], he was stationed on the [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|USS Enterprise]] during the [[Battle of Santa Cruz Islands]] and flew multiple air combat patrol missions in defense of his carrier group against enemy Japanese forces. 

In his first air combat engagement on October 26th, 1942, he shot down at least one enemy dive bomber in defense of the Enterprise. 

On November 13, 1942, he was part of a four plane flight on combat patrol over the Enterprise that intercepted and shot down a Japanese bomber shadowing the task force. 

Later on January 30, 1943, he shot down a torpedo bomber attempting to attack the cruiser [[USS Chicago (CA-29)|Chicago]] as it sat damaged near [[Rennell Island]]. 

== Air Medal ==
Leder was nominated by his commander for the Distinguished Flying Cross and was ultimately awarded the [[Air Medal]] for his actions in the Pacific.

'''Citation:'''

''Conspicuous courage and skill in air combat with the enemy. On October 26, 1942, while defending your carrier from air attack in the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands, you destroyed one enemy dive bomber and probably destroyed another before they could release their bombs. In November 13, 1942, while a member of the combat patrol over the U.S.S. ENTERPRISE, you assisted in shooting down one four engine patrol bomber which was attempting to shadow your task force. On January 30, 1943, while on combat patrol over the damaged cruiser USS CHICAGO in the vicinity of Rennell Island, yourself and three other pilots intercepted, by sight contact, an enemy heavily armed twin engine torpedo bomber which was preceding an enemy attack group of twelve torpedo bombers for the obvious purpose of reconnoitering our forces and directing the attack. After a running fight lasting twenty minutes and carried on at speeds approaching 300 m.p.h., you succeeded in shooting the enemy down in flames. Your courage, tenacity, and skill were exemplary and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.''

== Later career and death ==
[[File:Bill Leder Headstone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Memorial headstone at [[Evergreen Washelli Memorial Park]].]]
After action in the Pacific, Leder moved to [[Woodinville, Washington]] and was stationed at the Ellensburg Army Airfield (today [[Bowers Airport|Bowers Field]]) in [[Ellensburg, Washington]] as a [[test pilot]]. On September 5th, 1943, the  Navy plane he was flying caught fire midair, and he crashed near the airfield and was killed. <ref>{{cite news |title=Flyer is Killed in Plane Crash |publisher=Ellensburg Daily Record |date=September 8, 1943}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Naval Flier Killed |work=Page 4 |publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=September 9, 1943}}</ref>

Rolls are also commonly used to make [[sandwich]]es similar to those produced using slices of bread. They are found in most cuisines all over the world.

==Europe==
Even in the same languages rolls are known by a variety of names. Zamknij pizde konrad 

Rolls are common in [[Europe]], especially in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[the Czech Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Italy]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]] and other countries with a thriving bread culture.

Other European languages have many local and dialectal terms for bread rolls. These include [[German language]] diminutives of ''Brot'' (bread) in most of western and central Germany (where they are called ''Brötchen'') and in Switzerland (where they are called ''Brötli''). Other German language terms include ''Rundstück'' (\"round piece\") in [[Hamburg]] and [[Schleswig-Holstein]];<ref>[http://www.abendblatt.de/daten/2002/08/05/53895.html www.abendblatt.de: Hamburger Rundstück] {{in lang|de}}</ref> ''Semmel'' in [[Austria]] and southern [[Bavaria]]; ''Weck'' in much of [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Franconia]] and [[Saarland]]; ''Schrippe'' in [[Berlin]] and parts of [[Brandenburg]]. Some of these names reappear in other European languages as well, for example as ''zsemle'' in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], or ''rundstykker'' (\"round pieces\") in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]].

\"Small bread\" is also found as Italian ''[[panino]]'', but which commonly denotes a very specific kind of ''[[Tramezzino]]'' sandwich bread. The ''[[Kaiser roll|Kaisersemmel]]'' reappears in Italy as the ''[[Michetta]]'' or ''Rosetta''.  In [[Swedish language|Swedish]], a bread roll is a ''(frukost) bullar'' (\"(breakfast) buns\"), ''franskbrödbullar'' (\"french bread bun\") or simply ''fralla'' (\"bun\"), comfort food eaten with butter and any kind of topping (marmalade, cheese, ham, salami) for special weekend breakfasts. The ''Doppelweck or Doppelbrötchen'' is a type of bread roll originating from the Saarland which consists of two rolls joined together side-by-side before baking.

There are several names for them in the United Kingdom including bap, barm, batch, breadcake, bun, cob and teacake. 

A variety of rolls are found in Europe, from white rolls made with [[wheat|wheat flour]], to dark rolls containing mostly [[rye|rye flour]]. Many variants include spices, such as [[coriander]] and [[cumin]], or nuts. Also common are bread rolls containing or garnished with whole seeds such as [[sesame]], [[poppy seed|poppy]], [[pumpkin]] or [[sunflower]].

==Career==

He was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and graduated from the [[University of Alabama]] in 1931 with a major in English and a minor in political science. In 1937 he got a job writing advertising copy and giving sales talks for the U.S. Vitamin Corporation. In this capacity, he began diagnosing and prescribing vitamins to patients. Caught in a sting operation conducted by agents from the New York State Department of Education, he pleaded guilty to unlawful practice of medicine in the Special Sessions Court of New York City on March 13, 1945 and paid a $500 fine, receiving a suspended sentence of 3 months in prison.  He enrolled in [[New York University]]'s School of Education and received a master's degree in 1949, and a night-school Ph.D. in Communications in 1955, his dissertation being \"A Study of the Responses of a Group of Adult Female Listeners to a Series of Educational Radio Programs.\" He was a radio host at [[WEPN (AM)|WMGM]] in [[New York City]], and starting in 1957 moved to [[WOR-AM]], where he stayed for 30&nbsp;years until his death.

His WOR-AM nutrition advice call-in program, ''Design for Living,'' was broadcast six days a week by the station and was also syndicated. Fredericks also wrote several books on nutrition as well as writing a column for [[Prevention (magazine)|Prevention magazine]].

'''Continental Connection''' was a [[brand]] name under which several [[regional airline|commuter airline]] carriers and their [[holding company|holding companies]] operated services marketed exclusively by [[Continental Airlines]]. As such, all Continental Connection banner carrier services were operated primarily with [[turboprop]] aircraft in contrast to [[Continental Express]], whose flights were operated by Continental's [[regional jet]] partners, [[ExpressJet Airlines]] and [[Chautauqua Airlines]].  Continental Connection operations were merged into Continental Express in 2012.

According to the [[Official Airline Guide]] (OAG), earlier Continental Express flights, such as those operated by [[Royale Airlines]] followed by [[Britt Airways]] from the Continental hub at [[Houston Intercontinental Airport]] (IAH), were operated with such turboprop aircraft as the [[ATR-42]], [[Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante]], [[Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia]] and [[Grumman Gulfstream I]] during the 1980s.<ref>http://www.departedflights.com, Feb. 15, 1985 & Dec. 15, 1989 Official Airline Guide (OAG) editions, Houston Intercontinental flight schedules </ref>

All flights operated by Continental Connection carriers were given full [[OnePass]] [[frequent flyer program|frequent flyer]] credit, as if they were mainline Continental flights.

The \"Continental Connection\" name was discontinued and the operation was renamed [[United Express]] following the merger of [[Continental Airlines]] with [[United Airlines]].

'''Sir Robert Kerr (or Carr), 1st Earl of Ancram''' (c. 1578–1654), was a Scottish nobleman, English politician and writer.<ref name=Chambers1840>Chambers, Robert (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=0iopAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA315#v=onepage&q=&f=false A biographical dictionary of eminent Scotsmen], Volume 3, Blackie and Son, pp 315-6. </ref>

==Biography==
He descended from a third son of Sir Andrew Kerr of [[Ferniehirst Castle|Ferniehurst]], and was laird of [[Ancrum]] in [[Roxburghshire]]. He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated by his kinsman, Robert Ker, younger of [[Cessford Castle|Cessford]]. He was cousin to [[Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr]], the [[favourite]] of [[James I of England|James VI]]. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king's accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]]. He subsequently was employed by [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], who became his patron through life. Charles mediated the marriage between Sir Robert and the [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Lady Anne Stanley]], daughter of the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]].<ref name=Chambers1840/>

In 1620, Kerr was involved in a fatal quarrel with Charles Maxwell, who insulted him without provocation as he entered the palace at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. In a duel that followed, Sir Robert killed Maxwell. Even though Maxwell's friends acquitted Kerr of blame, the king's strict rules for prevention and punishment of duels forced him to flee to Holland, where he remained about a year. During his exile, he collected pictures, for which, like his royal master, he had good taste. He eventually presented those he brought back with him to the prince. He was also distinguished by his literary taste<ref name=Chambers1840/> and was a friend of [[John Donne]]. He also lived in [[Whitehall Palace]] and [[Kew]].

On the accession of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the throne, in 1625, Sir Robert Kerr was made a [[gentleman of the bedchamber]].

He was [[Member of Parliament|Member]] of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] (MP) for [[Aylesbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Aylesbury]] in 1625, and for [[Lostwithiel (UK Parliament constituency)|Lostwithiel]] and [[Preston (UK Parliament constituency)|Preston]] in 1628.<ref name=HoP>http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/kerr-sir-robert-1578-1654</ref>

On 24 June 1633, when Charles was in Scotland at his coronation, Kerr was elevated to the peerage under the titles [[Earl of Ancram]] and [[Lord Kerr of Nisbet, Langnewton, and Dolphinstoun]]. Previously, his son William, by his first wife Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Murray of [[Blackbarony]], had married his relative, Anne, [[Marquess of Lothian|Countess of Lothian]] in her own right, and had been, by the king, given the title [[Earl of Lothian]].<ref>David Laing, ''Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, first Earl of Ancram'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1875), pp. xlviii, li.</ref> It was therefore arranged, in the patent granted to Kerr, that his own title should descend to the children of his second marriage. Thus, he was father of two peers.<ref name=Chambers1840/>

Unlike others who owed everything to this prince, the Earl of Ancram remained the prince's steady adherent during the whole of his troubles—though he was unable to prevent his eldest son, the [[William Kerr, 3rd Earl of Lothian|Earl of Lothian]], from acting a conspicuous part on the opposite side. On the death of Charles, Kerr took refuge in Holland, where he spent the remainder of his days in solitary afflictions and poverty, and died in 1654, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. [[Jan Lievens]] painted him marvelously. His son [[Charles Carr, 2nd Earl of Ancram|Charles]], inherited his title, but ultimately merged with that of Lothian.<ref name=Chambers1840/>

==Family==
He had two sons by his first marriage to Elizabeth Murray:

*[[William Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian]](bef. 1615&nbsp;– c. October 1675)

==Biography==
He descended from a third son of Sir Andrew Kerr of Ferniehurst, and entered public life as laird of Ancrum in [[Roxburghshire]]. He was born about 1578, and succeeded to the family estate in 1590 on the death of his father, who was assassinated by his kinsman, Robert Key, younger of Cessford. He was cousin to [[Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset|Robert Carr]], the [[favourite]] of [[James I of England|James VI]]. Kerr appears to have also been honoured at an early age with court favour. Soon after the king's accession to the English throne, Kerr occupied a considerable station in the household of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]]. The household of that time  was more splendid and consisted of more people than the present royal household. He subsequently was employed by [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], who became his patron through life. Charles mediated a match between Sir Robert and the [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Ancram|Lady Anne Stanley]], daughter of the [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]].<ref name=Chambers1840/>

In 1620, Kerr was involved in a fatal quarrel with a young man named Charles Maxwell, who insulted him without provocation as he entered the palace at [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]]. In a duel that followed, Sir Robert killed Maxwell. Even though Maxwell's friends acquitted Kerr of blame, the king's strict rules for prevention and punishment of duels forced him to flee to Holland, where he remained about a year.

(Place dead link in correct location),unsafe,HYanWong,"\"'''Without a Song'''\" is a [[popular music|popular]] [[song]] with music by [[Vincent Youmans]] and lyrics by [[Billy Rose]] and [[Edward Eliscu]], published in 1929. It was included in the [[musical play]], ''Great Day''.  The play only ran for 36 performances but contained two songs which became famous, \"Without a Song\" and \"Great Day\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Internet Broadway Database|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-production/great-day-10960|website=Internet Broadway Database|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}</ref> 

==Background and initial recordings==
Canadian singer, Gilbert Burgess Holland introduced “Without A Song” in the show “Great Day” accompanied by Fletcher Henderson’s Orchestra, in the pit of the famous Park Theatre, NYC. <ref>{{https://archive.org/stream/RecordResearch37/RR%2037_djvu.txt}}</ref> Gilbert is the son of Reverend [[John Christie Holland]].  One of the earliest recordings of the song was by [[Paul Whiteman]]'s orchestra featuring [[Bing Crosby]] on October 9, 1929<ref>{{cite web|title=A Bing Crosby Discography|url=http://www.bingmagazine.co.uk/bingmagazine/crosby1a.html|website=BING magazine|publisher=International Club Crosby|accessdate=April 29, 2017}}</ref> and this reached the charts of the day.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Whitburn|first1=Joel|title=Joel Whitburn's Pop Memories 1890-1954|date=1986|publisher=Record Research Inc|location=Wisconsin, USA|isbn=0-89820-083-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit/page/452 452]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/joelwpopmemories00whit/page/452}}</ref><br />
\"Without a Song\" was recorded in March 1946 in New York by [[Billy Eckstine]],<ref>Billy Eckstine, I Ain't Like That, Quadromania, Jazz Edition, 4CD, Mebran International GmbH, 2005</ref> who later rerecorded the song live on 30 August 1960 at the Cloud Nine Lounge of the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas for his album [[No Cover, No Minimum]]. <br />
\"Without a Song\" also was recorded twice by [[Perry Como]]: the first time on January 11, 1951 and the second time in June 1970 at a live performance at the International Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada. The 1951 recording was issued as a 78 rpm single in the United States by [[RCA Victor Records]] (catalog number 20-4033) and in the United Kingdom by [[HMV]] (catalog number B-10093). It was also included in a 1957 album, ''Dream Along With Me'' (RCA Camden catalog number CAL-403).

[[Image:Sophie de Ségur.jpg|thumb|200px|<center>The Countess of Ségur</center>]]
{{French literature sidebar}}
'''Sophie Rostopchine''', '''Countess of Ségur''', born '''Sofiya Feodorovna Rostopchina''' ({{lang-ru|Софья Фёдоровна Ростопчина}}; 1 August 1799 in [[Saint Petersburg]] – 8 February 1874 in [[Paris]]) (watch out ! Feb, 9 th in French or russian and others wikipedia), was a French writer of [[Russian Empire|Russian]] birth and origin. She is best known today for her novel ''[[Sophie's Misfortunes|Les Malheurs de Sophie]]'' (Sophie's misfortunes), [[Children's literature|intended for children]].

==Life==
Her father [[Fyodor Rostopchin|Count Fyodor Rostopchin]] was lieutenant-general and, later, Minister of Foreign Affairs for Russia. In 1812, he was governor of Moscow during the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|invasion]] of the [[Grande Armée]] under [[Napoleon I of France]]. While facts concerning the origin of the [[Fire of Moscow (1812)|great fire of Moscow]] are disputed by historians, Sophie Rostopchine's father has been said by some to have organized (despite opposition from the wealthy property-owners in the city) the great fire which forced Napoleon to make a disastrous retreat.

In 1814 the Rostopchine family left [[Imperial Russia]] for exile, going first to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], then to the [[German Confederation]] and the [[Italian peninsula]] and finally in 1817 to [[Bourbon Dynasty, Restored|France under the Bourbon Restoration]]. In France, the father established a [[salon (gathering)|salon]], and his wife and daughter converted to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] from Russian Orthodoxy.

It was in her father's salon that Sophie Rostopchine met Eugène Henri Raymond, Count of Ségur ([[Fresnes-sur-Marne|Fresnes]], Seine-et-Marne on 12 February 1798 – Château de [[Méry-sur-Oise]] 15 July 1869), whom she married on 13/14 July 1819. The marriage was largely an unhappy one: her husband was flighty, distant and poor (until being made a [[Peerage of France|Peer of France]] in 1830), and his infrequent conjugal visits to their château des Nouettes (near [[L'Aigle]], Orne) produced eight children, including the father of the historian [[Pierre de Ségur]] (Eugène de Ségur is said to have called his wife \"la mère Gigogne\", or \"Mother Gigogne\" in reference to a theatre character of 1602, an enormous woman out of whose skirts a crowd of children appeared).

The Comtesse de Ségur wrote her first novel at the age of 58.

==Novels==
The novels of the Countess of Ségur were published from 1857 to 1872 in the \"Bibliothèque rose illustrée\" by the publishing house [[Hachette (publishing)|Hachette]].  They were collected together in 1990 under the title ''Œuvres de la comtesse de Ségur'' in the collection \"Bouquins\" (publisher: Robert Laffont).

In 2006, McGreal returned to South Africa. He made repeated undercover trips to [[Zimbabwe]] to report on the political violence of President [[Robert Mugabe]]'s regime. He was runner up in the 2006 British Media Award by the Foreign Press Association in London for his Zimbabwe coverage. In 2009 he was appointed ''The Guardian'''s Washington correspondent. He was runner up in the Foreign Press Association award for Print/Web Feature Story of the Year for a series retracing route of ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' to report on economic depression in modern America. He has continued to report from the Middle East at times, including the Egyptian and Libyan revolutions in 2011. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Scope==
In ordinary conversation, ''everything'' usually refers only to the totality of things relevant to the subject matter.<ref name=\"OED\"/> When there is no expressed limitation, ''everything'' may refer to the [[universe]], or the [[world]].

The ''Universe'' is most commonly defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of [[time]], all forms of [[matter]], [[energy]] and [[momentum]], and the [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant|constants]] that govern them. However, the term \"universe\" may be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting such concepts as the ''[[cosmos]]'', the ''[[world (philosophy)|world]]''  or ''[[Nature]]''. According to some speculations, this universe may be one of many disconnected universes, which are collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]]. In the [[bubble universe theory]], there is an infinite variety of universes, each with different [[physical constant]]s. In the [[many-worlds hypothesis]], new universes are spawned with every [[quantum measurement]]. By definition, these speculations cannot currently be tested experimentally, yet, if multiple universes do exist, they would still be part of everything.

Especially in a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] context, ''World'' may refer to everything that constitutes [[reality]] and the [[Universe]]: see [[World (philosophy)]]. However, world may \"only\" refer to ''[[Earth]]'' envisioned from an [[anthropocentric]] or [[human]] [[worldview]], as a place by [[human beings]].

==In theoretical physics==
{{Main article|Theory of everything}}
In [[theoretical physics]], a ''theory of everything'' (TOE) is a hypothetical [[theory]] that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena. Initially, the term was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of [[Ijon Tichy]]—a character from a cycle of [[Stanisław Lem]]'s [[science fiction]] stories of the 1960s—was known to work on the \"General Theory of Everything\". Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of [[quantum physics]] to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature.

There have been many theories of everything proposed by [[theoretical physicists]] over the last century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that the accepted theories of [[quantum mechanics]], [[general relativity]] or [[special relativity]] are hard to combine. Theories exploring quantum mechanics and string theory are easier to combine{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. 

Based on theoretical [[holographic principle]] arguments from the 1990s, many physicists believe that 11-dimensional [[M-theory]], which is described in many sectors by [[matrix string theory]], and in many other sectors by [[dual resonance model|perturbative string theory]], is the complete theory of everything. Other physicists disagree.

==Uses==
Snort's open-source network-based [[Intrusion prevention system|intrusion detection/prevention system]] (IDS/IPS) has the ability to perform real-time traffic analysis and [[Packet analyzer|packet logging]] on [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) networks. Snort performs protocol analysis, content searching and matching.

The program can also be used to detect probes or [[Attack (computing)|attacks]], including, but not limited to, [[TCP/IP stack fingerprinting|operating system fingerprinting]] attempts, [[semantic URL attack]]s, [[buffer overflow]]s, [[server message block]] probes, and stealth [[Port scanner|port scans]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James Stanger|title=How to Cheat at Securing Linux|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdDB718VwZcC&pg=PA126|year=2011|publisher=Elsevier|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-0-08-055868-4|page=126}}</ref>

Snort can be configured in three main modes: 1. sniffer, 2. packet logger, and 3. network intrusion detection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manual.snort.org/node2.html |title=Snort Usage |author=Snort Team |date=2012-01-01}}</ref>

===Sniffer Mode===
The program will read network packets and display them on the console.

===Packet Logger Mode===
In packet logger mode, the program will log packets to the disk.

===Network Intrusion Detection System Mode===
In intrusion detection mode, the program will monitor network traffic and analyze it against a rule set defined by the user. The program will then perform a specific action based on what has been identified.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://manual.snort.org/node6.html |title=Snort Usage |author=Snort team |date=2013-04-05}}</ref>

==Third-party tools==
There are several third-party tools interfacing Snort for administration, reporting, performance and log analysis:
* Snorby – a [[GPLv3]]<ref>https://github.com/Snorby/snorby/blob/master/LICENSE</ref> [[Ruby on Rails]] application
* BASE

\"Without a Song\" was recorded in March 1946 in New York by [[Billy Eckstine]],<ref>Billy Eckstine, I Ain't Like That, Quadromania, Jazz Edition, 4CD, Mebran International GmbH, 2005</ref> who later rerecorded the song live on 30 August 1960 at the Cloud Nine Lounge of the New Frontier Hotel in Las Vegas for his album [[No Cover, No Minimum]]. <br />
\"Without a Song\" also was recorded twice by [[Perry Como]]: the first time on January 11, 1951 and the second time in June 1970 at a live performance at the International Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada. The 1951 recording was issued as a 78 rpm single in the United States by [[RCA Victor Records]] (catalog number 20-4033) and in the United Kingdom by [[HMV]] (catalog number B-10093). It was also included in a 1957 album, ''Dream Along With Me'' (RCA Camden catalog number CAL-403). The 1970 recording was issued on albums by RCA and its United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Japan subsidiaries, but not as a single.<ref>{{cite web|title=Perry Como Discography|url=http://kokomo.ca/early_years/without_a_song.htm|website=kokomo.ca|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

==Other notable recordings==
[[Lawrence Tibbett]], [[Nelson Eddy]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] recorded versions of the song with what appears to be the original lyrics, including the line, \"A [[List of ethnic slurs#D|darkie]]'s born, but he's no good no how, without a song.\" In subsequent recordings, Sinatra didn't use the term \"darkie\", and later recorded versions included the altered text \"a man is born, but he's no good no how, without a song.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blacksuperhero.com/articles/art2-Cohen.html|title= A Face On the Past|author= Richard Cohen}}{{dead link}}</ref> The original was played in error on BBC Radio 4's 'PM' program on the 9th April 2020, prompting an apology on the same program four days later.

In addition to popular artists like Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, [[Tony Bennett]], [[Keely Smith]] and [[Neil Sedaka]], and opera singers like [[Lauritz Melchior]], [[Jan Peerce]] and [[Mario Lanza]], many African-American artists of varying styles also successfully recorded the song after Billy Eckstine first did so in 1946, including a version in \"gospel style\" by [[Mahalia Jackson]] in concert in Berlin, 1967; also versions by [[George Benson]], [[The Ravens]], [[The Isley Brothers]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The Supremes]] (for their album ''[[I Hear a Symphony (album)|I Hear A Symphony]]''), and jazz singer [[Jimmy Scott]] on his 2006 album ''Milestone Profiles - Jimmy Scott'' on Milestone Records. Instrumental versions have been recorded by [[Sonny Rollins]], on his 1962 \"comeback\" album, ''[[The Bridge (Sonny Rollins album)|The Bridge]]'', [[Stanley Turrentine]] on his album ''Never Let Me Go'' (Blue Note 90838), [[Clare Fischer]] on ''[[Surging Ahead]]'' (Pacific Jazz PJ 67), and [[Bill Evans]] on ''[[You Must Believe in Spring (Bill Evans album)|You Must Believe in Spring]]'' (reissued on [[Rhino Records]]).

\"Without a Song\" was released as a single in the UK by [[Gary Shearston]] in 1974 and by [[Noah Stewart]] in 2011.

Durags were originally worn by poor African American women laborers and slaves in the 19th century.

In the 2000s, wearing durags in public lost popularity in certain areas, but maintained its popularity in others.{{fact|date=September 2019}} However, because of rappers such as [[ASAP Ferg|A$AP Ferg]] and the renewed popularity of [[Waves (hairstyle)|waves]], they regained their status.

[[File:Bradford - Mills 12.JPG|thumb|225 px|right|Victorian buildings in Little Germany]]
'''Little Germany, Bradford''', is an area of particular historical and architectural interest in central [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The architecture is predominantly neoclassical in style with an Italian influence.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Buildings of England]]: Yorkshire West Riding, Leeds, Bradford and the north |first1=Peter E.|last1=Leach |first2=Nikolaus |last2=Pevsner |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2009|isbn=9780300126655}}{{page number|date=February 2015}}</ref> Many individual buildings are [[Listed building|listed]], and Little Germany is also protected as a [[Conservation area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Area]].<ref name=\"trail\"/>

== History and information ==
The buildings within Little Germany date back to the 19th&nbsp;century, developing from 1855. Most of the buildings are commercial, although are also a few non-commercial buildings, for example Baptist and Methodist chapels. The commercial buildings are the legacy of merchants from mainland Europe, many of them Jewish,<ref name=\"trail\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtrails.org.uk/trails/bradford/places-of-interest |title=Trail → Bradford |publisher=jtrails.org.uk |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> who spent large sums of money constructing imposing warehouses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bradfordjewish.org.uk/900-2/ |title=Unknown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922005523/http://bradfordjewish.org.uk/900-2/ |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}</ref> for the storage and sale of their goods for export. A large proportion of the merchants came from [[Germany]] hence the name '''Little Germany'''.
Bradford became more attractive as a centre of international trade in the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], which disrupted commercial relations between France and Germany.

Architectural practices included Milnes & France, [[William_Mawson#Lockwood_and_Mawson|Lockwood & Mawson]], Andrews & Delaunay and J.T. Fairbank building in italianate style. An 1871 building by [[George Corson]] for Scottish clients is in [[Scottish baronial architecture|Scottish baronial style]]. Caspian House (61 East Parade) was built in 1873, as the warehouse of D. Delius and Company; the senior partner in the business was the father of the composer [[Frederick Delius]].

Little Germany is still one of [[Bradford]]'s busiest commercial areas, with over 110 businesses and organisations with 3,000 workers. It attracts around 100,000 visitors each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitbradford.com/thedms.aspx?dms=3&venue=2183380&feature=1 |title=Little Germany |publisher=Visit Bradford |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The local authority is currently promoting plans to regenerate the area by renovating and converting the interior of the old mills into housing, hotels, offices, whilst preserving the originally [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] distinctive architecture.

In April 2012 retail giant [[Freemans|Freeman Grattan Holdings]], now a German-owned company, secured a deal to open a new head office and house around 300 staff in a Grade-II-listed former wool warehouse in Little Germany.

Little Germany is also the home of the [[Bradford Playhouse]], which has a mural on the back of the building that commemorates the centenary of the founding of the [[Independent Labour Party]] in Bradford in 1893.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/10066 |title=Blue plaque № 10066 in Bradford |publisher=openplaques.org |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

== Developments ==

=== Eastbrook Hall redevelopment ===
[[File:Eastbrook Hall.JPG|thumb|200 px|right|Eastbrook Hall]]
Ham Construction undertook the redevelopment of [[Eastbrook Hall]] in Little Germany. The project cost an estimated £11&nbsp;million and converted the building into 63 high-quality apartments as well some commercial usage on Leeds Road. The project included a refurbishment of the exterior and roof of the listed building which had suffered extensive fire damage. The hall was built in 1903 and was originally used as a [[Methodism|Methodist]] mission. The redevelopment was being funded through a public private sector funding agreement, as well as the [[The Prince's Regeneration Trust|Prince's Regeneration Trust]]. Work was finally completed in 2008, some months after the original projected finish date was set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://princes-regeneration.org/projects/eastbrook-hall-bradford |title=Eastbrook Hall, Bradford |publisher=The Prince's Regeneration Trust |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

=== The Gatehaus ===

[[The Gatehaus]] is an 11-storey glass building constructed within the Little Germany district. Construction began in 2005 and was completed in 2007 with a total cost of £22&nbsp;million. The project was originally proposed as a 17-storey landmark but was changed due to a rethink after suggestions that its height was incompatible with the surrounding Victorian buildings. The scheme was developed by Asquith Properties.

'''Little Germany, Bradford''', is an area of particular historical and architectural interest in central [[Bradford]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]]. The architecture is predominantly neoclassical in style with an Italian influence.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Buildings of England]]: Yorkshire West Riding, Leeds, Bradford and the north |first1=Peter E.|last1=Leach |first2=Nikolaus |last2=Pevsner |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2009|isbn=9780300126655}}{{page number|date=February 2015}}</ref> Many individual buildings are [[Listed building|listed]], and Little Germany is also protected as a [[Conservation area (United Kingdom)|Conservation Area]].<ref name=\"trail\"/>

== History and information ==
The buildings within Little Germany date back to the 19th&nbsp;century, developing from 1855. Most of the buildings are commercial, although are also a few non-commercial buildings, for example Baptist and Methodist chapels. The commercial buildings are the legacy of merchants from mainland Europe, many of them Jewish,<ref name=\"trail\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jtrails.org.uk/trails/bradford/places-of-interest |title=Trail → Bradford |publisher=jtrails.org.uk |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> who spent large sums of money constructing imposing warehouses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bradfordjewish.org.uk/900-2/ |title=Unknown |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922005523/http://bradfordjewish.org.uk/900-2/ |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}</ref> for the storage and sale of their goods for export. A large proportion of the merchants came from [[Germany]] hence the name '''Little Germany'''.
Bradford became more attractive as a centre of international trade in the aftermath of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], which disrupted commercial relations between France and Germany.There are also a few non-commercial buildings, for example Baptist and Methodist chapels.

Architectural practices included Milnes & France, [[William_Mawson#Lockwood_and_Mawson|Lockwood & Mawson]], Andrews & Delaunay and J.T. Fairbank building in italianate style. An 1871 building by [[George Corson]] for Scottish clients is in [[Scottish baronial architecture|Scottish baronial style]]. Caspian House (61 East Parade) was built in 1873, as the warehouse of D. Delius and Company; the senior partner in the business was the father of the composer [[Frederick Delius]].

Little Germany is still one of [[Bradford]]'s busiest commercial areas, with over 110 businesses and organisations with 3,000 workers. It attracts around 100,000 visitors each year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitbradford.com/thedms.aspx?dms=3&venue=2183380&feature=1 |title=Little Germany |publisher=Visit Bradford |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> The local authority is currently promoting plans to regenerate the area by renovating and converting the interior of the old mills into housing, hotels, offices, whilst preserving the originally [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] distinctive architecture.

In April 2012 retail giant [[Freemans|Freeman Grattan Holdings]], now a German-owned company, secured a deal to open a new head office and house around 300 staff in a Grade-II-listed former wool warehouse in Little Germany.

Little Germany is also the home of the [[Bradford Playhouse]], which has a mural on the back of the building that commemorates the centenary of the founding of the [[Independent Labour Party]] in Bradford in 1893.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/10066 |title=Blue plaque № 10066 in Bradford |publisher=openplaques.org |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

== Developments ==

=== Eastbrook Hall redevelopment ===
[[File:Eastbrook Hall.JPG|thumb|200 px|right|Eastbrook Hall]]
Ham Construction undertook the redevelopment of [[Eastbrook Hall]] in Little Germany. The project cost an estimated £11&nbsp;million and converted the building into 63 high-quality apartments as well some commercial usage on Leeds Road. The project included a refurbishment of the exterior and roof of the listed building which had suffered extensive fire damage. The hall was built in 1903 and was originally used as a [[Methodism|Methodist]] mission. The redevelopment was being funded through a public private sector funding agreement, as well as the [[The Prince's Regeneration Trust|Prince's Regeneration Trust]]. Work was finally completed in 2008, some months after the original projected finish date was set.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://princes-regeneration.org/projects/eastbrook-hall-bradford |title=Eastbrook Hall, Bradford |publisher=The Prince's Regeneration Trust |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

=== The Gatehaus ===

[[The Gatehaus]] is an 11-storey glass building constructed within the Little Germany district. Construction began in 2005 and was completed in 2007 with a total cost of £22&nbsp;million. The project was originally proposed as a 17-storey landmark but was changed due to a rethink after suggestions that its height was incompatible with the surrounding Victorian buildings. The scheme was developed by Asquith Properties.

'''WYNT''' (95.9 [[Frequency modulation|FM]]) is a Hot AC station formerly located in [[Upper Sandusky, Ohio]] now located with its studios in [[Marion, Ohio]] and its transmitter and city of license moved to [[Caledonia, Ohio]]. It broadcasts music from the 1980s through today as \"Majic 95.9\" and is part of the [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]]'s Marion cluster which includes [[WMRN (AM)|WMRN]] and [[WMRN-FM]]. Its Cleveland FM sister [[WMJI]] also uses the \"Majic\" branding for its 1960s/70s oldies station.  WYNT was also formerly an oldies station under the same branding.

The station had for years, served as a full-service adult contemporary/country music station serving Upper Sandusky, the seat of Wyandot County, as well as the communities surrounding Upper Sandusky, which is not to be confused with the town of Sandusky, Ohio...about 50 miles due north in Erie County, best known as the home of [[Cedar Point]].

==History==
According to the 1981 Broadcasting and Cable Yearbook, WYNT first went on the air on December 11, 1973 with the original call letters WYAN, licensed to Upper Sandusky.

The station was founded by Wendell A. Triplett, president of Triplett Broadcasting of [[Bellefontaine, Ohio]]; which also owned the former WTOO (now [[WBLL]]) in Bellefontaine, founded the former WPNM (currently [[WBUK]]) in Ottawa and the former WAXT (later WHTI, now [[WBKQ]]) in Alexandria, Indiana.  Triplett's brother and company vice president Robert S. Triplett served as the station's first general manager, and also served as the station's chief engineer.  T.P. Communications, a company headed by Charles Earl, then acquired WYAN in October 1979.  Forest Whitehead, who would become a driving force in the station's future rescue from financial turmoil, became the station's general manager in 1980.

By 1981 the company had run into financial trouble and WYNT was silenced.  However, the license was already in the planning stages of a return to the air by the end of 1982.

[[Image:WXML-WYNT.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The original studio-office building and transmitter tower of WYAN, today used by [[WXML]], a non-profit Christian radio station, on the outskirts of Upper Sandusky.  WXML purchased this site after WYAN had fallen silent and its assets liquidated.  WYAN would return to the air as WYNT at a site about a mile west of this site later.]]

Determined to keep the radio station in local hands, then-general manager and morning DJ Forest Whitehead and a local funeral director formed an ownership group, which subsequently returned the station to the air under the name U.S. Broadcasting in 1986.  The funeral director stated he would invest in the station on the condition that it would provide the community with local high school sports game broadcasts, especially football.

According to [http://www.radio-locator.com the Radio Locator website], a construction permit has been granted to move the transmitter and city of license from Upper Sandusky to Caledonia located northeast of [[Marion, Ohio]].  Concurrent with the move, the station moved from an [[oldies]] to a [[Soft AC]] format, which has since been switched to Hot AC.  Most of the station's programming comes from Clear Channel's [[List of programming syndicated by Clear Channel#Premium Choice|Premium Choice]] Hot AC format, except for the locally originating morning show.  Clear Channel ran a similar format previously on 94.3 WDIF (now the home of [[WMRN-FM]] after [[WZCB|the original WMRN-FM]] was moved into the Columbus market).

Robert S. Triplett died April 5, 2020 at the age of 97.  

As of November 20, 2006, this station was advertised for sale, along with other Clear Channel-owned radio stations operating out of Marion, Ohio. In May 2007, WYNT and the other stations of the Marion cluster of [[Clear Channel Communications]] was to have been sold to Florida-based [[GoodRadio.TV LLC]], but the deal has since collapsed.
