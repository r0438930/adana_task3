It officially declared its neutrality at the beginning of the war, but after a failed attempt by Confederate General [[Leonidas Polk]] to take the state of Kentucky for the Confederacy, the legislature petitioned the [[Union Army]] for assistance. After early 1862 Kentucky came largely under Union control.\n\nKentucky was the site of several fierce battles, including [[Battle of Mill Springs|Mill Springs]] and [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]]. It was host to such military leaders as [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] side, who first encountered serious [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] gunfire coming from [[Columbus, Kentucky]], and Confederate cavalry leader [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. Forrest proved to be a scourge to the [[Union Army]] in western Kentucky, even making an attack on [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]]. Kentuckian [[John Hunt Morgan]] further challenged Union control, as he conducted numerous cavalry raids through the state.\n\nKentucky was the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], and his southern counterpart, [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]]. Lincoln had declared, early in the war, \"I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.\"\n\nIn the historiography of the Civil War, Kentucky is treated primarily as a border state, with special attention to the social divisions during the secession crisis, invasions and raids, internal violence, sporadic guerrilla warfare, federal-state relations, the ending of slavery, and the return of Confederate veterans.<ref>John David Smith, \"Whither Kentucky Civil War and Reconstruction Scholarship?.\" ''Register of the Kentucky Historical Society ''112.2 (2014): 223-247.</ref>\n\n35,000 Kentuckians served as Confederate soldiers; an estimated 125,000 Kentuckians served as Union soldiers.<ref>Quisenberry, A.

In 1860, slaves composed 19.5% of the Commonwealth's population, and many Unionist Kentuckians saw nothing wrong with the \"[[peculiar institution]]\".<ref>Harrison, p. 1.</ref> The Commonwealth was further bound to the South by the [[Mississippi River]] and its tributaries, which were the main commercial outlet for her surplus produce, although [[railroad]] connections to the North were beginning to diminish the importance of this tie.<ref name=harrison2>Harrison, p. 2.</ref> The ancestors of many Kentuckians hailed from Southern states like [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]], but many Kentucky children were beginning to migrate toward the North.<ref name=harrison2 />\n\nKentucky, along with [[North Carolina]], also boasted the best educational systems in the South. [[Transylvania University]] had long been one of the most respected institutions of higher learning in the nation, and while its reputation had begun to fade by 1860, other Kentucky schools like [[Centre College]] and [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]] were gaining prominence.<ref>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 13.</ref>\n\nPolitically, the Commonwealth had produced some of the country's best known leaders. Former Vice-Presidents [[John C. Breckinridge]] and [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] both hailed from the state, as did [[Henry Clay]], [[John J. Crittenden]], U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]].<ref>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 14.</ref> However, by the time of the Civil War, Kentucky was in a politically confused state. The decline of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which Clay had founded, had left many politicians looking for an identity.<ref name=\"harrison4\">Harrison, p. 4.</ref> Many joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], a few joined the newly formed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], while still others associated with one of numerous minor parties such as the [[Know Nothing Party]].<ref name=harrison4 /> In the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], with Tennessee-native [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] as its presidential candidate and Massachusetts-native [[Edward Everett]] as its vice-presidential candidate, won the state. The party was composed mainly of former Whigs and Know-Nothings.<ref>[http://onthebrinkofdisunion-theelectionof1860.weebly.com/constitutional-union-party.html Constitutional Union Party] Retrieved March 29, 2016.</ref>\n\nKentucky was strategically important to both the North and South. The Commonwealth ranked ninth in population by 1860, and was a major producer of such agricultural commodities as [[tobacco]], [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]].<ref name=harrison2 /> Geographically, Kentucky was important to the South because the [[Ohio River]] would provide a defensible boundary along the entire length of the state.<ref name=harrison2 />\n\n[[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky governor]] [[Beriah Magoffin]] believed that the rights of the Southern states had been violated and favored the right of secession, but sought all possible avenues to avoid it.<ref>Harrison, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> On December 9, 1860, he sent a letter to the other slave state governors suggesting that they come to an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], a division of common territories at the [[37th parallel north#United States|37th parallel]], a guarantee of free use of the [[Mississippi River]], and a Southern [[veto]] over slave legislation.<ref name=harrison7>Harrison, p. 7.</ref> Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure these concessions.<ref name=harrison7 /> Due to the escalating pace of events, neither conference was ever held.<ref name=harrison7 />\n\nMagoffin called a special session of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] on December 27, 1860, and asked legislators for a convention of Kentuckians to decide the Commonwealth's course regarding secession.<ref name=harrison7 /> The majority of the General Assembly had Unionist sympathies, however, and declined the governor's request,<ref name=harrison7 /> fearing that the state's voters would favor secession.<ref name=\"Rose, p. 26\">Harrison in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 26.</ref> The Assembly did, however, send six delegates to a February 4 [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] to call a national convention to consider potential resolutions to the secession crisis, including the [[Crittenden Compromise]], authored by Kentuckian [[John J. Crittenden]].<ref name=harrison8>Harrison, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWhen the General Assembly convened again on March 20, it called for a convention of the [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] in the Kentucky capital of [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] on May 27, 1861.<ref name=harrison8 /> Again, the call went unheeded. Legislators also passed a [[Corwin Amendment|proposed Thirteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States of America|Constitution]] that would have guaranteed slavery in states where it was already legal.<ref name=harrison8 />\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] recognized the importance of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] when, in a September 1861 letter to [[Orville Hickman Browning|Orville Browning]],<ref name=brown79>Brown, p. 79.</ref> he had written:\n\n<blockquote>I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.

B. Magoffin\"<ref>Powell, p. 52.</ref> Instead, most Kentuckians favored John J. Crittenden's position that the Commonwealth should act as a mediator between the two sides.<ref name=harrison8 /> To that end, both houses of the General Assembly passed [[Kentucky Declaration of Neutrality|declarations of neutrality]], a position officially declared by Governor Magoffin on May 20, 1861.<ref name=harrison8 />\n\nBoth sides respected the Commonwealth's neutrality, but positioned themselves strategically to take advantage of any change in the situation. Union forces established Camp Clay in [[Ohio]] just north of the city of [[Newport, Kentucky]] and [[Camp Joe Holt]] in [[Indiana]] opposite [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name=kleber192>Kleber, p. 192.</ref> Meanwhile, Confederate troops constructed Forts [[Fort Donelson|Donelson]] and [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] just across Kentucky's southern border in [[Tennessee]], and stationed troops fewer than 50 yards from [[Cumberland Gap]].<ref name=kleber192 /> Volunteers from the Commonwealth left the state to join up with whichever side they favored.<ref name=kleber192 /> Some covert recruiting also took place.<ref name=harrison9>Harrison, p. 9.</ref> Nearly 60 infantry regiments served in the Union armies versus just 9 in the Confederate. However, a rather large number of cavalry outfits joined the latter. John Breckenridge originally commanded the \"Orphan Brigade\" of the Army of Tennessee, consisting of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 9th Kentucky Infantry. The brigade's nickname came about allegedly because the soldiers' home counties were occupied by Union troops for most of the war and they couldn't go home to them.\n\nRealizing that neutrality was becoming less and less feasible, six prominent Kentuckians met to find some solution for a state caught in the middle of a conflict. Governor Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and [[Richard Hawes]] represented the secessionists' position, while Crittenden, [[Archibald Dixon]], and S. S. Nicholas advocated the Northern cause.<ref name=harrison9 /> The sextet agreed only to continue the doctrine of neutrality, however, and called for the formation of a five-member board to coordinate the Commonwealth's defense.<ref name=harrison10>Harrison, p. 10.</ref> The General Assembly created the board on May 24 and vested in it supervision of the state's military, a power reserved in the [[Kentucky Constitution]] for the governor.<ref name=harrison10 />\n\nThe Commonwealth's military forces, however, proved to be just as divided as the general populace. The State Guard, under the command of [[Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr.|Simon B. Buckner]], largely favored the Confederate cause, while the newly formed Home Guard were mostly Unionists.<ref name=harrison10 /> Several close calls almost started a conflict within the state, but Buckner successfully negotiated with Union general [[George B. McClellan]] and Tennessee governor [[Isham Harris]] to maintain the Commonwealth's neutrality through the summer.<ref name=harrison10 />\n\n===Elections of 1861===\nThe tide of public opinion was beginning to turn in Kentucky, however. In a special congressional election held June 20, 1861, Unionist candidates won nine of Kentucky's ten congressional seats.<ref name=\"Rose, p. 26\"/> Confederate sympathizers won only the [[Jackson Purchase]] region,<ref>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', pp. 26\u201327.</ref> which was economically linked to Tennessee by the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]]s.<ref name=kleber193>Kleber, p. 193.</ref> Seeing imminent defeat at the polls, many Confederate sympathizers [[election boycott|boycotted the election]]; the total number of ballots cast was just over half the number that had been cast in the previous year's election.<ref name=harrison11>Harrison, p. 11.</ref> Governor Magoffin was dealt a further blow in the August 5 election for state legislators. This election resulted in [[veto]]-proof Unionist majorities of 76\u201324 in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|House]] and 27\u201311 in the [[Kentucky Senate|Senate]].<ref>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 27.</ref>\n\nFrom that point forward, most of Magoffin's vetoes to protect southern interests were overridden in the General Assembly.<ref>Kleber, p. 603.</ref> After clashing with the Assembly for over a year on even the most trivial issues, Magoffin decided that resignation was his only option. Magoffin's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], [[Linn Boyd]], had died in office, and Senate Speaker John Fisk, next in line for the governorship, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. In an intricate plan worked out with the General Assembly, Fisk resigned as speaker and the Senate elevated Magoffin's chosen successor, [[James Fisher Robinson|James F. Robinson]], to the post. Magoffin then resigned, promoting Robinson to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Senate Speaker.\n\nAlmost immediately following the results of the 1861 election, [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]] established [[Camp Dick Robinson]], a Union recruiting camp, in [[Garrard County, Kentucky|Garrard County]].<ref name=\"harrison11\"/> When Crittenden objected to this violation of Kentucky's neutrality, Nelson replied, \"That a camp of loyal Union men, native Kentuckians, should assemble in camp under the flag of the Union and upon their native soil [and] should be a cause of apprehension is something I do not clearly understand.\"<ref>Harrison, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> Governor Magoffin appealed to President Lincoln to close the camp, but he refused.<ref name=harrison12>Harrison, p. 12.</ref> Meanwhile, Confederate volunteers covertly crossed the Tennessee border and massed at [[Camp Boone]], just south of [[Guthrie, Kentucky|Guthrie]].<ref name=harrison12 /> Kentucky's fragile neutrality was nearing an end.\n\n==Neutrality violated==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1861 abstract return showing Union Forces in Kentucky, commanded by Brig.

Grant left [[Cairo, Illinois]] and entered [[Paducah, Kentucky]] on September 6, which gave the Union control of the northern end of the [[New Orleans and Ohio Railroad]]<ref name=kleber216 /> and the mouth of the [[Tennessee River]]. Governor Magoffin denounced both sides for violating the Commonwealth's neutrality, calling for both sides to withdraw.<ref name=harrison13>Harrison, p. 13.</ref> However, on September 7, 1861, the General Assembly passed a resolution ordering the withdrawal of only Confederate forces.<ref name=harrison13 /> Magoffin vetoed the resolution, but both houses overrode the veto, and Magoffin issued the proclamation.<ref>Harrison in ''Kentucky Governors'', p. 79.</ref> The General Assembly ordered the flag of the United States to be raised over the [[Kentucky State Capitol|state capitol]] in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]], declaring its allegiance with the Union.\n\nIts neutrality broken, both sides quickly moved to establish advantageous positions in the Commonwealth. Confederate forces under [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] formed a line in the southern regions of Kentucky and the northern regions of Tennessee, stretching from Columbus in the west to [[Cumberland Gap]] in the east.<ref name=rose15>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 15.</ref> Johnston dispatched Simon B. Buckner to fortify the middle of the line in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]].<ref name=harrison16>Harrison, p. 16.</ref> Buckner arrived on September 18, 1861 and immediately began intensive drill sessions and constructing elaborate defenses in anticipation of a Union strike.<ref name=harrison17>Harrison, p. 17.</ref> So extensive were the fortifications at Bowling Green that a Union officer who later surveyed them commented, \"The labor has been immense\u2013 their troops cannot be well drilled\u2013 their time must have been chiefly spent in hard work, with the axe and spade.\"<ref name=harrison17 />\n\n==Confederate state government==\n{{main|Confederate government of Kentucky}}\n[[File:Seal of Kentucky (Confederate shadow government).svg|thumb|left|The Seal of Kentucky used during the [[George W.

Following a preliminary meeting on October 29, 1861, delegates from 68 of [[List of counties in Kentucky|Kentucky's 110 counties]] met at the [[William Forst House|Clark House]] in [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]] on November 18.<ref name=kleber222>Kleber, p. 222.</ref> The convention passed an ordinance of secession, adopted a new state seal, and elected [[Scott County, Kentucky|Scott County]] native [[George W.

Johnson and Richard Hawes: The Governors of Confederate Kentucky\"</ref> Being unable to flesh out a complete constitution and system of laws, the delegates voted that \"the [[Kentucky Constitution|Constitution]] and laws of Kentucky, not inconsistent with the acts of this Convention, and the establishment of this Government, and the laws which may be enacted by the Governor and Council, shall be the laws of this state.\"<ref name=cantrell /> Though President Davis had some reservation about the circumvention of the elected General Assembly in forming the Confederate government, Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10, 1861.<ref name=rose64>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 64.</ref> Kentucky was represented by the central star on the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America#Battle flag|Confederate battle flag]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ngeorgia.com/history/flagsofga.html |title=A Concise History of the Flags of the Confederate States of America and the Sovereign State of Georgia |accessdate=November 29, 2006 |last=Irby, Jr. |first=Richard E. |work=About North Georgia |publisher=Golden Ink}}</ref>\n\nThough it existed throughout the war, Kentucky's provisional government had very little effect on the events in the Commonwealth or in the war.

Smith's more experienced troops broke the center of the Union line, and Mahlon fell back to Richmond Cemetery.<ref name=rose80 /> By the afternoon, General Nelson arrived and tried to rally the troops. Riding along the front of the Union line, the portly Nelson exclaimed, \"Boys, if they can't hit me, they can't hit a barn door!\"<ref name=rose80 /> Unfortunately for Nelson, he was soon hit twice by Confederate gunfire.<ref name=harrison41>Harrison, p. 41.</ref> Though Nelson was seriously wounded, he escaped the battle as Confederate cavalry moved to cut off the Union retreat.<ref name=harrison42>Harrison, p. 42.</ref> He left behind 206 killed, 844 wounded, and 4,303 missing.<ref name=kleber773>Kleber, p. 773.</ref> With only 98 killed, 492 wounded, and 10 missing, Smith had won one of the most complete Confederate victories of the entire war.<ref name=kleber773 />\n\n===Battle of Munfordville===\n{{main|Battle of Munfordville}}\nWhile Smith was continuing on to Lexington, Bragg was just entering Kentucky, having delayed at Chattanooga until August 28.<ref name=harrison42 /> Bragg was told that there were ample supplies in the Glasgow area, but upon learning that Bragg had entered Kentucky, Buell left George Thomas to guard Nashville and moved the rest of his army to heavily fortified Bowling Green.<ref>Harrison, pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Smith had dispatched Colonel John Scott to look for Bragg.<ref name=harrison44>Harrison, p. 44.</ref> On the night of September 13, Scott encountered [[John T. Wilder]] at Munfordville, and demanded his surrender.<ref name=rose84>Bush in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 84.</ref> Scott requested the aid of [[James Ronald Chalmers|James Chalmers]]' Mississippi brigade,<ref name=harrison44 /> which moved to support Scott throughout the night.<ref name=rose84 /> The assault commenced the next morning, and though outnumbered, Scott's forces inflicted more than 200 casualties in the early fighting.<ref name=harrison44 /> At 9:30 AM, Chalmers tried to intimidate Wilder into surrender, sending a flag of truce with the message, \"You have made a gallant defense of your position, and to avoid further bloodshed I demand an unconditional surrender of your forces. I have six regiments of infantry, one battalion of infantry sharpshooters, and have just been reinforced by a brigade of cavalry, under Colonel Scott, with two battalions of infantry.\" Upon receiving this message, Wilder replied \"Thank you for your compliments. If you wish to avoid further bloodshed, keep out of the reach of my guns.\"<ref name=rose85>Bush in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 85.</ref>\n\nWilder was soon reinforced by Colonel [[Cyrus L. Dunham]], who brought a force of 4,000 men.<ref name=harrison44 /> Scott and Chalmers sought assistance from Bragg's main army.<ref name=harrison44 /> Bragg was incensed, but arrived the next day to take charge of the battle.<ref name=harrison44 /> Bragg deployed forces under [[William J. Hardee]] and Leonidas Polk to surround the town, delaying his assault until September 17.<ref name=harrison44 /> Bragg sent another request for the force's surrender.<ref name=harrison44 /> At a council of war, Wilder made an unusual request of Bragg's subordinate, Simon B. Buckner\u2013 that he be allowed to inspect the forces that now surrounded him to determine whether surrender were the correct course of action.<ref name=harrison45>Harrison, p. 45.</ref> Delighted by this supreme compliment, Buckner obliged, and after surveying the Confederate line, Wilder surrendered.<ref>Harrison, pp. 45\u201346.</ref>\n\nWilder's force of some 4,000 men was paroled and directed to Bowling Green, where Bragg hoped they would be a drain on Buell's supplies.<ref name=harrison46>Harrison, p. 46.</ref> The delay caused by the Confederate victory at Munfordville may well have cost them a much more important prize\u2013 Louisville.<ref name=rose86>Bush in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 86.</ref>\n\n===Inauguration of Governor Hawes===\n[[File:Confederate-Kentucky-Broadside-Issued-by-James-B.-Clay,-October-1862.png|thumb|left|[[Broadside (printing)|Broadside]] by [[James Brown Clay]], October 1862]]\nWhile Bragg rested his troops and planned his next move, Buell marched north from Bowling Green and arrived in Louisville on September 25.<ref name=harrison46 /> Seeing his primary objective fallen into Union hands, Bragg turned to [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], where he had expected to meet Smith.<ref name=harrison46 /> Smith was actually operating independently near Frankfort, and Bragg, now painfully aware that the lack of cooperation with Smith might prove the Confederates' undoing in Kentucky, began to disperse his troops into defensive postures at Bardstown, [[Shelbyville, Kentucky|Shelbyville]], and Danville.<ref name=harrison4748>Harrison, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\nBoth Bragg and Smith had been disappointed with the number of volunteers from Kentucky. Wagonloads of rifles had been sent to the Commonwealth to equip the anticipated recruits, but although Confederate sympathies were high, willing volunteers were not, and many of the rifles remained on the wagons.<ref name=harrison4748 /> Bragg hoped to rally potential recruits by installing [[Richard Hawes]], governor of Kentucky's Confederate shadow government, in an inauguration ceremony in Frankfort.<ref name=harrison48>Harrison, p. 48.</ref> The elected government fled to Louisville just before the Confederates arrived in Frankfort.<ref name=rose88>Hughes in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 88.</ref>\n\nThe ceremony took place on October 4, 1862.<ref name=kleber194>Kleber, p. 194.</ref> First, Bragg addressed the assembled partisan crowd, promising to defend the Commonwealth.<ref name=rose91 /> Then Hawes, who had taken the oath of office months earlier while traveling with Bragg's [[Army of Tennessee]], delivered a lengthy inaugural address.<ref>Harrison in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', pp. 90\u201391.</ref> He told the crowd that the provisional government would \"institute as far as possible such civil institutions, as will protect persons and property, until the people in their sovereign capacity can establish a permanent Government founded on the will of the majority.\"<ref name=rose91 />\n\nThe promises made by Bragg and Hawes were short-lived. Before the inaugural ball could be held, Buell's forces had descended on the state capital, firing artillery shells that shattered the jovial atmosphere and put the Confederate forces to flight.<ref name=rose91 /> Bragg had sorely underestimated Buell's ability to make a rapid advance on his position.<ref name=harrison49>Harrison, p. 49.</ref>  While preparations were being made for Hawes' inauguration, Buell was already forcing the Confederate army from Shelbyville.<ref name=harrison49 /> Bragg ordered Leonidas Polk from Bardstown to attack Buell's flank, but Polk was already under attack and retreating to [[Bryantsville, Kentucky|Bryantsville]].<ref name=harrison49 /> Bragg began a retreat from Frankfort to [[Harrodsburg, Kentucky|Harrodsburg]] to regroup with Polk.<ref name=harrison49 /> Meanwhile, Smith prepared to defend Lexington, where he assumed the bulk of Buell's force would be directed.<ref name=harrison50>Harrison, p. 50.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Perryville===\n{{main|Battle of Perryville}}\n[[File:Harpers-perryville-battle.jpg|thumb|280px|right|The Battle of Perryville battlefield as depicted in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', November 1, 1862]]\nBy October 7, Polk's forces had fallen back to the town of [[Perryville, Kentucky|Perryville]]. The dry summer of 1862 had left water in short supply, and when the Union troops learned of water in Perryville's Doctor's Creek, they began to move on the Confederate position. Bragg shared Smith's assumption that the bulk of the Union attack would be directed at Lexington and Frankfort, and ordered Polk's forces to attack and destroy the approaching Union force before proceeding to [[Versailles, Kentucky|Versailles]] to meet Smith. The Confederate soldiers in Perryville, however, realized that a much larger force was approaching, and assumed a defensive posture. In fact, Buell, [[Charles Champion Gilbert]], [[Alexander McCook]], and [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Thomas Crittenden]] were all approaching Perryville.<ref name=kleber718>Kleber, p. 718.</ref>\n\nThe Confederates were not the only ones to misjudge the situation, however. When Bragg learned that his men had not attacked as ordered, he came to Perryville himself to lead the attack. In realigning to an attack posture, the Confederates stirred such a cloud of dust that the approaching Union force believed they were retreating to Harrodsburg.<ref>Sanders in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', pp. 94\u201395.</ref> This gave Bragg's men the advantage of surprise when they opened fire on McCook's forces at 2 PM on October 8.<ref name=rose95>Sanders in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 95.</ref> While McCook was being pushed back on the left flank, the Union center held strong until the right flank began to collapse.<ref name=rose95 />\n\nIt was not until late afternoon that Buell learned of McCook's plight, whereupon he sent two brigades from Gilbert's corps to reinforce him.<ref name=kleber718 /> This halted the Confederate advance on McCook north of Perryville.<ref name=kleber718 /> Meanwhile, small Confederate brigades encountered Gilbert's force of 20,000 men to the west and Crittenden's force, also 20,000 strong, to the south.<ref name=rose96>Sanders in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 96</ref> Only then did Bragg realize that he was facing Buell's main force, and that he was vastly outnumbered. As night approached and halted the battle, Bragg conferred with his officers and decided to retreat to Harrodsburg to meet Smith.<ref name=kleber718 /> From Harrodsburg, the Confederates exited Kentucky through Cumberland Gap.<ref name=kleber718 /> For the remainder of the war, there would be no concerted efforts by the Confederacy to hold Kentucky.<ref name=rose96 />\n\nOn December 17, 1862, under the terms of [[General Order No. 11 (1862)|General Order No. 11]], thirty Jewish families, longtime residents all, were forced from their homes. [[Cesar Kaskel]], a prominent local Jewish businessman, dispatched a telegram to President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]], and met with him, eventually succeeding in getting the order revoked.\n\n==Morgan strikes again==\n[[File:1863 abstract return showing Union Forces in Kentucky.jpg|frame|right|1863 abstract return showing Union Forces in Kentucky.<ref name=\"orr\"/>]]\nHis inability to engage Bragg and Smith on their retreat from Kentucky led to Buell being replaced by General [[William Rosecrans]].<ref>Harrison, pp. 55\u201356.</ref> Rosecrans encamped at Nashville during the fall and early winter of 1862. Believing that Rosecrans would begin a campaign as soon as sufficient supplies were accumulated, Bragg dispatched John Hunt Morgan back into Kentucky in December 1862 to cut the supply line afforded Rosecrans by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.<ref name=harrison59>Harrison, p. 59.</ref> Morgan's raid was part of a plan to disrupt Union supply lines. While Morgan was moving into Kentucky, Nathan Bedford Forrest was mounting a raid through West Tennessee into the Kentucky Purchase while Earl Van Dorn raided into southern West Tennessee.\n\n===The Christmas Raid===<!-- This section is linked to from the redirect \"Morgan's Christmas Raid\" -->\nMorgan's men crossed into Kentucky on December 22 and captured a Union supply wagon bound for Glasgow.<ref name=harrison60>Harrison, p. 60.</ref> On [[Christmas]] Day, Morgan's men rode through Glasgow, bound for Bacon Creek Station and the L&N bridge span. After quelling the stiff Union resistance, Morgan's men destroyed the bridge and several miles of railroad track.<ref name=harrison60 /> Whatever else might happen, they had succeeded in disrupting Rosecrans' supply line.<ref name=harrison60 />\n\nFrom Bacon Creek, Morgan rode to [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], arriving on December 27.<ref name=harrison60 /> The Union commander, [[Colonel]] H. S. Smith, demanded Morgan's surrender, but Morgan turned the tables, surrounded Smith, and, after a short skirmish, accepted his surrender.<ref>Harrison, pp. 61\u201362.</ref> Again, Morgan destroyed the L&N infrastructure in the area, then began planning an escape back to Tennessee.<ref name=harrison62>Harrison, p. 62.</ref>\n\nColonel [[John Marshall Harlan|John M. Harlan]]'s artillery shelled Morgan's force as it crossed the [[Rolling Fork (Kentucky)|Rolling Fork River]] on December 29, seriously wounding First Brigade commander [[Basil W. Duke]].<ref name=harrison62 /> Duke was taken to Bardstown for medical treatment, however, and recovered in time to rejoin the Confederate retreat the next day.<ref name=harrison62 />\n\nFreezing rain plagued Morgan's men as they encamped at [[Springfield, Kentucky|Springfield]] on the night of December 30.<ref name=harrison62 /> Worse yet, scouts reported a massive Union force concentrated nine miles away at [[Lebanon, Kentucky|Lebanon]].<ref name=harrison62 /> With [[Frank Wolford]]'s men moving on his position, Morgan made the difficult decision to move out just after midnight in ever-worsening weather.<ref name=harrison62 /> He ordered a few companies to create a diversion, feigning an attack on Lebanon and burning fence rails to give the appearance of campfires, while the main body of his force continued to [[Campbellsville, Kentucky|Campbellsville]].<ref name=harrison62 /> The plan worked, and following a march that many described as their most miserable night of the war, Morgan's men arrived safely in Campbellsville on [[New Year's Eve]] and captured some welcome supplies.<ref>Harrison, pp. 62\u201363.</ref> The following day, they proceeded through [[Columbia, Kentucky|Columbia]], and returned to Tennessee on January 3.<ref name=harrison63>Harrison, p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Morgan crosses the Ohio===\n{{main|Morgan's Raid}}\n{{see also|Battle of Lebanon}}\nFollowing the Christmas Raid, there were only minor incursions into Kentucky by various units under [[Roy Cluke]], [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram]], [[Humphrey Marshall (general)|Humphrey Marshall]], among others.<ref>Harrison, pp. 63\u201364.</ref> Frustrated Union commanders could only react to these unpredictable raids.<ref name=harrison64>Harrison, p. 64.</ref> Morgan would soon do them a favor, however, by raising the visibility of his next raid.<ref name=harrison64 />\n\nIt was widely reported that since his December 1862 marriage, Morgan had lost some of his bravado.<ref>Thomas, p. 73.</ref> Morgan, eager to dispel such rumors and weary of guarding Bragg's left flank,<ref name=harrison64 /> proposed a raid through Kentucky and across the [[Ohio River]].<ref>Thomas, p. 75.</ref> Bragg, fearing an attack from Rosecrans, welcomed the idea of a distraction that would take the pressure off his [[Army of Tennessee]].<ref>Thomas, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> Morgan gathered his men to an area between [[Liberty, Tennessee|Liberty]] and [[Alexandria, Tennessee]].<ref name=thomas76>Thomas, p. 76.</ref> On June 10, he addressed his unit, telling them that Bragg had sanctioned a raid to Louisville, and if conditions permitted, across the Ohio River into [[Indiana]] and possibly [[Ohio]].<ref name=thomas76 /> He confided Bragg's true orders\u2013 to halt at the Ohio River\u2013 only to trusted confidant Basil Duke.<ref>Thomas, pp. 76\u201377.</ref>\n\nThe raid was delayed by orders to intercept a Union raiding party moving on [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], but after three miserable weeks of floundering through muddy conditions, Morgan's men still had not located the enemy.<ref name=harrison65>Harrison, p. 65.</ref> They finally began entering Kentucky on July 2, 1863.<ref name=harrison65 /> Two days later, Morgan engaged Colonel Orlando Moore's forces at [[Battle of Tebbs Bend|Tebbs Bend]], where a bridge crossed the [[Green River (Kentucky)|Green River]]<ref name=harrison66>Harrison, p. 66.</ref> near Campbellsville.<ref name=thomas77>Thomas, p. 77.</ref> As was his custom, Morgan demanded an unconditional surrender, but Moore, noting that this was [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], replied \"It is a bad day for surrender, and I would rather not.\"<ref name=harrison66 /> Moore's forces won the day, and Morgan, having suffered 71 casualties, decided to bypass the bridge.<ref name=harrison66 />\n\n[[File:Brandenburg Morgan marker.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Historical marker noting Morgan's activities at [[Brandenburg, Kentucky]], where his forces captured two [[steamboat]]s, the ''John B.

Besides obtaining mounts for the mounted-infantry-to-be, Forrest intended to disrupt Union supply lines, obtain general provisions for Confederate forces, and discourage enlistment of blacks in Kentucky into the Union army.<ref name=kleber706>Kleber, p. 706.</ref>\n\nOn March 25, 1864, Forrest commenced his attack.<ref name=kleber706 /> He met Colonel [[Stephen G.

Thompson]], a native of the area, did briefly attempt to capture it before being killed with 24 men from his unit.<ref name=harrison71 /> Forrest held the city for ten hours, destroying the Union headquarters, as well as the buildings housing the quartermaster and commissary.<ref name=kleber706 /> Forrest also captured a total of 200 horses and mules before withdrawing to [[Mayfield, Kentucky|Mayfield]].<ref name=kleber706 /> Following the raid, Forrest granted [[furlough]] to the Kentuckians under his command so they could secure better clothing and mounts.<ref name=kleber706 /> As agreed, every man reported back to [[Trenton, Tennessee]] on April 4.<ref name=harrison71 />\n\nUnionist newspapers bragged after the raid that Union forces had hidden the best horses in the area and that Forrest had only captured horses stolen from private citizens.<ref name=harrison71 /> Furious, Forrest ordered Buford back into Kentucky.<ref name=harrison71 /> Buford's men arrived on April 14, forced Hicks back into the fort, and captured an additional 140 horses in the [[foundry]], exactly where the newspaper reports had placed them.<ref name=harrison71 /> They then rejoined Forrest in Tennessee.<ref name=harrison71 /> The raid was not only successful in terms of gaining additional mounts, but provided a diversion for Forrest's [[Battle of Fort Pillow|attack on Fort Pillow, Tennessee]].<ref name=kleber706 />\n\n==1864\u20131865: Military rule==\nIn response to the growing problem of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaigns]] throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. [[Stephen G. Burbridge]] was given command over the commonwealth of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with [[martial law]] authorized by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor [[Thomas E. Bramlette]], Burbridge was dismissed in February 1865.

It officially declared its neutrality at the beginning of the war, but after a failed attempt by Confederate General [[Leonidas Polk]] to take the state of Kentucky for the Confederacy, the legislature petitioned the [[Union Army]] for assistance. After early 1862 Kentucky came largely under Union control.\n\nKentucky was the site of several fierce battles, including [[Battle of Mill Springs|Mill Springs]] and [[Battle of Perryville|Perryville]]. It was host to such military leaders as [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] side, who first encountered serious [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] gunfire coming from [[Columbus, Kentucky]], and Confederate cavalry leader [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]]. Forrest proved to be a scourge to the [[Union Army]] in western Kentucky, even making an attack on [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]]. Kentuckian [[John Hunt Morgan]] further challenged Union control, as he conducted numerous cavalry raids through the state.\n\nKentucky was the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary Todd]], and his southern counterpart, [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]]. Lincoln had declared, early in the war, \"I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.\"\n\nIn the historiography of the Civil War, Kentucky is treated primarily as a border state, with special attention to the social divisions during the secession crisis, invasions and raids, internal violence, sporadic guerrilla warfare, federal-state relations, the ending of slavery, and the return of Confederate veterans.<ref>John David Smith, \"Whither Kentucky Civil War and Reconstruction Scholarship?.\" ''Register of the Kentucky Historical Society ''112.2 (2014): 223-247.</ref>\n\n35,000 Kentuckians served as Confederate soldiers; an estimated 125,000 Kentuckians served as Union soldiers.<ref>Quisenberry, A.

In 1860, slaves composed 19.5% of the Commonwealth's population, and many Unionist Kentuckians saw nothing wrong with the \"[[peculiar institution]]\".<ref>Harrison, p. 1.</ref> The Commonwealth was further bound to the South by the [[Mississippi River]] and its tributaries, which were the main commercial outlet for her surplus produce, although [[railroad]] connections to the North were beginning to diminish the importance of this tie.<ref name=harrison2>Harrison, p. 2.</ref> The ancestors of many Kentuckians hailed from Southern states like [[Virginia]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]], but many Kentucky children were beginning to migrate toward the North.<ref name=harrison2 />\n\nKentucky, along with [[North Carolina]], also boasted the best educational systems in the South. [[Transylvania University]] had long been one of the most respected institutions of higher learning in the nation, and while its reputation had begun to fade by 1860, other Kentucky schools like [[Centre College]] and [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]] were gaining prominence.<ref>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 13.</ref>\n\nPolitically, the Commonwealth had produced some of the country's best known leaders. Former Vice-Presidents [[John C. Breckinridge]] and [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] both hailed from the state, as did [[Henry Clay]], [[John J. Crittenden]], U.S. President [[Abraham Lincoln]], and Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]].<ref>Klotter in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 14.</ref> However, by the time of the Civil War, Kentucky was in a politically confused state. The decline of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], which Clay had founded, had left many politicians looking for an identity.<ref name=\"harrison4\">Harrison, p. 4.</ref> Many joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], a few joined the newly formed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], while still others associated with one of numerous minor parties such as the [[Know Nothing Party]].<ref name=harrison4 /> In the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]], with Tennessee-native [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] as its presidential candidate and Massachusetts-native [[Edward Everett]] as its vice-presidential candidate, won the state. The party was composed mainly of former Whigs and Know-Nothings.<ref>[http://onthebrinkofdisunion-theelectionof1860.weebly.com/constitutional-union-party.html Constitutional Union Party] Retrieved March 29, 2016.</ref>\n\nKentucky was strategically important to both the North and South. The Commonwealth ranked ninth in population by 1860, and was a major producer of such agricultural commodities as [[tobacco]], [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]].<ref name=harrison2 /> Geographically, Kentucky was important to the South because the [[Ohio River]] would provide a defensible boundary along the entire length of the state.<ref name=harrison2 />\n\n[[Governor of Kentucky|Kentucky governor]] [[Beriah Magoffin]] believed that the rights of the Southern states had been violated and favored the right of secession, but sought all possible avenues to avoid it.<ref>Harrison, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> On December 9, 1860, he sent a letter to the other slave state governors suggesting that they come to an agreement with the North that would include strict enforcement of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], a division of common territories at the [[37th parallel north#United States|37th parallel]], a guarantee of free use of the [[Mississippi River]], and a Southern [[veto]] over slave legislation.<ref name=harrison7>Harrison, p. 7.</ref> Magoffin proposed a conference of slave states, followed by a conference of all the states to secure these concessions.<ref name=harrison7 /> Due to the escalating pace of events, neither conference was ever held.<ref name=harrison7 />\n\nMagoffin called a special session of the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] on December 27, 1860, and asked legislators for a convention of Kentuckians to decide the Commonwealth's course regarding secession.<ref name=harrison7 /> The majority of the General Assembly had Unionist sympathies, however, and declined the governor's request,<ref name=harrison7 /> fearing that the state's voters would favor secession.<ref name=\"Rose, p. 26\">Harrison in ''Kentucky's Civil War 1861\u20131865'', p. 26.</ref> The Assembly did, however, send six delegates to a February 4 [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and asked [[United States Congress|Congress]] to call a national convention to consider potential resolutions to the secession crisis, including the [[Crittenden Compromise]], authored by Kentuckian [[John J. Crittenden]].<ref name=harrison8>Harrison, p. 8.</ref>\n\nWhen the General Assembly convened again on March 20, it called for a convention of the [[Border states (Civil War)|border states]] in the Kentucky capital of [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] on May 27, 1861.<ref name=harrison8 /> Again, the call went unheeded. Legislators also passed a [[Corwin Amendment|proposed Thirteenth Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of the United States of America|Constitution]] that would have guaranteed slavery in states where it was already legal.<ref name=harrison8 />\n\n[[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] recognized the importance of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|Commonwealth]] when, in a September 1861 letter to [[Orville Hickman Browning|Orville Browning]],<ref name=brown79>Brown, p. 79.</ref> he had written:\n\n<blockquote>I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.

B. Magoffin\"<ref>Powell, p. 52.</ref> Instead, most Kentuckians favored John J. Crittenden's position that the Commonwealth should act as a mediator between the two sides.<ref name=harrison8 /> To that end, both houses of the General Assembly passed [[Kentucky Declaration of Neutrality|declarations of neutrality]], a position officially declared by Governor Magoffin on May 20, 1861.<ref name=harrison8 />\n\nBoth sides respected the Commonwealth's neutrality, but positioned themselves strategically to take advantage of any change in the situation. Union forces established Camp Clay in [[Ohio]] just north of the city of [[Newport, Kentucky]] and [[Camp Joe Holt]] in [[Indiana]] opposite [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name=kleber192>Kleber, p. 192.</ref> Meanwhile, Confederate troops constructed Forts [[Fort Donelson|Donelson]] and [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] just across Kentucky's southern border in [[Tennessee]], and stationed troops fewer than 50 yards from [[Cumberland Gap]].<ref name=kleber192 /> Volunteers from the Commonwealth left the state to join up with whichever side they favored.<ref name=kleber192 /> Some covert recruiting also took place.<ref name=harrison9>Harrison, p. 9.</ref> Nearly 60 infantry regiments served in the Union armies versus just 9 in the Confederate. However, a rather large number of cavalry outfits joined the latter. John Breckenridge originally commanded the \"Orphan Brigade\" of the Army of Tennessee, consisting of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, and 9th Kentucky Infantry. The brigade's nickname came about allegedly because the soldiers' home counties were occupied by Union troops for most of the war and they couldn't go home to them.\n\nRealizing that neutrality was becoming less and less feasible, six prominent Kentuckians met to find some solution for a state caught in the middle of a conflict. Governor Magoffin, John C. Breckinridge, and [[Richard Hawes]] represented the secessionists' position, while Crittenden, [[Archibald Dixon]], and S. S.

Magoffin's [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], [[Linn Boyd]], had died in office, and Senate Speaker John Fisk, next in line for the governorship, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. In an intricate plan worked out with the General Assembly, Fisk resigned as speaker and the Senate elevated Magoffin's chosen successor, [[James Fisher Robinson|James F. Robinson]], to the post. Magoffin then resigned, promoting Robinson to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Senate Speaker.\n\nAlmost immediately following the results of the 1861 election, [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]] established [[Camp Dick Robinson]], a Union recruiting camp, in [[Garrard County, Kentucky|Garrard County]].<ref name=\"harrison11\"/> When Crittenden objected to this violation of Kentucky's neutrality, Nelson replied, \"That a camp of loyal Union men, native Kentuckians, should assemble in camp under the flag of the Union and upon their native soil [and] should be a cause of apprehension is something I do not clearly understand.\"<ref>Harrison, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> Governor Magoffin appealed to President Lincoln to close the camp, but he refused.<ref name=harrison12>Harrison, p. 12.</ref> Meanwhile, Confederate volunteers covertly crossed the Tennessee border and massed at [[Camp Boone]], just south of [[Guthrie, Kentucky|Guthrie]].<ref name=harrison12 /> Kentucky's fragile neutrality was nearing an end.\n\n==Neutrality violated==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1861 abstract return showing Union Forces in Kentucky, commanded by Brig.

Besides obtaining mounts for the mounted-infantry-to-be, Forrest intended to disrupt Union supply lines, obtain general provisions for Confederate forces, and discourage enlistment of blacks in Kentucky into the Union army.<ref name=kleber706>Kleber, p. 706.</ref>\n\nOn March 25, 1864, Forrest commenced his attack.<ref name=kleber706 /> He met Colonel [[Stephen G.

Thompson]], a native of the area, did briefly attempt to capture it before being killed with 24 men from his unit.<ref name=harrison71 /> Forrest held the city for ten hours, destroying the Union headquarters, as well as the buildings housing the quartermaster and commissary.<ref name=kleber706 /> Forrest also captured a total of 200 horses and mules before withdrawing to [[Mayfield, Kentucky|Mayfield]].<ref name=kleber706 /> Following the raid, Forrest granted [[furlough]] to the Kentuckians under his command so they could secure better clothing and mounts.<ref name=kleber706 /> As agreed, every man reported back to [[Trenton, Tennessee]] on April 4.<ref name=harrison71 />\n\nUnionist newspapers bragged after the raid that Union forces had hidden the best horses in the area and that Forrest had only captured horses stolen from private citizens.<ref name=harrison71 /> Furious, Forrest ordered Buford back into Kentucky.<ref name=harrison71 /> Buford's men arrived on April 14, forced Hicks back into the fort, and captured an additional 140 horses in the [[foundry]], exactly where the newspaper reports had placed them.<ref name=harrison71 /> They then rejoined Forrest in Tennessee.<ref name=harrison71 /> The raid was not only successful in terms of gaining additional mounts, but provided a diversion for Forrest's [[Battle of Fort Pillow|attack on Fort Pillow, Tennessee]].<ref name=kleber706 />\n\n==1864\u20131865: Military rule==\nIn response to the growing problem of [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaigns]] throughout 1863 and 1864, in June 1864, Maj. Gen. [[Stephen G. Burbridge]] was given command over the commonwealth of Kentucky. This began an extended period of military control that would last through early 1865, beginning with [[martial law]] authorized by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. To pacify Kentucky, Burbridge rigorously suppressed disloyalty and used economic pressure as coercion. His guerrilla policy, which included public execution of four guerrillas for the death of each unarmed Union citizen, caused the most controversy. After a falling out with Governor [[Thomas E. Bramlette]], Burbridge was dismissed in February 1865. Confederates remembered him as the \"Butcher of Kentucky\".<ref>Louis De Falaise, \"General Stephen Gano Burbridge's Command in Kentucky\", ''Register of the Kentucky Historical Society'', April 1971, Vol. 69 Issue 2, pp. 101-127.</ref>\n\n==Order of battle for Union forces in Kentucky==\n*Data is from ''Tabular Statements Showing the Names of Commanders of Army Corps, Divisions and Brigades, United States Army, During the War of 1861 to 1865'', compiled from the data on record in the office of the Quartermaster General of the Army, Gen.
