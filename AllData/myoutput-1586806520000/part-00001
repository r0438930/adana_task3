At the same time Chernorizets Hrabar opposes Glagolitic dogmatists{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} and makes several suggestions as to how the alphabet can be further improved.\n\nHe also provided information critical to Slavonic [[palaeography]] with his mention that the pre-Christian Slavs employed \"strokes and incisions\" ({{lang-cu|\u0447\u0440\u044a\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0440\u0463\u0437\u044b}}, ''\u010dr\u016dty i r\u011bzy''), translated as \"tallies and sketches\" below) writing that was, apparently, insufficient properly to reflect the spoken language. It is thought that this may have been a form of [[runic script]] but no authentic examples are known to have survived.\n\n===Textual criticism===\n\nThe manuscript of ''On the Letters'' has been preserved in 79 copies in seven families of texts, including five contaminated manuscripts, plus four abridgements independent of the seven families.<ref name=Veder /> All of these families probably ultimately share a common [[wikt:protograph|protograph]].<ref name=Veder /> Not one of the textual families contains an optimal text, and none of them can be established to be the source of any other.<ref name=Veder /> None of the text families can be shown to have dialectal features, albeit some of the individual manuscripts in the families do have them.<ref name=Veder /> The protograph was written in Glagolitic, and it underwent significant change or corruption in the course of its successive transcription into seven families of Cyrillic texts.<ref name=Veder /> Today only Cyrillic manuscripts survive.<ref name=Veder /> The [[wikt:hyparchetype|hyparchetypes]] of all seven families give the number of the letters in the alphabet as 38, but the original Glagolitic alphabet had only 36, as attested in the acrostic of [[Constantine of Preslav]]; however, one of the abridgements instead gives the number as 37 and another gives it as 42.<ref name=Veder />\n\nThe oldest surviving manuscript copy dates back to 1348 and was made by the monk Laurentius for Tsar [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]]. The work has also been printed in [[Vilnius]] (1575\u20131580), [[Moscow]] (1637), [[Saint Petersburg]] (1776), [[Supra\u015bl]] (1781).\n\n=== Excerpt ===\n{{Script/Slavonic|\u041f\u0440\u0463\u0436\u0434\u0435 \u0479\u0431\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u0438\u043c\u0463\u0445\u046b \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044a \u00b7 \u043d\u046b \u0447\u0440\u044a\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0463\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0447\u044c\u0442\u0463\u0445\u046b \u0438 \u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0430\u0445\u046b \u043f\u043e\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u046b\u0449\u0435 \u00b7 \u043a\u0440\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0432\u0448\u0435 \u0436\u0435 \u0441\u0467 \u00b7 \u0440\u0438\u043c\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0433\u0440\u044a\u0447\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044b \u00b7 \u043d\u046b\u0436\u0434\u0430\u0430\u0445\u046b \u0441\u0467 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u0441\u043a\u044b \u0440\u0463\u0447\u044c \u0431\u0435\u0437\u044a \u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0430\u2026 \u041f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0436\u0435 \u0447\u043b\u0483\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044e\u0431\u0435\u0446\u044a \u0431\u0483\u044a\u2026 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u044c \u0441\u0442\u0483\u0433\u043e \u041a\u0461\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0444\u0430 \u00b7 \u043d\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0433\u043e \u041a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u00b7 \u043c\u046b\u0436\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u00b7 \u0438 \u0441\u044a\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u044a \u00b7 \u043b\u0483 \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0438 \u043e\u0441\u043c\u044c \u00b7 \u0461\u0432\u0430 \u0443\u0431\u0461 \u043f\u043e \u0447\u0438\u043d\u0479 \u0413\u0440\u044a\u0447\u044c\u0441\u043a\u044a\u0131\u0445\u044c \u043f\u0438\u0441\u043c\u0435\u043d\u044a \u00b7 \u0461\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u044a\u0441\u0442\u0463\u0438 \u0440\u0463\u0447\u0438}}\n:''Being still pagans, the Slavs did not have their own letters, but read and communicated by means of tallies and sketches.<ref group=note>Note: \"by means of tallies and sketches\" - the original \"\u0447\u0440\u044a\u0442\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u0440\u0463\u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\" is literally translated as \"by means of drawn and cut drawings\", i.e., \"by means of strokes and incisions\"</ref> After their baptism they were forced to use Roman and Greek letters in the transcription of their Slavic words but these were not suitable ...<ref group=note>In this place are listed eleven examples of Slavic words, such as \"\u0436\u0438\u0432\u0463\u0442\u044a\" /\u017eiv\u011bt\u016d/ \"life\", which can be hardly written using the unadapted Roman or Greek letters (i.e. without [[diacritic]] changing their sound-values).</ref> At last, God, in his love for mankind, sent them St. Constantine the Philosopher, called [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Cyril]], a learned and upright man, who composed for them thirty-eight letters, some (24 of them) similar to the Greek, but some (14 of them) different, suitable to express Slavic sounds.''{{who|date=May 2016}}<!-- who translated-->\n\n==Legacy==\n\n[[Hrabar Nunatak]] on [[Greenwich Island (South Shetland Islands)|Greenwich Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named for Chernorizets Hrabar.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Clement of Ohrid]] \n* [[Constantine of Preslav]]\n* [[John Exarch]]\n* [[Cosmas the Priest]]\n*[[Pre-Christian Slavic writing]]\n*[[History of Bulgaria]]\n*[[Simeon I of Bulgaria]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hrabar, Chernorizets}}\n[[Category:9th-century births]]\n[[Category:10th-century deaths]]\n[[Category:9th-century Bulgarian people]]\n[[Category:10th-century Bulgarian people]]\n[[Category:Medieval Bulgarian writers|Chernorizets Hrabar]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian male writers|Chernorizets Hrabar]]\n[[Category:Old Church Slavonic literature|An Account of Letters]]\n[[Category:Medieval writers|Chernorizets Hrabar]]\n[[Category:Preslav Literary School]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernorizets_Hrabar"}
