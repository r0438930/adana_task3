The [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] of the oblast is the city of [[Kyiv]] ({{lang-uk|\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432}}, ''Kyiv''), which also serves as the capital of Ukraine. Despite being located in the center of the Kyiv Oblast, and hosting the governing bodies of the oblast, Kyiv itself is a self-governing city with special status and not under oblast jurisdiction.\n\nKyiv Oblast neither corresponds to nor is limited to the unofficially designated [[Kyiv metropolitan area]] although it is significantly dependent on the urban economy and transportation of the latter.\n\nThe largest city in the oblast is [[Bila Tserkva]].\n\nThe [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] is technically located within the northern part of the Kyiv Oblast but access to the Zone is prohibited to the public and it is administered separately from the oblast.\n\n==Geography==\nKyiv Oblast has a total area of {{convert|28100|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} (approximately 35 times the area of Kyiv city) and is located in north-central Ukraine. On the west it borders the [[Zhytomyr Oblast]], on the Southwest \u2013 [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], on the South \u2013 [[Cherkasy Oblast]], on the Southeast \u2013 [[Poltava Oblast]], on the East and Northeast \u2013 [[Chernihiv Oblast]], and on the North \u2013 [[Homiel Voblast|Homyel Voblasts]] of [[Belarus]].\n\nThe oblast is equally split between the both banks of [[Dnieper River]] (''Dnipro'') north and south of Kyiv. Other significant rivers in the oblast are the [[Dnieper River#Tributaries of the Dnieper|Dnieper's tributaries]]: [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]] (''Prypiat'') (R), [[Desna River|Desna]] (L), [[Teteriv River|Teteriv]] (R), [[Irpin River|Irpin']] (R), [[Ros' River|Ros']] (R) and [[Trubizh]] (L).\n\nThe length of the Dnipro River within the boundaries of the oblast totals {{convert|246|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The oblast has a total number of 177 rivers intersecting the region; 13 reservoirs (the most notable ones being [[Kyiv Reservoir]] and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]]), over 2000 ponds, and approximately 750 small lakes.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate of Kyiv Oblast is characteristic of the [[Polesia]] area and other neighboring forested areas. The oblast has a moderately [[continental climate]] with relatively mild winters and warm summers. The temperatures range from {{convert|-6.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|19.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} degrees in July{{dubious|date=December 2012}}.\n\n[[File:Oleksandriia Park in Bila Tserkva.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of the historical [[Landscape garden|landscape park]] \"Alexandria\" in the city of [[Bila Tserkva]].]]\n\n===Vegetation===\n\nKyiv Oblast has small mountains and slopes on the right bank of the Dnieper River. This entire area is surrounded by a continuous belt by greenery and forests. The oblast's \"green area\" covers {{convert|436|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, characterized by 250 different sorts of trees and bushes.\n\n==History==\nKyiv Oblast was officially created as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on February 27, 1932.\n\nEarlier historical administrative units that later became the territory of the oblast include the [[Kyiv Voivodeship]] under the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Kyiv Governorate]] under the [[Russian Empire]]. The northern part of the oblast belongs to the historical region of [[Polesia]] (''Polissia'').\n\nIn Kyiv region, there was a specific folk icon-painting style much influenced by the [[Kyiv Pechersk Lavra]] painting school. Saints were depicted on the deep purple or black background, their clothes dark, their haloes dark blue, dark green or even black, outlined by thin white dotted contours. The Kyiv region's icons' collection is the part of the exhibition of the [[Museum of Ukrainian home icons]] in the Historical and cultural complex \"[[Radomysl Castle|The Radomysl Castle]]\".<ref>\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446\u044c. \u041e. \"\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a-\u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0428\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0443 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0432 Via Regia\". \u2014 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432, 2013</ref>\n\nThe current borders of the oblast were last set following the [[Chernobyl accident]] in 1986. Administrative oversight of the new city of [[Slavutych]], which was constructed as part of the [[Chernihiv Oblast]], was then transferred to the Kyiv Oblast (''see [[#Chernobyl zone|Chernobyl zone]] below'').\n\n==Points of interest==\nThe following historic-cultural sites were nominated for the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]].\n* [[Pereiaslav]] museum of folk architecture\n* [[Liutych platzdarm]]\n* [[Ivan Kozlovsky]] villa\n* [[Dobranychivka settlement]]\n* [[Saint Pokrov Church (Parkhomivka)]]\n* [[Museum-villa of Ekaterina Bilokur]]\n* [[Landscape garden Oleksandria]]\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{main article|Administrative divisions of Kyiv Oblast}}\nThe oblast is subdivided into 25 [[raions]] (''administrative districts''). It consists of [[List of cities in Ukraine|26 cities]], [[List of urban-type settlements in Ukraine by subdivision|30 towns]], and more than [[List of villages in Kyiv Oblast|1,000 villages]].\n\nThe following data incorporates the number of each type of administrative divisions of Kyiv Oblast:<ref name=\"KyivRegionStatistics07\">''Statistical Yearbook of Kyiv Region for 2007'', Main Department of Statistics in Kyiv Region, 2008</ref>\n\n* Administrative Center \u2013 1 ([[Kyiv]])\n* [[Raions]] \u2013 25;\n* Settlements \u2013 1183, including:\n** Villages \u2013 1127;\n** Cities/Towns \u2013 56, including:\n*** [[Urban-type settlement]] \u2013 30;\n*** Cities \u2013 25, including:\n**** Cities of oblast' subordinance \u2013 13;\n**** Cities of raion subordinance \u2013 14;\n* [[Selsoviet]]s \u2013 605.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Map of Kyivska Oblast.gif|thumb|250px|Detailed map of Kyiv Oblast, with [[raion]]s and administrative centers.]] -->\n\nAs with other oblasts of Ukraine, the head of the Kyiv Oblast State Administration (governor) is appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]] and subordinated to the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]]. Local self-government body is the popularly elected Kyiv Oblast Rada, chaired by a Speaker (elected from among the councilors).\n\n===The \"exclaves\"===\nThe municipality of [[Slavutych]] is located within the borders of the neighboring [[Chernihiv Oblast]] on the eastern bank of the [[Dnieper]] river and the municipality has no common border with the Kyiv Oblast. Still, Slavutych is administrated by the Kyiv Oblast authorities (being a kind of administrative [[exclave]]).\n\nSimilarly, the town of [[Kotsiubynske]], which is located within the borders of [[Kyiv|Kyiv city]] (which is itself surrounded by the Kyiv Oblast), is administrated by the Irpin city council.\n\n===Chernobyl zone===\n{{main article|Chernobyl Exclusion Zone}}\n\nThe north-western end of the oblast is a part of the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] due to the [[radioactive contamination]] caused by the [[Chernobyl accident|Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident]]. The largest cities within zone are [[Chernobyl (city)|Chernobyl]] and [[Prypiat, Ukraine|Prypiat]], which are now abandoned (''see [[ghost town]]s'').

The [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] of the oblast is the city of [[Kiev]] ({{lang-uk|\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432}}, ''Kyiv''), which also serves as the capital of Ukraine. Despite being located in the center of the Kiev Oblast, and hosting the governing bodies of the oblast, Kiev itself is a self-governing city with special status and not under oblast jurisdiction.\n\nKiev Oblast neither corresponds to nor is limited to the unofficially designated [[Kiev metropolitan area]] although it is significantly dependent on the urban economy and transportation of the latter.\n\nThe largest city in the oblast is [[Bila Tserkva]].\n\nThe [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] is technically located within the northern part of the Kiev Oblast but access to the Zone is prohibited to the public and it is administered separately from the oblast.\n\n==Geography==\nKiev Oblast has a total area of {{convert|28100|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} (approximately 35 times the area of Kiev city) and is located in north-central Ukraine. On the west it borders the [[Zhytomyr Oblast]], on the Southwest \u2013 [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], on the South \u2013 [[Cherkasy Oblast]], on the Southeast \u2013 [[Poltava Oblast]], on the East and Northeast \u2013 [[Chernihiv Oblast]], and on the North \u2013 [[Homiel Voblast|Homyel Voblasts]] of [[Belarus]].\n\nThe oblast is equally split between the both banks of [[Dnieper River]] (''Dnipro'') north and south of Kyiv. Other significant rivers in the oblast are the [[Dnieper River#Tributaries of the Dnieper|Dnieper's tributaries]]: [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]] (''Prypiat'') (R), [[Desna River|Desna]] (L), [[Teteriv River|Teteriv]] (R), [[Irpin River|Irpin']] (R), [[Ros' River|Ros']] (R) and [[Trubizh]] (L).\n\nThe length of the Dnipro River within the boundaries of the oblast totals {{convert|246|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The oblast has a total number of 177 rivers intersecting the region; 13 reservoirs (the most notable ones being [[Kiev Reservoir]] and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]]), over 2000 ponds, and approximately 750 small lakes.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate of Kiev Oblast is characteristic of the [[Polesia]] area and other neighboring forested areas. The oblast has a moderately [[continental climate]] with relatively mild winters and warm summers. The temperatures range from {{convert|-6.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|19.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} degrees in July{{dubious|date=December 2012}}.\n\n[[File:Oleksandriia Park in Bila Tserkva.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of the historical [[Landscape garden|landscape park]] \"Alexandria\" in the city of [[Bila Tserkva]].]]\n\n===Vegetation===\n\nKiev Oblast has small mountains and slopes on the right bank of the Dnieper River. This entire area is surrounded by a continuous belt by greenery and forests. The oblast's \"green area\" covers {{convert|436|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, characterized by 250 different sorts of trees and bushes.\n\n==History==\nKiev Oblast was officially created as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on February 27, 1932.\n\nEarlier historical administrative units that later became the territory of the oblast include the [[Kiev Voivodeship]] under the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Kiev Governorate]] under the [[Russian Empire]]. The northern part of the oblast belongs to the historical region of [[Polesia]] (''Polissia'').\n\nIn Kiev region, there was a specific folk icon-painting style much influenced by the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] painting school. Saints were depicted on the deep purple or black background, their clothes dark, their haloes dark blue, dark green or even black, outlined by thin white dotted contours. The Kiev region's icons' collection is the part of the exhibition of the [[Museum of Ukrainian home icons]] in the Historical and cultural complex \"[[Radomysl Castle|The Radomysl Castle]]\".<ref>\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446\u044c. \u041e. \"\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a-\u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0428\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0443 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0432 Via Regia\". \u2014 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432, 2013</ref>\n\nThe current borders of the oblast were last set following the [[Chernobyl accident]] in 1986. Administrative oversight of the new city of [[Slavutych]], which was constructed as part of the [[Chernihiv Oblast]], was then transferred to the Kiev Oblast (''see [[#Chernobyl zone|Chernobyl zone]] below'').\n\n==Points of interest==\nThe following historic-cultural sites were nominated for the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]].\n* [[Pereiaslav]] museum of folk architecture\n* [[Liutych platzdarm]]\n* [[Ivan Kozlovsky]] villa\n* [[Dobranychivka settlement]]\n* [[Saint Pokrov Church (Parkhomivka)]]\n* [[Museum-villa of Ekaterina Bilokur]]\n* [[Landscape garden Oleksandria]]\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{main article|Administrative divisions of Kiev Oblast}}\nThe oblast is subdivided into 25 [[raions]] (''administrative districts'').
