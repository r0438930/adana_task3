In 1916 during the [[First World War]], Wagener was promoted to the [[General Staff]].\n\nAfter the war, Wagener was involved in the planning of an attack against the city of Posen (now [[Pozna\u0144]], in [[Poland]]), but had to flee to the [[Baltic countries]] to avoid arrest. There he merged all ''[[Freikorps]]'' associations into the German Legion, and assumed leadership after its leader, Paul Siewert, was murdered. After returning to Germany, he was active in ''Freikorps'' operations in [[Upper Silesia]], [[Saxony]], and the [[Ruhr area]].\n\nIn 1920 he studied [[economics]] and managed to broaden his knowledge by traveling abroad. In 1929 Wagener joined the [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (Nazi Party) and the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), having been recruited by his old ''Freikorps'' comrade [[Franz Pfeffer von Salomon]].<ref name=\"Kershaw\">''Kershaw'' p. 348.</ref> Wagener was able to put his business acumen and contacts to good usage for the Nazi Party, in this case for the SA:\n\n<blockquote>Wagener had used his business contacts to persuade a cigarette firm to produce [[\"Sturm\" cigarettes]] for SA men \u2013 a \"sponsorship\" deal benefiting both the firm and SA coffers. Stormtroopers were strongly encouraged to smoke only these cigarettes. A cut from the profit went to the SA ....<ref name = \"Kershaw\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe functioned as SA [[Chief of Staff]] from October 1929 through December 1930, assuming effective command of the SA for a few months in the wake of the [[Stennes Revolt]] until the assumption of command by [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]] as the new Chief of Staff in early January 1931.<ref group=\"Note\">After the first Stennes Revolt in August 1930, Hitler assumed Supreme Command of the SA, having cashiered Wagener's friend and war comrade Pfeffer von Salomon as SA head. Wagener was the de facto leader of the SA from this time until R\u00f6hm's return in January 1931. See [[Stennes Revolt]].</ref> In 1933 he became a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. In January 1931, Wagener led the Political-economic Department of the NSDAP, and in September 1932 he was appointed the [[F\u00fchrer]]'s personal economic advisor. Hitler appointed him Reich Commissar for the Economy from April to June 1933.<ref>''See Lambert'' p. 237.</ref>\n\nBy late 1930 or early 1931 Wagener had made a mark on National Socialist economic policy. As Patch notes (p.&nbsp;201-02):\n\n<blockquote>Wagener formulated an original set of economic policies based on corporatist and leadership principles in confidential talks with Hitler and succeeded in recruiting many middle echelon industrial managers and owners of small factories for the NSDAP....[A confidential draft by Wagener] embraced the ideal of the corporatist \"company union\" (''Werksgemeinschaft'') and described the employer as the \"Fuhrer\" within his factory. All disputes over wages and working conditions would be settled within the \"family\" of the individual company in the National Socialist state of the future. Trade unions would be responsible merely for vocational training.</blockquote>\n\nWagener was replaced in his role as Commissioner for Economic Questions by [[Wilhelm Keppler]], as Wagener had become embroiled in \"coordination\" disputes with leaders of industry after the National Socialist assumption of national power in January 1933, even forcibly occupying the industry-run trade association \"Reich Association of German Industry\" with the intention of shutting it down.<ref>''Evans'' p. 384.</ref> Internal conflicts led to legal proceedings against Wagener in 1933 and 1934 in a case brought before the [[USCHLA]] (Party tribunal). After the [[Night of the Long Knives]], Wagener was detained for a short time. Nevertheless, he was rehabilitated, and he resumed his career in the army.\n\n[[File:The Liberation of Rhodes, 1945 E30943.jpg|thumb|Wagener signs the instrument of surrender for the German forces in the [[Dodecanese]] to the British, 8 May 1945]]\nIn the [[Second World War]], Wagener served at the front, rising to the rank of [[major general]] and becoming a [[Division (military)|division commander]]. After the war, Wagener found himself first in [[United Kingdom|British]] and later, from 1947 to 1952, [[Italy|Italian]] [[prisoner of war camp]]s.\n\nIn 1946, while being held by the British, Wagener wrote his memoirs about Hitler and the Nazi Party's early history, entitled ''Hitler aus n\u00e4chster N\u00e4he.
