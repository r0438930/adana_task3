O'Sullivan was [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of one of the ships in the first fleet to establish English and Irish settlement at Charleston. In 1671, he became [[surveyor general]]. He appears in the earliest record of [[Irish American#Irish immigration to the United States|Irish immigration to the Carolinas]], mentioned as being taken on \"at Kingsayle ([[Kinsale]]) in [[Ireland]]\".\n\nSullivan's Island was used as a quarantine station for African captives, who were housed in various \"pest houses\" on the island and checked for communicable diseases before they were transported to Charleston for sale at public auction.<ref name=Morekis>{{cite book|last=Morekis |first=Jim |title=Coastal Carolinas|ISBN=978-1-64049-245-5|page=170|publisher=Avalon Travel (Moon) |url=https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Coastal-Carolinas-Charleston-Handbooks-ebook/dp/B071FZSR6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542757359&sr=8-1&keywords=Coastal+Carolinas+morekis|date=February 2018 |accessdate=2018-11-20}}</ref> Sullivan's Island was the port of entry for over 40% of the estimated 400,000 [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves transported]] from Africa to [[British North America|Britain's North American Colonies]], making it the largest slave port in North America.

The British [[cannon]] had no effect on the sand-filled [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto log]] walls of the fort; the only fatalities were the result of those shots that carried over the walls.\n\nDuring this battle, a flag designed by Moultrie flew over the fortress; it was dark blue with a crescent moon on it bearing the word \"liberty\". When this flag was shot down, Sergeant [[William Jasper]] reportedly picked it up and held it aloft, rallying the troops until a new standard could be provided. Because of the importance of this pivotal battle, that flag became symbolic of liberty in South Carolina, the South, and the nation as a whole.\n\nThe [[Battle of Sullivan's Island]] was commemorated by the addition of a white [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]] to the flag used to rally that day, known as the [[Moultrie Flag]]. This was used as the basis of the state [[flag of South Carolina]]. The victory is celebrated and June 28 is known as [[Carolina Day]].\n\nThe history of the island has been dominated by Fort Moultrie, which, until its closure in the late 1940s, served as the base of command for the defense of Charleston. After World War II, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] concluded that such coastal defense installations were no longer needed, given current technology and style of war.

He appears in the earliest record of [[Irish American#Irish immigration to the United States|Irish immigration to the Carolinas]], mentioned as being taken on \"at Kingsayle ([[Kinsale]]) in [[Ireland]]\".\n\nSullivan's Island was used as a quarantine station for African captives, who were housed in various \"pest houses\" on the island and checked for communicable diseases before they were transported to Charleston for sale at public auction.<ref name=Morekis>{{cite book|last=Morekis |first=Jim |title=Coastal Carolinas|ISBN=978-1-64049-245-5|page=170|publisher=Avalon Travel (Moon) |url=https://www.amazon.com/Moon-Coastal-Carolinas-Charleston-Handbooks-ebook/dp/B071FZSR6Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1542757359&sr=8-1&keywords=Coastal+Carolinas+morekis|date=February 2018 |accessdate=2018-11-20}}</ref> Sullivan's Island was the port of entry for over 40% of the estimated 400,000 [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves transported]] from Africa to [[British North America|Britain's North American Colonies]], making it the largest slave port in North America.

The British [[cannon]] had no effect on the sand-filled [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto log]] walls of the fort; the only fatalities were the result of those shots that carried over the walls.\n\nDuring this battle, a flag designed by Moultrie flew over the fortress; it was dark blue with a crescent moon on it bearing the word \"liberty\". When this flag was shot down, Sergeant [[William Jasper]] reportedly picked it up and held it aloft, rallying the troops until a new standard could be provided. Because of the importance of this pivotal battle, that flag became symbolic of liberty in South Carolina, the South, and the nation as a whole.\n\nThe [[Battle of Sullivan's Island]] was commemorated by the addition of a white [[Sabal palmetto|palmetto tree]] to the flag used to rally that day, known as the [[Moultrie Flag]]. This was used as the basis of the state [[flag of South Carolina]]. The victory is celebrated and June 28 is known as [[Carolina Day]].\n\nThe history of the island has been dominated by Fort Moultrie, which, until its closure in the late 1940s, served as the base of command for the defense of Charleston. After World War II, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] concluded that such coastal defense installations were no longer needed, given current technology and style of war.
