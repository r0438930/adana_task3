In Taimni's opinion, Theosophy has introduced in them \"order, clarity, system and a rational outlook\" which allowed us to get a \"clear and systematic\" understanding of the processes and laws underlying the revealed universe, \"both visible and invisible.\"{{sfn|Taimni|1969|pp=189\u201390}}\n\nAccording to the Theosophical teaching, the \"universal consciousness, which is the essence of all life\", lies at the basis of the individual consciousness, and this coincides with the Advaita Vedanta point of view, which states that [[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|atman]] \"is identical with Brahman, the universal self\".{{sfn|Sellon, Weber|1992|p=323}} Prof. [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] wrote:\n<blockquote>\"[Blavatsky's] preference for Advaita Vedanta related to its exposition of the ultimate reality as a [[Monism|monist]], [[Nontheism|nontheistic]], impersonal [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]].

The primary differentiation of the Ultimate Reality leads to the appearance of two Realities which are polar in nature and which are called [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]] in Hindu philosophy, and the Father-Mother principle in ''The Secret Doctrine''.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888|p=18}} Shiva is the root of consciousness and Shakti that of power: all manifestations of consciousness are derived from Shiva and those of power from Shakti.\"{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=162}}</blockquote>\nProf. [[Robert Ellwood]] wrote that, according to the Theosophical point of view, spirit and matter are \"to be regarded, not as independent realities, but as the two facets or aspects of the Absolute (Parabrahm), which constitute the basis of conditioned Being whether subjective or objective.\"{{sfnm|Blavatsky|1888|1p=15|Ellwood|2014|2p=57}}\n\nAccording to Hindu philosophy, Shiva consciousness serves as a repository in which the universe is in the [[pralaya]] stage. After each period of manifestation, the cosmos, or the solar system, \"passes into His Consciousness\", in accordance with the eternal alternation of the manifestation phase (''Shrishti'') and the [[pralaya|rest]] one that is \"inherent in the Absolute.\" This state is \"beautifully\" described, in Taimni's opinion, in the first stanza of Cosmogenesis in ''The Secret Doctrine''.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888|p=35}} Thus, the universe in the state of pralaya is in the consciousness of Shiva. In fact, it is \"in His Consciousness all the time\", and the changes associated with manifestation and pralaya can be viewed as affecting \"only the periphery of His Consciousness.\"{{sfn|Taimni|1969|pp=50\u20131}}{{refn|group=note|According to Hindu philosophy, during the period of \"dissolution\", the universe collapses \"into a mathematical point\" that has not any magnitude. This is the \"Shiva-Bindu.\"{{sfn|Woodroffe|1974|pp=34\u20135}}}}\n\nThe [[Logos]] of a solar system creates in the \"Divine Mind\" a thought-form which becomes the basis for the construction of His system. Taimni claimed that this \"aspect of the Logos corresponding to Not-Self is called [[Brahma]], or the Third Logos\" in Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|A European term \"the Logos\" is equivalent to the Hindu one the \"[[Shabda Brahman|Shabda-Brahman]].\"{{sfnm|Subba Row|1888|1p=8|Woodroffe|1974|2p=47}}}} But a world conceived in this way cannot become, according to Taimni, independent without its being animated by the Logos, just as \"a picture in the mind of an artist cannot remain without the artist ensouling it with his attention.\" The created world animated by the Logos is called [[Vishnu]], the \"indwelling Life, or the Second Logos\" in Theosophy. \"This corresponds to the ''[[Satcitananda|Ananda]]'' aspect which is the relating principle between ''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]'' and ''[[Cit (consciousness)|Cit]]'' or Self and Not-Self,\" Taimni wrote. But this process of thought-formation, which takes place in consciousness, and not in matter, does not in any way affect the \"Logos Himself.\" He \"remains as He was,\" although He supports and permeates the manifested solar system that He controls. \"Having created this world and ensouled it I remain,\" as [[Sri Krishna]]  says in ''[[Bhagavad Gita|The Bhagavad-gita]]'' [X, 42]. Thus, the aspect of the Logos, which keeps \"unaffected and independent\" of the world that He created, \"is called [[Mahesha]], or the first Logos\" in Theosophy. Taimni explained: \"It is the [[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcendent]] Aspect, as Vishnu is the [[Immanence|Immanent]] Aspect and Brahma the Imprisoned Aspect of Divinity, if I may use such a term. The first is related to pure Consciousness, the second to Life and the third to Form.\"{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=88}}\n\nThe Theosophists used the concept of reincarnation common for Hinduism and Buddhism to substantiate the one esoteric core of these religions.{{refn|group=note|In a historian Julie Chajes' opinion, reincarnation is a \"fundamental principle of Theosophy\", which claims that not only individualities are reincarnated, but also the \"universes, solar systems, and planets.\"{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=72}}}} Thus, for [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]], an author of the ''[[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|Esoteric Buddhism]],'' [[Gautama Buddha]] is simply one of a row of mahatmas who have \"appeared over the course of the centuries.\" According to Theosophy, \"his next incarnation\" that occurred sixty years after his death became [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], the \"great Vedanta philosopher.\" Sinnett did not deny that the \"uninitiated\" researcher would insist on Shankara's date of birth a \"thousand years after the death of the Buddha, and would also note Shankara's extreme \"antipathy\" towards Buddhism.

According to information obtained from the [[Tantras (Hinduism)|Tantric]] sources, it is impossible to ascertain whether the chakras are objectively \"existing structures in the subtle body,\" or they are \"created\" by a [[yogi]] through visualization in the process of his \"[[meditation|meditative]]\" practice.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|pp=185, 192}}{{refn|group=note|Tantric practice of the Hindus has always been associated with the \"local religious worldview,\" for example, with some \"forms of [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivism]].\"{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=192}}}}\n\nWoodroffe wrote that a Hindu who practice any form of \"spiritual Yoga\" usually, unlike the Theosophists,{{refn|group=note|When the Theosophical Society was created the investigation \"the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man\" was proclaimed its third major task.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=113}}}} does this \"not on account of a curious interest in [[occultism]] or with a desire to gain 'astral' or similar experiences.\" His attitude towards this cause is exclusively a \"religious one, based on a firm faith in Brahman\" and on the desire to unite \"with It\" in order to receive \"Liberation.\"{{sfn|Woodroffe|1974|pp=12\u20133}} A Japanese Indologist [[Hiroshi Motoyama]] noted that the chakras, according to the Theosophists' statements, are the [psycho-spiritual] organs, which actually exist, while in a traditional Hindu literature they are described as the sets of symbols.{{sfn|Motoyama|2003|p=189}} Prof. [[Mircea Eliade]] wrote that all chakras, always depicted as the lotuses, contain the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, as well as religious symbols of Hinduism.{{sfn|Eliade|1958|pp=241\u20135}} Woodroffe noted that, in Leadbeater's opinion, at the awakening of the [[Vishuddha|fifth centre]] a yogi \"hears voices\" but, according to ''Shat-chakra-nirupana'', the \"sound of the Shabda-brahman\" is heard at the [[Anahata|fourth centre]].{{sfn|Woodroffe|1974|p=9}}\n\n== Criticism of Theosophy ==\nIn Prof. [[Max M\u00fcller]]'s opinion, neither in the Vedas, nor in the Upanishads there are any esoteric overtones announced by the Theosophists, and they only sacrifice their reputation, pandering \"to the superstitious belief of the Hindus in such follies.\"{{sfnm|Olcott|1910b|1p=61|Lopez|2009|2p=157}}\n\nA French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non]] noted that the Theosophical conceptions of evolution are \"basically only an absurd caricature of the Hindu theory of cosmic cycles.\"{{sfn|Gu\u00e9non|2004|p=100}} According to Gu\u00e9non, the Theosophical motto \"There is no religion higher than truth\" is a very unfortunate translation of the motto \"Saty\u0101t n\u0101sti paro dharmah\" which owned by one of the Maharajas of Benares. Thus, in his opinion, the Theosophists not only impudently appropriated the \"Hindu device\", but also could not correctly translate it. Gu\u00e9non's translation\u2014\"There are no rights superior to those of the Truth\".{{sfn|Gu\u00e9non|2004|pp=197, 298}}\n\nProf. Lopez wrote that some Indians, for example, such a \"legendary\" figure as Vivekananda, after initially \"cordial relations with the Theosophists,\" disavowed the connection between \"their Hinduism\" and Theosophy.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=186}} In 1900, Vivekananda, calling Theosophy a \"graft of American [[spiritualism]],\" noted that it was identified by \"educated people in the West\" as charlatanism and fakirism mixed with \"Indian thought,\" and this was, in his opinion, all the help provided by the Theosophists for Hinduism. He wrote that Dayananda Saraswati \"took away his patronage from [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Blavatskism]] the moment he found it out. Vivekananda summarized, \"The Hindus have enough of religious teaching and teachers amidst themselves even in this [[Kali Yuga]], and they do not stand in need of dead ghosts of Russians and Americans.\"{{sfn|Vivekananda|2018}}\n\nIn Woodroffe's opinion, despite the fact that the Theosophists widely used the ideas of Hinduism, the meanings they gave to some Hindu terms \"is not always\" correspond to the meanings that the Hindus themselves placed into these terms. For example, Leadbeater explained the ability of yogi to become \"large or small at will (Anima and Maxima [[Siddhi]]) to a flexible tube\" in the forehead, but the Hindus would say so about this: \"All powers (Siddhi) are the attributes of the Lord [[Ishvara]]\". Woodroffe wrote that one should avoid the terms and definitions adopted by the Theosophical authors. {{sfn|Woodroffe|1974|pp=14, 19}} Hammer also noted that in many cases, when the Theosophists borrowed terminology from Sanskrit, they were giving it \"entirely new meanings.\"{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=124}} A Christian theologian Dimitri Drujinin also wrote about the \"significant\" change by Theosophists the meaning of Hindu terms and content of the concepts when they were used.{{sfn|\u0414\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d|2012|p=74}}\n\nA German philosopher [[Eduard von Hartmann]], analyzing Sinnett's book ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' has criticized not only the Theosophical concepts, but also the cosmology of Hinduism and Buddhism, on which they are based. In his opinion:\n<blockquote>\"Indian cosmology cannot rid itself from the constant wavering between sensualistic materialism and a cosmic illusionism. The ultimate reason of this appears to be that the lndians have no idea of objective phenomenality. Because they cannot understand the individualities to be relatively constant centres (conglomerations, groups) of functions of the universal spirit, they must take them either for illusions or for separate senso-material existences. And the latter view is obliged to draw the conclusion that the absolute being from which they emanate or derive their existence must also be senso-material. This can only be avoided and an enlightened idea of spirit can only be arrived at, if one takes our notions of matter to be mere illusions of our senses; the objective matter, however, corresponding with it, to be the product of immaterial forces acting in space, and these forces to be the functions of the one unconscious cosmic force.\"{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=176}}</blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Buddhism and Theosophy]]\n* [[Christianity and Theosophy]]\n* ''[[From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan]]''\n* \"[[Is Theosophy a Religion?]]\"\n* [[Theosophy and literature#Yeats|Literature and Theosophy]]\n* \"[[What Are The Theosophists?]]\"\n* \"[[What Is Theosophy?]]\"\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.ts-adyar.org/content/emblem-or-seal |title=Emblem Or Seal |author= |date= |website=TS Adyar |publisher=The Theosophical Society Adyar |accessdate=13 November 2018 |ref={{SfnRef|Emblem}}}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Purucker |editor-first=G. de |editor-link=Gottfried de Purucker |encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary |title=Satyat Nasti Paro Dharmah |url= http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/sar-sec.htm |access-date=13 November 2018 |edition= |date=1999 |publisher=Theosophical University Press |isbn=978-1-55700-141-2 |ref={{SfnRef|Purucker|1999}}}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/swastika |title=Swastika |date=2018 |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] Online |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc. |accessdate=13 November 2018 |author-mask= |author= |author-link= |ref={{SfnRef|Britannica}}}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{SfnRef|Besant, Leadbeater|1913}} |last1=Besant |first1=A. |last2=Leadbeater |first2=C.

After each period of manifestation, the cosmos, or the solar system, \"passes into His Consciousness\", in accordance with the eternal alternation of the manifestation phase (''Shrishti'') and the [[pralaya|rest]] one that is \"inherent in the Absolute.\" This state is \"beautifully\" described, in Taimni's opinion, in the first stanza of Cosmogenesis in ''The Secret Doctrine''.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1888|p=35}} Thus, the universe in the state of pralaya is in the consciousness of Shiva.

Taimni claimed that this \"aspect of the Logos corresponding to Not-Self is called [[Brahma]], or the Third Logos\" in Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|A European term \"the Logos\" is equivalent to the Hindu one the \"[[Shabda Brahman|Shabda-Brahman]].\"{{sfnm|Subba Row|1888|1p=8|Woodroffe|1974|2p=47}}}} But a world conceived in this way cannot become, according to Taimni, independent without its being animated by the Logos, just as \"a picture in the mind of an artist cannot remain without the artist ensouling it with his attention.\" The created world animated by the Logos is called [[Vishnu]], the \"indwelling Life, or the Second Logos\" in Theosophy. \"This corresponds to the ''[[Satcitananda|Ananda]]'' aspect which is the relating principle between ''[[Sat (Sanskrit)|Sat]]'' and ''[[Cit (consciousness)|Cit]]'' or Self and Not-Self,\" Taimni wrote. But this process of thought-formation, which takes place in consciousness, and not in matter, does not in any way affect the \"Logos Himself.\" He \"remains as He was,\" although He supports and permeates the manifested solar system that He controls. \"Having created this world and ensouled it I remain,\" as [[Sri Krishna]]  says in ''[[Bhagavad Gita|The Bhagavad-gita]]'' [X, 42]. Thus, the aspect of the Logos, which keeps \"unaffected and independent\" of the world that He created, \"is called [[Mahesha]], or the first Logos\" in Theosophy. Taimni explained: \"It is the [[Transcendence (philosophy)|Transcendent]] Aspect, as Vishnu is the [[Immanence|Immanent]] Aspect and Brahma the Imprisoned Aspect of Divinity, if I may use such a term. The first is related to pure Consciousness, the second to Life and the third to Form.\"{{sfn|Taimni|1969|p=88}}\n\nThe Theosophists used the concept of reincarnation common for Hinduism and Buddhism to substantiate the one esoteric core of these religions.{{refn|group=note|In a historian Julie Chajes' opinion, reincarnation is a \"fundamental principle of Theosophy\", which claims that not only individualities are reincarnated, but also the \"universes, solar systems, and planets.\"{{sfn|Chajes|2017|p=72}}}} Thus, for [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A.

According to information obtained from the [[Tantras (Hinduism)|Tantric]] sources, it is impossible to ascertain whether the chakras are objectively \"existing structures in the subtle body,\" or they are \"created\" by a [[yogi]] through visualization in the process of his \"[[meditation|meditative]]\" practice.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|pp=185, 192}}{{refn|group=note|Tantric practice of the Hindus has always been associated with the \"local religious worldview,\" for example, with some \"forms of [[Kashmir Shaivism|Kashmiri Shaivism]].\"{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=192}}}}\n\nWoodroffe wrote that a Hindu who practice any form of \"spiritual Yoga\" usually, unlike the Theosophists,{{refn|group=note|When the Theosophical Society was created the investigation \"the unexplained laws of nature and the powers latent in man\" was proclaimed its third major task.{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=113}}}} does this \"not on account of a curious interest in [[occultism]] or with a desire to gain 'astral' or similar experiences.\" His attitude towards this cause is exclusively a \"religious one, based on a firm faith in Brahman\" and on the desire to unite \"with It\" in order to receive \"Liberation.\"{{sfn|Woodroffe|1974|pp=12\u20133}} A Japanese Indologist [[Hiroshi Motoyama]] noted that the chakras, according to the Theosophists' statements, are the [psycho-spiritual] organs, which actually exist, while in a traditional Hindu literature they are described as the sets of symbols.{{sfn|Motoyama|2003|p=189}} Prof. [[Mircea Eliade]] wrote that all chakras, always depicted as the lotuses, contain the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, as well as religious symbols of Hinduism.{{sfn|Eliade|1958|pp=241\u20135}} Woodroffe noted that, in Leadbeater's opinion, at the awakening of the [[Vishuddha|fifth centre]] a yogi \"hears voices\" but, according to ''Shat-chakra-nirupana'', the \"sound of the Shabda-brahman\" is heard at the [[Anahata|fourth centre]].{{sfn|Woodroffe|1974|p=9}}\n\n== Criticism of Theosophy ==\nIn Prof. [[Max M\u00fcller]]'s opinion, neither in the Vedas, nor in the Upanishads there are any esoteric overtones announced by the Theosophists, and they only sacrifice their reputation, pandering \"to the superstitious belief of the Hindus in such follies.\"{{sfnm|Olcott|1910b|1p=61|Lopez|2009|2p=157}}\n\nA French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non]] noted that the Theosophical conceptions of evolution are \"basically only an absurd caricature of the Hindu theory of cosmic cycles.\"{{sfn|Gu\u00e9non|2004|p=100}} According to Gu\u00e9non, the Theosophical motto \"There is no religion higher than truth\" is a very unfortunate translation of the motto \"Saty\u0101t n\u0101sti paro dharmah\" which owned by one of the Maharajas of Benares. Thus, in his opinion, the Theosophists not only impudently appropriated the \"Hindu device\", but also could not correctly translate it. Gu\u00e9non's translation\u2014\"There are no rights superior to those of the Truth\".{{sfn|Gu\u00e9non|2004|pp=197, 298}}\n\nProf. Lopez wrote that some Indians, for example, such a \"legendary\" figure as Vivekananda, after initially \"cordial relations with the Theosophists,\" disavowed the connection between \"their Hinduism\" and Theosophy.{{sfn|Lopez|2009|p=186}} In 1900, Vivekananda, calling Theosophy a \"graft of American [[spiritualism]],\" noted that it was identified by \"educated people in the West\" as charlatanism and fakirism mixed with \"Indian thought,\" and this was, in his opinion, all the help provided by the Theosophists for Hinduism. He wrote that Dayananda Saraswati \"took away his patronage from [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Blavatskism]] the moment he found it out. Vivekananda summarized, \"The Hindus have enough of religious teaching and teachers amidst themselves even in this [[Kali Yuga]], and they do not stand in need of dead ghosts of Russians and Americans.\"{{sfn|Vivekananda|2018}}\n\nIn Woodroffe's opinion, despite the fact that the Theosophists widely used the ideas of Hinduism, the meanings they gave to some Hindu terms \"is not always\" correspond to the meanings that the Hindus themselves placed into these terms. For example, Leadbeater explained the ability of yogi to become \"large or small at will (Anima and Maxima [[Siddhi]]) to a flexible tube\" in the forehead, but the Hindus would say so about this: \"All powers (Siddhi) are the attributes of the Lord [[Ishvara]]\". Woodroffe wrote that one should avoid the terms and definitions adopted by the Theosophical authors. {{sfn|Woodroffe|1974|pp=14, 19}} Hammer also noted that in many cases, when the Theosophists borrowed terminology from Sanskrit, they were giving it \"entirely new meanings.\"{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=124}} A Christian theologian Dimitri Drujinin also wrote about the \"significant\" change by Theosophists the meaning of Hindu terms and content of the concepts when they were used.{{sfn|\u0414\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043d|2012|p=74}}\n\nA German philosopher [[Eduard von Hartmann]], analyzing Sinnett's book ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' has criticized not only the Theosophical concepts, but also the cosmology of Hinduism and Buddhism, on which they are based. In his opinion:\n<blockquote>\"Indian cosmology cannot rid itself from the constant wavering between sensualistic materialism and a cosmic illusionism. The ultimate reason of this appears to be that the lndians have no idea of objective phenomenality. Because they cannot understand the individualities to be relatively constant centres (conglomerations, groups) of functions of the universal spirit, they must take them either for illusions or for separate senso-material existences. And the latter view is obliged to draw the conclusion that the absolute being from which they emanate or derive their existence must also be senso-material. This can only be avoided and an enlightened idea of spirit can only be arrived at, if one takes our notions of matter to be mere illusions of our senses; the objective matter, however, corresponding with it, to be the product of immaterial forces acting in space, and these forces to be the functions of the one unconscious cosmic force.\"{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=176}}</blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Buddhism and Theosophy]]\n* [[Christianity and Theosophy]]\n* ''[[From the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan]]''\n* \"[[Is Theosophy a Religion?]]\"\n* [[Theosophy and literature#Yeats|Literature and Theosophy]]\n* \"[[What Are The Theosophists?]]\"\n* \"[[What Is Theosophy?]]\"\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.ts-adyar.org/content/emblem-or-seal |title=Emblem Or Seal |author= |date= |website=TS Adyar |publisher=The Theosophical Society Adyar |accessdate=13 November 2018 |ref={{SfnRef|Emblem}}}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Purucker |editor-first=G. de |editor-link=Gottfried de Purucker |encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary |title=Satyat Nasti Paro Dharmah |url= http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/sar-sec.htm |access-date=13 November 2018 |edition= |date=1999 |publisher=Theosophical University Press |isbn=978-1-55700-141-2 |ref={{SfnRef|Purucker|1999}}}}\n* {{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/swastika |title=Swastika |date=2018 |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] Online |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc. |accessdate=13 November 2018 |author-mask= |author= |author-link= |ref={{SfnRef|Britannica}}}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{SfnRef|Besant, Leadbeater|1913}} |last1=Besant |first1=A. |last2=Leadbeater |first2=C.
