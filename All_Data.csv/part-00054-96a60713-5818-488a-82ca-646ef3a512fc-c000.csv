'''Kazys Škirpa''' (18 February 1895 &ndash; 18 August 1979) was a Lithuanian military officer and diplomat. He is best known as the founder of the [[Lithuanian Activist Front]] (LAF) and his involvement in the attempt to establish [[June Uprising in Lithuania|Lithuanian independence in June 1941]].

== Army career==
During [[World War I]] he was mobilized into the Russian army and attempted to form Lithuanian detachments in [[Petrograd]]. After Lithuania declared independence in 1918, he returned and volunteered during the [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence]]. In 1920, as a member of the [[Lithuanian Peasant Popular Union]], he was elected to the [[Constituent Assembly of Lithuania]]. After that he decided to pursue a military education in [[ETH Zurich|Institute of Technology in Zurich]], Higher Military School in [[Kaunas]], and [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)]].<ref name=ignat/> Upon graduation in 1925, he worked as chief of the General Staff, but was forced to resign after the [[1926 Lithuanian coup d'état]], because he was actively refusing it and was trying to gather military force to protect the Government.

== Political career==
Later he served as a Lithuanian representative to Germany (1927–1930), [[League of Nations]] (1937), Poland (1938), and again Germany (1938–1941). After [[Soviet occupation of Lithuania|Soviet Union occupied Lithuania]] in 1940, Škirpa fled to Germany and formed [[Lithuanian Activist Front]], a short-lived resistance organisation whose goal was to liberate Lithuania and re-establish its independence by working with the Nazis.<ref name=blood>Timothy Snyder - Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin, ch.6-Final Solution. 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-465-0-3147-4}}</ref> According to [[Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation]], he was a primary source of the secret part of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] which he sent to the Latvian foreign minister {{Ill|Vilhelms Munters|lv|Vilhelms Munters}} in 1939.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.victimsofcommunism.org/witnessblog/2018/4/19/sg78hvjl0wlzrockaohia2vwmuiehd|title=Chekhov’s Gun: The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in the Baltics|website=Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref> When [[Operation Barbarossa|Nazis invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941.

==Street names==
Due to Škirpa's alleged anti-Semitic rhetoric as the leader of LAF, a movement to remove street names in both Kaunas and Vilnius in honor of Škirpa was launched by British member of the Vilnius City Council [[Mark Adam Harold]].

She is Emeritus Professor of Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology at the University of Bristol.

==Early life and education==
Born in Hayle, Cornwall in 1939, Golding struggled with illness throughout her childhood. Her regular stays in hospital led to a delay in the beginning of her education, eventually starting school when she was six years old. Her family moved to [[Chester]], after a period living in [[Plymouth]], and within a few weeks she contracted [[polio]], causing her to miss another year of school and causing a disability that would remain with her permanently. Despite these interruptions to her schooling, she won a place studying mathematics at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]] in 1958,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Jean Golding: a tale of illness, adventure and statistics|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2014/oct/14/illness-adventure-statistics-jean-golding-my-inspiring-scientist-ada-lovelace|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-13|first = Suzi|last = Gage}}</ref> from where she was awarded an honours BA, and subsequently MA.

==Career and research==
In 1966 she joined a team in London, headed by Neville Butler and Eva Alberman,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pearson | first1 = Helen | year = 2012 | title = Children of the 90s: Coming of age | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 484 | issue = 7393| pages = 155–158 | doi = 10.1038/484155a | pmid = 22498607 }}</ref> analysing data collected in the 1958 Perinatal Mortality Survey (later the 1958 birth cohort) [[British birth cohort studies]]. She then obtained a research fellowship in the Galton Laboratory of Human Genetics and Biometry, University College London [[Galton Laboratory]] to study the aetiology of neural tube defects. Subsequent research at the [[University of Oxford]], involved working with large data sets including the Oxford Record Linkage Study.

In 1980 she moved to the [[University of Bristol]], where she was involved in analysing data from the national 1970 birth cohort [[British birth cohort studies]]. During the 1980s she was responsible for assisting in designing and augmenting a major perinatal survey in Jamaica 1985-6,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ashley | first1 = D. | last2 = McCaw-Binns | first2 = A. | last3 = Foster-Williams | first3 = K. | year = 1988 | title = The perinatal morbidity and mortality survey of Jamaica 1986–1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3016.1988.tb00194.x | journal = Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology | volume = 2 | issue = 2| pages = 138–147 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3016.1988.tb00194.x }}</ref> and developed, and was the initial Director of the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Protocol | first1 = Research | year = 1989 | title = European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC) | url = | journal = Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 460–469 }}</ref> This led to the founding of ALSPAC ([[Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children]]), also known as Children of the 90s, a birth [[cohort study]], the overall aim of which is to determine the ways in which different aspects of the environment influence child health and development, and how these may be influenced by genetics.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Golding | first1 = J | last2 = Pembrey | first2 = M | last3 = Jones | first3 = R | year = 2001 | title = ALSPAC – The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.

It continues to record biological, psychological, social and medical information of these groups throughout their childhoods and into their adult lives [[ALSPAC]].  The dataset is used by researchers across the world,<ref name=\":0\"/> and it includes interviews, questionnaires, biological samples, hands-on testing and linkage to educational and other records.  Data collection has continued since the children were born. Golding's decision on what data was useful to collect has led to it being used for genetic and [[Epigenetics]] research worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ada Lovelace Day: Where are the women in science? Right here ... My top 10 female scientists|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10378299/Ada-Lovelace-Day-Where-are-the-women-in-science-Right-here-...-My-top-10-female-scientists.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}</ref> and, by 2019, around 2000 peer-reviewed papers based on this resource have been published (see ALSPAC website: www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/).

In 1987 she was the founding editor of the international journal: [[Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology]] and continued as editor-in-chief until 2012.  Golding has continued to carry out research on the ALSPAC resource long into retirement, and has concentrated in particular with the psychologist, Professor Stephen Nowicki, at [[Emory University]], on the [[Locus of control]] of the parents and children and how that appears to influence behaviours, and with Professor [[Marcus Pembrey]] on various trans- and inter-generational  [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]] influences on outcomes of various sorts.

==Awards and Honours==

In 2012 she was made an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to medical science.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=New Years Honours: Prof Jean Golding appointed OBE|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-16364995|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=BBC News|date=31 December 2011}}</ref>

In 2013, she received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Bristol]], acclaimed as an \"exemplar of the qualities and values the institution promotes\".<ref name=Bristol>{{cite news|title=Professor Jean Golding gets honorary degree at Bristol University|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-21246233|accessdate=17 October 2015|work=BBC News|date=29 January 2013}}</ref>

In 2017, she received an honorary Doctor of Science from [[University College London]] for her pioneering work on longitudinal population studies.<ref>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/news/2017/golding-ucl-honorary-degree.html</ref>

In 2018, as a celebration of the 70 years since the start of the NHS, she was made one of seven \"NHS Research Legends\".<ref>[https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news-and-events/support-our-campaigns/i-am-research/7-research-legends.htm]</ref>

In 2018, the University of Bristol named their Institute of Data Science after her.<ref>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/</ref>

Again in 2018, in response to a national call by [[English Heritage]] Put her Forward campaign (in response to the realisation of the paucity of statues of women in Britain), Golding was nominated, and among 25 women to have a 3-D printed statuette.<ref>https://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/visiting/unsung-stories/put-her-forward</ref><ref>http://putherforward.com/the-women/</ref> This is currently displayed in the Royal Fort House at the University of Bristol.

She is Emeritus Professor of Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology at the University of Bristol.

==Early life and education==
Born in Hayle, Cornwall in 1939, Golding struggled with illness throughout her childhood. Her regular stays in hospital led to a delay in the beginning of her education, eventually starting school when she was six years old. Her family moved to [[Chester]], after a period living in [[Plymouth]], and within a few weeks she contracted [[polio]], causing her to miss another year of school and causing a disability that would remain with her permanently. Despite these interruptions to her schooling, she won a place studying mathematics at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]] in 1958,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Jean Golding: a tale of illness, adventure and statistics|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2014/oct/14/illness-adventure-statistics-jean-golding-my-inspiring-scientist-ada-lovelace|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-10-13|first = Suzi|last = Gage}}</ref> from where she was awarded an honours BA, and subsequently MA.

==Career and research==
In 1966 she joined a team in London, headed by Neville Butler and Eva Alberman <ref>Pearson, Helen (12 April 2012). \"Children of the 90s: Coming of age\". Nature. 484 (7393): 155–158. doi:10.1038/484155a. {{PMID|22498607}}.</ref>, analysing data collected in the 1958 Perinatal Mortality Survey (later the 1958 birth cohort) [[British birth cohort studies]]. She then obtained a research fellowship in the Galton Laboratory of Human Genetics and Biometry, University College London [[Galton Laboratory]] to study the aetiology of neural tube defects. Subsequent research at the [[University of Oxford]], involved working with large data sets including the Oxford Record Linkage Study.

In 1980 she moved to the [[University of Bristol]], where she was involved in analysing data from the national 1970 birth cohort [[British birth cohort studies]]. During the 1980s she was responsible for assisting in designing and augmenting a major perinatal survey in Jamaica 1985-6<ref>Ashley, D., McCaw‐Binns, A., & Foster‐Williams, K. (1988). The perinatal morbidity and mortality survey of Jamaica 1986–1987. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology, 2(2), 138-147. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3016.1988.tb00194.x</ref>, and developed, and was the initial Director of the European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC) <ref>Research Protocol: European Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ELSPAC). Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 1989;3(4):460-469</ref>. This led to the founding of ALSPAC ([[Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children]]), also known as Children of the 90s, a birth [[cohort study]], the overall aim of which is to determine the ways in which different aspects of the environment influence child health and development, and how these may be influenced by genetics <ref>Golding J, Pembrey M, Jones R, ALSPAC Study Team. ALSPAC – The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. I. Study methodology. Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology 2001; 15:74-87.</ref>. The study has resulted in a highly detailed dataset of children born in the [[Avon (county)|Avon]] area in 1991 and 1992, their parents and, as time has gone on, their own children. It continues to record biological, psychological, social and medical information of these groups throughout their childhoods and into their adult lives [[ALSPAC]].  The dataset is used by researchers across the world,<ref name=\":0\"/> and it includes interviews, questionnaires, biological samples, hands-on testing and linkage to educational and other records.  Data collection has continued since the children were born. Golding's decision on what data was useful to collect has led to it being used for genetic and [[Epigenetics]] research worldwide,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Ada Lovelace Day: Where are the women in science? Right here ... My top 10 female scientists|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/10378299/Ada-Lovelace-Day-Where-are-the-women-in-science-Right-here-...-My-top-10-female-scientists.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-10-13}}</ref>, and, by 2019, around 2000 peer-reviewed papers based on this resource have been published (see ALSPAC website: www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/).

In 1987 she was the founding editor of the international journal: [[Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology]] and continued as editor-in-chief until 2012.  Golding has continued to carry out research on the ALSPAC resource long into retirement, and has concentrated in particular with the psychologist, Professor Stephen Nowicki, at [[Emory University]], on the [[Locus of control]] of the parents and children and how that appears to influence behaviours, and with Professor [[Marcus Pembrey]] on various trans- and inter-generational  [[Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]] influences on outcomes of various sorts.

==Awards and Honours==

In 2012 she was made an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] for services to medical science.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=New Years Honours: Prof Jean Golding appointed OBE|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-16364995|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=BBC News|date=31 December 2011}}</ref> 

In 2013, she received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Bristol]], acclaimed as an \"exemplar of the qualities and values the institution promotes\".<ref name=Bristol>{{cite news|title=Professor Jean Golding gets honorary degree at Bristol University|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-bristol-21246233|accessdate=17 October 2015|work=BBC News|date=29 January 2013}}</ref>

In 2017, she received an honorary Doctor of Science from [[University College London]] for her pioneering work on longitudinal population studies.<ref>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/news/2017/golding-ucl-honorary-degree.html</ref>

In 2018, as a celebration of the 70 years since the start of the NHS, she was made one of seven \"NHS Research Legends\".<ref>[https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news-and-events/support-our-campaigns/i-am-research/7-research-legends.htm</ref>

In 2018, the University of Bristol named their Institute of Data Science after her<ref>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/</ref>.

Again in 2018, in response to a national call by [[English Heritage]] Put her Forward campaign (in response to the realisation of the paucity of statues of women in Britain), Golding was nominated, and among 25 women to have a 3-D printed statuette.<ref>https://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/visiting/unsung-stories/put-her-forward</ref><ref>http://putherforward.com/the-women/</ref> This is currently displayed in the Royal Fort House at the University of Bristol.

== Schools where the project is implemented ==
[[File:Signboard for Melfa School WatSani.jpg|thumb|School WatSani project at May Sa’iri school]]
The School-Watsani project is implemented in 10 schools. In all schools, [[Ecosan]] toilet buildings have been constructed and training given on their use. In several schools water availability was improved and nudging implemented.

== Embeddedness ==
By actively enabling teachers and pupils in all aspects of the project, this project aims to grow the school as a knowledge pool around water and sanitation and to have a positive effect on society as a whole. Since this society consists mainly of [[small-scale farming]] families, a link is also made to the strengthening of small-scale agriculture and exemplary water management is strengthened around the schools.<ref name=\"hotspot\"/>

Not only the school's hygiene and water supply are positively affected but also the surrounding community. The municipality has meetings with the partners, school and the community. For example, there is local foundationof the project and the investments. The investments are necessary and will be met with local contractors and the surrounding community. It not only brings investment but also provides the necessary support through nudging for the right use and encouragement of use. In addition to the investments, the project also takes into account local/scientific knowledge/techniques to influence water availability. The design of the latrines is the right one adapted for the [[environment]]. The project thinks about sustainability, is open to improvement and learns from mistakes.<ref name = \"jeroen\"/>

== Impact on [[Sustainable Development Goals]] <ref name = \"jeroen\"/> ==
* SDG 6: water and sanitation 
* SDG 1: no poverty
* SDG 2: no hunger 
* SDG 3: health 
* SDG 4: education 
* SDG 13: climate 
* SDG 17: partnerships

== Partnership ==
The partners involved have extensive experience in Ethiopia, knowledge of the proposed project activities and have been working together for several years with the local partners of [[Degua Tembien|Dogu'a Tembien]] district administration and [[Mekelle University]]. [[Ghent University]] avails its expertise and useful equipment. Engineers Without Borders<ref>Ingenieurs zonder Grenzen https://www.izg.be</ref> is involved in the preparation of the technical plans and the engineer-specific support for the planned infrastructure. [[Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen]] provides support for the development of learning and communication tools. The [[Belgian Red Cross]] provides expertise in the field of [[WASH]] and sensitisation. The Environment Department of the [[Flemish government]] ([[Belgium]]) co-finances this project, which has a duration of 36 months (2018-2020).<ref name=\"hotspot\"/>

'''Billy Conway''' is an American [[drummer]] best known for his work with [[Treat Her Right]] and [[Morphine (band)|Morphine]]. Since 2013, he has toured as a duo with [[Jeffrey Foucault]]. In recent years, he has also backed [[Chris Smither]]. A stripped-down approach has characterized his bands, equipment, and playing.

== Background ==

Conway is a native of [[Owatonna, Minnesota]], south of [[Minneapolis]]. In the 1970s, he went to [[Yale University]], where he became friends and bandmates with harmonica player [[Jim Fitting]], who would also become part of Treat Her Right. Conway earned a degree in psychology.<ref name=\"Graff\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99821981/ |author=Graff, Gary |title=Treat Her Right shows you can be a Yale grad and still sing the blues |work=Detroit Free Press |date=May 9, 1988}}</ref> A member of the Class of 1979, he was also captain of Yale's [[ice hockey]] team as a senior in the 1978-79 season. He was invited to try out for the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, which performed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", but could not after tearing a knee ligament.<ref name=\"Fleschner\">{{cite book | title=Bulldogs on Ice: Yale University Men's Ice Hockey | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=Fleschner, Daniel K. | year=2003 | pages=81 | isbn=9780738513287}}</ref>

== Treat Her Right ==

After graduation, Conway and Fitting both moved to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where Conway taught at a school for emotionally disturbed adolescents. In 1985, they were introduced to the other two principals in Treat Her Right, [[Mark Sandman]] and [[David Champagne (musician)|David Champagne]].<ref name=\"Graff\" />

One of the notable features of Treat Her Right was the [[cocktail drum]] that Conway used. This band was noted for its spare, spacious sound, and the cocktail drum was an integral part of that.

== Morphine ==

When Mark Sandman formed Morphine, the original drummer was [[Jerome Deupree]], but Conway served in the band for much of its existence. He played a fuller drum kit, yet still often stripped down.<ref>{{cite book | title=Music (chapter in the book New England) | publisher=Greenwood Publishing | author=Marshall, Barry and Suzanne Cope | year=2004 | pages =352 | isbn=9780313327537}}</ref> His cocktail drum appeared on some album cuts. ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' described him as playing jazz-influenced, very tight drums, but that he crucially left plenty of spaces for Sandman and the other member of the band, saxophonist [[Dana Colley]], to make their noises.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Rough Guide to Rock | publisher=Rough Guides | author=Buckley, Peter and Jonathan (editors) | year=2003 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/693 693] | isbn=9781858284576 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock00roug/page/693 }}</ref>

== Subsequent bands ==

After Sandman suffered his fatal heart attack in 1999, Colley and Conway proceeded to form Orchestra Morphine, a group of Sandman's friends and colleagues who toured to celebrate the music of the band and to raise funds for the Mark Sandman Music Education Fund. 

Colley and Conway also formed [[Twinemen]] with singer [[Laurie Sargent]]. Conway and Sargent are long-term partners.  

Conway worked with Jeffrey Foucault and poet [[Lisa Olstein]] on the eponymous first album by Cold Satellite (2011) and the follow-up ''Cavalcade'' (2013). Previously, he had performed on albums by [[Kris Delmhorst]], who became Foucault's wife. 

Another part of this circle of artists is [[Caitlin Canty]], whose 2015 album ''Reckless Skyline'' was produced by Foucault and employed Conway as drummer.

Foucault has cited a shared desire to give weight to space and silence, which is a constant in Conway's career.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.wideopencountry.com/jeffrey-foucaults-blood-brothers-is-the-album-we-need/ |author=Cholset, Rachel |title=Album Premiere: Jeffrey Foucault's 'Blood Brothers' Is the Album We Need |work=Wide Open Country |date=June 2018}}</ref> For their live gigs as a duo, they play only what they can carry into a club alone in one trip. Conway's minimal \"suitcase drum\" setup harks back to his use of the cocktail drum.<ref>[https://jeffreyfoucault.com/press Jeffrey Foucault's website]</ref> 

Conway occasionally joins [[Vapors of Morphine]], which honors the legacy of Morphine, for some big shows.<ref>[https://www.vaporsofmorphine.com/bio/ Vapors of Morphine bio]</ref> 

He also continues to perform as a guest on albums and live dates by other artists. In particular, Chris Smither cited Conway's feel and intuition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ecurrent.com/music/guitars-influence-going-solo-and-playing-in-the-band/ |author=Bye, Brandon |title=Guitars, Influence, Going Solo, and Playing in the Band |work=Current |date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

Conway was drummer on ''Early Riser'', the ninth album by [[John Statz]], recorded in 2019 and released in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.westword.com/music/hear-it-john-statz-on-recording-with-morphine-drummer-billy-conway-11683821 |author=Solomon, Jon |title= Hear It: John Statz on Recording With Morphine Drummer Billy Conway |work=Westword |date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>

In 2019, Conway, Fitting, and Champagne got together and recorded an album. A live date was announced for January 19, 2020 at Club Passim in Cambridge -- which was to be their first appearance together on stage since all were members of Treat Her Right. Unfortunately, it was announced that week that Conway would not be able to perform at the event because of health issues and that Jerome Deupree and Larry Dersch would fill in.<ref>[https://www.passim.org/live-music/events/billy-jimmy-dave/ Club Passim website]</ref> At the event Fitting told the audience Conway had restarted cancer treatment. He was originally diagnosed in 2014. 

== Solo album ==
Yet despite his health challenges, and in part because of them, Conway released his first solo album, ''Outside Inside'', in 2020. It was accompanied by a new album from Sargent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/09/arts/making-music-or-weathering-misfortune-billy-conway-laurie-sargent-are-this-together/?fbclid=IwAR0o2pjTKdspZ0AY4j2YO8gdb789jYhHCv543HMD20LnKEuMY4B7BWI5qtU |author=Sullivan, James |title= Making music or weathering misfortune, Billy Conway and Laurie Sargent are in this together|work=Boston Globe |date=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

== As producer ==

Conway has served as a producer and engineer. This arose in his prior capacity as a founder of [[Hi-n-Dry]], but he also oversaw two of Kris Delmhorst's albums, ''[[Five Stories (album)|Five Stories]]'' and ''[[Songs for a Hurricane]]''.

'''Billy Conway''' is an American [[drummer]] best known for his work with [[Treat Her Right]] and [[Morphine (band)|Morphine]]. Since 2013, he has toured as a duo with [[Jeffrey Foucault]]. In recent years, he has also backed [[Chris Smither]]. A stripped-down approach has characterized his bands, equipment, and playing.

== Background ==

Conway is a native of [[Owatonna, Minnesota]], south of [[Minneapolis]]. In the 1970s, he went to [[Yale University]], where he became friends and bandmates with harmonica player [[Jim Fitting]], who would also become part of Treat Her Right. Conway earned a degree in psychology.<ref name=\"Graff\">{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/99821981/ |author=Graff, Gary |title=Treat Her Right shows you can be a Yale grad and still sing the blues |work=Detroit Free Press |date=May 9, 1988}}</ref> A member of the Class of 1979, he was also captain of Yale's [[ice hockey]] team as a senior in the 1978-79 season. He was invited to try out for the 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey team, which performed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", but could not after tearing a knee ligament.<ref name=\"Fleschner\">{{cite book | title=Bulldogs on Ice: Yale University Men's Ice Hockey | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | author=Fleschner, Daniel K. | year=2003 | pages=81 | isbn=9780738513287}}</ref>

== Treat Her Right ==

After graduation, Conway and Fitting both moved to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], where Conway taught at a school for emotionally disturbed adolescents. In 1985, they were introduced to the other two principals in Treat Her Right, [[Mark Sandman]] and [[David Champagne (musician)|David Champagne]].<ref name=\"Graff\" />

One of the notable features of Treat Her Right was the [[cocktail drum]] that Conway used. This band was noted for its spare, spacious sound, and the cocktail drum was an integral part of that.

== Morphine ==

When Mark Sandman formed Morphine, the original drummer was [[Jerome Deupree]], but Conway served in the band for much of its existence. He played a fuller drum kit, yet still often stripped down.<ref>{{cite book | title=Music (chapter in the book New England) | publisher=Greenwood Publishing | author=Marshall, Barry and Suzanne Cope | year=2004 | pages =352 | isbn=9780313327537}}</ref> His cocktail drum appeared on some album cuts.

'''Geoff Crammond''' is a [[computer game designer]] and [[Game programmer|programmer]] who specialises in motor [[racing game]]s. A former defence industry systems engineer,<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2000/08/12/feat.html Forbes - August 2000 - Feature]</ref> he claims to have had little interest in motor racing before programming his first racing game (Formula 3) back in 1984, but he holds a [[physics]] degree, which may explain the realism of some of his programming. As a consequence of that project he became a big fan of Formula One motor racing. At the end of the 80s, this interest, plus the ever improving capabilities of home computers, inspired him to specialise in programming Formula One racing simulations.

== Games ==
One of his early releases was ''Aviator'', a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] simulator marketed for the [[BBC Micro]] by [[Acornsoft]]. Although displayed in only four colours and has few of the features of modern simulators for more powerful computers, Aviator was of unparalleled quality at the time of its release (c. 1983), with a realistic flight model that included g-forces that could tear the wings off in a dive. This would be accompanied by a continuous high pitched beep. The wings could be restored by removing the physical pressure on the airframe which was causing the flight envelope to be exceeded. Generally, this could be achieved by returning the joystick to a neutral centre position. The landscape was crudely rendered, and was basically a plane. Some scenic features were drawn as [[vector graphics]], including low hills, fields, a lake, a suspension bridge over a river, and a small town which comprised a cluster of three buildings. Bonus points could be earned for flying under the bridge or along the main street of the town at a lower altitude than the buildings. Double points were earned for performing these stunts upside down. The game also had a shoot-'em-up mode in which alien vessels were seeded in the fields, feeding on the crops and growing until they could become airborne, at which point they headed for the town. The player could destroy the aliens on the ground as they fed, or (for reduced points) tackle them in the air (the aliens were agile but could not return fire). If an alien reached the town, the game was lost. A minor bug permitted the plane to be landed upside down without consequence, so long as the landing gear had been deployed.

Although better known for his [[Formula One]] simulation games on the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Amiga]] platforms, his first motor racing simulator was ''[[REVS (computer game)|REVS]]'', a [[Formula Three]] simulator that debuted on the BBC Micro platform in 1984. The BBC version of ''Revs'' featured just one track, the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] circuit, but the realistic implementation of motor racing physics and artificial intelligence of the computer controlled components gave the game enormous depth and replayability.

A [[Commodore 64]] version of the game, entitled ''Revs Plus'', was released in 1986, which added the [[Brands Hatch]] track to the game. An enhanced edition of the BBC version was later released called 'REVS 4 Tracks' which included Brands Hatch, [[Donington Park]], [[Oulton Park]] and [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] race tracks. Later the [[Commodore 64]] version added the [[Nürburgring]] to this list to continue the \"4 Tracks\" theme as Brands Hatch had already been included with the initial ''REVS Plus'' release. The Nürburgring was chosen as its new layout had recently been completed and computer based design data was available. This gives an idea of just how accurate REVS was as a simulation rather than 'just' a game.

''[[The Sentinel (computer game)|The Sentinel]]'' was published by [[Firebird (software label)|Firebird]] on the BBC Micro in 1986. It was a 3D puzzle game, featuring ten thousand levels, in which the player had to manoeuvre his way through a landscape of cliffs, trees and boulders to topple the ominous Sentinel. The game was a critical and commercial success. Conversions for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64|C64]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]] and PC soon followed. A sequel, ''[[Sentinel Returns]]'', was published by [[Psygnosis]] in 1998 on the PC and [[PlayStation]] platforms.

Crammond's attention returned to motor racing simulators. ''[[Stunt Car Racer]]'' was a slightly offbeat driving simulation, rewarding the player for performing outrageous stunts on a number of elevated, roller-coaster-like courses. Although less serious in tone than his previous simulators, the game nevertheless used an impressive physics engine to offer a realistic driving experience. The game enjoyed cult status among many Amiga and Atari ST gamers. Ever since the early 1990s, Crammond's primary focus has been on developing the award-winning Formula One Grand Prix series of games. The first game in the series, ''[[Formula One Grand Prix (Geoff Crammond)|F1GP]]'' (aka ''World Circuit'' in the USA), was released by [[MicroProse]] on the Amiga in 1991 and is essentially the spiritual successor to ''Revs''. Around this time ''[[Amiga Power]]'' magazine began referring to him as Sir Geoff, a running gag which has caught on with many others. The game was an instant success, earning a conversion to the Atari ST and PC platforms, but the inevitable sequel, ''[[Grand Prix 2 (game)|Grand Prix 2]]'', remained in development for three years before eventually being released on the PC in 1996.

''[[Grand Prix 3]]'' was released on the PC in 2000 and was well received by fans and critics alike.<ref>http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/grand-prix-3</ref> Crammond's series now had considerable competition from other developers, particularly Psygnosis/[[Sony]], who were licensed by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] to produce the official Formula One gaming titles. ''[[Grand Prix 4]]'' was released on the PC in 2002 and is generally regarded as the most accurate game in the series. After ''Grand Prix 4'' there were rumours that Crammond's next game would be Stunt Car Racer Pro, an updated version of his classic game. The rumours were later confirmed with an announcement that he was co-operating with [[Lost Toys]] studios. Lost Toys studios were closed in late 2003. At the beginning of 2005, the game was rumoured to be cancelled.

Crammond's most recent game release is still GP4 (2002), which is still supported by fans with annual [[game mod|mods]], in spite of MicroProse's closure in 2001.

Following that, Crammond kept a low profile, but continues to engage in various programming projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meanmachinesmag.co.uk/upload/media/scans/geoffcrammond.pdf|title=In the Chair with...

'''Geoff Crammond''' is a [[computer game designer]] and [[Game programmer|programmer]] who specialises in motor [[racing game]]s. A former defence industry systems engineer,<ref>[https://www.forbes.com/2000/08/12/feat.html Forbes - August 2000 - Feature]</ref> he claims to have had little interest in motor racing before programming his first racing game (Formula 3) back in 1984, but he holds a [[physics]] degree, which may explain the realism of some of his programming. As a consequence of that project he became a big fan of Formula One motor racing. At the end of the 80s, this interest, plus the ever improving capabilities of home computers, inspired him to specialise in programming Formula One racing simulations.

== Games ==
One of his early releases was ''Aviator'', a [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] simulator marketed for the [[BBC Micro]] by [[Acornsoft]]. Although displayed in only four colours and has few of the features of modern simulators for more powerful computers, Aviator was of unparalleled quality at the time of its release (c. 1983), with a realistic flight model that included g-forces that could tear the wings off in a dive. This would be accompanied by a continuous high pitched beep. The wings could be restored by removing the physical pressure on the airframe which was causing the flight envelope to be exceeded. Generally, this could be achieved by returning the joystick to a neutral centre position. The landscape was crudely rendered, and was basically a plane. Some scenic features were drawn as [[vector graphics]], including low hills, fields, a lake, a suspension bridge over a river, and a small town which comprised a cluster of three buildings. Bonus points could be earned for flying under the bridge or along the main street of the town at a lower altitude than the buildings. Double points were earned for performing these stunts upside down. The game also had a shoot-'em-up mode in which alien vessels were seeded in the fields, feeding on the crops and growing until they could become airborne, at which point they headed for the town. The player could destroy the aliens on the ground as they fed, or (for reduced points) tackle them in the air (the aliens were agile but could not return fire). If an alien reached the town, the game was lost. A minor bug permitted the plane to be landed upside down without consequence, so long as the landing gear had been deployed.

Although better known for his [[Formula One]] simulation games on the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Amiga]] platforms, his first motor racing simulator was ''[[REVS (computer game)|REVS]]'', a [[Formula Three]] simulator that debuted on the BBC Micro platform in 1984. The BBC version of ''Revs'' featured just one track, the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] circuit, but the realistic implementation of motor racing physics and artificial intelligence of the computer controlled components gave the game enormous depth and replayability.

A [[Commodore 64]] version of the game, entitled ''Revs Plus'', was released in 1986, which added the [[Brands Hatch]] track to the game. An enhanced edition of the BBC version was later released called 'REVS 4 Tracks' which included Brands Hatch, [[Donington Park]], [[Oulton Park]] and [[Snetterton Motor Racing Circuit|Snetterton]] race tracks. Later the [[Commodore 64]] version added the [[Nürburgring]] to this list to continue the \"4 Tracks\" theme as Brands Hatch had already been included with the initial ''REVS Plus'' release. The Nürburgring was chosen as its new layout had recently been completed and computer based design data was available. This gives an idea of just how accurate REVS was as a simulation rather than 'just' a game.

''[[The Sentinel (computer game)|The Sentinel]]'' was published by [[Firebird (software label)|Firebird]] on the BBC Micro in 1986. It was a 3D puzzle game, featuring ten thousand levels, in which the player had to manoeuvre his way through a landscape of cliffs, trees and boulders to topple the ominous Sentinel. The game was a critical and commercial success. Conversions for the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64|C64]], [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]] and PC soon followed. A sequel, ''[[Sentinel Returns]]'', was published by [[Psygnosis]] in 1998 on the PC and [[PlayStation]] platforms.

It gets its name from the ancient church that was located near to where the current Church of Ireland is located on Church Street looking over the town. It is near the [[River Bann]], which marks the boundary between County Londonderry and [[County Antrim]]. In the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]] it had a population of 2,724 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk/public/AreaProfileReportViewer.aspx?FromAPAddressMulipleRecords=Kilrea@Exact|title=statistics|first=Northern Ireland Statistics and Research|last=Agency|date=|website=www.ninis2.nisra.gov.uk|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref> It is situated within [[Causeway Coast and Glens]] district.

== History ==
There is a tradition that [[St Patrick]] visited the area during the fifth century, a story repeated recently in the book 'The Fairy Thorn' produced by Kilrea local historians. Today Kilrea is a market town and commercial centre of the surrounding district. The village is centred on 'The Diamond' which includes the town's War Memorial erected in honour of Kilrea men killed in the [[World War I|Great War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulsterwarmemorials.net/html/kilrea.html|title=Ulster War Memorials|author=|date=|website=ulsterwarmemorials.net|accessdate=22 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820055609/http://www.ulsterwarmemorials.net/html/kilrea.html|archive-date=20 August 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The village is featured in the song ''Kitty the rose of Kilrea'' by The Irish Rover band.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=== The Troubles ===
A total of seven people died in violence relating to [[the Troubles]]. Five were killed by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and two by the [[Ulster Freedom Fighters]] (UFF). All the IRA's victims were current or former members of the security forces, with two belonging to the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], one a current and one a former member of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]], and one belonging to the [[British Territorial Army]]. All were [[Protestant]]s and three of the five were off duty when they were killed. According to the Sutton Index of Deaths, both men killed by the UFF were former members of the IRA. At the time of their deaths both were associated with [[Sinn Féin]]. Both were [[Catholic]]. Of the seven killed in the Kilrea Troubles, all were killed in separate incidents and all were shot except one of the RUC officers, who was killed by a [[booby trap]] bomb while on patrol. While deaths in many other areas were concentrated in the early 1970s, in Kilrea they were spread between 1976 and 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/index.html|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths - menu page|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|date=|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=22 April 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Hillfield Court in the winter.jpg|thumb|right|Hillfield Court on a winter's morning]]

'''Hillfield Court''' is a prominent [[art deco]] residential [[mansion block]] in [[Belsize Park]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], built in 1934. It is located off Belsize Avenue and can also be accessed from Glenloch Road. It is one of the many purpose built mansion blocks on Haverstock Hill between [[Chalk Farm]] and [[Hampstead]]. It is close to the amenities near [[Belsize Park tube station]], as well as the shops of Belsize Village, South End Green and Hampstead.

== Site history ==

Hillfield Court sits on what was once a large country estate known as the Belsize Estate. The first recorded building on the site of what today is Hillfield Court was built in around 1646. It was known as the ''Blue House'' and was one of many rural abodes in the area belonging to wealthy merchants, who wanted a country residence within easy reach of London. The Blue House was accessed directly from Haverstock Hill. Little is known about the residents of the Blue House but evidence suggests that in 1650 it was occupied by one John Mascall and in 1679 by Thomas Butler. Between 1761 and 1773, the house was rebuilt and extended by merchant William Horsley.

In 1808, the Belsize Estate was split into 9 leasehold estates. The Hillfield leasehold, as well as the adjoining Belsize House leasehold (around {{convert|19|acre|m2}} in total) were bought by James Abel.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compid=22638&filename=fig09.gif]

In 1841 Basil Woodd, a [[Bond Street]] brandy merchant bought the lease from Abel, a {{convert|19|acre|m2|adj=on}} estate set within the boundaries of [[Belsize Avenue]], [[Belsize Park Gardens]] and [[Belsize Grove]]. By this time, the area to the west of Haverstock Hill was dotted with many country abodes. The former ''Blue House'' had by this stage been renovated, modernised and renamed ''Heathfield House'', a stuccoed 6-bedroom house with a library. Woodd acquired the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] of the land in 1857 and renamed the house ''Hillfield''. Sometime between 1864 and 1867 he built another house on the south end of the estate for his son Robert Ballard Woodd - This house was called Woodlands. Whilst Woodlands was demolished in 1901 to make way for higher density housing, Hillfield remained until 1928 when it was demolished.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22638 Hampstead - Belsize | British History Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The land was bought by Hillfield Estates Ltd, a company formed in 1933 by FL, WJ and AG Griggs (Frank, William and Alfred).

The activities of Griggs & Son Ltd of Victoria St, London included land development in Pinner, building theatres<ref>http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk</ref> for the Astoria group in London and in [[Astoria Theatre, Brighton|Brighton (1933)]] and building at least two other theatres in the West End. Griggs & Son developed the Hillfield site to cater for the high demand for mansion blocks. The destruction of the old house and the development of the estate was met with some local opposition, however.

'''Hillfield Court''' is a prominent [[art deco]] residential [[mansion block]] in [[Belsize Park]], in the [[London Borough of Camden]], built in 1934. It is located off Belsize Avenue and can also be accessed from Glenloch Road. It is one of the many purpose built mansion blocks on Haverstock Hill between [[Chalk Farm]] and [[Hampstead]]. It is close to the amenities near [[Belsize Park tube station]], as well as the shops of Belsize Village, South End Green and Hampstead.

== Site history ==

Hillfield Court sits on what was once a large country estate known as the Belsize Estate. The first recorded building on the site of what today is Hillfield Court was built in around 1646. It was known as the ''Blue House'' and was one of many rural abodes in the area belonging to wealthy merchants, who wanted a country residence within easy reach of London. The Blue House was accessed directly from Haverstock Hill. Little is known about the residents of the Blue House but evidence suggests that in 1650 it was occupied by one John Mascall and in 1679 by Thomas Butler. Between 1761 and 1773, the house was rebuilt and extended by merchant William Horsley.

In 1808, the Belsize Estate was split into 9 leasehold estates. The Hillfield leasehold, as well as the adjoining Belsize House leasehold (around {{convert|19|acre|m2}} in total) were bought by James Abel.[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/image.aspx?compid=22638&filename=fig09.gif]

In 1841 Basil Woodd, a [[Bond Street]] brandy merchant bought the lease from Abel, a {{convert|19|acre|m2|sing=on}} estate set within the boundaries of [[Belsize Avenue]], [[Belsize Park Gardens]] and [[Belsize Grove]]. By this time, the area to the west of Haverstock Hill was dotted with many country abodes. The former ''Blue House'' had by this stage been renovated, modernised and renamed ''Heathfield House'', a stuccoed 6-bedroom house with a library. Woodd acquired the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] of the land in 1857 and renamed the house ''Hillfield''. Sometime between 1864 and 1867 he built another house on the south end of the estate for his son Robert Ballard Woodd - This house was called Woodlands. Whilst Woodlands was demolished in 1901 to make way for higher density housing, Hillfield remained until 1928 when it was demolished.<ref>[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=22638 Hampstead - Belsize | British History Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The land was bought by Hillfield Estates Ltd, a company formed in 1933 by FL, WJ and AG Griggs (Frank, William and Alfred).

The activities of Griggs & Son Ltd of Victoria St, London included land development in Pinner, building theatres<ref>http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk</ref> for the Astoria group in London and in [[Astoria Theatre, Brighton|Brighton (1933)]] and building at least two other theatres in the West End. Griggs & Son developed the Hillfield site to cater for the high demand for mansion blocks. The destruction of the old house and the development of the estate was met with some local opposition, however.

[[File:Carl Vigeland.jpg|thumb|Carl Vigeland in 2011]]

'''Carl Vigeland''' is an American writer and lecturer who lives in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]].

==Biography==
The son of musicians, Vigeland was born in Englewood, NJ, and spent his childhood in [[Buffalo, NY]].  He graduated from [[Harvard University]] cum laude (majoring in government) and later earned a master's degree in education from [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. He lived many years in Conway, MA, before moving to Amherst, MA where he and his family have resided since 1991. He is the brother of composer and pianist [[Nils Vigeland]].

==Career==
Vigeland began his writing career as a newspaper reporter and reviewer while freelancing for magazines. Vigeland worked at Amherst College from 1978–83, writing and editing several of the school’s publications, before leaving to write about the oldest corporation in America, Harvard University. His first book, ''Great Good Fortune: How Harvard Makes Its Money'', was published by Houghton Mifflin Company in 1986.

An amateur pianist and trumpet player, and an expert skier and golfer, Vigeland has written on wide-ranging topics for such magazines as ''The Atlantic Monthly'', ''Harper's'', ''The New Yorker'', ''Boston Magazine'', ''The Boston Globe Magazine'', ''Conde Nast Traveler'', ''Country Journal'', ''DoubleTake'', ''Downbeat'', ''Fast Company'', ''Golf Digest'', ''Harvard'', ''New England Monthly'', ''The New York Times Magazine'', ''Playboy'', ''Sports Illustrated'', and ''Yankee.\"

His second book, ''In Concert: Onstage and Offstage with the Boston Symphony Orchestra'' was published by William Morrow and Company in 1989. The book chronicles music director [[Seiji Ozawa]], trumpeter Charlie Schlueter and the entire [[Boston Symphony Orchestra|BSO]] throughout the 1986-1987 season. Publishers Weekly lauded the book for \"demystifying and humanizing the august Boston Symphony Orchestra\" and noted that \"Vigeland is at his best in conveying the emotive power of music, making palpable the feelings of the musicians when a concert goes well and they are overwhelmed at the sound they have made.\"<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Concert-Onstage-Offstage-Symphony-Orchestra/dp/0688075517/ref=la_B001H6S19S_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1386636476&sr=1-2</ref>

Vigeland taught writing for many years at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. He  was instrumental in developing courses at UMass for its award-winning Certificate in Online Journalism. He also taught journalism at Greenfield Community College, where he is president of the Executive Committee of the Friends of the Archibald MacLeish Collection.

In 1994, W.W. Norton and Company published Vigeland's ''Stalking the Shark: Pressure & Passion on the Pro Golf Tour''. Focusing on [[Greg Norman]], the book explores what really separates the great golfer from the rest of the field.

In 2001, after a decade on the road with the jazz trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]], he collaborated with Marsalis on ''Jazz in the Bittersweet Blues of Life'',<ref>Da Capo Press Think Music Think Da Capo http://www.dacapopressmusic.com/titlepage.asp?ID=11 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217073026/http://www.dacapopressmusic.com/titlepage.asp?ID=11# |date=2010-12-17 }}</ref> journaling life on the road, in the recording studio, and in concerts with Marsalis, his ensemble, and road crew in the early 1990s. Library Journal recommended the book, saying \"This period saw Marsalis, currently director of Jazz at Lincoln Center, honing his chops at little clubs and composing songs. While not a traditional biography, this book provides a very real, personal glimpse of Marsalis, as both musician and man. Trumpeter and music writer Vigeland, who tagged along with the septet, here allows his coauthor's sense of humor to shine through. The book's film-inspired techniques make for an unpredictable, ever-evolving reading experience, and readers will come away with a feeling for life on the road, stripped of its many false stereotypes.<ref>https://www.amazon.com/Jazz-Bittersweet-Blues-Wynton-Marsalis/dp/product-description/0306811278/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&n=283155&s=books</ref>\"

The next year, Vigeland returned to the subject of golf, collaborating with [[Bob Duval]] on ''Letters to a Young Golfer'', published by Basic Books as part of their \"The Art of Mentoring\" series.

In 2009, Wiley published Vigeland's ''Mostly Mozart Guide to Mozart'', a concise biography accompanied by insights into Mozart's most important works in a variety of genres.

Vigeland’s seventh and perhaps most personal book is ''The Breathless Present'', published by Levellers Press in 2011. Both an autobiography and a road book, in ''The Breathless Present'' Vigeland shares portraits of an unusual grouping of people, ranging from an early mentor and one-time neighbor, the late poet [[Archibald MacLeish]], to jazz great [[Wynton Marsalis]], and the author charismatic, tormented father, also a musician. The work tells several intersecting stories in a variety of voices that mirror music's power to transmute memory and affirm life.

Vigeland's latest books are ''Jonathan's Sternberg'', a biography of conductor and teacher [[Jonathan Sternberg]], published in 2014, ''The Great Romance: The Sun Returns, Time Never'', published in 2015, and ''A Symphony for Shelbie'' and ''Dear President Trump: An Open Letter on Greatness'', both published in 2019.

== Production ==
Kariya is the second film of [[Prem (film director)|Prem]] as a director after Excuse Me. Having a gangster backdrop, director Prem and producer Anekal Balaraj bailed out 23 criminals to act in the film. Balraj tried to persuade a female mobster Mari Mutthu to act in the film. However, Mari Mutthu who was a councillor refused the offer fearing it might tarnish her reputation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viggy.com/news/volume2/current_kariya.asp|title=23 Rowdies in Kariya|website=viggy.com|accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> Certain scenes involving these rowdies were shot in exactly the same spot where they have killed or assaulted their targets in the past. [[Darshan Thoogudeep|Darshan]] who made his debut through the crime film [[Majestic (film)|Majestic]] was chosen to play the titular role while [[Abhinayashree|Abhirami]], daughter of actress Anuradha was signed in to play the female lead. [[Gurukiran]] has scored and composed the film's soundtrack. Cinematography was handled by Seenu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viggy.com/english/wings_kariya.asp|website=viggy.com|title=Darshan's Kariya to release on January 3rd|accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref>

== Reception ==
=== Critical Reception ===
According to ''Viggy'', \"There are some catchy dialogues and comedy to make you laugh if you are freezed looking at the blood pool.\" Though they criticised the musical score by Gurukiran and wrong casting of Darshan in the lead role, the film's cinematography and Prem's direction received praise. The similarities of certain scenes with that of Om and Satya were pointed out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viggy.com/english/review_kariya.asp|title=Kariya review|website=viggy.com|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref>
 
''Chitraloka'' criticised the film for not catering much to the women or the younger generation. But they praised Darshan's performance, Gurukiran's music and M. R. Seenu's camerawork were appreciated.

Kariya had a big opening. It ran for 35 to 56 days at Kapali theatre during its first release. At the end of its first run the film was declared a [[sleeper hit]].

== Production ==
Kariya is the second film of [[Prem (film director)|Prem]] as a director after Excuse Me. Having a gangster backdrop, director Prem and producer Anekal Balaraj bailed out 23 criminals to act in the film. Balraj tried to persuade a female mobster Mari Mutthu to act in the film. However, Mari Mutthu who was a councillor refused the offer fearing it might tarnish her reputation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viggy.com/news/volume2/current_kariya.asp|title=23 Rowdies in Kariya|website=viggy.com|accessdate=16 February 2020}}</ref> Certain scenes involving these rowdies were shot in exactly the same spot where they have killed or assaulted their targets in the past. [[Darshan Thoogudeep|Darshan]] who made his debut through the crime film [[Majestic (film)|Majestic]] was chosen to play the titular role while [[Abhinayashree|Abhirami]], daughter of actress Anuradha was signed in to play the female lead.

== Reception ==
=== Critical Reception ===
According to ''Viggy'', \"There are some catchy dialogues and comedy to make you laugh if you are freezed looking at the blood pool.\" Though they criticised the musical score by Gurukiran and wrong casting of Darshan in the lead role, the film's cinematography and Prem's direction received praise. The similarities of certain scenes with that of Om and Satya were pointed out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viggy.com/english/review_kariya.asp|title=Kariya review|website=viggy.com|accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref>
 
''Chitraloka'' criticised the film for not catering much to the women or the younger generation. But they praised Darshan's performance, Gurukiran's music and M. R. Seenu's camerawork were appreciated. The film was also lauded for its technical prowness.<ref>{{Cite web|date=3 January 2003|accessdate=11 February 2020|title=ಕರಿಯ Review|website=chitraloka.com|url=https://www.chitraloka.com/movie-reviews/2803-kariya-review.html}}</ref>

The '''{{Nihongo|House of Peers|貴族院| Kizoku-in }}''' was the [[upper house]] of the [[National Diet#History|Imperial Diet]] as mandated under the [[Meiji Constitution|Constitution]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] (in effect from 11 February 1889 to 3 May 1947).

==Background==
[[File:Yōshū Chikanobu House of Peers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emperor Meiji]] in a formal session of the House of Peers. [[Ukiyo-e]] woodblock print by [[Toyohara Chikanobu|Yōshū Chikanobu]], 1890]]
In 1869, under the new [[Meiji government]], a Japanese [[peerage]] was created by an Imperial decree merging the former Court nobility ''([[kuge]])'' and former feudal lords (''[[daimyō]]s'') into a single new [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] [[Social class|class]] called the ''[[kazoku]].'' A second imperial ordinance in 1884 grouped the ''kazoku'' into five ranks equivalent to the [[Europe]]an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s, [[prince]] (or [[duke]]), [[marquis]], [[count]], [[viscount]], and [[baron]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_RXAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA631&lpg=PA631&dq=House+of+Peers+(Japan)&source=bl&ots=Cb1nv_wagI&sig=z1KYEzjxaO3MTSIeMRsnFUo0VqM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwib9L3Ct-rVAhVB7CYKHTVlBkw4ChDoAQgtMAI#v=onepage&q=House%20of%20Peers%20(Japan)&f=false|title=The Twentieth Century|date=1907|publisher=Nineteenth Century and After|language=en}}</ref> Although this grouping idea was taken from the European peerage, the Japanese titles were taken from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and based on the ancient [[Social structure of China|feudal system in China]]. [[Itō Hirobumi]] and the other [[Meiji period|Meiji]] leaders deliberately modeled the chamber on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[House of Lords]], as a counterweight to the popularly elected [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] (''Shūgiin'').

==Establishment==
In 1889, the House of Peers Ordinance established the House of Peers and its composition. For the first session of the Imperial Diet (November 1890–March 1891), there were 145 hereditary members and 106 imperial appointees and high taxpayers, for a total of 251 members. In the 1920s, four new peers elected by the [[Japan Academy|Japan Imperial Academy]] were added, and the number of peers elected by the top taxpayers of each prefecture was increased from 47 to 66 as some prefectures now elected two members. Inversely, the minimum age for hereditary (dukes and marquesses) and mutually elected (counts, viscounts and barons) noble peers was increased to 30, slightly reducing their number. By 1938, membership reached 409 seats.<ref>p. 109, \"Government: The Imperial Diet - House of Peers,\" Japan Year Book 1938-1939, Kenkyusha Press, Foreign Association of Japan, Tokyo</ref> After the addition of seats for the Empire's colonies Chōsen (Japanese colonial name of Korea) and Taiwan (Japanese name of Formosa) during the last stages of WWII, it stood at 418 at the beginning of the 89th Imperial Diet in November 1945,<ref>[[National Diet Library]], Reference (レファレンス, an NDL periodical) 2005.5, Hidehisa Ōyama [http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_999894_po_065202.pdf?contentNo=1 帝国議会の運営と会議録をめぐって]; contains an appended table listing membership by category at the beginning of each Imperial Diet]</ref> briefly before Douglas MacArthur's \"purge\" barred many members from public office. In 1947 during its 92nd and final session, the number of members was 373.

==Composition==
After revisions to the ordinance, notably in 1925, the House of Peers comprised:
# The [[Crown Prince]] ''(Kōtaishi)'' and the Imperial Grandson and Heir Presumptive ''(Kōtaison)'' from the age of 18, with the term of office for life.
# All Imperial Princes ''(shinnō)'' and lesser Princes of the Imperial Blood ''(ō)'' over the age of 20, with the term of office for life.
# All Princes and Marquises over the age of 25 (raised to 30 in 1925), with the term of office for life.
# 18 Counts, 66 Viscounts and 66 Barons over the age of 25 (raised to 30 in 1925), for seven-year terms.
# 125 distinguished politicians and scientists over the age of 30 and nominated by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] in consultation with the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]], with the term of office for life
# 4 members of the Imperial Academy over the age of 30, elected by the academicians and nominated by the Emperor, for seven-year terms.
# 66 elected representatives of the 6000 highest taxpayers, over the age of 30 and for seven-year terms.

==Postwar dissolution==
After [[World War II]], under the current [[Constitution of Japan]], in effect from 3 May 1947, the unelected House of Peers was replaced by an elected [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]].

In the 1920s, four new peers elected by the [[Japan Academy|The Japan Imperial Academy]] were added, and the number of peers elected by the top taxpayers of each prefecture was increased from 47 to 66 as some prefectures now elected two members. Inversely, the minimum age for hereditary (dukes and marquesses) and mutually elected (counts, viscounts and barons) noble peers was increased to 30, slightly reducing their number. By 1938, membership reached 409 seats.<ref>p. 109, \"Government: The Imperial Diet - House of Peers,\" Japan Year Book 1938-1939, Kenkyusha Press, Foreign Association of Japan, Tokyo</ref> After the addition of seats for the Empire's colonies Chōsen (Japanese colonial name of Korea) and Taiwan (Japanese name of Formosa) during the last stages of WWII, it stood at 418 at the beginning of the 89th Imperial Diet in November 1945,<ref>[[National Diet Library]], Reference (レファレンス, an NDL periodical) 2005.5, Hidehisa Ōyama [http://dl.ndl.go.jp/view/download/digidepo_999894_po_065202.pdf?contentNo=1 帝国議会の運営と会議録をめぐって]; contains an appended table listing membership by category at the beginning of each Imperial Diet]</ref> briefly before Douglas MacArthur's \"purge\" barred many members from public office. In 1947 during its 92nd and final session, the number of members was 373.

==Composition==
After revisions to the ordinance, notably in 1925, the House of Peers comprised:
# The [[Crown Prince]] ''(Kōtaishi)'' and the Imperial Grandson and Heir Presumptive ''(Kōtaison)'' from the age of 18, with the term of office for life.
# All Imperial Princes ''(shinnō)'' and lesser Princes of the Imperial Blood ''(ō)'' over the age of 20, with the term of office for life.
# All Princes and Marquises over the age of 25 (raised to 30 in 1925), with the term of office for life.
# 18 Counts, 66 Viscounts and 66 Barons over the age of 25 (raised to 30 in 1925), for seven-year terms.
# 125 distinguished politicians and scientists over the age of 30 and nominated by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] in consultation with the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]], with the term of office for life
# 4 members of the Imperial Academy over the age of 30, elected by the academicians and nominated by the Emperor, for seven-year terms.
# 66 elected representatives of the 6000 highest taxpayers, over the age of 30 and for seven-year terms.

==Postwar dissolution==
After [[World War II]], under the current [[Constitution of Japan]], in effect from 3 May 1947, the unelected House of Peers was replaced by an elected [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]].

'''Chris Langford''' (born 2 January 1963) is a former professional [[Australian rules football]]er who has been an [[AFL Commission]]er since 1999.

==Player==
Langford is best known for his 303-game career for the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] between 1983 and 1997.

Langford played his early games for Hawthorn on the wing or as the second ruckman. He had a good leap which compensated for his lack of height. It was after the retirement of Peter Knights and David O'Halloran he switched to full back . It was that position in which he won his first All-Australian selection in 1987.

A defender, Langford won four premierships with Hawthorn, in 1986, 1988, 1989 and 1991. He captained the club in the 1994 season and earned a second [[All-Australian]] selection.

He holds a place on the interchange bench in Hawthorn's official 'Team of the Century'.

Late in his career, Langford moved to [[Sydney]] where he worked as an accountant, commuting to Melbourne to training and play with his club. In 2012, he moved back to Melbourne.

===Merger game===
Langford's antics at the end of the [[Melbourne Hawks|merger game]] against Melbourne in 1996 inspired many Hawthorn members to vote against the merger proposal. Langford (Hawthorn's full back) took off his Hawthorn jumper and proudly held it above his head while leaving the field. Langford was only one of the then playing list to display his disapproval of the plan.

<!-- Called Pueblo in source. -->
The [[United States]] took control of Puerto Rico from [[Spain]] in the aftermath of the [[Spanish-American War]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]]. In 1899, the United States conducted its first [[census]] of Puerto Rico, finding that the population of Pueblo, and [[Quebrada Arenas, Las Piedras, Puerto Rico|Quebrada Arenas]], a neighboring barrio, was 1,449.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States.

[[AllMusic]] editor William Ruhlmann noted how the band was an oddity in Earache's mostly death metal roster but gave praise to their musical ability to harken back to late '60s hard rock reminiscent of [[Led Zeppelin]] (\"Pressure & Time\", \"Gypsy Heart\") and [[Hush (Deep Purple song)|Hush]]-era [[Deep Purple]] (\"All Over the Road\"), concluding that \"anyone who likes that kind of music should overlook the implications of the record label and check out Rival Sons.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Joseph Giannone of Cinema Blend was ambivalent towards the record, commending the band's catchy musicianship for capturing late '60s and '70s hard rock but felt it lacked virtuosity and a style to call their own. He singled out the title track, \"Gypsy Heart\" and \"Face of Light\" for showcasing the band's potential in their given subgenre and should be used as a blueprint to follow, saying that \"instead of concerning themselves with easily digestible music, then maybe this album would have been distinguished.\"<ref name=\"CB\"/>

[[AllMusic]] editor William Ruhlmann noted how the band was an oddity in Earache's mostly death metal roster but gave praise to their musical ability to harken back to late '60s hard rock reminiscent of [[Led Zeppelin]] (\"Pressure & Time\", \"Gypsy Heart\") and [[Hush (Deep Purple song)|Hush]]-era [[Deep Purple]] (\"All Over the Road\"), concluding that \"anyone who likes that kind of music should overlook the implications of the record label and check out Rival Sons.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> Joseph Giannone of Cinema Blend was ambivalent towards the record, commending the band's catchy musicianship for capturing late '60s and '70s hard rock but felt it lacked virtuosity and a style to call their own. He singled out the title track, \"Gypsy Heart\" and \"Face of Light\" for showcasing the band's potential in their given subgenre and should be used as a blueprint to follow, saying that \"instead of concerning themselves with easily digestible music, then maybe this album would have been distinguished.\"<ref name=\"CB\"/>

The '''Nauvoo Illinois Temple''' is the 113th dedicated [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). It is the third such temple that has been built in [[Illinois]] (the [[Nauvoo Temple|original Nauvoo Temple]] and [[Chicago Illinois Temple]] being the others).

==History==
Located in the town of [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], the temple's construction was announced on April 4, 1999, by [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]]. Groundbreaking was conducted on October 24, 1999 and the cornerstones were laid November 5, 2000. The structure itself was built in the [[Greek Revival]] architectural style using limestone block quarried in [[Russellville, Alabama]]. It is built in the same location as the [[Nauvoo Temple|original structure]] that was dedicated in 1846.

The origins of the temple go back to 1937. In that year, Wilford C. Wood purchased some of the land on behalf of the LDS Church and purchased another piece of land that he later sold to the church. He also organized a group of church members from the Chicago Illinois [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]], co-led by Ariel S. Williams, to clear and beautify the recently purchased land. At the time, the Chicago Stake was one of only two east of the Mississippi River.<ref>[https://rsc.byu.edu/es/archived/nauvoo-temple-story-faith/13-temple-rebuilt Don F. Colvin. ''Nauvoo Temple: A Story of Faith''. BYU Religious Studies Center, Chapter 13]</ref>

Wood purchased land in 1951 that included a house which was made a visitors center for the temple site. In the late-1950s, and then in 1962, agents for the LDS Church completed the purchase of the temple lot.<ref>Colvin, ''Nauvoo Temple''</ref>

==Exterior design and decoration==
The building measures {{convert|130|ft|m}} long, {{convert|90|ft|m}} wide, and {{convert|162|ft|m}} tall to the top of the statue of angel Moroni.  It has an area of {{convert|54000|sqft|m2}}.  It is the only temple owned by the LDS Church today that has a bell tower, although the [[Kirtland Temple]] also has a bell tower. The temple spire is surmounted by a standing statue of the [[angel Moroni]] covered in gold leaf, following the pattern of the statue on the Salt Lake temple. The angel on the first Nauvoo temple was a weather vane, sculpted of metal. The figure was positioned horizontally as if it were flying. Clothed in a robe and cap. The angel held a book in one hand and a trumpet in the other.  

Church leaders and architects carefully worked to replicate the original exterior design of the [[Nauvoo Temple|19th-century temple]], which was damaged by an arson fire in 1848 and by a tornado on May 27, 1850. It was consequently condemned and demolished by the Nauvoo City Council. Construction materials and furniture were derived from the original design as well.

==Interior design and decoration==
The interior floor plan of the temple is noticeably different from the original structure in which the endowment ceremony assumed its present format. At the direction of Joseph Smith, the west end of the attic story was divided by cloth partitions into four spaces used to administer the endowment. One of the canvas \"rooms\" was decorated with potted plants to suggest the Garden of Eden. 

The Salt Lake City [[Endowment House]] and early Utah temples, each with a series of four rooms through which patrons moved during the presentation of the endowment, followed this layout. The first three rooms were decorated with murals representing, in succession, the creation of the world, the Garden of Eden, and the world after the fall of Adam and Eve. The fourth room, known as the Terrestrial Room, was ornately decorated but lacked murals. The [[Los Angeles California Temple]], dedicated in 1956, was the last temple with this layout. Temples built after Los Angeles present the endowment in one or two rooms without murals adorning the ordinance rooms. The use of murals resumed again in 2001 with the opening of the [[Columbia River Washington Temple]].{{cn|date=April 2020}}. The Nauvoo Illinois Temple, a throwback to the four room layout, is the sole exception, as it has the four-room progressive format with murals decorating the first three rooms. 

==Open house and dedication==
After the temple was completed, a public open house from 6 May to 22 June 2002 attracted over 250,000 visitors to tour the temple. The completion and official dedication took place on June 27, 2002, on the anniversary of the death of [[Joseph Smith]], the church's founder.

Up to 1.5 million visitors a year have visited Nauvoo since the temple opened in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title= Mormon temple a tourism draw for tiny Nauvoo |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2006-08-22-mormon-temple-tourism_x.htm |first= Jan |last= Dennis |date= August 22, 2006 |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |agency= [[Associated Press|AP]] }}</ref>

In 2020, like all the church's other temples, the Nauvoo Illinois Temple was closed in response to the [[2019–20 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>Stack, Peggy Fletcher. [https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2020/03/26/all-latter-day-saint/ \"All Latter-day Saint temples to close due to coronavirus\"], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 26 March 2020.

Eastern European people,safe,Peipsi-Pihkva,"The '''New Economic Mechanism (NEM)''' was a major [[economic reform]] launched in the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] in 1968. Between 1972 and 1978, it was curtailed by the prevailing winds of [[Eastern Bloc politics]]. During the subsequent decade, until the [[revolutions of 1989]] ended the era, the NEM's principles continued to affect the [[economy of Hungary|Hungarian economy]], even in cases where the \"NEM\" name was not emphasized. Because of the NEM, Hungary in the 1980s had a higher ratio of [[market mechanism]]s to [[central planning]] than any other Eastern Bloc economy. The ratio was different to an extent that was [[politics|politically]] challenging to bring about in the Soviet sphere because of the [[ideology|ideological]] mixture it required. The name [[Goulash Communism]] was jokingly (but tellingly) applied to this mixture. The Hungarian economy under the influence of NEM principles was widely viewed as outperforming other Eastern Bloc economies, making Hungary \"the happiest barrack\" in [[barracks communism]]. Many Soviet and [[Eastern European people]] enjoyed going to Hungary (for example, on work assignments or on vacations) because of the economic and cultural environment there.

The tensions and harmonies between market mechanisms and central planning, with neither having sole control, are a perennial challenge in all societies that temper capitalism with socialism or vice versa. In some ways Hungary's economic reform channels comparisons with the [[Chinese economic reform]], in the sense that both were qualitative challenges to a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] type of system—and thus that such reforms were not politically feasible in most of the Eastern Bloc.

== Reform ==
The period from 1956–1968 was one of reform in Eastern Europe. The beginning of these transformations was marked by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], which resulted in [[János Kádár]]’s placement as the communist leader of the [[People's Republic of Hungary]] and the creation of the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (HSWP). For the first ten years of his rule, Kádár’s objective was to create a united Hungary, announcing in December 1961 that \"those who are not against us are with us.\" Having reached social peace, Kádár turned his attention to economic improvement.

On 7 May 1966, the Central Committee of the HSWP announced Kádár's plans for the reform of the economy, known as the New Economic Mechanism (NEM).<ref name = \"Belassa\">Balassa, Bela. ''The Economic Reform in Hungary''. Economica, New Series, Vol. 37, No. 145.

World Politics, Vol. 25, No. 3. (Apr., 1973), pp. 414-429.</ref> The plan, which became official 1 January 1968, was a major shift to decentralization in an attempt to overcome the inefficiencies of [[central planning]]. The NEM represented a move away from the soviet economic system of compulsory plan indicators in favor of a policy that states profits as the enterprise's main goal. The new economic policy was a \"comprehensive reform of the economic system\", creating market relationships among firms, using prices as allocative functions and firms responding to prices to maximize profits, and using profits to budget new investments.<ref name=\"Belassa\"/>

== Enterprises ==

The Central Committee's document on 7 May 1966 details changes in the firm's role under the new economic policy. The reform gave producers the freedom to decide what and how much they produce and offer for sale and to establish commercial or co-operative relationships. Buyers were also given the freedom to choose between domestic goods and imports. Additionally, firms were given greater autonomy in carrying out investments and hiring labor. As dictated by the Central Committee, success is to be measured by a firm's profitability.<ref name=\"Belassa\"/> The decentralized structure of the New Economic Mechanism marked an improvement in the decision making process, allowing for basic decisions to be made at the local level without information having to be transmitted upward for a more centralized decision.<ref name=\"Granick\"/>  The Hungarian government made 50.5%(enterprises 49.5%) of the investment decisions for the 68 billion [[forint]] invested in 1968, while in 1974 enterprises accounted for 53.1% of the decisions for the 128 billion forint invested.<ref name = \"Das\">Das Gupta, K.K.. ''The Nature of Post-Reform Economic Management in Eastern Europe: The Hungarian Case''. Social Scientist, Vol. 9, No. 1. (Aug., 1980), pp. 3-17.</ref>

== Prices ==

The New Economic Mechanism also aimed to create a more active role for prices.<ref name = \"Hare\">Hare, P.G. ''Industrial Prices in Hungary Part I: The New Economic Mechanism''. [[Soviet Studies]], Vol. 28, No. 2. (Apr., 1976), pp. 189-206.</ref>  A system of free prices reflecting market conditions was implemented. The government wanted flexibility, but also to combat inflation. To do so, they introduced a new practice of price controls declaring an item's price as fixed, limited, or free.

'''''Fixed prices''''' were classified as material and basic intermediate goods. The price was fixed because of the good's impact on the economy and the overall need to ensure stability. The price was determined by ministries.

'''''Limited prices''''' referred to particular products or products in some product group for which there were no substitutes, such as bread. It was applied on the average price over a period or a window within which prices were free to fluctuate.

'''''Free prices''''' were assigned to goods that formed small parts of individual expenditures or were regarded as luxuries.<ref name = \"Hare\"/>

The price reform allowed for prices better to reflect the cost of production and the valuation by the market, and to correspond more closely to \"some measure of socially necessary inputs\",<ref name = \"Hare\"/> helping reach market equilibrium.

== Foreign trade ==

The goal of the New Economic Mechanism consisted of improving Hungary's economy to make Hungary a serious contributor to the international economy. In 1966 the Soviet Union accounted for 32% of Hungary's exports and 29% of its imports. Of Hungary's exports to Western Developed Countries, 42.7% was Food and Live Animals, 43.5% Manufactured Goods. Meanwhile, trade with Socialist Countries consisted largely of Manufactured Goods (81.3%). Conversely, Hungary's imports from the West were primarily Manufactured Goods (70.6%).<ref name = \"Belassa\"/> Because of the pre-existing quota system which placed an emphasis on quantity, not quality, Hungarian goods were inferior and did not meet Western technological standards.

Decentralization provided enterprises with the opportunity to better align with the world market by giving them more freedom in deciding which products and technologies to invest in and manufacture. Additionally, firms were paid for exports in the Hungarian currency equivalent of the foreign currency they earned, as the government aimed to involve enterprises in foreign markets and in improving the quality of goods produced.<ref name = \"Granick\"/> The new plan established direct connections between the foreign and domestic markets on the basis of an appropriate exchange rate.<ref name = \"Granick\"/> The primary concern of the New Economic Mechanism was in improving foreign trade and establishing a relationship between success in exportation and a firm's profitability.<ref name = \"Belassa\"/>

Distinguishing [[fact]] from opinion is that facts are verifiable, i.e. can be agreed to by the consensus of experts.  An example is: \"United States of America was involved in the [[Vietnam War]],\" versus \"United States of America was right to get involved in the Vietnam War\". An opinion may be supported by facts and principles, in which case it becomes an [[argument]].

Different people may draw opposing conclusions (opinions) even if they agree on the same set of facts. Opinions rarely change without new arguments being presented. It can be [[inductive reasoning|reasoned]] that one opinion is better supported by the facts than another, by analyzing the supporting arguments.<ref>{{cite book |last=Damer |first=T.

In casual use, the term ''opinion'' may be the result of a person's [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]], [[understanding]], particular feelings, beliefs, and [[desire (emotion)|desires]].  The term may also refer to unsubstantiated information, in contrast to [[knowledge]] and fact.

Though not hard fact, collective opinions or professional opinions are defined as meeting a higher standard to substantiate the opinion.

==Epistemology==
In [[economics]], other [[social sciences]] and [[philosophy]], analysis of social phenomena based on one's own opinion(s) is referred to as [[norm (philosophy)|normative]] analysis (what ''ought'' to be), as opposed to [[positivism|positive]] analysis, which is based on scientific observation (what materially ''is'' or is empirically demonstrable).

Historically, the distinction of demonstrated [[knowledge]] and opinion was articulated by [[Ancient Greek]] [[philosophers]]. Today, [[Plato]]'s analogy of the [[divided line]] is a well-known illustration of the distinction between knowledge and opinion, or [[knowledge]] and [[belief]], in customary terminology of contemporary philosophy. Opinions can be persuasive, but only the assertions they are based on can be said to be true or false.

==Collective and professional opinions==
{{Original research|section|date=December 2009}}

===Public opinion===
In contemporary usage, [[public opinion]] is the aggregate of individual attitudes or beliefs held by a population (e.g., a city, state, or country), while consumer opinion is the similar aggregate collected as part of [[marketing research]] (e.g., opinions of users of a particular product or service). Typically, because the process of gathering opinions from all individuals are difficult, expensive, or impossible to obtain, public opinion (or consumer opinion) is estimated using [[survey sampling]] (e.g., with a [[representative sample]] of a population).

===Group opinion===
In some social sciences, especially [[political science]] and [[psychology]], group opinion refers to the aggregation of opinions collected from a group of subjects, such as members of a [[jury]], [[legislature]], [[committee]], or other collective decision-making body. In these situations, researchers are often interested in questions related to [[social choice]], [[conformity]], and [[group polarization]].

===Scientific opinion===
\"Scientific opinion\" may reflect opinions on scientific concerns as articulated by one or more scientists, published in scholarly journals or respected textbooks, both of which entail peer-review and rigorous professional editing. It may also refer to opinions published by professional, academic, or governmental organizations about scientific findings and their possible implications.

A related—but not identical—term, [[scientific consensus]], is the prevailing view on a scientific topic within the scientific community, such as the [[scientific opinion on climate change]].

Scientific opinion(s) can be \"partial, temporally contingent, conflicting, and uncertain\"<ref name=Wynne>{{cite journal|title=Knowledges in Context|journal=Science, Technology & Human Values|year=1991|volume=16|issue=1|pages=111–121|author=Brian Wynne|doi=10.1177/016224399101600108|jstor=690044}}</ref> so that there may be no accepted consensus for a particular situation.

===Legal opinion===
A \"[[legal opinion]]\" or \"closing opinion\" is a type of professional opinion, usually contained in a formal legal-opinion letter, given by an attorney to a client or a third party. Most legal opinions are given in connection with [[business]] transactions. The opinion expresses the attorney's professional judgment regarding the legal aspect of the transaction. The opinion can be \"clean\" or \"reasoned\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Robert|title=Real Estate Opinion Letters: Introduction|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gpsolo_ereport/2012/october_2012/real_estate_opinion_letters_introduction.html|website=americanbar.org|accessdate=2 June 2016}}</ref> A legal opinion is not a guarantee that a court will reach any particular result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/tribar/materials/20050120000000.pdf |title=American Bar Association Committee on Legal Opinions, Legal Opinion Principles, 53 Bus.

===Judicial opinion===
A \"[[judicial opinion]]\" or \"opinion of the court\" is an opinion of a judge or group of judges that accompanies and explains an order or ruling in a controversy before the court. A judicial option generally lays out the facts that the court recognized as being established, the legal principles the court is bound by, and the application of the relevant principles to the recognized facts. The goal is to demonstrate the rationale the court used in reaching its decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/program/law/08-732/Courts/howtoreadv2.pdf |title=O.S.

===Editorial opinion===
An \"editorial opinion\" is the evaluation of a topic by a newspaper as conveyed on its [[editorial]] page.

'''''Drakula İstanbul'da''''' (''Dracula in Istanbul'') is a Turkish 1953 film version of [[Bram Stoker|Bram Stoker's]] original novel ''[[Dracula]]''.

The screenplay was based on a 1928 novel by [[Ali Riza Seyfi]] called ''Kazıklı Voyvoda'' (''Impaler Voivode''), and is more or less a translation of Stoker's novel, but there is no [[Renfield]] character and Güzin, the \"[[Mina Harker]]\" character, is a [[showgirl]] given to performing in revealing outfits. Drakula/Dracula is played by balding Atif Kaptan. Both the novel and the film make an explicit connection with the historical [[Vlad the Impaler]], the Prince and three-time Voivode of [[Wallachia]]. This is the first film to portray Dracula with fangs.

==Plot==
The year is 1953. Azmi, a lawyer, travels to Romania to close a real estate transaction with Count Dracula. Azmi receives a letter from Dracula at an inn in Bistritz. He meets fearful, superstitious people at the inn. They are frightened at the mention of Draculas name, and because it is the 14th of the month, a day of ill omen. A woman warns him not to go, but Azmi says he carries an amulet for protection. The hotel’ car only takes Azmi so far, and then Dracula’s own carriage picks him up. The Count himself, incognito, drives the carriage to the castle. At the castle, Azmi is greeted by the Count, who helps Azmi with his bags and shows him to his room. Dracula makes excuses as to the absence of his servants, and as to why he doesn't plan to eat dinner. Azmi enjoys a supper in which the Count does not join him. Dracula tells Azmi about Transylvanian history. Wolves howl outside, and the Count remarks: “Listen to them—the children of the night! They sing beautiful song”.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.42''.</ref>

A hunchbacked servant suddenly appears and  gives Azmi a key to the library and warns him not to sleep there. In the library, the Count tells Azmi to write three letters home, in which he is to say that he has already left Transylvania. Azmi and Dracula discuss the sale of the house in Istanbul. Azmi cuts his thumb. The sight of blood excites the Count. Azmi explores the castle and falls asleep in one of the rooms, and is attacked a vampire woman. The Count stops the attack, giving the woman a baby to feed on. Azmi awakes as if from a nightmare. Dracula helps him return to his room. Azmi finds a book about vampires in
the library-but all the pages on how to destoy them are ripped off. A woman comes to the castle pleading for the return of her child. Wolves kill her. Azmi finds a vault in which the Count reposes in a coffin-like box and tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails, whereupon he flees in terror. Dracula later tries to attack Azmi, but his servant  intervenes, and Dracula kills him. A rooster crows, and Dracula disappears. Next night looking out a window, Azmi sees Dracula climb head-first down the outer wall. Azmi returns to the vault in which the Count reposes in his box and again tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails. He also empties a revolver into the Count, but gunshots do not harm him. Azmi runs away.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.42-43''.</ref>

Back in Turkey, Azmi's wife Güzin receives one of his letters. She frets because it’s the first she's heard from him in ten days. Güzin spends her time with her best friend Sadan.  Sadan's mother, who has a heart condition, says Sadan has been ill and walking in her sleep lately. Though Sadan seems happy as she recently become engaged to Turan. Güzin and Sadan go to the seashore. While taking a walk, they meet four men carrying a coffin-like box, which they say is full of dirt from Romania. The men say that two other men hired to move the boxes of earth disap- peared in transit. That night Sadan walks in her sleep. Güzin follows her to the seashore and sees her near the foot of a seaside staircase, being preyed upon by Dracula, who disappears. Güzin walks Sadan back to her room. Sadan begins to suffer from a mysterious illness that leaves her pale and weak. Her illness baffles Dr. Akif. Dr.Nuri is called to examine Sadan  and notices that she has two tiny wounds on her throat. Güzin meanwhile learns that Azmi  is being nursed back to health in a hospital in Edirne. She goes to bring him home. Dr.Nuri recommends blood transfusions for Sadan. He also places garlic in her room and prepares a wreath of it for her to wear in her sleep. He warns that her windows should not be opened at night. That night, Sadan’s mother removes the necklace, with disastrous results. The Count breaks the window to Sadan’s room and attacks her. Sadan’s mother, who is still in the room at the time, dies of a heart attack. Azmi and Güzin return from Edirne, but they are too late. Sadan is on her deathbed, marks from her neck vanished and her teeth appear longer and sharper. She speaks with strange seductiveness to Turan, but Dr. Nuri prevents Turan from kissing her. Sadan dies, is buried and then rises as vampire, who preys on children. Dr.Nuri, Azmi, Güzin , Dr.Akif, and Turan agree to join forces against the Count. Dr.Nuri tells the others of his suspicions about Dracula, and about his limitations: he retreats from garlic, and he can be killed by a stake through the heart or by decapitation. Dr. Nuri also reveals that the wounds in the children’s throats weren't made in the same way as Sadan’s wounds, but were made by Sadan herself. Dr.Nuri leads Dr. Akif, Azmi, and Turan to the graveyard by night. Inside the tomb, Sadan's coffin is empty.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.44''.</ref>

Meanwhile Dracula turns his attention to Güzin , entering her home. Azmi returns in time to run him off with a garlic clove. The next day, Dr. Nuri and the others return to the graveyard. They discover that
Sadan has returned to her grave. That night, Dr. Nuri returns to the graveyard with Dr. Akif, Azmi, and Turan, and wait for Sadan. She returns to the tomb carrying a child, whom she abandons when Van Dr.Nuri and the others confront her. After trying to sweet-talk Turan, she recoils from a garlic clove and is captured. The men then return Sadan to her grave, and Turan stakes her. Dr.Nuri, Azmi, Turan, and Dr.Akif infiltrate Dracula's house and find the boxes. They place garlic in them, and then lie in wait for the Count’s return. Güzin, who is a showgirl, is performing that night and has to return to the musical hall to fetch her garlic wreath she left there and is detained by Dracula, who waited her there.  Dracula states his admiration for her and desire to drink her drop by drop, puts her into a trance, and makes her dance for him.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.44''.</ref>

'''Appledore''' is a village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appledorepc.kentparishes.gov.uk/|title=Appledore Kent|publisher=}}</ref> in the [[Ashford (borough)|Ashford District]] of [[Kent]], England. The village centre is on the northern edge of the [[Romney Marsh]], 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) south-west of [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] [[town]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashford.gov.uk/about_the_borough/towns_and_villages/appledore.aspx?|title=Whoops, the requested page was not found - Ashford Borough Council|first=Stephen|last=Mills|publisher=}}</ref> The northerly part of this village is '''Appledore Heath'''.

==History==
The name Appledore comes from the [[Old English]] ''apuldre'' (meaning apple tree) and is first recorded in the 10th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagenet.co.uk/rotherlevels/villages/appledore.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-08 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414105521/http://www.villagenet.co.uk/rotherlevels/villages/appledore.php |archivedate=2010-04-14 |df= }}</ref> Although a Brythonic origin is more likely (given the widespread survival of Brythonic names in Kent) e.g. from or connected with \"dwr/dor\" meaning water.

Appledore was once a [[port]] on the [[estuary]] of the [[River Rother (Eastern)|River Rother]]. Famously, the greater part of the Danish army (280 ships - 5000 men)  wintered at Appledore in 892&ndash;93, before moving into Wessex and suffering defeat at the hands of the Saxons led by [[King Alfred]]'s son [[Edward the Elder]] at [[Farnham]] in Surrey. The defeated Danes fell back to [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]] in Essex where they were again defeated in battle.
The importance of Appledore as a port diminished suddenly in the 13th-century when great storms caused the river Rother to change its course; the village street now leads down to the [[Royal Military Canal]]. A [[French people|French]] raid in 1380 resulted in the burning of the church: it was later rebuilt. The village was permitted to hold a market in the main street by [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]. In 1804, when there was threat of invasion by [[Napoleon]] the [[Royal Military Canal]] was built: Appledore stands on its northern bank.<ref>[http://www.historic-kent.co.uk/vill_a.html Historical notes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100411080421/http://www.historic-kent.co.uk/vill_a.html |date=April 11, 2010 }}</ref> The ''[[Rhee Wall]]'', a 13th-century waterway, was built to carry silt away from the eastern part of the [[Romney Marsh]]; it runs from Appledore to [[New Romney]].

==In film, the media and literature==
Appledore in Kent is known to generations of children as the setting for [[A. A. Milne]]'s famous verse poem, \"The Knight Whose Armour Didn't Squeak\". Milne lived {{convert|29|mi}} west in [[Hartfield, Sussex|Hartfield]].

Appledore features in the series Darling Buds of May.

==Religion==
The [[medieval]] parish [[church (building)|church]] is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul.<ref>[http://www.kentchurches.info/parish.asp?p=Appledore Appledore parish church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515121438/http://www.kentchurches.info/parish.asp?p=Appledore |date=May 15, 2006 }}</ref>

'''Appledore''' is a village and [[civil parishes in England|civil parish]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.appledorepc.kentparishes.gov.uk/|title=Appledore Kent|publisher=}}</ref> in the [[Ashford (borough)|Ashford District]] of [[Kent]], England. The village centre is on the northern edge of the [[Romney Marsh]], 12 miles (19&nbsp;km) south-west of [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] [[town]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashford.gov.uk/about_the_borough/towns_and_villages/appledore.aspx?|title=Whoops, the requested page was not found - Ashford Borough Council|first=Stephen|last=Mills|publisher=}}</ref> The northerly part of this village is '''Appledore Heath'''.

==History==
The name Appledore comes from the [[Old English]] ''apuldre'' (meaning apple tree) and is first recorded in the 10th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagenet.co.uk/rotherlevels/villages/appledore.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-08 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414105521/http://www.villagenet.co.uk/rotherlevels/villages/appledore.php |archivedate=2010-04-14 |df= }}</ref> Although a Brythonic origin is more likely (given the widespread survival of Brythonic names in Kent) e.g. from or connected with \"dwr/dor\" meaning water.

Appledore was once a [[port]] on the [[estuary]] of the [[River Rother (Eastern)|River Rother]]. Famously, the greater part of the Danish army (280 ships - 5000 men)  wintered at Appledore in 892&ndash;93, before moving into Wessex and suffering defeat at the hands of the Saxons led by [[King Alfred]]'s son [[Edward the Elder]] at [[Farnham]] in Surrey. The defeated Danes fell back to [[South Benfleet|Benfleet]] in Essex where they were again defeated in battle.
The importance of Appledore as a port diminished suddenly in the 13th-century when great storms caused the river Rother to change its course; the village street now leads down to the [[Royal Military Canal]]. A [[French people|French]] raid in 1380 resulted in the burning of the church: it was later rebuilt.
