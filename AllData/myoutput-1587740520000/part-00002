It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on August 15, 2001. The episode features [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] after he is struck by lightning, and has a [[near-death experience]], which involves him going back in time, and realizing his love for his wife, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]], who he had ditched to play golf on their anniversary. Peter soon realizes his mistakes, and attempts to repair his relationship with his wife.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] and directed by [[Rob Renzetti]]. The episode featured guest performances by [[Adam Carolla]], [[Laura Silverman]], [[Peter Frampton]], and [[Estelle Harris]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.\n\n==Plot==\nOn their wedding anniversary, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] is invited by Quagmire to play at Barrington, an extremely exclusive [[golf course]], so he sends [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] on a [[scavenger hunt]] to stall his family. Playing golf, he is struck by [[lightning]] and has a [[near-death experience]]. It is then he meets [[Death (Family Guy)|Death]] again (for the first time since his debut), who tries to show Peter that his marriage is in trouble and, to a greater extent, his life (Death tells Peter he dies 2 years after Lois divorces him); in exchange, Peter helps Death get a date with a pet shop clerk named Amy.\n\nDeath takes Peter back in time to his courtship of Lois. Peter did not make a good impression on Lois's father, [[List of Family Guy characters#Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter Pewterschmidt]], who knocked Peter out with an early [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] statue and had his servants give him a [[death flight]]. He was rescued by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] ship on which [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] was serving. Peter enjoys a rousing musical number performed by Quagmire and his shipmates. Back ashore, Peter gets a ride with [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] back to [[Rhode Island]]. Cleveland's vehicle is a van tricked out for [[seduction]]. They are pursued by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] whom Peter mistakes for [[ghost]]s, a reference to ''[[Mississippi Burning]]''.\n\nPeter gets back to the Pewterschmidts' house, but is chased by a guard dog and ends up rolling into Carter's private sauna. He explains he wants to marry Lois, and Carter offers Peter one million dollars to stay away from her. Peter tears up the check, declaring Lois \"worthless\". Lois, who has heard (and understood that he actually meant to say \"priceless\"), comes in to thank Peter.\n\nDeath manages to score a date with Amy by talking to her outside of the shop. Peter realizes that he has not appreciated his wife as much recently and, once he's back in his body, he asks Death to pay a visit to [[Peter Frampton]]. When Death arrives at Frampton's house, he asks him to bring his [[guitar]] and [[talkbox|\"that thing that makes it go \u2018wah wah wah'\"]]. Lois discovers Peter at the golf course and prepares to confront him, but Frampton appears, playing \"[[Baby, I Love Your Way]]\", which is \"their\" song, which they heard when they were making out on the road when they first met (played on the radio of the truck that crashed avoiding them). Peter presents this as his anniversary gift to her. Lois is deeply moved, asking Peter how he thought of all this; Peter responds by saying he had help from \"a very special friend\".\n\nAt the end of the episode, however, Death does not enjoy his date with Amy, as she harps on about animal rights. He then discreetly kills her by his \"touch of death\" and ends the episode by saying \"Check, please!\".<ref>S.
