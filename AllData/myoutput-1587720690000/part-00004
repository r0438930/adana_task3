Sarah Schenirer concluded that only providing young Jewish women with a thorough, school-based Jewish education would effectively combat this phenomenon. She started a school of her own, trained other women to teach, and set up similar schools in other cities throughout [[Europe]].\n\nShe obtained the approval of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]] (author of ''[[Chofetz Chaim]]''), who issued a [[responsum]] holding that contemporary conditions required departing from traditional prohibitions on teaching women Torah and accepting the view that it was permitted. Following the Chofetz Chaim's approbation, the Bais Yaakov Movement in Poland was taken under the wing of [[World Agudath Israel|Agudath Israel]]. Additionally, she sought and received approbation from [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] rabbis as well, most notably the [[Yissachar Dov Rokeach (third Belzer rebbe)|Belzer Rebbe]] and the [[Avraham Mordechai Alter|Gerrer Rebbe]].<ref>\"From Sarah to Sarah\" by S.

These run various courses generally lasting between one and three years. There are also post-secondary schools that combine Torah education with practical workforce skills, such as computer programming, education, and graphic arts.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name Bais Yaakov comes from a verse in the [[Book of Exodus]] in which the term \"House of Jacob\" is understood by [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]] to refer to the female segment of the Jewish nation.<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus|19:3}}</ref>\n\n== Current ==\n=== Educational approach ===\nThe educational policies of most Bais Yaakov schools worldwide is generally that of [[Haredi Judaism]] and the [[Agudath Israel movement]]. In accordance with the differences between the Israeli and Diaspora Haredi communities, there are slight variations in outlook and philosophy between Israeli, American and European Bais Yaakov schools. Israeli Bais Yaakov schools tend to de-emphasize the secular content of the [[curriculum]], whereas in North America and Europe the girls frequently receive a more diverse secular education. Large cities may have several Bais Yaakov schools, each with small variations in philosophy, typically over the importance placed on secular studies and/or accommodations made to secular values.\n\nStudents are required to uphold a dress code or wear uniforms which conform to the rules of ''[[tzniut|tznius]]'' (modesty). Uniforms differ from school to school but typically consist of a long pleated skirt, [[oxford shirt]], and sweater or sweatshirt.\n\nThe schools' primary purpose is to prepare students to be contributors to family and community, as good [[Jew]]s, wives, professionals, and mothers. \n\nSecular studies sometimes reflect government proficiency requirements in such subjects as math, science, literature and history in their respective countries.\n\n=== Curriculum ===\n:''See also: [[Midrasha #Curriculum]]; [[Women in Judaism #Yisrael Meir Kagan]].''\nMost non-Hasidic Bais Yaakov schools in America teach Judaic studies in the mornings and a college preparatory program of secular studies in the afternoons. Judaic studies usually include study of [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] ([[Pentateuch]]), [[Nevi'im]] (Prophets), and other parts of the [[Hebrew Bible]]; and instruction in [[Hebrew language]], [[Jewish history]] and the study of practical ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law), sometimes directly from the text, and other times as a summary of classic ''halakha'' sources.\n\nOne of the tenets of [[Orthodox Judaism]] is that it is impossible to fully understand the written Torah without the Jewish commentaries, so Bais Yaakov girls are taught the [[Tanakh]] through this approach. A major focus is on [[Rashi]], considered the foremost Torah commentator.\n\nThe curriculum of Bais Yaakov differs from that of male-only [[yeshiva]]s, where the core component of study is the [[Talmud]]. Girls in Bais Yaakov schools do not learn law from the text of the Talmud itself, but may study its non-legal portions of ''[[aggadah]]'' (homiletics). This contrasts with the approach of many [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] [[Jewish day school]]s, which increasingly teach Talmud to women.\n\n=== Locations ===\n[[Image:\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \"\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1\" \u05d4\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d5\u05df, \u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1 (1).jpg|thumb|250px|Beit Yaakov teachers' Seminary, [[Krak\u00f3w]], Poland.]]\nBranches exist in most North American cities with large [[:Category:Orthodox Jewish communities|populations of Orthodox Jews]] such as New York City, Montreal, Miami, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Denver, [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Toronto, [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey|Lakewood]], [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], [[Monsey, New York|Monsey]], and in most Israeli cities.

However, they may place a greater emphasis on the teachings of their individual Hasidic [[Rebbe]]s and much of the instruction may be conducted in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], which is still the home language for most Hasidic families in the world today. Also, in many Hasidic Beis Yaakov schools in Israel, English is often not taught, which is not the case in other Bais Yaakov schools.\n\nSchools for young Hasidic girls which are not part of the Bais Yaakov movement take names such as:\n\n* [[Beth Rivkah|Bais Rivkah]], Bnos Menachem, Bnos Rabbeinu, Bais [[Chaya Mushka Schneerson|Chaya Mushka]], or [[Bais Chana Women International|Bais Chana]] for the [[Chabad Lubavitch]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Zion for the [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobov]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Belz or Beis Malka for [[Belz (Hasidic dynasty)|Belz]] girls' schools.\n*  Bnos Vizhnitz for [[Vizhnitz (Hasidic dynasty)|Vizhnitz]] girls' schools.\n*  Beis Rochel schools for girls of the [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]] community, as well as some girls' schools of related Hasidic groups (often of Hungarian background). \n\nThese schools follow a different curriculum of Judaic studies, which is less text-based and more focused on practical knowledge than the curriculum in other schools.
