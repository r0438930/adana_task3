The upper jaw is partially concealed beneath the orbital bones when the mouth is closed and the teeth are small, fixed and are incisor-like with flattened tips. There are also teeth in the middle of the roof of the mouth. It has a continuous [[dorsal fin]] which has 11 spines in the anterior part which fold down into a scaled groove and 13 soft rays in the posterior part. The [[anal fin]] has three spines and 14 soft rays and is low. The [[caudal fin]] deeply forked.
