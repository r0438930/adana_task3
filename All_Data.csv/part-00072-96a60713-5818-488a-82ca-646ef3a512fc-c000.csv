== Preparation ==
There is no requirement for fermentation of the [[rice]] in order to prepare Neer dosa. The rice needs to be soaked for at least 2 hours. After a quick wash and a drain the rice needs to be ground by adding water in order to get very fine batter. Additional amount of water can be added based on the thickness of the batter and then salt is added for taste. Finally the batter is used to prepare the dosa.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3m6DBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT38&dq=neer%20dosa%20preparation&pg=PT39#v=onepage&q=neer%20dosa%20preparation&f=false|title=South Indian Cooking|last=Dalal|first=Tarla|publisher=Sanjay & Co|isbn=9788189491796|language=en}}</ref>

In September 2004, the corporation hosted the Annual Conference of the IEC in Sydney. It was awarded the International body's most prestigious prize, the Golden Egg Award.

The Bronze sculptured panel contains a carved relief with the figures of three servicemen a Soldier in full trench kit, with steel helmet, cape and fixed [[bayonet]] flanked by the busts of a Sailor and an Airman. There is an inscription on the top which reads above the Soldier ‚ÄúVictory won by Sacrifice‚Äù and below the Soldier ‚ÄúAt the Going down of the Sun and in the Morning we will Remember them.‚Äù There is a Flagpole behind the stone cross .OS Grid Ref: TQ 261 921. Either side of the memorial are two memorial plaques the Finchley Metropolitan Tramway War Memorial (18 names), (IWM Ref 64400) and the Hendon Garage War Memorial (52 names), (IWM Ref 64399) who were relocated after the buildings where they were hanging were demolished. Names are recorded in a book at the Memorial club.

                                           In grateful Memory of 
                                            Men of Finchley who
                                           By service on Land Sea
                                          And in the Air gave their

The Memorial remembers those Servicemen and Women up to the present day who have lost their lives in conflict and also there loved ones, family and friends who they left behind. A Service of Remembrance occurs every year on [[Remembrance Sunday]] at the Memorial with a two minutes silence and the Last Post sounds followed by a march past. Ballards Lane is closed so relatives and members of the community can pay their respects. Recorded IWM Ref: 10972.

'''''Cantata misericordium''''', [[opus number|op.]] 69, is a 1963 musical composition by British composer [[Benjamin Britten]]. Its single movement is based on the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]] and was composed for the centenary of the [[Red Cross]].

==History and text==
This [[cantata]] was composed in 1963 for the centenary of the [[Red Cross]].<ref name=em>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/notes_other/n_britten_cantata_misericordium.htm|publisher=Emmanuel Music|title=Benjamin Britten ''Cantata misericordium''|author=Bloch, Gregory|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

The [[Latin]] text by Patrick Wilkinson recounts the Biblical [[parable of the Good Samaritan]].<ref name=em/> Because the work was to be premiered at an international event, Britten felt that Latin would be the most appropriate language. He had originally intended to use either the Biblical text or a medieval adaptation, but the International Committee of the Red Cross objected that explicitly religious text would be inappropriate to celebrate an organization with a firm nonsectarian stance.<ref name=em/> To resolve this issue, Britten approached Wilkinson, a Latin professor at [[Cambridge University]], to create a [[libretto]] for the work. The resulting text is \"somewhat 'academic' and lacking in obviously expressive poetic qualities\" but is notable for its \"recondite, elegant, Classical Latin diction\".<ref name=em/>

The work was premiered in [[Geneva]] on 1 September 1963 by soloists [[Peter Pears]] and [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], with the Motet de Gen√®ve and the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]] conducted by [[Ernest Ansermet]].<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwolf.de/premi%E8res.html|title=Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau: Urauff√ºhrungen|publisher=Monika Wolf|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> It was performed again at [[The Proms]] later that month, conducted by Britten himself.<Ref name=rose>{{cite journal|author=Roseberry, Eric|title=Britten's 'Cantata Misericordium' and 'Psalm 150'|journal=Tempo|issue=66/67|pages=40&ndash;47|year=1963}}</ref>

==Composition==
''Cantata misericordium'' is scored for solo tenor and baritone, [[SATB]] choir, [[string quartet]], [[string orchestra]], piano, harp, and timpani.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brittenproject.org/works/BTC1116|work=Britten Thematic Catalogue|title=Cantata Misericordium|publisher=Britten-Pears Foundation|year=2012}}</ref>

The work is in a single movement with \"a highly unified structure built up out of short interlinked sections\". Its [[tonality]] is largely [[F-sharp major]], but with a D in the bass.<ref name=rose/>

==Analysis==
Eric Roseberry describes this piece as \"yet another minor masterpiece in which once more [Britten's] skill and science as a composer objectify his unique poetic sensibility\".<ref name=rose/>

Dean Jobin-Bevans suggests that Britten's compositional style provides for two potential interpretations of the work: pacifist, as with Britten's earlier ''[[War Requiem]]'', and [[queer theory|queer]]-positive.<ref name=job>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.library.mun.ca/ojs/index.php/singing/article/view/885|journal=The Phenomenon of Singing|author=Jobin-Bevans, Dean|title=Merging Perspectives: The Open-ended Nature of Brittens Parable Art and the Cantata Misericordium Op. 69|volume=6|year=2007}}</ref>

'''''Cantata misericordium''''', [[opus number|op.]] 69, is a 1963 musical composition by British composer [[Benjamin Britten]]. Its single movement is based on the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]] and was composed for the centenary of the [[Red Cross]].

==History and text==
This [[cantata]] was composed in 1963 for the centenary of the [[Red Cross]].<ref name=em>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmanuelmusic.org/notes_translations/notes_other/n_britten_cantata_misericordium.htm|publisher=Emmanuel Music|title=Benjamin Britten ''Cantata misericordium''|author=Bloch, Gregory|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref>

The [[Latin]] text by [[Patrick Wilkinson]] recounts the Biblical [[parable of the Good Samaritan]].<ref name=em/> Because the work was to be premiered at an international event, Britten felt that Latin would be the most appropriate language. He had originally intended to use either the Biblical text or a medieval adaptation, but the International Committee of the Red Cross objected that explicitly religious text would be inappropriate to celebrate an organization with a firm nonsectarian stance.<ref name=em/> To resolve this issue, Britten approached Wilkinson, a Latin professor at [[Cambridge University]], to create a [[libretto]] for the work. The resulting text is \"somewhat 'academic' and lacking in obviously expressive poetic qualities\" but is notable for its \"recondite, elegant, Classical Latin diction\".<ref name=em/>

The work was premiered in [[Geneva]] on 1 September 1963 by soloists [[Peter Pears]] and [[Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau]], with the Motet de Gen√®ve and the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]] conducted by [[Ernest Ansermet]].<Ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mwolf.de/premi%E8res.html|title=Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau: Urauff√ºhrungen|publisher=Monika Wolf|accessdate=6 August 2015}}</ref> It was performed again at [[The Proms]] later that month, conducted by Britten himself.<Ref name=rose>{{cite journal|author=Roseberry, Eric|title=Britten's 'Cantata Misericordium' and 'Psalm 150'|journal=Tempo|issue=66/67|pages=40&ndash;47|year=1963}}</ref>

==Composition==
''Cantata misericordium'' is scored for solo tenor and baritone, [[SATB]] choir, [[string quartet]], [[string orchestra]], piano, harp, and timpani.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brittenproject.org/works/BTC1116|work=Britten Thematic Catalogue|title=Cantata Misericordium|publisher=Britten-Pears Foundation|year=2012}}</ref>

The work is in a single movement with \"a highly unified structure built up out of short interlinked sections\". Its [[tonality]] is largely [[F-sharp major]], but with a D in the bass.<ref name=rose/>

==Analysis==
Eric Roseberry describes this piece as \"yet another minor masterpiece in which once more [Britten's] skill and science as a composer objectify his unique poetic sensibility\".<ref name=rose/>

Dean Jobin-Bevans suggests that Britten's compositional style provides for two potential interpretations of the work: pacifist, as with Britten's earlier ''[[War Requiem]]'', and [[queer theory|queer]]-positive.<ref name=job>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.library.mun.ca/ojs/index.php/singing/article/view/885|journal=The Phenomenon of Singing|author=Jobin-Bevans, Dean|title=Merging Perspectives: The Open-ended Nature of Brittens Parable Art and the Cantata Misericordium Op. 69|volume=6|year=2007}}</ref>

The 7th constituency of [[Maine-et-Loire]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Septi√®me circonscription de Maine-et-Loire'') is a French legislative [[Constituency (France)|constituency]] in the Maine-et-Loire ''[[Departments of France|d√©partement]]''. Like the other 576 French constituencies, it elects one [[National Assembly of France|MP]] using the [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] election system with a run-off.

==Description==
The 7th Constituency of [[Maine-et-Loire]] is situated in the north west of the department, including the north and north-western suburbs of [[Angers]].

In common with other several seats in [[Maine-et-Loire]] for example the [[Maine-et-Loire's 1st constituency|1st]], [[Maine-et-Loire's 5th constituency|5th]] and [[Maine-et-Loire's 6th constituency|6th]] this constituency had a long tradition of supporting centre right candidates. This tradition was broken at the [[2017 French legislative election|2017 election]] with the election of the [[Democratic Movement (France)|MoDem]] candidate, during which election the conservative [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans party]] secured just 38% of the second round vote.<ref>http://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/elections/departement/2017/resultats/49</ref>

The '''F/V ''Maverick''''' is a commercial crab fishing vessel that featured on the first three seasons of the [[Discovery Channel]]'s reality television show [[Deadliest Catch]]. The  F/V ''Maverick'' was built by Giddings Boat Works in 1982. She is a 92-foot house aft vessel that holds 120 pots and sleeps between nine and ten people. She was purchased by Rick and Donna Quashnick of [[Warrenton, Oregon]] in 1991. The F/V Maverick was selected for a camera crew for season one in the 2005 opilio crab season, as partner vessel of the [[FV Cornelia Marie|''F/V Cornelia Marie'']]. The ''Maverick'' took part in the rescue efforts for the [[FV Big Valley|''F/V Big Valley'']], which sunk on the first day of the opilio crab season off [[Saint Paul Island (Alaska)|Saint Paul Island, Alaska]] losing all but one crew member. She became a featured vessel beginning in the second and third season of [[Deadliest Catch]], joining the [[FV Cornelia Marie|''F/V Cornelia Marie'']], [[FV Northwestern|''F/V Northwestern'']] and [[FV Time Bandit|''F/V Time Bandit'']].

==Current status==

While the F/V Maverick is no longer on [[Deadliest Catch]], she is still fishing with owners Rick and Donna Quashnick. The F/V Maverick's homeport is [[Astoria, Oregon]]. As shown in the third season of [[Deadliest Catch]], Captain Rick gave control of the ''Maverick'' to the late Blake Painter for the 2006 king crab season. After the 2006 king crab season was over, Painter gave the ''Maverick'' back to Rick and Donna Quashnick.
