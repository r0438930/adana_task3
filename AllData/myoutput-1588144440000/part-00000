This treaty designated the new border as terminating at a point on the Pacific Ocean coast which would result in the border passing one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion of [[San Diego Bay]], thus ensuring that the United States received all of this natural harbor.\n\nSan Diego County was one of the original counties of California, created at the time of California statehood in 1850.<ref name=coy>{{cite book |last=Coy |first=Owen C.; PhD |title=California County Boundaries |publisher=California Historical Commission |year=1923 |location=Berkeley |asin=B000GRBCXG}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nAt the time of its establishment in 1850, San Diego County was relatively large, and included all of southernmost California south and east of [[Los Angeles County]].

[[Cleveland National Forest]] is spread across the central portion of the county, while the [[Anza-Borrego Desert|Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]] occupies most of the northeast.\n\nAlthough the county's western third is primarily urban, the mountains and deserts in the eastern two-thirds are primarily undeveloped [[backcountry]]. Most of these backcountry areas are home to a native plant community known as [[chaparral]]. San Diego County contains more than a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of chaparral, twice as much as any other California county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|title=The California Chaparral Field Institute|website=Web.archive.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623064734/http://californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|archivedate=June 23, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNorth San Diego County is known as [[North County, San Diego|North County]]; the exact geographic definitions of \"North County\" vary, but it includes the northern suburbs and sometimes certain northern neighborhoods of the [[City of San Diego]].\n\nThe eastern suburbs are collectively known as [[East County, San Diego|East County]], though most still lie in the western third of the county. The southern suburbs and southern detached portion of the city of San Diego, extending to the Mexican border, are collectively referred to as [[South Bay, San Diego|South Bay]].\n\nPeriodically the area has been subject to [[wildfire]]s that force thousands to evacuate. The most recent are the December 2017 [[Lilac Fire]] and the [[May 2014 San Diego County wildfires]]; before them was the [[Witch Creek Fire]] in 2007 and the [[Cedar Fire (2003)|Cedar Fire]] in 2003. California defines a fire season in which fires are most likely to occur, usually between late July and late October (which are the driest months of the area). Signs posted in numerous spots of the county provide information on the level of threats from fires based on weather conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of San Diego, California}}\n[[File:Mountlagunasmall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cleveland National Forest]]]]\n\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, the urban and suburban San Diego area straddles areas of [[Mediterranean climate]] (CSa) to the north and [[semi-arid climate]] (BSh) to the south and east.<ref>{{cite journal|author=M.

Western San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between November and March. The city has mild, mostly dry weather, with an average of 201 days above {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and low rainfall ({{convert|9|\u2013|13|in|cm}} annually). Summer temperatures are generally warm, with average highs of {{convert|70|\u2013|78|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|55|\u2013|66|F|C}}. Temperatures exceed {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} only four days a year. Most rainfall occurs from November to April.

In San Diego's case this is mainly due to the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons).

In addition, several entities of the [[government of California]] have jurisdiction conterminous with San Diego County, such as the [[Superior Court of San Diego County|San Diego Superior Court]].\n\nUnder its foundational Charter, the five-member elected [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors]] is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process.\n\nAs of January 2019, the members of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Supervisors|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/general/bos.html|website=Sandiegocounty.gov}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2 width=\"35%\"\n|-\n!

Various cities within the county are swing areas that have split their votes in elections since 2000.  Republican strength is concentrated in North County, East County and the eastern backlands. Coronado has also traditionally been a Republican stronghold.\n\nOne unique feature of the political scene is the use of [[Golden Hall (sports venue)|Golden Hall]], a convention facility next to San Diego's City Hall, as \"Election Central.\"  The County Registrar of Voters rents the hall to distribute election results. Supporters and political observers gather to watch the results come in; supporters of the various candidates parade around the hall, carrying signs and chanting; candidates give their victory and concession speeches and host parties for campaign volunteers and donors at the site; and television stations broadcast live from the floor of the convention center.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/election/article_92315642-27a2-11e2-a565-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Where to Find Us on Election Day|last=Libby|first=Sarah|date=November 5, 2012|work=Voice of San Diego|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> The atmosphere at Election Central on the evening of election day has been compared to the voting portion of a political party national convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041104/news_1m4hall.html|title=Amid the celebrations, farewell - The San Diego Union-Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Signsonsandiego.com}}</ref>\n\nOn Nov 4, 2008 San Diego County voted 53.71% for Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages, thus restoring [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]] which was overturned by a ruling from the [[California Supreme Court]].

This treaty designated the new border as terminating at a point on the Pacific Ocean coast which would result in the border passing one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion of [[San Diego Bay]], thus ensuring that the United States received all of this natural harbor.\n\nSan Diego County was one of the original counties of California, created at the time of California statehood in 1850.<ref name=coy>{{cite book |last=Coy |first=Owen C.; PhD |title=California County Boundaries |publisher=California Historical Commission |year=1923 |location=Berkeley |asin=B000GRBCXG}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nAt the time of its establishment in 1850, San Diego County was relatively large, and included all of southernmost California south and east of [[Los Angeles County]].

[[Cleveland National Forest]] is spread across the central portion of the county, while the [[Anza-Borrego Desert|Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]] occupies most of the northeast.\n\nAlthough the county's western third is primarily urban, the mountains and deserts in the eastern two-thirds are primarily undeveloped [[backcountry]]. Most of these backcountry areas are home to a native plant community known as [[chaparral]]. San Diego County contains more than a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of chaparral, twice as much as any other California county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|title=The California Chaparral Field Institute|website=Web.archive.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623064734/http://californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|archivedate=June 23, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNorth San Diego County is known as [[North County, San Diego|North County]]; the exact geographic definitions of \"North County\" vary, but it includes the northern suburbs and sometimes certain northern neighborhoods of the [[City of San Diego]].\n\nThe eastern suburbs are collectively known as [[East County, San Diego|East County]], though most still lie in the western third of the county. The southern suburbs and southern detached portion of the city of San Diego, extending to the Mexican border, are collectively referred to as [[South Bay, San Diego|South Bay]].\n\nPeriodically the area has been subject to [[wildfire]]s that force thousands to evacuate. The most recent are the December 2017 [[Lilac Fire]] and the [[May 2014 San Diego County wildfires]]; before them was the [[Witch Creek Fire]] in 2007 and the [[Cedar Fire (2003)|Cedar Fire]] in 2003. California defines a fire season in which fires are most likely to occur, usually between late July and late October (which are the driest months of the area). Signs posted in numerous spots of the county provide information on the level of threats from fires based on weather conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of San Diego, California}}\n[[File:Mountlagunasmall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cleveland National Forest]]]]\n\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, the urban and suburban San Diego area straddles areas of [[Mediterranean climate]] (CSa) to the north and [[semi-arid climate]] (BSh) to the south and east.<ref>{{cite journal|author=M.

Western San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between November and March. The city has mild, mostly dry weather, with an average of 201 days above {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and low rainfall ({{convert|9|\u2013|13|in|cm}} annually). Summer temperatures are generally warm, with average highs of {{convert|70|\u2013|78|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|55|\u2013|66|F|C}}. Temperatures exceed {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} only four days a year. Most rainfall occurs from November to April. Winter temperatures are mild, with average high temperatures of {{convert|66|\u2013|70|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|50|\u2013|56|F|C}}.\n\nThe climate in the San Diego area, like much of California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances resulting in [[microclimate]]s. In San Diego's case this is mainly due to the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons).

In addition, several entities of the [[government of California]] have jurisdiction conterminous with San Diego County, such as the [[Superior Court of San Diego County|San Diego Superior Court]].\n\nUnder its foundational Charter, the five-member elected [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors]] is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process.\n\nAs of January 2019, the members of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Supervisors|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/general/bos.html|website=Sandiegocounty.gov}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2 width=\"35%\"\n|-\n!

Various cities within the county are swing areas that have split their votes in elections since 2000.  Republican strength is concentrated in North County, East County and the eastern backlands. Coronado has also traditionally been a Republican stronghold.\n\nOne unique feature of the political scene is the use of [[Golden Hall (sports venue)|Golden Hall]], a convention facility next to San Diego's City Hall, as \"Election Central.\"  The County Registrar of Voters rents the hall to distribute election results. Supporters and political observers gather to watch the results come in; supporters of the various candidates parade around the hall, carrying signs and chanting; candidates give their victory and concession speeches and host parties for campaign volunteers and donors at the site; and television stations broadcast live from the floor of the convention center.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/election/article_92315642-27a2-11e2-a565-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Where to Find Us on Election Day|last=Libby|first=Sarah|date=November 5, 2012|work=Voice of San Diego|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> The atmosphere at Election Central on the evening of election day has been compared to the voting portion of a political party national convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041104/news_1m4hall.html|title=Amid the celebrations, farewell - The San Diego Union-Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Signsonsandiego.com}}</ref>\n\nOn Nov 4, 2008 San Diego County voted 53.71% for Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages, thus restoring [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]] which was overturned by a ruling from the [[California Supreme Court]].
