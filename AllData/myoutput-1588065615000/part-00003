Brazil is a [[multiethnic society]], which means that it is home to people of many different ethnic origins. As a result, majority of Brazilians do not equate their [[nationality]] with their ethnicity, usually embracing and espousing both simultaneously.\n\nIn the period after the colonization of the Brazilian territory by [[Portugal]], during much of the XVI century, the word \"Brazilian\" was given to the Portuguese merchants of [[Brazilwood]], designating exclusively the name of such profession, since the inhabitants of the land were, in most of them, [[Native Brazilian|indigenous]] or Portuguese born in Portugal, or in the territory now called Brazil.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z3qpHh7cBYkC&pg=PA93&dq=%22brasileiro%22+s+comerciantes+de+pau-brasil,&cd=4#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=Um defunto estramb\u00f3tico: an\u00e1lise e interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o das Mem\u00f3rias p\u00f3stumas de Br\u00e1s Cubas|first=Valentim|last=Facioli|date=25 February 2018|publisher=EdUSP|via=Google Books|isbn=9788531410833}}</ref> However, long before the [[independence of Brazil]], in 1822, both in Brazil and in [[Portugal]], it was already common to attribute the Brazilian [[Demonym|gentile]] to a person, usually of clear Portuguese descent, resident or whose family resided in the [[State of Brazil]] (1530\u20131815), belonging to the [[Portuguese Empire]]. During the lifetime of the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]] (1815\u20131822), however, there was confusion about the nomenclature.\n\n==Definition==\n{{Main|Brazilian nationality law}}\nAccording to the [[Constitution of Brazil]], a Brazilian citizen is:\n\n* Anyone born in Brazil, even if to foreign born parents.

A foreign born person who holds Brazilian citizenship has exactly the same [[rights]] and duties of the Brazilian citizen by birth, but cannot occupy some special public positions such as the Presidency of the Republic, Vice-presidency of the Republic, Minister (Secretary) of Defense, Presidency (Speaker) of the Senate, Presidency (Speaker) of the House of Representatives, Officer of the Armed Forces and Diplomat.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n== Overview==\n{{Main|Race and ethnicity in Brazil}}\n{{See also|Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Colonial Brazil|Afro-Brazilian history|Dutch Brazil|Immigration to Brazil||History of the Jews in Brazil}}\n\nBrazilians are mostly [[Kinship|descendants]] of [[Portuguese Brazilians|Portuguese settlers]], [[Immigration to Brazil|post-colonial]] immigrant groups, [[Afro-Brazilians|enslaved Africans]] and [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Brazil's indigenous peoples]].

They had been living there since the [[Pleistocene]] and still exist in many different tribes and ethnicities, amounting to the hundreds, giving them varying features, shapes and shades. There are different estimates for the Indigenous population around 1498, when the cohort commanded by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] first set foot in Brazilian territory, followed by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1500 and 1502, with figures revolving between 2.4 million and 3.1 million. What is more accurate is that about three quarters of them died from contracted diseases brought by colonizers (the [[flu]], [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[scarlet fever]] and [[tuberculosis]]) and conflicts (besides the numerous deaths in different tribal groups by forging alliances with the Portuguese, French and Dutch to fight each other, ending in genocide, the abortion rate also increased among Indigenous women after the arrival of the colonizers), while the remaining were pushed to the Amazon Basin, sometimes migrating beyond the borders with Hispanic provinces. It is also important to mention that a strong assimilation by miscegenation with local populations occurred, where Natives living under Jesuit protection and having a monastic life decided to leave for the life in towns. The European diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and whole tribes were likely annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans. Today, 517,000 Indigenous people live in reservations and 160 thousand speak assorted Native languages, whereas millions of Brazilians have at least some degree of Amerindian ancestry due to the mentioned interracial encounters.\n* The country was officially discovered by Portugal in 1500 and received about 724,000 [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonizers, mostly males, who settled there until the end of Colonial Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |title=IBGE teen |publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] |accessdate=2011-12-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224012534/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |archivedate=2013-02-24 |df= }}</ref> But other sources even claim that the given numbers of total entrances were clearly surpassed. The Jesuits asked the Portuguese Crown to ship [[orphaned]] women under royal wardship for marriage with the settlers; they were known as ''[[\u00d3rf\u00e3s d'El-Rei]]'' (modern ''\u00f3rf\u00e3s do rei'', \"orphans of the king\").{{sfnp|Telfer|1932|p=184}}{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}}<ref name=\"ensinarhistoria\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ensinarhistoriajoelza.com.br/desmundo-o-brasil-do-sec-xvi/|title=Desmundo de Alain Fresnot, o Brasil no s\u00e9culo XVI|publisher=ensinarhistoria|accessdate=22 April 2016|date=2015-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.companhiadasletras.com.br/detalhe.php?codigo=10637|title=Desmundo by Ana Miranda (1996)|publisher=companhiadasletras.com.br|accessdate=22 April 2016}}</ref> Daughters of noblemen who died overseas administrating captaincies in the colonies or in battle for the king would marry settlers of higher rank. Bahia's port in the Northeast received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551.{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}}\nPortugal remained the only significant, but not an exclusive source of European immigration to Brazil until the early 19th century.\n* These other people came from different nationalities - but the by far most mentioned are the Dutch. Hence, under the rule of [[Dutch Brazil]] in the northeastern part of the country, from 1630 to 1654, a comparatively small but still notable number of Dutch settlers ([[Dutch Brazilian]]) and some [[Jews|Jewish People]] arrived, the latter seeking religious freedom. These Jews founded the first Synagogue in the Americas, named [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]] in the city of [[Recife]].\n\nIt is estimated that more than 20,000 [[Dutch people|Dutch]] entered [[Brazil]], however, both groups had been forced out of the country after the rule's end. The remaining families mostly fled to remote parts of the interior of Northeastern Brazil (mainly in the states of Pernambuco, but also Para\u00edba, Rio Grande do Norte, Cear\u00e1 and others) or changed their names to Portuguese ones. The proven excess of Y-chromosomes of the haplogroup 2 in northeasterners probably results from the high miscegenation of Dutch settlers with the local population.\n\nThe Jews who mostly left Brazil took off to what was then named [[New Amsterdam]], today New York City, and founded the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States, the [[Congregation Shearith Israel]]. The ones who stayed, converted into Christianity and were then known as [[New Christian]]s or [[Marranos]], who sometimes practiced [[Crypto-Judaism]]. Even if the Jewish population under Dutch Brazil not surpassed a few thousand individuals, a considerably higher number of New Christians, in the past simply absorbed as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonizers, arrived in Colonial Brazil - especially in the first centuries after 1500. They entered Brazil fleeing from the Inquisition or were deported by the Kingdom of Portugal and also Spain, latter being known as [[Degredado]]s, someone who was sentenced or forced to exile. This also included [[Romani People]] from the Iberian Peninsula, what partially explains the curiously high numbers for a western country. Brazil has the second largest Gypsy population in the Americas after the United States, having also received Roma people from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Baltic countries during the 20th century.\n\n* As a result of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from the mid-16th century until 1855, an estimated 3.6 million [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African people]], also from many different countries and ethnicities were brought to Brazil, giving the country the Americas' largest population with some African ancestry. Many of the slaves suffered under severe conditions and the mortality rates were pretty high, what led to the foundation of [[Quilombola]] communities throughout the country.

Millions of White Brazilians descend from recent Portuguese immigration from between the 1870s and 1975. In addition, many multiracial Brazilians partially descend from Portuguese people, caused by the high intermarriage rates. Most of them came from the [[Provinces of Portugal|historical provinces]] of Minho, Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura (North and Central Portugal). Northeastern Brazil traditionally received the first waves of immigrants, but during the Great Immigration, the Southeast received the biggest influx. S\u00e3o Paulo (state) received the most, followed by Rio de Janeiro (city), which is considered the largest Portuguese city outside of Lisbon. The second former capital of Brazil once also was the capital of Portugal, the only European capital outside of Europe. The accent in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] subsequently reminds the 19th century innovations that took place in the European variety of the language, while the prosody of the rest of the country, besides some local varieties, has rather conservative phonetics rooted in the 1600s. Other states with significant numbers were [[Minas Gerais]], [[Par\u00e1]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Pernambuco]] and [[Bahia]]. Nowadays, they naturally live throughout Brazil and compose the majority of White and also Multiracial Brazilians in many states.\n\n*Furthermore, around '''1.6 million''' '''[[Italian Brazilian|Italians]]''' were responsible for a massive immigration wave, consequently composing the biggest European follow-up group the country has received after its colonizers.\n\nToday, millions of [[Italian-Brazilians]] make Brazil their home, as they usually brought the whole family and had high birth rates. Regarding the total numbers, this probably represents the biggest Italian diaspora outside of Italy. Contrary to other countries, more than half of the Italians immigrated from the North, mostly composed by people from [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]], followed by people from Central Italy. The state of S\u00e3o Paulo had the strongest and a more diverse influx, with many also coming from [[South Italy]], especially to the eponymic capital. [[Italians]] mostly went to [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)]], which received half of the overall immigrants. The others mainly went to the states of southern Brazil, where they also composed the biggest European immigrant group. Other notable influxes occurred in two other southeastern states, here [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] and the Central-West region, mainly to [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] and Goi\u00e1s. Comparatively small numbers went to [[Pernambuco]] and Bahia, both in the Northeast. Nowadays the descendants mostly live in mentioned areas, but the sheer amount and internal migrations made the Italilan diaspora spread out and nowadays they are scattered all over Brazil.\n\n*'''[[Spanish Brazilians|Spaniards]]''' also arrived in rather high numbers, with around '''700,000''' immigrants mainly from [[Andalusia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].\n\nSeveral million Brazilians have Spanish ancestry. Most Spaniards settled in the past century, where they chiefly headed to [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], then [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Most notably from [[Andalusia]] (South), others from the provinces of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] and [[Catalonia]] (North and East Spain) followed. Galicians were also present throughout Colonial Brazil, as the province shares borders and linguistic ties with Portugal, and once was part of the country. [[Spanish Brazilian]]s in the other states mainly have origins in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], which arrived in earlier occasions. Many of them went to the first capital [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and its state Bahia, but also Pernambuco (Northeast), Par\u00e1 (North), [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] (Southeast), and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (South).<ref>{{cite web|author=Mar\u00edlia D.

But in fact, minorities in the White and Black populations consider themselves as Pardo. Moreover, some people in the Roma, Sephardic, Arab and Asian population classify themselves as Pardo, due to miscegenation with other races.\n*[[Northern Brazil]], largely covered by the [[Amazon Rainforest]], is also mostly '''Pardo''', due to a stronger [[Amerindian]] influence.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050315162129/http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/english/source/xi.shtm Sources :: Indigenous Peoples in Brazil \u2013 ISA]. socioambiental.org</ref>\n*The two remaining [[Southeastern Brazil|South Eastern states]] and the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-Western]] Brazil have a more '''balanced''' ratio among different racial groups (around 50% White, 43% Pardo, 5% Black, 1% Asian/Amerindian).\n\nThe [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE) classifies the Brazilian population in five categories: ''brancos'' ([[Whites|white]]), ''negros'' ([[Black people|black]]), ''[[pardo]]s'' ([[Brown people|brown or mixed]]), ''amarelos'' ([[Asian people|Asian/yellow]]) and ''\u00edndios'' ([[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]]), based on [[Human skin color|skin color]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. The last detailed census (PNAD) found Brazil to be made up of c. 91 million white people ([[White Brazilian]]), 79 million multiracial people ([[Pardo]]), 14 million black people ([[Afro-Brazilian]]), 2-4 million Asian people ([[Asian Brazilian]]) and 807,900 indigenous ([[Amerindian]]) people.\n\n[[File:Concentra\u00e7\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Young Brazilians]]\nIn the 2005 detailed census, for the first time in two decades, the number of White Brazilians did not exceed 50% of the population. On the other side, the number of ''pardos'' (multiracial) people increased and all the others remained almost the same. According to the IBGE, this trend is mainly because of the revaluation of the identity of historically discriminated ethnic groups.\n\nBrazil is said to be among the most miscegenated countries in the world, as since the country was discovered and during the colonial period intermarriage between races was never illegal and common. Those of full ancestry are usually the Brazilians who can trace back their ethnicity to more recent immigration from the monarchical period in the 19th century until the Republican 20th and 21st centuries. Still, many Brazilians can not trace back their real origin easily. For instance, European family names which were difficult to pronounce were commonly changed to easier Portuguese surnames. In basic terms, it could be said that half of Brazilians are descendants of populations from the colonial era and the other half made of modern immigration. Brazil is a true melting pot of Europeans, Asians, Africans and Indigenous people, who either are in the single group or a mixture of various different backgrounds and races.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; border:1px #000; margin-center:1em;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" rowspan=\"2\"|[[Human skin color|Skin color]] or<br>[[Human races|race]]|| colspan=\"2\"|%<br>(rounded values)\n|-\n! 2000<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=892&id_pagina=1 Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825192041/http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=892&id_pagina=1 |date=2007-08-25 }}.

The term ''Pardo'' or mixed race Brazilian is a rather complex one. Multiracial Brazilians appear in hundreds of different shades, colours and backgrounds. They are typically a mixture of colonial and post-colonial [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] with descendants of [[African slaves]] and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Some individuals may also descend from Maghreb people, Jews, Middle Eastern and Egyptian people, or a more recent ancestry from East or South Asia. Skin colours can vary from light to dark. The '''''caboclo''''' or '''''mesti\u00e7o''''' population, those who are a miscegenation of Native and European, revolves around 43 million people. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the '''[[Caboclo]]''' population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers. Similar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as '''[[Mulatto]]''' or White and Black mix, span from 62% to 85% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The '''Pardo category''' in Brazil also includes 800 thousand '''[[Gypsies]]''' or '''[[Roma people]]''', most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. '''[[Eurasia]]ns''' can also be classified as Pardo. The majority of them consisting of '''[[Hafu|Ainoko]]''' or '''[[Hafu]]''', individuals who are a miscegenation between Japanese and European.\n\nRecent research has suggested that Asians from the early [[Portuguese Eastern Empire]], known as [[Luso-Asians]] first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as [[Lascars]], or as servants, slaves and [[concubines]] accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.<ref>Cliff Pereira, in Van Tilburg, H., Tripati, S., Walker Vadillo, V., Fahy, B., and Kimura, J.

While the occurrence of Pardos is not uniform across the country, there are states with more people of mixed background than others. It also can happen that Pardos constitute significant numbers within single regions in states.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Multiracial people by region:\n|-\n! style=\"width:35%\" | Region !! style=\"width:35%\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[North Region, Brazil|North Brazil]] || 71.2%\n|-\n| [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]] || 62.7%\n|-\n| [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West Brazil]] || 50.6%\n|-\n| [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Brazil]] || 35.69%\n|-\n| [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] || 17.3%\n|}\n\n===Black coloured people===\n{{Main|Afro-Brazilians}}\n'''Blacks''' constitute the third largest ethnic group of Brazil with around 14,5 million citizens or 7,6 % of the population. These are people who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa. In the country, these are generally used for Brazilians with at least partial [[Sub-Saharan African]] ancestry. Most African Brazilians are the direct descendants of captive Africans who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present Brazil, but also with considerable European and Amerindian ancestry. Afro-Brazilians might not directly be compared to Pardo-Brazilians. The number of African genes is substantially higher in Afro-Brazilians, therefore their skin colour is darker compared to mixed-race Brazilians. Brazil, followed by the United States, has the largest '''[[African diaspora]]''' in the Americas.\n\nToday most Blacks are either Catholic or Evangelical. Smaller groups are Irreligious including Atheists and a number of African tradition sects can be found especially in Bahia, notably [[Candombl\u00e9]] and [[Umbanda]]. The latter being a syncretism of Roman Catholicism, African traditions, [[Spiritism]] and Indigenous beliefs. A minority of Blacks follows [[Kardecism]], which is a blend of Christianism and [[Spiritualism]] founded in France.\n\nMost Blacks can be found in Bahia and Maranh\u00e3o states after the colonial period influx, as well as in the northern region of Minas Gerais thanks to the Diamond and Gold Rush period and parts of Rio de Janeiro due to slavery in the former royal court after its transfer.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Afro-Brazilians by region:\n|-\n! style=\"width:35%\" | Region !! style=\"width:35%\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[North Region, Brazil|North Brazil]] || 6.2%\n|-\n| [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]] || 8.1%\n|-\n| [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West Brazil]] || 5.7%\n|-\n| [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Brazil]] || 7.91%\n|-\n| [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] || 3.6%\n|}\n\n===Asian Brazilians===\n{{Main|Asian Brazilians}}\n{{See also|Japanese Brazilians|Chinese Brazilians|Korean Brazilians}}\n'''Asians''', in common parlance referred to East Asians, constitute the fourth largest ethnic group of Brazil with '''2.2 million''' people, what may not include mixed East Asians. The largest East Asian ethnic group in the country are the [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]]. \nBrazil has the largest population of Japanese people outside Japan, being in percentage or absolute numbers. The number of Japanese Brazilians revolves around '''1.8 million''' descendants and the Japanese community also comprises '''57 thousand Japanese nationals'''.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref name=japantimes/><ref name=\"japao100.com.br\"/><ref name=\"IBGE tra\u00e7a perfil dos imigrantes\"/> According to Ethnologue over '''400 thousand people speak Japanese''' in Brazil.\n\nThe others are mainly Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean. Due to the recent immigration of Chinese citizens to Brazil the number of these people is constantly on the rise.\n\nSouth Asians also left descendants in Brazil, mostly East Indians, Vietnamese, Indonesians and Bengali. However, there is a current stronger influx of Bengalis (between 5 and 10,000) nowadays, most of them refugees. Moreover, South Asians might not be included into the category of people with \"yellow\" skin colour, as they are physically different from Eastern Asian populations and therefore more likely to fit into the Pardo category.\n\nThere are large groups of East Asian Catholics as well as non-religious Asians. [[Buddhism in Brazil]] is also very common among non-Asians, especially Whites, with Japanese Buddhism being among the most usual and oldest forms. [[Shinto]] practices involving life style and funerals are very common in Nipponese families of S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 states. Shinto-derived [[Japanese New Religions]] are very popular throughout the nation. The largest Nipponese new religions are [[Seicho-no-Ie]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[PL Kyodan|Perfect Liberty Kyodan]] and [[Church of World Messianity]].

It is the oldest ethnic group in the country, mainly located in the surroundings of the Amazon basin inside the [[Amazon Forest]] but also in various reservations throughout the five geographical regions. Compared to the total population of the country the number might seem small, but millions of Brazilians actually have some Indigenous ancestry. This happened mainly because of the miscegenation of indigenous tribes with colonial settlers.\n\nAround '''180 Native or autoctone languages are spoken in Brazil''' by 160 thousand people, many of them have threatened status. Most Natives can communicate in Portuguese and tribes in reservations have their mother tongue and Portuguese taught at schools. Today 517 thousand people live in Indigenous reservations.\n\n== Genetic studies ==\nGenetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native Americans components.\n\n===Autosomal studies===\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%).

Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085).

A total of 22 different haplogroups were detected in the whole Brazilian sample, revealing the three major continental origins of the current population, namely from America, Europe and Africa. The genetic differences observed among regions were, however, consistent with the colonization history of the country. The sample from the Northern region presented the highest Native American ancestry (8.4%), whereas the more pronounced African contribution could be observed in the Northeastern population (15.1%).

The Southeastern region presented significant European (86.1%) and African (12.0%) contributions. Portugal was estimated to be the main source of the male European lineages to Central-West, Southeast and South Brazil. The North and the Northeast showed the highest contribution from France and Italy, respectively. The highest migration rate from Lebanon was to the Central-Weast, whereas a significant migration from Germany was observed to the Central East, Southeast and South.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Male Lineages in Brazil: Intercontinental Admixture and Stratification of the European Background, Resque et al.

They had been living there since the [[Pleistocene]] and still exist in many different tribes and ethnicities, amounting to the hundreds, giving them varying features, shapes and shades. There are different estimates for the Indigenous population around 1498, when the cohort commanded by [[Duarte Pacheco Pereira]] first set foot in Brazilian territory, followed by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]] and [[Amerigo Vespucci]] in 1500 and 1502, with figures revolving between 2.4 million and 3.1 million. What is more accurate is that about three quarters of them died from contracted diseases brought by colonizers (the [[flu]], [[smallpox]], [[measles]], [[scarlet fever]] and [[tuberculosis]]) and conflicts (besides the numerous deaths in different tribal groups by forging alliances with the Portuguese, French and Dutch to fight each other, ending in genocide, the abortion rate also increased among Indigenous women after the arrival of the colonizers), while the remaining were pushed to the Amazon Basin, sometimes migrating beyond the borders with Hispanic provinces. It is also important to mention that a strong assimilation by miscegenation with local populations occurred, where Natives living under Jesuit protection and having a monastic life decided to leave for the life in towns. The European diseases spread quickly along the indigenous trade routes, and whole tribes were likely annihilated without ever coming in direct contact with Europeans. Today, 517,000 Indigenous people live in reservations and 160 thousand speak assorted Native languages, whereas millions of Brazilians have at least some degree of Amerindian ancestry due to the mentioned interracial encounters.\n* The country was officially discovered by Portugal in 1500 and received about 724,000 [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonizers, mostly males, who settled there until the end of Colonial Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |title=IBGE teen |publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] |accessdate=2011-12-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224012534/http://www.ibge.gov.br/ibgeteen/povoamento/portugueses.html |archivedate=2013-02-24 |df= }}</ref> But other sources even claim that the given numbers of total entrances were clearly surpassed.

Bahia's port in the Northeast received one of the first groups of orphans in 1551.{{sfnp|Bethell|1984|p=47}}\nPortugal remained the only significant, but not an exclusive source of European immigration to Brazil until the early 19th century.\n* These other people came from different nationalities - but the by far most mentioned are the Dutch. Hence, under the rule of [[Dutch Brazil]] in the northeastern part of the country, from 1630 to 1654, a comparatively small but still notable number of Dutch settlers ([[Dutch Brazilian]]) and some [[Jews|Jewish People]] arrived, the latter seeking religious freedom. These Jews founded the first Synagogue in the Americas, named [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]] in the city of [[Recife]].\n\nIt is estimated that more than 20,000 [[Dutch people|Dutch]] entered [[Brazil]], however, both groups had been forced out of the country after the rule's end. The remaining families mostly fled to remote parts of the interior of Northeastern Brazil (mainly in the states of Pernambuco, but also Para\u00edba, Rio Grande do Norte, Cear\u00e1 and others) or changed their names to Portuguese ones. The proven excess of Y-chromosomes of the haplogroup 2 in northeasterners probably results from the high miscegenation of Dutch settlers with the local population.\n\nThe Jews who mostly left Brazil took off to what was then named [[New Amsterdam]], today New York City, and founded the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States, the [[Congregation Shearith Israel]]. The ones who stayed, converted into Christianity and were then known as [[New Christian]]s or [[Marranos]], who sometimes practiced [[Crypto-Judaism]]. Even if the Jewish population under Dutch Brazil not surpassed a few thousand individuals, a considerably higher number of New Christians, in the past simply absorbed as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonizers, arrived in Colonial Brazil - especially in the first centuries after 1500. They entered Brazil fleeing from the Inquisition or were deported by the Kingdom of Portugal and also Spain, latter being known as [[Degredado]]s, someone who was sentenced or forced to exile. This also included [[Romani People]] from the Iberian Peninsula, what partially explains the curiously high numbers for a western country. Brazil has the second largest Gypsy population in the Americas after the United States, having also received Roma people from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the Baltic countries during the 20th century.\n\n* As a result of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from the mid-16th century until 1855, an estimated 3.6 million [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African people]], also from many different countries and ethnicities were brought to Brazil, giving the country the Americas' largest population with some African ancestry. Many of the slaves suffered under severe conditions and the mortality rates were pretty high, what led to the foundation of [[Quilombola]] communities throughout the country. A small number of the slaves in the state of Bahia were actually Muslims; they produced a revolt in the city of Salvador that was quickly tamed by the army.\n\nIn 1808, the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Portuguese court moved to Brazil]], bringing thousands of Portuguese again and afterwards opened its seaports to other nations starting from 1820. This caused the biggest wave of immigration which the country has seen until then.\n\n===The Great Immigration (1820 until the 1970s)===\n[[File:Europeans and Arabs in Brazil.jpg|thumb|Some of the main immigrant groups]]\nIn this period, [[Immigration to Brazil|people]] from all over the world officially entered Brazil, the vast majority of them Europeans.\n\nBetween 1820 and the 1950s, Brazil received around '''5,686,133''' European immigrants, including a thriving Jewish population.<ref name=\"Brazil - Modern-Day Community\">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html#4 |title=Brazil - Modern-Day Community |publisher=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://brasil500anos.ibge.gov.br/territorio-brasileiro-e-povoamento/judeus/judeus-no-brasil-vida-social-politica-e-cultural|title=Judeus no Brasil.

Millions of White Brazilians descend from recent Portuguese immigration from between the 1870s and 1975. In addition, many multiracial Brazilians partially descend from Portuguese people, caused by the high intermarriage rates. Most of them came from the [[Provinces of Portugal|historical provinces]] of Minho, Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes, Beira, Estremadura (North and Central Portugal). Northeastern Brazil traditionally received the first waves of immigrants, but during the Great Immigration, the Southeast received the biggest influx. S\u00e3o Paulo (state) received the most, followed by Rio de Janeiro (city), which is considered the largest Portuguese city outside of Lisbon. The second former capital of Brazil once also was the capital of Portugal, the only European capital outside of Europe. The accent in the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]] subsequently reminds the 19th century innovations that took place in the European variety of the language, while the prosody of the rest of the country, besides some local varieties, has rather conservative phonetics rooted in the 1600s. Other states with significant numbers were [[Minas Gerais]], [[Par\u00e1]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], [[Pernambuco]] and [[Bahia]]. Nowadays, they naturally live throughout Brazil and compose the majority of White and also Multiracial Brazilians in many states.\n\n*Furthermore, around '''1.6 million''' '''[[Italian Brazilian|Italians]]''' were responsible for a massive immigration wave, consequently composing the biggest European follow-up group the country has received after its colonizers.\n\nToday, millions of [[Italian-Brazilians]] make Brazil their home, as they usually brought the whole family and had high birth rates. Regarding the total numbers, this probably represents the biggest Italian diaspora outside of Italy. Contrary to other countries, more than half of the Italians immigrated from the North, mostly composed by people from [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]], followed by people from Central Italy. The state of S\u00e3o Paulo had the strongest and a more diverse influx, with many also coming from [[South Italy]], especially to the eponymic capital. [[Italians]] mostly went to [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)]], which received half of the overall immigrants. The others mainly went to the states of southern Brazil, where they also composed the biggest European immigrant group. Other notable influxes occurred in two other southeastern states, here [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] and the Central-West region, mainly to [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] and Goi\u00e1s. Comparatively small numbers went to [[Pernambuco]] and Bahia, both in the Northeast. Nowadays the descendants mostly live in mentioned areas, but the sheer amount and internal migrations made the Italilan diaspora spread out and nowadays they are scattered all over Brazil.\n\n*'''[[Spanish Brazilians|Spaniards]]''' also arrived in rather high numbers, with around '''700,000''' immigrants mainly from [[Andalusia]] and [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].\n\nSeveral million Brazilians have Spanish ancestry. Most Spaniards settled in the past century, where they chiefly headed to [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], then [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Most notably from [[Andalusia]] (South), others from the provinces of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]] and [[Catalonia]] (North and East Spain) followed. Galicians were also present throughout Colonial Brazil, as the province shares borders and linguistic ties with Portugal, and once was part of the country. [[Spanish Brazilian]]s in the other states mainly have origins in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], which arrived in earlier occasions. Many of them went to the first capital [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and its state Bahia, but also Pernambuco (Northeast), Par\u00e1 (North), [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] (Southeast), and [[Rio Grande do Sul]] (South).<ref>{{cite web|author=Mar\u00edlia D.

But in fact, minorities in the White and Black populations consider themselves as Pardo. Moreover, some people in the Roma, Sephardic, Arab and Asian population classify themselves as Pardo, due to miscegenation with other races.\n*[[Northern Brazil]], largely covered by the [[Amazon Rainforest]], is also mostly '''Pardo''', due to a stronger [[Amerindian]] influence.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050315162129/http://www.socioambiental.org/pib/english/source/xi.shtm Sources :: Indigenous Peoples in Brazil \u2013 ISA]. socioambiental.org</ref>\n*The two remaining [[Southeastern Brazil|South Eastern states]] and the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-Western]] Brazil have a more '''balanced''' ratio among different racial groups (around 50% White, 43% Pardo, 5% Black, 1% Asian/Amerindian).\n\nThe [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE) classifies the Brazilian population in five categories: ''brancos'' ([[Whites|white]]), ''negros'' ([[Black people|black]]), ''[[pardo]]s'' ([[Brown people|brown or mixed]]), ''amarelos'' ([[Asian people|Asian/yellow]]) and ''\u00edndios'' ([[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]]), based on [[Human skin color|skin color]] or [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]. The last detailed census (PNAD) found Brazil to be made up of c. 91 million white people ([[White Brazilian]]), 79 million multiracial people ([[Pardo]]), 14 million black people ([[Afro-Brazilian]]), 2-4 million Asian people ([[Asian Brazilian]]) and 807,900 indigenous ([[Amerindian]]) people.\n\n[[File:Concentra\u00e7\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Young Brazilians]]\nIn the 2005 detailed census, for the first time in two decades, the number of White Brazilians did not exceed 50% of the population. On the other side, the number of ''pardos'' (multiracial) people increased and all the others remained almost the same. According to the IBGE, this trend is mainly because of the revaluation of the identity of historically discriminated ethnic groups.\n\nBrazil is said to be among the most miscegenated countries in the world, as since the country was discovered and during the colonial period intermarriage between races was never illegal and common. Those of full ancestry are usually the Brazilians who can trace back their ethnicity to more recent immigration from the monarchical period in the 19th century until the Republican 20th and 21st centuries. Still, many Brazilians can not trace back their real origin easily. For instance, European family names which were difficult to pronounce were commonly changed to easier Portuguese surnames. In basic terms, it could be said that half of Brazilians are descendants of populations from the colonial era and the other half made of modern immigration. Brazil is a true melting pot of Europeans, Asians, Africans and Indigenous people, who either are in the single group or a mixture of various different backgrounds and races.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; border:1px #000; margin-center:1em;\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\" rowspan=\"2\"|[[Human skin color|Skin color]] or<br>[[Human races|race]]|| colspan=\"2\"|%<br>(rounded values)\n|-\n! 2000<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=892&id_pagina=1 Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825192041/http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/presidencia/noticias/noticia_visualiza.php?id_noticia=892&id_pagina=1 |date=2007-08-25 }}.

The term ''Pardo'' or mixed race Brazilian is a rather complex one. Multiracial Brazilians appear in hundreds of different shades, colours and backgrounds. They are typically a mixture of colonial and post-colonial [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] with descendants of [[African slaves]] and the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Some individuals may also descend from Maghreb people, Jews, Middle Eastern and Egyptian people, or a more recent ancestry from East or South Asia. Skin colours can vary from light to dark. The '''''caboclo''''' or '''''mesti\u00e7o''''' population, those who are a miscegenation of Native and European, revolves around 43 million people. Genetic studies conducted by the geneticist Sergio D.J. Pena of the Federal University of Minas Gerais have shown that the '''[[Caboclo]]''' population is made of individuals whose DNA ranges from 70% to 90% European (mostly Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French or Italian 1500s to 1700s male settlers) with the remaining percentage spanning different Indigenous markers. Similar DNA tests showed that people self-classified as '''[[Mulatto]]''' or White and Black mix, span from 62% to 85% European (mostly descendants of Portuguese, Dutch and French settlers during the colonial period in the Northeast). The '''Pardo category''' in Brazil also includes 800 thousand '''[[Gypsies]]''' or '''[[Roma people]]''', most of them coming from Portugal but also different countries in Eastern Europe and the Baltics. '''[[Eurasia]]ns''' can also be classified as Pardo. The majority of them consisting of '''[[Hafu|Ainoko]]''' or '''[[Hafu]]''', individuals who are a miscegenation between Japanese and European.\n\nRecent research has suggested that Asians from the early [[Portuguese Eastern Empire]], known as [[Luso-Asians]] first came to Brazil during the sixteenth century as seamen known as [[Lascars]], or as servants, slaves and [[concubines]] accompanying the governors, merchants and clergy who has served in Portuguese Asia.<ref>Cliff Pereira, in Van Tilburg, H., Tripati, S., Walker Vadillo, V., Fahy, B., and Kimura, J. (eds.), [http://www.themua.org/collections/items/show/1607 \u201cEast in the West : Investigating the Asian presence and influence in Brazil from the 16th to 18th centuries.\u201d] The MUA Collection.</ref> This first presence of Asians was limited to [[Northeast Brazil]], especially [[Bahia]], but others were brought as cultivators, textile workers and miners to [[Par\u00e1]] and other parts of the Northeast.\n\nThe largest populations with Pardo individuals are found in northern and northeastern Brazil, with many inhabiting the states of [[Mato Grosso]], [[Goi\u00e1s]], [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro State]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo State]] and [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1 State]], as well as the Federal District. While the occurrence of Pardos is not uniform across the country, there are states with more people of mixed background than others. It also can happen that Pardos constitute significant numbers within single regions in states.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Multiracial people by region:\n|-\n! style=\"width:35%\" | Region !! style=\"width:35%\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[North Region, Brazil|North Brazil]] || 71.2%\n|-\n| [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]] || 62.7%\n|-\n| [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West Brazil]] || 50.6%\n|-\n| [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Brazil]] || 35.69%\n|-\n| [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] || 17.3%\n|}\n\n===Black coloured people===\n{{Main|Afro-Brazilians}}\n'''Blacks''' constitute the third largest ethnic group of Brazil with around 14,5 million citizens or 7,6 % of the population. These are people who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa. In the country, these are generally used for Brazilians with at least partial [[Sub-Saharan African]] ancestry. Most African Brazilians are the direct descendants of captive Africans who survived the slavery era within the boundaries of the present Brazil, but also with considerable European and Amerindian ancestry. Afro-Brazilians might not directly be compared to Pardo-Brazilians. The number of African genes is substantially higher in Afro-Brazilians, therefore their skin colour is darker compared to mixed-race Brazilians. Brazil, followed by the United States, has the largest '''[[African diaspora]]''' in the Americas.\n\nToday most Blacks are either Catholic or Evangelical. Smaller groups are Irreligious including Atheists and a number of African tradition sects can be found especially in Bahia, notably [[Candombl\u00e9]] and [[Umbanda]]. The latter being a syncretism of Roman Catholicism, African traditions, [[Spiritism]] and Indigenous beliefs. A minority of Blacks follows [[Kardecism]], which is a blend of Christianism and [[Spiritualism]] founded in France.\n\nMost Blacks can be found in Bahia and Maranh\u00e3o states after the colonial period influx, as well as in the northern region of Minas Gerais thanks to the Diamond and Gold Rush period and parts of Rio de Janeiro due to slavery in the former royal court after its transfer.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Afro-Brazilians by region:\n|-\n! style=\"width:35%\" | Region !! style=\"width:35%\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[North Region, Brazil|North Brazil]] || 6.2%\n|-\n| [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]] || 8.1%\n|-\n| [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West Brazil]] || 5.7%\n|-\n| [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Brazil]] || 7.91%\n|-\n| [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] || 3.6%\n|}\n\n===Asian Brazilians===\n{{Main|Asian Brazilians}}\n{{See also|Japanese Brazilians|Chinese Brazilians|Korean Brazilians}}\n'''Asians''', in common parlance referred to East Asians, constitute the fourth largest ethnic group of Brazil with '''2.2 million''' people, what may not include mixed East Asians. The largest East Asian ethnic group in the country are the [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]]. \nBrazil has the largest population of Japanese people outside Japan, being in percentage or absolute numbers. The number of Japanese Brazilians revolves around '''1.8 million''' descendants and the Japanese community also comprises '''57 thousand Japanese nationals'''.<ref name=\"Gonzalez\"/><ref name=japantimes/><ref name=\"japao100.com.br\"/><ref name=\"IBGE tra\u00e7a perfil dos imigrantes\"/> According to Ethnologue over '''400 thousand people speak Japanese''' in Brazil.\n\nThe others are mainly Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean. Due to the recent immigration of Chinese citizens to Brazil the number of these people is constantly on the rise.\n\nSouth Asians also left descendants in Brazil, mostly East Indians, Vietnamese, Indonesians and Bengali. However, there is a current stronger influx of Bengalis (between 5 and 10,000) nowadays, most of them refugees. Moreover, South Asians might not be included into the category of people with \"yellow\" skin colour, as they are physically different from Eastern Asian populations and therefore more likely to fit into the Pardo category.\n\nThere are large groups of East Asian Catholics as well as non-religious Asians. [[Buddhism in Brazil]] is also very common among non-Asians, especially Whites, with Japanese Buddhism being among the most usual and oldest forms. [[Shinto]] practices involving life style and funerals are very common in Nipponese families of S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 states. Shinto-derived [[Japanese New Religions]] are very popular throughout the nation. The largest Nipponese new religions are [[Seicho-no-Ie]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[PL Kyodan|Perfect Liberty Kyodan]] and [[Church of World Messianity]]. [[Korean Confucianism]] and Chinese Confucianism are especially found in S\u00e3o Paulo capital.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ East Asian Brazilians by region:\n|-\n! style=\"width:35%\" | Region !! style=\"width:35%\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[North Region, Brazil|North Brazil]] || 0.5 - 1%\n|-\n| [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Brazil]] || 0.3 - 0.5%\n|-\n| [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West Brazil]] || 0.7 - 0.8%\n|-\n| [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Brazil]] || 1.1%\n|-\n| [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazil]] || 0.5 - 0.7%\n|}\n\n===Indigenous people===\n{{Main|Native Brazilians}}\n'''Indigenous people''' constitute the fifth largest ethnic group of Brazil, with around '''800,000''' individuals. It is the oldest ethnic group in the country, mainly located in the surroundings of the Amazon basin inside the [[Amazon Forest]] but also in various reservations throughout the five geographical regions. Compared to the total population of the country the number might seem small, but millions of Brazilians actually have some Indigenous ancestry. This happened mainly because of the miscegenation of indigenous tribes with colonial settlers.\n\nAround '''180 Native or autoctone languages are spoken in Brazil''' by 160 thousand people, many of them have threatened status. Most Natives can communicate in Portuguese and tribes in reservations have their mother tongue and Portuguese taught at schools. Today 517 thousand people live in Indigenous reservations.\n\n== Genetic studies ==\nGenetic studies have shown the Brazilian population as a whole to have European, African and Native Americans components.\n\n===Autosomal studies===\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations concluded that: European ancestry accounts for 62% of the heritage of the population, followed by the African (21%) and the Native American (17%).

'Following an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban\npopulations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population'.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0075145|pmid=24073242|title=Revisiting the Genetic Ancestry of Brazilians Using Autosomal AIM-Indels|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=9|pages=e75145|year=2013|last1=Saloum De Neves Manta|first1=Fernanda|last2=Pereira|first2=Rui|last3=Vianna|first3=Romulo|last4=Rodolfo Beuttenm\u00fcller De Ara\u00fajo|first4=Alfredo|last5=Leite G\u00f3es Gita\u00ed|first5=Daniel|last6=Aparecida Da Silva|first6=Dayse|last7=De Vargas Wolfgramm|first7=Eldam\u00e1ria|last8=Da Mota Pontes|first8=Isabel|last9=Ivan Aguiar|first9=Jos\u00e9|last10=Oz\u00f3rio Moraes|first10=Milton|last11=Fagundes De Carvalho|first11=Elizeu|last12=Gusm\u00e3o|first12=Leonor|pmc=3779230|bibcode=2013PLoSO...875145S}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085).

They are very general genetic snapshots, primarily useful in examining past population group migratory patterns. Only autosomal DNA testing can reveal admixture structures, since it analyses millions of alleles from both maternal and paternal sides. Contrary to yDNA or mtDNA, which are focused on one single lineage (paternal or maternal) the autosomal DNA studies profile the whole ancestry of a given individual, being more accurate in describing the complex patterns of ancestry in a given place. According to a genetic study in 2000 who analysed 247 samples (mainly identified as \"white\" in Brazil) who came from four of the five major geographic regions of the country, the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] pool (maternal lineages) of present-day Brazilians clearly reflects the imprints of the early Portuguese colonization process (involving directional mating), as well as the recent immigrant waves (from Europe) of the last century.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/303004|title=The Ancestry of Brazilian mtDNA Lineages|year=2000|last1=Alvessilva|first1=J|last2=Dasilvasantos|first2=M|last3=Guimaraes|first3=P|last4=Ferreira|first4=A|last5=Bandelt|first5=H|last6=Pena|first6=S|last7=Prado|first7=V|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=67|issue=2|pages=444\u201361|pmid=10873790|pmc=1287189}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A total of 22 different haplogroups were detected in the whole Brazilian sample, revealing the three major continental origins of the current population, namely from America, Europe and Africa. The genetic differences observed among regions were, however, consistent with the colonization history of the country. The sample from the Northern region presented the highest Native American ancestry (8.4%), whereas the more pronounced African contribution could be observed in the Northeastern population (15.1%). The Central-Western and Southern samples showed the higher European contributions (95.7% and 93.6%, respectively). The Southeastern region presented significant European (86.1%) and African (12.0%) contributions. Portugal was estimated to be the main source of the male European lineages to Central-West, Southeast and South Brazil. The North and the Northeast showed the highest contribution from France and Italy, respectively. The highest migration rate from Lebanon was to the Central-Weast, whereas a significant migration from Germany was observed to the Central East, Southeast and South.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Male Lineages in Brazil: Intercontinental Admixture and Stratification of the European Background, Resque et al.
