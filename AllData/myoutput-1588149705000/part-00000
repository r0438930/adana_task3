It is bordered by the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east, and extends more than {{convert|3000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=off}} from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the northeast to the [[East China Sea]] in the southwest. Part of the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], Japan encompasses a [[Stratovolcano|stratovolcanic]] [[Japanese archipelago|archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]]; five main islands ([[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Okinawa]]) comprise 97% of the country's land area of {{convert|377,975|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}} and more than 99% of its population.\n\nJapan is officially divided into [[Prefectures of Japan|47 prefectures]] and traditionally into [[List of regions of Japan|eight regions]]. About three-fourths of [[Geography of Japan|the country's terrain]] is mountainous, with much of the remainder made up by low-lying coastal plains. As a result, Japan is among the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated]] and [[Urbanization_by_country|urbanized countries]] in the world, with more than 90% of its population living in urban areas. The largest of these is the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] centered on the capital city of [[Tokyo]], which is the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan area in the world]] and home to more than 38 million people. Japan is the [[List of countries by population|eleventh most populous country in the world]] with a population of 126.2 million, of which 97.8% are [[Yamato people|ethnically Japanese]].\n\nThe [[kanji]] (or \"[[Chinese characters]]\") that make up [[Names of Japan|the name of Japan]] in the [[Japanese language]] mean \"sun origin\"; in the Western world, the country is sometimes known by the [[sobriquet]] \"Land of the Rising Sun\". Periods of influence from other regions, primarily [[Imperial China|China]], followed by periods of isolation, particularly from [[Western Europe]], have characterized [[History of Japan|the history of Japan]].\n\nWhile archaeological evidence indicates that [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan was inhabited]] as early as the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, the first written mentions of the country appear in [[Book of Han|Chinese texts]] from the first century AD. Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under [[Emperor of Japan|an Emperor]] and [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial court]] based in [[Heian-ky\u014d]] (modern [[Kyoto]]). Beginning in  the twelfth century, however, political power came to be held by a succession of military dictators (''[[sh\u014dgun]]''), feudal lords (''[[daimy\u014d]]''), and a class of warrior nobility (''[[samurai]]''). After [[Sengoku period|a century-long period of civil war]], the country was reunified in 1603 under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which enacted a [[Sakoku|policy of foreign isolationism]]. This period ended in 1854 when [[Perry Expedition|a United States fleet]] forced Japan to [[Bakumatsu|open to the West]], leading to the [[Boshin War|fall of the shogunate]] and [[Meiji Restoration|the restoration of imperial power]] in 1868. In the resulting [[Meiji period]], Japan adopted a [[Meiji Constitution|Western-style government]] and pursued a program of [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]], which transformed the feudal society into a [[great power]]. By 1920, Japan had established [[Japanese colonial empire|a colonial empire in East Asia]] after decisive victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]]. In 1937, the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]; in 1940, it signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and entered [[World War II]] the following year on the side of the [[Axis powers]]. After suffering major defeats in [[Pacific War|the Pacific]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], Japan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered to the Allies]] in 1945, coming under [[Occupation of Japan|a seven-year occupation]] and adopting [[Constitution of Japan|a post-war constitution]]. Japan has since maintained a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with the Emperor as the [[head of state]] and an elected legislature known as the [[National Diet]].\n\nToday, Japan is a member of numerous international institutions, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[G7]], and the [[G20]]. Though it has [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|officially renounced its right to declare war]], Japan maintains a [[Japanese Self Defense Forces|modern military]] for [[peacekeeping]] and self-defense, which has been ranked as the [[Military#Capability development|world's fourth most powerful]]. Following World War II, Japan experienced [[Japanese economic miracle|record economic growth]], becoming [[Economic history of Japan|the world's second-largest economy]] by 1980. As of 2019, [[Economy of Japan|Japan's economy]] is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|world's third-largest by nominal GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth-largest by purchasing power parity]]; it is also the [[List of countries by imports|fourth-largest importer]] and [[List of countries by exports|exporter]] and an international leader in the [[Automotive industry in Japan|automotive]] and [[Electronics industry in Japan|electronics]] industries. Japan is categorized as \"very high\" on the [[Human Development Index]], and its population enjoys high levels of [[Education in Japan|tertiary education]] and the [[List of countries by life expectancy|highest life expectancy]] in the world, though it is currently is experiencing [[Aging of Japan|a projected decline]] due to aging and low [[Total fertility rate|birth rates]]. [[Japanese culture|Culturally]], Japan is renowned around the world for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]], [[Cinema of Japan|cinema]], [[Japanese music|music]], and [[Japanese popular culture|popular culture]], including its prominent [[manga|comics]], [[anime|animation]], and [[Video gaming in Japan|video game]] industries.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Japan}}\n\nThe Japanese word for Japan is {{nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}}, which is pronounced ''Nihon'' or ''Nippon''.

It is bordered by the [[Sea of Japan]] to the west and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the east, and extends more than {{convert|3000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=off}} from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the northeast to the [[East China Sea]] in the southwest. Part of the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], Japan encompasses a [[Stratovolcano|stratovolcanic]] [[Japanese archipelago|archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]]; five main islands ([[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Kyushu]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Okinawa]]) comprise 97% of the country's land area of {{convert|377,975|sqkm|sqmi|sp=us}} and more than 99% of its population.\n\nJapan is officially divided into [[Prefectures of Japan|47 prefectures]] and traditionally into [[List of regions of Japan|eight regions]]. About three-fourths of [[Geography of Japan|the country's terrain]] is mountainous, with much of the remainder made up by low-lying coastal plains. As a result, Japan is among the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most densely populated]] and [[Urbanization_by_country|urbanized countries]] in the world, with more than 90% of its population living in urban areas. The largest of these is the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] centered on the capital city of [[Tokyo]], which is the [[List of metropolitan areas by population|most populous metropolitan area in the world]] and home to more than 38 million people. Japan is the [[List of countries by population|eleventh most populous country in the world]] with a population of 126.2 million, of which 97.8% are [[Yamato people|ethnically Japanese]].\n\nThe [[kanji]] (or \"[[Chinese characters]]\") that make up [[Names of Japan|the name of Japan]] in the [[Japanese language]] mean \"sun origin\"; in the Western world, the country is sometimes known by the [[sobriquet]] \"Land of the Rising Sun\". Periods of influence from other regions, primarily [[Imperial China|China]], followed by periods of isolation, particularly from [[Western Europe]], have characterized [[History of Japan|the history of Japan]].\n\nWhile archaeological evidence indicates that [[Japanese Paleolithic|Japan was inhabited]] as early as the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period, the first written mentions of the country appear in [[Book of Han|Chinese texts]] from the first century AD. Between the fourth and ninth centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became gradually unified under [[Emperor of Japan|an Emperor]] and [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial court]] based in [[Heian-ky\u014d]] (modern [[Kyoto]]). Beginning in  the twelfth century, however, political power came to be held by a succession of military dictators (''[[sh\u014dgun]]''), feudal lords (''[[daimy\u014d]]''), and a class of warrior nobility (''[[samurai]]''). After [[Sengoku period|a century-long period of civil war]], the country was reunified in 1603 under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], which enacted a [[Sakoku|policy of foreign isolationism]]. This period ended in 1854 when [[Perry Expedition|a United States fleet]] forced Japan to [[Bakumatsu|open to the West]], leading to the [[Boshin War|fall of the shogunate]] and [[Meiji Restoration|the restoration of imperial power]] in 1868. In the resulting [[Meiji period]], Japan adopted a [[Meiji Constitution|Western-style government]] and pursued a program of [[industrialization]] and [[modernization]], which transformed the feudal society into a [[great power]]. By 1920, Japan had established [[Japanese colonial empire|a colonial empire in East Asia]] after decisive victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and [[Russo-Japanese War]]. In 1937, the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|China]], beginning the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]; in 1940, it signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and entered [[World War II]] the following year on the side of the [[Axis powers]]. After suffering major defeats in [[Pacific War|the Pacific]] and [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bombings of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], Japan [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered to the Allies]] in 1945, coming under [[Occupation of Japan|a seven-year occupation]] and adopting [[Constitution of Japan|a post-war constitution]]. Japan has since maintained a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with the Emperor as the [[head of state]] and an elected legislature known as the [[National Diet]].\n\nToday, Japan is a member of numerous international institutions, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[G7]], and the [[G20]]. Though it has [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|officially renounced its right to declare war]], Japan maintains a [[Japanese Self Defense Forces|modern military]] for [[peacekeeping]] and self-defense, which has been ranked as the [[Military#Capability development|world's fourth most powerful]]. Following World War II, Japan experienced [[Japanese economic miracle|record economic growth]], becoming [[Economic history of Japan|the world's second-largest economy]] by 1980. As of 2019, [[Economy of Japan|Japan's economy]] is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|world's third-largest by nominal GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|fourth-largest by purchasing power parity]]; it is also the [[List of countries by imports|fourth-largest importer]] and [[List of countries by exports|exporter]] and an international leader in the [[Automotive industry in Japan|automotive]] and [[Electronics industry in Japan|electronics]] industries. Japan is categorized as \"very high\" on the [[Human Development Index]], and its population enjoys high levels of [[Education in Japan|tertiary education]] and the [[List of countries by life expectancy|highest life expectancy]] in the world, though it is currently is experiencing [[Aging of Japan|a projected decline]] due to aging and low [[Total fertility rate|birth rates]]. [[Japanese culture|Culturally]], Japan is renowned around the world for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese cuisine|cuisine]], [[Cinema of Japan|cinema]], [[Japanese music|music]], and [[Japanese popular culture|popular culture]], including its prominent [[manga|comics]], [[anime|animation]], and [[Video gaming in Japan|video game]] industries.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Main|Names of Japan}}\n\nThe Japanese word for Japan is {{nihongo2|\u65e5\u672c}}, which is pronounced ''Nihon'' or ''Nippon''.
