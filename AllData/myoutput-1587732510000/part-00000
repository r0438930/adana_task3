Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nThe artist is also re-evaluating his own resources through his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\n==Exhibition History==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Selected Solo Exhibitions !!

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nShortly after the death of his father, Butcher created a series of works from gunpowder residue and clay on burnt paper. These found 'drawings' were from 'spent fireworks cartridges from a beach display [that] had been casually tossed into the sea'<ref name=richnessrightness>(2019).\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\" Carey-Kent, Paul, p.124. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>. 'Eric started to gather them up for more suitable disposal. Then he became interested in how the spent energy had left its marks, especially as those traces were \u2013 in line with the aims of his wider practice \u2013 free from the subjectivity of creative decision making'.<ref name=richnessrightness /> Butcher states how 'the absence of something no longer present coupled with enormous pressure (in the case of the embossed pieces) or heat (in the case of the firework pieces) I find very suggestive and full of implications. On a metaphorical level they speak of loss and spent energy'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.139. Galerie Robert Dress, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art, {{ISBN|978-1-5272-5156-4}}</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in the Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\"(2019). Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines),<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref> which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\nThe Devil Finds Work for Idle Hands explored the materiality of paper with work by six contemporary artists (Rana Begum, Michael Brown, Eric Butcher, Sim\u00f3n Granell, Natasha Kidd, John Lavell). It was an exhibition of artists who work with paper; with each artist making work exploiting properties intrinsic to the material.\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.
