As this contained both [[strychnine]] and [[arsenic]], she was required to sign the poison register. \n\nBritland's first victim was her eldest daughter, 19-year-old Elizabeth Hannah, in March 1886. Elizabeth's death was attributed to natural causes by the doctor who was called to attend the teenager. Mary Ann Britland then claimed [[\u00a3]]10 on Elizabeth's [[life insurance]] policy. Her next victim was her husband, Thomas, aged 44. His death on 3 May was diagnosed as [[epilepsy]], and once again Mary Ann claimed on the insurance.<ref name=\"Capital Punishment UK\">{{cite web |title=Mary Ann Britland |url=http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/Britland.html |website=Capital Punishment UK |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nMary Ann had been having an affair with her neighbour, Thomas Dixon, and after her own husband's death was invited to stay at the Dixons' house just across the street at number 128 by Thomas's 29-year-old wife, Mary.

It was found to contain a lethal quantity of the two poisons and Britland was immediately arrested along with Thomas Dixon. She confessed to Ashton Police that she had wanted to marry Dixon and that she had first poisoned her daughter, Elizabeth, because she believed that she suspected her intentions. She then killed her husband, and finally Mary Dixon. \n\nBritland was charged with the murder of the three victims, but Thomas Dixon was found to have played no part in the murder of his wife.
