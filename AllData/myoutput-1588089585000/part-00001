Japan's most popular philosophy{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}, [[Confucianism]], enforces gendered rules relating to fashion and public behavior. For instance, from a young age, Japanese men are taught the importance of professional success, higher education, honoring the family name, and providing for the family. In the Confucian tradition, women only receive education through [[middle school]], and are taught to focus on being respectful, learning to cook, and taking care of children. Under this framework, women are not supposed to have a paying job.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nIt was not until 1900 that women in Japan were allowed to earn a [[college degree]]. Women with a career at the expense of focusing on a family have become a target for blame regarding Japan's unusually low [[birthrate]]. While the cultural understanding of women's roles in society has changed, that of men's has not \u2014 honoring the family name and being a [[breadwinner]] are still deeply instilled priorities.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Gender gap in employment and wages==\nThe gender gap in employment and [[wage]]s is becoming an increasingly serious problem, with Japan being the fastest aging country in the [[OECD]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Pursuit of Gender Equality|doi=10.1787/9789264281318-en|year=2017|isbn=9789264281301|df=|author1=OECD}}</ref> In order to maintain its economy, the government must take measures to maintain productivity.

Japan has the third highest wage gap in the [[OECD]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The country's long work hours create an environment that reinforces the wage gap because there is a disproportional difference between how much time men and women spend on paid and unpaid work.<ref name=\":0\" /> On average, women spend 5.5 hours on unpaid housework per day, whereas men only spend one hour.<ref name=\":3\" /> Men do very little housework in Japan, and this is part of the gendered labor division.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Est\u00e9vez-Abe|first=Margarita|date=2012|title=An International Comparison of Institutional Requisites for Gender Equality|journal=Japanese Economy|volume=39|issue=3|pages=77\u201398|doi=10.2753/JES1097-203X390305}}</ref> The Japanese prioritization of seniority hurts the women who want to have children first, as promotions will be awarded much later in life.

In 2014, Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] placed five women into political roles within his cabinet. Of these, only three kept their positions due to [[scandal]]s related to workplace sexism.<ref name=Assman>Stephanie Assman, \"Gender Equality in Japan: The Equal Employment Opportunity Law Revisited,\" The Asia Pacific Journal, Vol. 12, Issue 44, No. 2, 10 November 2014</ref>\n\n==Gender Inequality Index==\nThe [[Gender Inequality Index]] (GII) has Japan ranked as 19<sup>th</sup> out of 188 countries in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/indicators/68606|title={{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> The GII measures three things: [[reproductive health]], [[empowerment]] and the labor market.<ref>HDRO calculations based on data from UN Maternal Mortality Estimation Group (2013), UNDESA (2013a),IPU (2013), Barro and Lee (2013), UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2013) and ILO (2013a).</ref> For this index, where 0 represents full equality and 1 is total inequality, Japan places at 0.116.<ref name=Assman/> \n\nThe Gender Inequality Index confirms that Japan has room for improvement. The country still lacks female voices in [[Japanese parliament|parliament]], compared to similar Asian countries: Japan ranks as fourth lowest within the 51 highest developed countries. In terms of women in the labor force, Japan has the sixth lowest score. However, Japan ranks fairly well when it comes to adolescent birth rate and the percentage of the female population with some [[secondary education]]. Overall, the country is ranked among the countries with the lowest GII because of its high scores in reproductive healthcare and women's education levels.<ref name=HDR/>\n\n==Gender roles through traditions and modern society==\nGender roles in Japan are deeply entwined with the East Asian country's religious and cultural history. Japan's most popular philosophy{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}, [[Confucianism]], enforces gendered rules relating to fashion and public behavior. For instance, from a young age, Japanese men are taught the importance of professional success, higher education, honoring the family name, and providing for the family. In the Confucian tradition, women only receive education through [[middle school]], and are taught to focus on being respectful, learning to cook, and taking care of children. Under this framework, women are not supposed to have a paying job.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nIt was not until 1900 that women in Japan were allowed to earn a [[college degree]]. Women with a career at the expense of focusing on a family have become a target for blame regarding Japan's unusually low [[birthrate]]. While the cultural understanding of women's roles in society has changed, that of men's has not \u2014 honoring the family name and being a [[breadwinner]] are still deeply instilled priorities.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Gender gap in employment and wages==\nThe gender gap in employment and [[wage]]s is becoming an increasingly serious problem, with Japan being the fastest aging country in the [[OECD]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Pursuit of Gender Equality|doi=10.1787/9789264281318-en|year=2017|isbn=9789264281301|df=|author1=OECD}}</ref> In order to maintain its economy, the government must take measures to maintain productivity.

In 2005, Japan had a gender wage gap of 32.8 percent, which decreased to 25.7 percent in 2017. Japan has the third highest wage gap in the [[OECD]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The country's long work hours create an environment that reinforces the wage gap because there is a disproportional difference between how much time men and women spend on paid and unpaid work.<ref name=\":0\" /> On average, women spend 5.5 hours on unpaid housework per day, whereas men only spend one hour.<ref name=\":3\" /> Men do very little housework in Japan, and this is part of the gendered labor division.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Est\u00e9vez-Abe|first=Margarita|date=2012|title=An International Comparison of Institutional Requisites for Gender Equality|journal=Japanese Economy|volume=39|issue=3|pages=77\u201398|doi=10.2753/JES1097-203X390305}}</ref> The Japanese prioritization of seniority hurts the women who want to have children first, as promotions will be awarded much later in life. The number of women in upper-level positions ([[manager]]s, [[Chief executive office|CEOs]], and politicians, and the like) is rather low.
