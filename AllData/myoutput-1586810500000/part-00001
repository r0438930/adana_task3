One World Trade Center (WTC 1) the \"North Tower\" was hit at 8:46&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]] and [[structural integrity and failure|collapsed]] at 10:28&nbsp;a.m. Two World Trade Center (WTC 2) the \"South Tower\" was hit at 9:02&nbsp;a.m. and collapsed at 9:59&nbsp;a.m. The resulting debris severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures, ultimately leading to the collapse of [[7 World Trade Center#Original building (1987\u20132001)|Seven World Trade Center]] at 5:21&nbsp;p.m.\n\n[[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|A total of 2,763 people were killed]] in the collapses, including 2,192 [[civilian]]s, 343 [[firefighter]]s, and 71 [[law enforcement officer]]s as well as all the passengers and crew on the airplanes, which included 147 civilians and the ten hijackers.\n\nIn September 2005, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) published the results of [[NIST World Trade Center Disaster Investigation|its investigation into the collapse]]. The investigators did not find anything substandard in the design of the twin towers, noting that the severity of the attacks was beyond anything experienced in buildings in the past. They determined the fires to be the main cause of the collapses, finding that sagging floors pulled inward on the perimeter columns, causing them to bow and then to buckle. Once the upper section of the building began to move downwards, a total progressive collapse was unavoidable.\n\nThe cleanup of the [[World Trade Center site]] involved round-the-clock operations and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Some surrounding structures that were not hit by the airplanes still sustained significant damage, requiring them to be torn down. Demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings continued even as new construction proceeded on the Twin Towers' replacement, the new [[One World Trade Center]], which was opened in November 2014. \n\n==Background==\nUpon completion, the Twin Towers were briefly the tallest buildings in the world, and at the time of the terrorist attacks they were still in the top five. One World Trade Center (WTC 1) the \"North Tower\" was, at {{convert|1368|ft}}, six feet taller than Two World Trade Center (WTC 2) the \"South Tower\", which stood {{convert|1362|ft|abbr=on}} tall.

In both cases, the section of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed, which allowed the floors above the impact zone to fall onto the undamaged structure below. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction, caused by the sudden rush of air from the upper levels.\n\nDuring each collapse, large portions of the perimeter columns and possibly the cores were left without any lateral support, causing them to fall laterally towards the outside, pushed by the increasing pile of rubble. The result was that the walls peeled off and separated away from the buildings by a large distance (about 500 feet in some cases), hitting other neighboring buildings, and starting fires that would later lead to the collapse of Building 7. Some connections broke as the bolts snapped, leaving many panels randomly scattered.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hamburger|first=Ronald|title=World Trade Center Building Performance Study|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|pages=2\u201327 & 2\u201335|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf|access-date=2006-07-27|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527193541/http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground 11 seconds after the collapse started, and parts of the South Tower after 9 seconds.

Above and below the impact floors, the cores consisted of what were essentially two rigid boxes; the steel in these sections was undamaged and had undergone no significant heating. The section between them, however, had sustained significant damage and, though they were not hot enough to melt it, the fires were weakening the structural steel.\n\nAs a result, the core columns were slowly being crushed, sustaining [[Deformation (engineering)|plastic]] and [[creep (deformation)|creep]] deformation from the weight of floors above. As the top section tried to move downward, however, the hat truss redistributed the load to the perimeter columns. Meanwhile, the perimeter columns and floors were also being weakened by the heat of the fires, and as the floors began to sag they pulled the exterior walls inwards. \"The ensuing loss in vertical load-carrying capacity was confined to a few storeys but extended over the entire cross section of each tower.\"<ref name=\"Starossek2009\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=12}}</ref> In the case of 2 WTC, the eastern face finally buckled, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse.

In both cases, the collapses began with the drop of the upper section through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or ten feet), yet a fall of only half a meter (about 20 inches) would have released the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.<ref name=\"BazantWhy\">{{Cite journal|last1=Ba\u017eant|first1=Z.

During the ''crush-down'' phase, the upper block destroyed the structure below in a progressive series of column failures roughly one story at a time. Each failure began with the impact of the upper block on the columns of the lower section, mediated by a growing layer of rubble consisting mainly of concrete from the floor slabs. The energy from each impact was \"reintroduced into the structure in [the] subsequent impact, ... concentrate[d] in the load-bearing elements directly affected by the impact.\"<ref name=\"Starossek2009b\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=13}}</ref> This buckled the columns of the story immediately beneath the advancing destruction down to the next point of lateral support, usually the floor trusses of the given story. After the columns buckled the block was once again unsupported and fell through the distance of that story, again impacting the columns of the story below, which then buckled in the same way.\n\nThis repeated until the upper block reached the ground and the ''crush-up'' phase began. Here, too, the columns buckled one story at a time, now starting from the bottom. As each story failed, the remaining block fell through the height of the story, onto the next one, which it also crushed, until the roof finally hit the ground.<ref name=\"Bazant07\"/> The process accelerated throughout, and by the end each story was being crushed in less than a tenth of a second.<ref name=\"BazantWhy\"/>\n\n===South Tower collapse===\n{{Main|World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)}}\n[[File:World Trade Center 3 After 9-11 Attacks With Original Building Locations.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Aerial view of the site after the collapse, with locations of the collapsed buildings outlined]]\nAs the fires continued to burn, occupants trapped in the upper floors of the South Tower provided information about conditions to [[9-1-1]] dispatchers.

A significant portion of this fuel was consumed immediately in the ensuing fireballs. The remaining fuel is believed either to have flowed down through the buildings or to have burned off within a few minutes of the aircraft impact. The heat produced by this burning jet fuel does not by itself appear to have been sufficient to initiate the structural collapses. However, as the burning jet fuel spread across several floors of the buildings, it ignited much of the buildings\u2019 contents, causing simultaneous fires across several floors of both buildings. The heat output from these fires is estimated to have been comparable to the power produced by a large commercial power generating station. Over a  period of many minutes, this heat induced additional stresses into the damaged structural frames while simultaneously softening and weakening these frames. This additional loading and the resulting damage were sufficient to induce the collapse of both structures.{{sfn|FEMA(403) Executive Summary|p=2}}}}\n\n===NIST report===\n{{main|The NIST World Trade Center Disaster Investigation}}\n[[Image:Remains of WTC1 and WTC2 after 9-11.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The outer shell of the South Tower (tower 2) of the WTC is still standing at right.

But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near Column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, Column 79 soon buckled \u2013 pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit.  From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building, NIST observed that the building's exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet), noting \"the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of descent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610|title=NIST NCSTAR 1A: Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=November 2008|pages=44\u201346|format=PDF|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121024658/http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610|archive-date=January 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.<ref name=\"ncstar1-a\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the old 7 World Trade Center is remarkable because it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires.<ref name=\"nist-questions\" /> Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the twin towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered.

One World Trade Center (WTC 1) the \"North Tower\" was hit at 8:46&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern time]] and [[structural integrity and failure|collapsed]] at 10:28&nbsp;a.m. Two World Trade Center (WTC 2) the \"South Tower\" was hit at 9:02&nbsp;a.m. and collapsed at 9:59&nbsp;a.m. The resulting debris severely damaged or destroyed more than a dozen other adjacent and nearby structures, ultimately leading to the collapse of [[7 World Trade Center#Original building (1987\u20132001)|Seven World Trade Center]] at 5:21&nbsp;p.m.\n\n[[Casualties of the September 11 attacks|A total of 2,763 people were killed]] in the collapses, including 2,192 [[civilian]]s, 343 [[firefighter]]s, and 71 [[law enforcement officer]]s as well as all the passengers and crew on the airplanes, which included 147 civilians and the ten hijackers.\n\nIn September 2005, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) published the results of [[NIST World Trade Center Disaster Investigation|its investigation into the collapse]]. The investigators did not find anything substandard in the design of the twin towers, noting that the severity of the attacks was beyond anything experienced in buildings in the past. They determined the fires to be the main cause of the collapses, finding that sagging floors pulled inward on the perimeter columns, causing them to bow and then to buckle. Once the upper section of the building began to move downwards, a total progressive collapse was unavoidable.\n\nThe cleanup of the [[World Trade Center site]] involved round-the-clock operations and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.  Some surrounding structures that were not hit by the airplanes still sustained significant damage, requiring them to be torn down. Demolition of the surrounding damaged buildings continued even as new construction proceeded on the Twin Towers' replacement, the new [[One World Trade Center]], which was opened in November 2014. \n\n==Background==\nUpon completion, the Twin Towers were briefly the tallest buildings in the world, and at the time of the terrorist attacks they were still in the top five. One World Trade Center (WTC 1) the \"North Tower\" was, at {{convert|1368|ft}}, six feet taller than Two World Trade Center (WTC 2) the \"South Tower\", which stood {{convert|1362|ft|abbr=on}} tall.

The trusses connected to the perimeter at alternate columns, and were therefore on {{convert|6.8|ft|m|adj=on}} centers. The top chords of the trusses were bolted to seats welded to the spandrels on the perimeter side and a channel welded to interior box columns on the core side. The floors were connected to the perimeter spandrel plates with [[Viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] dampers, which helped reduce the amount of sway felt by building occupants.<ref name=\"NIST 1-1\"/> \n\nThe towers also incorporated a \"hat truss\" or \"outrigger truss\" located between the 107th and 110th floors, which consisted of six trusses along the long axis of core and four along the short axis.<ref name=\"NIST structure\"/> This truss system allowed optimized load redistribution of floor diaphragms between the perimeter and core, with improved performance between the different materials of flexible steel and rigid concrete allowing the moment frames to transfer sway into compression on the core, which also mostly supported the transmission tower.

In both cases, the section of the building that had been damaged by the airplanes failed, which allowed the floors above the impact zone to fall onto the undamaged structure below. As the collapse progressed, dust and debris could be seen shooting out of the windows several floors below the advancing destruction, caused by the sudden rush of air from the upper levels.\n\nDuring each collapse, large portions of the perimeter columns and possibly the cores were left without any lateral support, causing them to fall laterally towards the outside, pushed by the increasing pile of rubble. The result was that the walls peeled off and separated away from the buildings by a large distance (about 500 feet in some cases), hitting other neighboring buildings, and starting fires that would later lead to the collapse of Building 7. Some connections broke as the bolts snapped, leaving many panels randomly scattered.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hamburger|first=Ronald|title=World Trade Center Building Performance Study|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency|pages=2\u201327 & 2\u201335|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf|access-date=2006-07-27|display-authors=etal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527193541/http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/fema403_ch2.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The first fragments of the outer walls of the collapsed North Tower struck the ground 11 seconds after the collapse started, and parts of the South Tower after 9 seconds.

Above and below the impact floors, the cores consisted of what were essentially two rigid boxes; the steel in these sections was undamaged and had undergone no significant heating. The section between them, however, had sustained significant damage and, though they were not hot enough to melt it, the fires were weakening the structural steel.\n\nAs a result, the core columns were slowly being crushed, sustaining [[Deformation (engineering)|plastic]] and [[creep (deformation)|creep]] deformation from the weight of floors above. As the top section tried to move downward, however, the hat truss redistributed the load to the perimeter columns. Meanwhile, the perimeter columns and floors were also being weakened by the heat of the fires, and as the floors began to sag they pulled the exterior walls inwards. \"The ensuing loss in vertical load-carrying capacity was confined to a few storeys but extended over the entire cross section of each tower.\"<ref name=\"Starossek2009\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=12}}</ref> In the case of 2 WTC, the eastern face finally buckled, transferring its loads back to the failing core through the hat truss and initiating the collapse.

In both cases, the collapses began with the drop of the upper section through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or ten feet), yet a fall of only half a meter (about 20 inches) would have released the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.<ref name=\"BazantWhy\">{{Cite journal|last1=Ba\u017eant|first1=Z.

During the ''crush-down'' phase, the upper block destroyed the structure below in a progressive series of column failures roughly one story at a time. Each failure began with the impact of the upper block on the columns of the lower section, mediated by a growing layer of rubble consisting mainly of concrete from the floor slabs. The energy from each impact was \"reintroduced into the structure in [the] subsequent impact, ... concentrate[d] in the load-bearing elements directly affected by the impact.\"<ref name=\"Starossek2009b\">{{cite book |last1=Starossek |first1=Uwe |title=Progressive Collapse of Structures |date=2009 |publisher=Thomas Telford Publishing |isbn=9780727736109 |page=13}}</ref> This buckled the columns of the story immediately beneath the advancing destruction down to the next point of lateral support, usually the floor trusses of the given story.

A significant portion of this fuel was consumed immediately in the ensuing fireballs. The remaining fuel is believed either to have flowed down through the buildings or to have burned off within a few minutes of the aircraft impact. The heat produced by this burning jet fuel does not by itself appear to have been sufficient to initiate the structural collapses. However, as the burning jet fuel spread across several floors of the buildings, it ignited much of the buildings\u2019 contents, causing simultaneous fires across several floors of both buildings. The heat output from these fires is estimated to have been comparable to the power produced by a large commercial power generating station. Over a  period of many minutes, this heat induced additional stresses into the damaged structural frames while simultaneously softening and weakening these frames. This additional loading and the resulting damage were sufficient to induce the collapse of both structures.{{sfn|FEMA(403) Executive Summary|p=2}}}}\n\n===NIST report===\n{{main|The NIST World Trade Center Disaster Investigation}}\n[[Image:Remains of WTC1 and WTC2 after 9-11.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The outer shell of the South Tower (tower 2) of the WTC is still standing at right.

But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing floor beams near Column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, Column 79 soon buckled \u2013 pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit.  From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building, NIST observed that the building's exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet), noting \"the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of descent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610|title=NIST NCSTAR 1A: Final Report on the Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=November 2008|pages=44\u201346|format=PDF|access-date=July 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121024658/http://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=861610|archive-date=January 21, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.<ref name=\"ncstar1-a\"/>\n\nThe collapse of the old 7 World Trade Center is remarkable because it was the first known instance of a tall building collapsing primarily as a result of uncontrolled fires.<ref name=\"nist-questions\" /> Based on its investigation, NIST reiterated several recommendations it had made in its earlier report on the collapse of the twin towers, and urged immediate action on a further recommendation: that fire resistance should be evaluated under the assumption that sprinklers are unavailable; and that the effects of thermal expansion on floor support systems be considered. Recognizing that current building codes are drawn to prevent loss of life rather than building collapse, the main point of NIST's recommendations is that buildings should not collapse from fire even if sprinklers are unavailable.<ref name=\"ncstar1-a\"/>\n\n===Other investigations===\nIn 2003, Asif Usmani, Professor of Structural Engineering at [[University of Edinburgh]], published a paper with two colleagues.
