There have been many legends over the centuries of descent from the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] after groups converted to Christianity and Islam. Hence the tribal name [[Yusufzai]] in Pashto translates to the \"son of Joseph\". A similar story is told by many historians, including the 14th century [[Ibn Battuta]] and 16th century [[Firishta|Ferishta]].<ref name=\"Ferishta\"/>\n\nOne conflicting issue in the belief that the Pashtuns descend from the [[Israelites]] is that the Ten Lost Tribes were exiled by the ruler of [[Assyria]], while ''Maghzan-e-Afghani'' says they were permitted by the ruler to go east to Afghanistan. This inconsistency can be explained by the fact that Persia acquired the lands of the ancient Assyrian Empire when it conquered the Empire of the Medes and Chaldean [[Babylonia]], which had conquered Assyria decades earlier.

It is mainly performed in and around the [[Peshawar]] area of Pakistan.]]\nPashtun culture is mostly based on Pashtunwali and the usage of the Pashto language. Pre-Islamic traditions, dating back to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s defeat of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 330&nbsp;BC, possibly survived in the form of [[Khattak Dance|traditional dances]], while literary styles and music reflect influence from the [[Culture of Iran|Persian tradition]] and regional [[musical instrument]]s fused with localised variants and interpretation. Pashtun culture is a unique blend of native customs with some influences from [[South Asia|South]] and Western Asia. Like other Muslims, Pashtuns celebrate ''[[Ramadan]]'' and ''[[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid al-Fitr]]''. Some also celebrate ''[[Norouz|Nouruz]]'', which is the Persian new year dating to pre-Islamic period.\n\n=== Pashtunwali ===\n{{Main|Pashtunwali}}\n[[Pashtunwali]] (or ''Pakhtunwali'') refers to an ancient self-governing tribal system that regulates nearly all aspects of Pashtun life ranging from community to personal level. One of the better known tenets is ''Melmastia'', hospitality and asylum to all guests seeking help. Perceived injustice calls for ''Badal'', swift [[revenge]]. Many aspects promote peaceful co-existence, such as ''Nanawati'', the humble admission of guilt for a wrong committed, which should result in automatic forgiveness from the wronged party. These and other basic precepts of Pashtunwali continue to be followed by many Pashtuns, especially in rural areas.\n\nAnother prominent Pashtun institution is the ''[[loya jirga]]'' or 'grand council' of elected [[elder (administrative title)|elders]]. Most decisions in tribal life are made by members of the [[jirga]], which has been the main institution of authority that the largely egalitarian Pashtuns willingly acknowledge as a viable governing body.<ref name=\"HRW\">{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/press/2002/04/qna-loyagirga.htm|title=Q & A on Afghanistan's Loya Jirga Process|accessdate=10 October 2006|work=hrw.org|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Pashto literature and poetry ===\n{{Main|Pashto literature and poetry}}\n[[File:Mahmud Tarzi in 1920-cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mahmud Tarzi]], son of [[Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi]], became the pioneer of [[Media of Afghanistan|Afghan journalism]].]]\nThe majority of Pashtuns use [[Pashto language|Pashto]] as their [[first language|native tongue]], believed to belong to the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] [[language family]],<ref name=\"Iranica\">[[Nicholas Sims-Williams]], [http://www.iranica.com/articles/eastern-iranian-languages Eastern Iranian languages], in Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, Online Edition, 2010.

Pashto has [[national language|national status]] in Afghanistan and [[regional language|regional status]] in neighboring Pakistan. In addition to their native tongue, many Pashtuns are fluent in Urdu, [[Dari language|Dari]], and English. Throughout their history, poets, prophets, kings and warriors have been among the most revered members of Pashtun society.

Perhaps the most common form of artistic expression can be seen in the various forms of Pashtun dances. One of the most prominent dances is ''[[Attan]]'', which has ancient roots. A rigorous exercise, Attan is performed as musicians play various native instruments including the ''[[dhol]]'' (drums), ''[[tabla]]s'' (percussions), ''[[Rubab (instrument)|rubab]]'' (a [[bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]]), and ''toola'' (wooden flute). With a rapid circular motion, dancers perform until no one is left dancing, similar to [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Mevlevi|whirling dervishes]]. Numerous other dances are affiliated with various tribes notably from Pakistan including the ''Khattak Wal Atanrh'' (eponymously named after the [[Khattak]] tribe), ''Mahsood Wal Atanrh'' (which, in modern times, involves the juggling of loaded rifles), and ''Waziro Atanrh'' among others. A sub-type of the ''Khattak Wal Atanrh'' known as the ''Braghoni'' involves the use of up to three swords and requires great skill. Young women and girls often entertain at weddings with the ''Tumbal'' ([[Dayereh]]).\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{Further|Sport in Afghanistan|Sport in Pakistan}}\nThe [[Afghanistan national cricket team]], which is dominated by Pashtun players, was formed in the early 2000s.

The national level includes women such as [[Nazo Tokhi]] (Nazo Anaa), Zarghona Anaa, and [[Malalai Anaa|Malalai of Maiwand]]. Nazo Anaa was a prominent 17th century Pashto poet and an educated Pashtun woman who eventually became the \"Mother of Afghan Nationalism\" after gaining authority through her poetry and upholding of the Pashtunwali code.

There have been many legends over the centuries of descent from the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] after groups converted to Christianity and Islam.

A similar story is told by many historians, including the 14th century [[Ibn Battuta]] and 16th century [[Firishta|Ferishta]].<ref name=\"Ferishta\"/>\n\nOne conflicting issue in the belief that the Pashtuns descend from the [[Israelites]] is that the Ten Lost Tribes were exiled by the ruler of [[Assyria]], while ''Maghzan-e-Afghani'' says they were permitted by the ruler to go east to Afghanistan. This inconsistency can be explained by the fact that Persia acquired the lands of the ancient Assyrian Empire when it conquered the Empire of the Medes and Chaldean [[Babylonia]], which had conquered Assyria decades earlier. But no ancient author mentions such a transfer of Israelites further east, or no ancient extra-Biblical texts refer to the Ten Lost Tribes at all.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Modern era ===\n{{See also|Pashtun nationalism}}\n[[File:Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Gandhi in 1940.jpg|thumb|upright|Leader of the [[nonviolence|non-violent]] [[Khudai Khidmatgar]], also referred to as \"the Red shirts\" movement, [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan|Bacha Khan]], standing with [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]]]]\nTheir modern past stretches back to the [[Delhi Sultanate]], particularly the [[Hotak dynasty]] and the [[Durrani Empire]].

By the 1950s a popular call for [[Pashtunistan]] began to be heard in Afghanistan and the new state of Pakistan. This led to bad relations between the two nations. The Afghan monarchy ended when [[List of Presidents of Afghanistan|President]] [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|Daoud Khan]] seized control of Afghanistan from his cousin Zahir Shah in 1973, which opened doors for a [[proxy war]] by neighbors and the rise of [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|Marxism]].

[[Mujahideen]] commanders began being recruited in neighboring Pakistan for a [[guerrilla warfare]] against the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]]. In 1979, the [[Soviet Union]] invaded its southern neighbor Afghanistan in order to defeat a rising insurgency.

Thus, tribes that speak disparate yet mutually intelligible dialects of Pashto acknowledge each other as ethnic Pashtuns and even subscribe to certain dialects as \"proper\", such as the '''Pukhto''' spoken by the [[Yusufzai|Yousafzais]], [[Gigyani tribe]], [[Afridi]] and other tribes in [[Peshawar]] and the '''Pashto''' spoken by the [[Kakar]], [[Wazir (Pashtun tribe)|Wazir]], [[Ghilji|Khilji]] and [[Durrani]]s in [[Kandahar]].

These communities are often considered overlapping groups or are simply assigned to the ethno-linguistic group that corresponds to their geographic location and mother tongue. The [[Niazi]] is one of these group.\n\nClaimants of Pashtun heritage in South Asia have mixed with local Muslim populations and are referred to as ''Pathan,'' the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] form of ''Pashtun''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2003/cseries.htm|title=Memons, Khojas, Cheliyas, Moplahs&nbsp;...

They are believed to have been bilingual in Pashto and Urdu until the mid-19th century. Some Urdu-speaking [[Muhajir people]] of India claiming descent from Pashtuns began moving to Pakistan in 1947.

Pre-Islamic traditions, dating back to [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s defeat of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 330&nbsp;BC, possibly survived in the form of [[Khattak Dance|traditional dances]], while literary styles and music reflect influence from the [[Culture of Iran|Persian tradition]] and regional [[musical instrument]]s fused with localised variants and interpretation. Pashtun culture is a unique blend of native customs with some influences from [[South Asia|South]] and Western Asia. Like other Muslims, Pashtuns celebrate ''[[Ramadan]]'' and ''[[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid al-Fitr]]''.

One of the better known tenets is ''Melmastia'', hospitality and asylum to all guests seeking help. Perceived injustice calls for ''Badal'', swift [[revenge]]. Many aspects promote peaceful co-existence, such as ''Nanawati'', the humble admission of guilt for a wrong committed, which should result in automatic forgiveness from the wronged party. These and other basic precepts of Pashtunwali continue to be followed by many Pashtuns, especially in rural areas.\n\nAnother prominent Pashtun institution is the ''[[loya jirga]]'' or 'grand council' of elected [[elder (administrative title)|elders]].

With a rapid circular motion, dancers perform until no one is left dancing, similar to [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Mevlevi|whirling dervishes]]. Numerous other dances are affiliated with various tribes notably from Pakistan including the ''Khattak Wal Atanrh'' (eponymously named after the [[Khattak]] tribe), ''Mahsood Wal Atanrh'' (which, in modern times, involves the juggling of loaded rifles), and ''Waziro Atanrh'' among others.
