\"'''Sugar, Sugar'''\" is a song written by [[Jeff Barry]] and [[Andy Kim]]. It was originally recorded by the [[virtual band|cartoon band]] [[the Archies]]. This version reached No. 1 in the US on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in 1969 and remained there for four weeks. It was also No.1 on the [[UK Singles chart]] in that same year for eight weeks. The song became a hit again in 1970 when [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Wilson Pickett]] took it back onto the charts [[#Wilson Pickett version|with his own version]].

==The Archies version==
===Background===
Produced by Jeff Barry, the Archies' \"Sugar, Sugar\" was originally released on the album ''[[Everything's Archie (album)|Everything's Archie]].'' The album was the product of a group of [[studio musician]]s managed by [[Don Kirshner]]. [[Ron Dante]]'s lead vocals were accompanied by those of [[Toni Wine]] and Andy Kim. Together they provided the voices of the Archies using [[multitrack recording|multitracking]]. The song was initially released in late May 1969 on the Calendar label (the same label as with the two previous Archies singles), achieving moderate chart success in the early summer in some radio markets. When the song was re-released in mid-July 1969 on the Kirshner label, it attained massive success nationwide by the late summer/early fall.<ref>[https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=761616330 npr.org]</ref>

Upon the song's initial release, Kirshner had promotion men play it for radio station personnel without revealing the group's name, as the Archies' previous single, \"Feelin' So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y-D.O.O)\", had only reached No. 53 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100|title=Top 100 Songs {{!}} Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Archies-Feelin-So-Good-SKOOBY-DOO/master/456550|title=The Archies - Feelin' So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y-D.O.O)|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> Only after most of the DJs liked the song were they told that it was performed by a \"mystery group\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/26/sugar-sugar-singer-ron-dante-discusses-archies-ban/|title=Archies singer Ron Dante: ‘Cartoon Band Man’|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

===Reception===
After topping the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM 100]]'' national singles chart in Canada on September 13, 1969 (where it spent three weeks), the single went on to spend four weeks at the top of the U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100 from September 20 through October 11.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> It spent a total of 22 weeks in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and was the 1969 US [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 1969|number-one single of the year]]. The song was [[RIAA certification|classified by the RIAA]] as a gold record in August 1969,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=Gold & Platinum: Searchable database |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=November 12, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007 |df= }}<br/>Search ''Artist: Archies''</ref> meaning it had sold one million units (the gold threshold was later lowered to 500,000).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-14/business/fi-188_1_singles-riaa-platinum|title=New Golden Rule: 500,000 Sales Mark for All Singles|last=Grein|first=Paul|date=May 14, 1989|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}</ref> It ranked #81 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s \"Hot 100 60th Anniversary\" chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100-60th-anniversary|title=HOT 100 60TH ANNIVERSARY|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=September 30, 2019}}</ref>

Although official [[music recording sales certification]]s were not introduced in the United Kingdom until the [[British Phonographic Industry]] was formed in 1973, ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc]]'' introduced an initiative in 1959 to present a gold record to singles that had sold over one million units.<ref name=\"Disc\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Alan|title=UK First Charts & Silver Discs|url=http://www.davemcaleer.com/page17.htm|work=[[Dave McAleer]]'s website|access-date=November 4, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902235451/http://www.davemcaleer.com/page17.htm|archive-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref> The awards relied on record companies correctly compiling and supplying sales information, and \"Sugar, Sugar\" was erroneously awarded a gold disc in January 1970 despite having sold approximately 945,000 copies, as [[RCA Records]] had informed ''Disc'' that one million copies had been shipped, but not all were sold.<ref name=\"Disc\"/><ref name=\"Million\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/stats-million_sellers.php|title=Stats and Facts: Million Sellers|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=July 19, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416145908/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/stats-million_sellers.php|archivedate=April 16, 2008}}</ref> Nevertheless, following the introduction of [[music download]]s in 2004, \"Sugar, Sugar\" passed the one-million sales mark.<ref name=\"MW\">{{cite journal|date=September 6, 2010|title=Digital generation pushes the oldies into the million-sellers club|journal=[[Music Week]]}}</ref>

\"'''Sugar, Sugar'''\" is a song written by [[Jeff Barry]] and [[Andy Kim]]. It was originally recorded by the [[virtual band|cartoon band]] [[the Archies]]. This version reached No. 1 in the US on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in 1969 and remained there for four weeks. It was also No.1 on the [[UK Singles chart]] in that same year for eight weeks. The song became a hit again in 1970 when [[rhythm and blues]] and [[soul music|soul]] singer [[Wilson Pickett]] took it back onto the charts [[#Wilson Pickett version|with his own version]].

==The Archies version==
===Background===
Produced by Jeff Barry, the Archies' \"Sugar, Sugar\" was originally released on the album ''[[Everything's Archie (album)|Everything's Archie]].'' The album was the product of a group of [[studio musician]]s managed by [[Don Kirshner]]. [[Ron Dante]]'s lead vocals were accompanied by those of [[Toni Wine]] and Andy Kim. Together they provided the voices of the Archies using [[multitrack recording|multitracking]]. The song was initially released in late May 1969 on the Calendar label (the same label as with the two previous Archies singles), achieving moderate chart success in the early summer in some radio markets. When the song was re-released in mid-July 1969 on the Kirshner label, it attained massive success nationwide by the late summer/early fall.<ref>[https://text.npr.org/s.php?sId=761616330 npr.org]</ref>

Upon the song's initial release, Kirshner had promotion men play it for radio station personnel without revealing the group's name, as the Archies' previous single, \"Feelin' So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y-D.O.O)\", had only reached No. 53 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100|title=Top 100 Songs {{!}} Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Archies-Feelin-So-Good-SKOOBY-DOO/master/456550|title=The Archies - Feelin' So Good (S.K.O.O.B.Y-D.O.O)|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> Only after most of the DJs liked the song were they told that it was performed by a \"mystery group\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/mar/26/sugar-sugar-singer-ron-dante-discusses-archies-ban/|title=Archies singer Ron Dante: ‘Cartoon Band Man’|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>

Although official [[music recording sales certification]]s were not introduced in the United Kingdom until the [[British Phonographic Industry]] was formed in 1973, ''[[Disc (magazine)|Disc]]'' introduced an initiative in 1959 to present a gold record to singles that had sold over one million units.<ref name=\"Disc\">{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Alan|title=UK First Charts & Silver Discs|url=http://www.davemcaleer.com/page17.htm|work=[[Dave McAleer]]'s website|access-date=November 4, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902235451/http://www.davemcaleer.com/page17.htm|archive-date=September 2, 2011}}</ref> The awards relied on record companies correctly compiling and supplying sales information, and \"Sugar, Sugar\" was erroneously awarded a gold disc in January 1970 despite having sold approximately 945,000 copies, as [[RCA Records]] had informed ''Disc'' that one million copies had been shipped, but not all were sold.<ref name=\"Disc\"/><ref name=\"Million\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/stats-million_sellers.php|title=Stats and Facts: Million Sellers|publisher=[[The Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=July 19, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416145908/http://www.theofficialcharts.com/stats-million_sellers.php|archivedate=April 16, 2008}}</ref> Nevertheless, following the introduction of [[music download]]s in 2004, \"Sugar, Sugar\" passed the one-million sales mark.<ref name=\"MW\">{{cite journal|date=September 6, 2010|title=Digital generation pushes the oldies into the million-sellers club|journal=[[Music Week]]}}</ref>

==Success as a comedy producer==
[[File:Hal Roach Laugh Factory (1959).jpg|thumb|The Hal Roach Studios (1919–1963) in 1959]]
Unable to expand his studios in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] because of [[zoning]], Roach purchased what became the Hal Roach Studios from [[Harry Culver]] in [[Culver City, California]]. During the 1920s and 1930s, he employed Lloyd (his top money-maker until his departure in 1923), [[Will Rogers]], [[Max Davidson]], the [[Our Gang]] children, [[Charley Chase]], [[Harry Langdon]], [[Thelma Todd]], [[ZaSu Pitts]], [[Lupe Vélez]], [[Patsy Kelly]] and, most famously, [[Laurel and Hardy]]. During the 1920s, Roach's biggest rival was producer [[Mack Sennett]]. In 1925, Roach hired away Sennett's supervising director, [[F. Richard Jones]].

Roach released his films through [[Pathé Exchange]] until 1927, when he went to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. He converted his silent movie studio to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts in early 1929. In the days before [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], foreign language versions of the Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film in the Spanish, French, and sometimes Italian and German languages. Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang children (some of whom had barely begun school) were required to recite the foreign dialogue [[phonetically]], often working from blackboards hidden off camera.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

In 1931, with the release of the Laurel & Hardy film ''[[Pardon Us]]'', Roach began producing occasional full-length features alongside the short product. Short subjects became less profitable and were phased out by 1936, save for the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series. An ''Our Gang'' feature film ''[[General Spanky]]'' did not do as well as expected; Roach continued making the shorts for MGM.

In 1937, Roach conceived a joint business venture partnering with [[Vittorio Mussolini]], son of fascist Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], to form a production company called \"R.A.M\" (Roach and Mussolini). Roach claimed the scheme involved Italian bankers (not the government) providing US$6 million that would enable Roach's studio to produce a series of 12 films. Eight would be for Italian screening only whilst the remaining four would receive world distribution.  The first film for Italy was to be a feature film of the opera ''[[Rigoletto]]''.<ref> Graham, Sheila ''Hollywood Today'' ''Hal Roach Defends Mussolini Deal'' p. 4  ''The Milwaukee Journal'' 5 October 1937</ref>

This proposed business alliance with Mussolini caused MGM to intervene and force Roach to pay his way out of the venture. This embarrassment, coupled with the underperformance of much of Roach's new feature product (save for Laurel & Hardy films and the odd non-L&H hit such as 1937's ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]''), led to the end of Roach's relationship with MGM.<ref name=\"MGMsale\">Ward, Richard Lewis (2005). ''A History of Hal Roach Studios''. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press. Pg. 97–102, 116, 225. {{ISBN|0-8093-2637-X}}.</ref> In May 1938, Roach ended his distribution contract with MGM, selling them the production rights to, and actors' contracts for ''Our Gang'' in the process, and signed with [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"MGMsale\" />

From 1937 to 1940, Roach concentrated on producing glossy features, abandoning low comedy almost completely. Most of his new films were either sophisticated farces (like ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'', 1937, and ''[[The Housekeeper's Daughter]]'', 1939) or rugged action fare (like ''[[Captain Fury]]'', 1939, and ''[[One Million B.C.]]'', 1940). Roach's one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), in which actors [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] played the leading roles. The Laurel and Hardy comedies, once the Roach studio's biggest drawing cards, were now the studio's ''least'' important product and were phased out altogether in 1940.

In 1940, Roach experimented with medium-length [[featurette]]s, running 40 to 50 minutes each. He contended that these \"[[Hal Roach's Streamliners|streamliners]]\", as he called them, would be useful in [[double-feature]] situations where the main attraction was a longer-length epic. Exhibitors agreed with him and used Roach's mini-features to balance top-heavy double bills. United Artists continued to release Roach's streamliners through 1943. By this time, Roach no longer had a resident company of comedy stars and cast his films with familiar featured players ([[William Tracy]] and [[Joe Sawyer]], [[Johnny Downs]], [[Jean Porter (actress)|Jean Porter]], [[Frank Faylen]], [[William Bendix]], [[George E. Stone]], etc.).

==World War II and television==
Hal Roach, Sr., commissioned in the US Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927<ref> p. 125  Ward, Richard Lewis ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'' SIU Press, 15 Aug 2006</ref> was called back to active military duty in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] in June 1942, at age 50.  The studio output he oversaw in uniform was converted from entertainment featurettes to military [[training film]]s. The studios were leased to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] made 400 training, morale and [[propaganda films]] at \"Fort Roach\". Members of the unit included [[Ronald W. Reagan]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. After the war the government returned the studio to Roach, with millions of dollars of improvements.<ref name=\"betancourt201203\">{{cite web | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html | title=World War II: The Movie | work=Air & Space | date=March 2012 | accessdate=September 27, 2013 | author=Betancourt, Mark}}</ref>

In 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star [[Bebe Daniels]] as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to go to an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in [[Cinecolor]], although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with [[Hal Roach Jr.]], producing series such as ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', ''[[Steve Donovan, Western Marshal]]'', ''[[Racket Squad]]'', ''[[The Public Defender (TV series)|The Public Defender]]'', ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'', ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]'' and ''[[My Little Margie]]'', and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[The Life of Riley]]'' and ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood's annual output of feature movies.<ref>\"Hollywood Is Humming\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 29, 1951.</ref>

Recognizing the value of his film library, in 1943 Roach began licensing revivals of his sound-era productions for theatrical and home-movie distribution. Roach's films were also early arrivals on television. His [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies were successful in [[television syndication]], as were the ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies produced from 1927-1938, for which in 1949 Roach had bought back the rights from MGM and re-branded for television as \"The Little Rascals\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | title=Little Rascals History | accessdate=2017-02-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119052141/http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | archive-date=November 19, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He thus became one of the first significant film producers to venture into television.

==Later years==
In 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, [[Hal Roach Jr.]], and retired from active production. The younger Roach lacked much of his father's business acumen and soon lost the studio to creditors. It was finally shut down in 1961.

For two more decades, Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96.

In 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an [[honorary Academy Award]]. Former ''Our Gang'' members [[Jackie Cooper]] and [[George McFarland|George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior. An additional [[Our Gang]] member, [[Ernie Morrison]], was amongst the crowd and started the standing ovation for Hal Roach. Cooper's gratitude towards Roach was especially notable. Years earlier Cooper had been the youngest Academy Award nominee ever for his performance in [[Skippy (1931 movie)|Skippy]] when he had been under contract with Roach. Although Paramount had paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper's services in that film, Roach paid Cooper only his standard salary of $50 per week''.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Please Don't Shoot My Dog|last=Cooper|first=Jackie|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1982|isbn=0-425-05306-7|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9 9, 32, 40–42, 44, 54–61]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9}}</ref>

On 21 January 1992, Roach was a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', just days after his 100th birthday, where he recounted experiences with such stars as [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Jean Harlow]]; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance. In February 1992, Roach travelled to [[Berlin]] to receive the honorary award of the ''Berlinale Kamera'' for Lifetime Achievement at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

On March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the [[64th Academy Awards]] ceremony, hosted by [[Billy Crystal]]. When Roach rose from the audience for a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip \"I think that's appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.\"

==Death==
Hal Roach died in his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]], from [[pneumonia]], on November 2, 1992, just two months before his 101st birthday. He had married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than 20 years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964), and Elizabeth (died in 1946). He also outlived many of the children who starred in his films.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\"/> Roach is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Elmira, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[Elmira, New York]], where he grew up.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=_-cZDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=hal+roach+woodlawn+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY-7Gw7YTfAhWRCHwKHVHBC8QQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=hal%20roach%20woodlawn%20cemetery&f=false ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'']</ref>

==Hal Roach Studios==
The 14.5 acre (58,680 m²) studio once known as \"The Lot of Fun\", containing 55 buildings, was demolished in 1963 (despite tentative plans to reopen the facilities as \"Landmark Studios\"), after one last movie, ''[[Dime with a Halo]]'' (1963), with [[BarBara Luna|Barbara Luna]], was made there in 1963 by [[Boris Sagal]] (to Sagal, the forlorn facility looked like a run-down Mexican city).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531142915/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie |archivedate=May 31, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}{{failed verification|date=September 2016}}</ref>

They were replaced by light industrial buildings, businesses, and an automobile dealership. Today, Culver City's \"Landmark Street\" runs down what was the middle of the old studio lot, with the two original sound stages having been located on the north side of Landmark Street, and the [[backlot]]/city street sets had been located at the eastern end of Landmark Street. A plaque sits in a small park across from the studio's location, placed there by [[The Sons of the Desert]].<ref>[http://www.culvercity.org/en/Visitors/CulverCityHistory/HalRoachStudios Culver City History: Hal Roach Studios] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315022518/http://www.culvercity.org/en/Visitors/CulverCityHistory/HalRoachStudios |date=March 15, 2011 }}, culvercity.org. Retrieved August 23, 2008</ref>

Most of the film library was bought in 1971 by a Canadian company that adopted the \"Hal Roach Studios\" name. It primarily handled the business of keeping the library in the public eye and licensing products based upon the classic film series.

In 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the controversial business of [[film colorization]]. Buying a fifty percent interest in [[Wilson Markle]]'s Colorization Inc, it began creating digitally colored versions of several Laurel and Hardy features, the [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), and other popular films. In the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios produced ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Roach's old distributor in the 1930s. During the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios distributed its classic film library, as well as films in the [[public domain]], on home video. 1986 saw the merger of Hal Roach Studios with the production firm of [[Robert Halmi]] into ''Qintex Entertainment'', named after Australian investor [[Qintex]]. Under this name, Qintex collaborated with [[Universal Television]] to distribute ''[[The New Leave It To Beaver]]'' in syndication and the Canadian drama ''[[T. and T.]]'', starring [[Mr. T]], with Canadian animation house [[Nelvana]]. However, Qintex's Australian parent ended up collapsing under a crushing debtload, forcing Qintex Entertainment into bankruptcy.

In the years that followed, the Roach company changed hands several more times. Independent television producer Robert Halmi (who had merged his company with Roach) bought the company in the early 1990s after the bankruptcy of Qintex, and it became [[RHI Entertainment]]. A short time later, this successor company was acquired by [[Hallmark Entertainment]] in 1994, but Halmi, [[Robert Halmi Jr.]] and affiliates of [[Kelso & Company]] reacquired the company in 2006. Hallmark Entertainment was absorbed into RHI Entertainment (with [[Vivendi]] as the current home video output partner).

In that same decade, a new incarnation of Hal Roach Studios (operated by the Roach Trust) was established, and today this new version of the company has released classic films on DVD, many of which are from Roach's own archival prints of his films, while others are public domain titles mastered from the best available [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] elements.

He is remembered today for producing a number of successes including the [[Laurel and Hardy]] franchise, the film's of entertainer [[Charley Chase]] and ''[[Our Gang]]'' film comedy series.

==Early life and career==
Hal Roach was born in [[Elmira, New York]], to Charles Henry Roach, whose father was born in [[Wicklow]], [[Ireland]], and Mabel Gertrude Bally, her father John Bally being from [[Switzerland]].<ref>[[Randy Skretvedt|Skretvedt, Randy]] (2016). ''LAUREL AND HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES''. Bonaventure Press. p.608</ref> A presentation by the great American [[List of humorists|humorist]] [[Mark Twain]] impressed Roach as a young [[Primary education|grade school]] student.

After an adventurous youth that took him to [[Alaska]], Hal Roach arrived in [[Hollywood, California]], in 1912 and began working as an [[Extra (actor)|extra]] in [[silent film]]s. Upon coming into an inheritance, he began producing [[short film|short film comedies]] in 1915 with his friend [[Harold Lloyd]], who portrayed a character known as Lonesome Luke.

In September 1916, Roach married actress [[Marguerite Nichols]]. They had two children, [[Hal Roach Jr.|Hal Jr.]] (June 15, 1918 – March 29, 1972), who followed his father as a producer and director, and Margaret M. Roach (March 15, 1921 – November 22, 1964), who worked as an actress in the 1930s and 1940s.

The studios were leased to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] made 400 training, morale and [[propaganda films]] at \"Fort Roach\". Members of the unit included [[Ronald W. Reagan]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. After the war the government returned the studio to Roach, with millions of dollars of improvements.<ref name=\"betancourt201203\">{{cite web | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html | title=World War II: The Movie | work=Air & Space | date=March 2012 | accessdate=September 27, 2013 | author=Betancourt, Mark}}</ref>

In 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star [[Bebe Daniels]] as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to go to an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in [[Cinecolor]], although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with [[Hal Roach Jr.]], producing series such as ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', ''[[Steve Donovan, Western Marshal]]'', ''[[Racket Squad]]'', ''[[The Public Defender (TV series)|The Public Defender]]'', ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'', ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]'' and ''[[My Little Margie]]'', and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[The Life of Riley]]'' and ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood's annual output of feature movies.<ref>\"Hollywood Is Humming\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 29, 1951.</ref>

Recognizing the value of his film library, in 1943 Roach began licensing revivals of his sound-era productions for theatrical and home-movie distribution. Roach's films were also early arrivals on television. His [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies were successful in [[television syndication]], as were the ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies produced from 1927-1938, for which in 1949 Roach had bought back the rights from MGM and re-branded for television as \"The Little Rascals\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | title=Little Rascals History | accessdate=2017-02-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119052141/http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | archive-date=November 19, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He thus became one of the first significant film producers to venture into television.

==Later years==
In 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, [[Hal Roach Jr.]], and retired from active production. The younger Roach lacked much of his father's business acumen and soon lost the studio to creditors. It was finally shut down in 1961.

For two more decades, Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96.

In 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an [[honorary Academy Award]]. Former ''Our Gang'' members [[Jackie Cooper]] and [[George McFarland|George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior. An additional [[Our Gang]] member, [[Ernie Morrison]], was amongst the crowd and started the standing ovation for Hal Roach. Cooper's gratitude towards Roach was especially notable. Years earlier Cooper had been the youngest Academy Award nominee ever for his performance in [[Skippy (1931 movie)|Skippy]] when he had been under contract with Roach. Although Paramount had paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper's services in that film, Roach paid Cooper only his standard salary of $50 per week''.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Please Don't Shoot My Dog|last=Cooper|first=Jackie|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1982|isbn=0-425-05306-7|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9 9, 32, 40–42, 44, 54–61]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9}}</ref>

On 21 January 1992, Roach was a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', just days after his 100th birthday, where he recounted experiences with such stars as [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Jean Harlow]]; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance. In February 1992, Roach travelled to [[Berlin]] to receive the honorary award of the ''Berlinale Kamera'' for Lifetime Achievement at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>

On March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the [[64th Academy Awards]] ceremony, hosted by [[Billy Crystal]]. When Roach rose from the audience for a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip \"I think that's appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.\"

==Death==
Hal Roach died in his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]], from [[pneumonia]], on November 2, 1992, just two months before his 101st birthday. He had married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than 20 years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964), and Elizabeth (died in 1946). He also outlived many of the children who starred in his films.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\"/> Roach is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Elmira, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[Elmira, New York]], where he grew up.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=_-cZDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=hal+roach+woodlawn+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY-7Gw7YTfAhWRCHwKHVHBC8QQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=hal%20roach%20woodlawn%20cemetery&f=false ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'']</ref>

==Hal Roach Studios==
The 14.5 acre (58,680 m²) studio once known as \"The Lot of Fun\", containing 55 buildings, was demolished in 1963 (despite tentative plans to reopen the facilities as \"Landmark Studios\"), after one last movie, ''[[Dime with a Halo]]'' (1963), with [[BarBara Luna|Barbara Luna]], was made there in 1963 by [[Boris Sagal]] (to Sagal, the forlorn facility looked like a run-down Mexican city).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531142915/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie |archivedate=May 31, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}{{failed verification|date=September 2016}}</ref>

They were replaced by light industrial buildings, businesses, and an automobile dealership. Today, Culver City's \"Landmark Street\" runs down what was the middle of the old studio lot, with the two original sound stages having been located on the north side of Landmark Street, and the [[backlot]]/city street sets had been located at the eastern end of Landmark Street. A plaque sits in a small park across from the studio's location, placed there by [[The Sons of the Desert]].<ref>[http://www.culvercity.org/en/Visitors/CulverCityHistory/HalRoachStudios Culver City History: Hal Roach Studios] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315022518/http://www.culvercity.org/en/Visitors/CulverCityHistory/HalRoachStudios |date=March 15, 2011 }}, culvercity.org. Retrieved August 23, 2008</ref>

Most of the film library was bought in 1971 by a Canadian company that adopted the \"Hal Roach Studios\" name. It primarily handled the business of keeping the library in the public eye and licensing products based upon the classic film series.

In 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the controversial business of [[film colorization]]. Buying a fifty percent interest in [[Wilson Markle]]'s Colorization Inc, it began creating digitally colored versions of several Laurel and Hardy features, the [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), and other popular films. In the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios produced ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Roach's old distributor in the 1930s. During the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios distributed its classic film library, as well as films in the [[public domain]], on home video. 1986 saw the merger of Hal Roach Studios with the production firm of [[Robert Halmi]] into ''Qintex Entertainment'', named after Australian investor [[Qintex]]. Under this name, Qintex collaborated with [[Universal Television]] to distribute ''[[The New Leave It To Beaver]]'' in syndication and the Canadian drama ''[[T. and T.]]'', starring [[Mr. T]], with Canadian animation house [[Nelvana]]. However, Qintex's Australian parent ended up collapsing under a crushing debtload, forcing Qintex Entertainment into bankruptcy.

In the years that followed, the Roach company changed hands several more times. Independent television producer Robert Halmi (who had merged his company with Roach) bought the company in the early 1990s after the bankruptcy of Qintex, and it became [[RHI Entertainment]]. A short time later, this successor company was acquired by [[Hallmark Entertainment]] in 1994, but Halmi, [[Robert Halmi Jr.]] and affiliates of [[Kelso & Company]] reacquired the company in 2006. Hallmark Entertainment was absorbed into RHI Entertainment (with [[Vivendi]] as the current home video output partner).

In that same decade, a new incarnation of Hal Roach Studios (operated by the Roach Trust) was established, and today this new version of the company has released classic films on DVD, many of which are from Roach's own archival prints of his films, while others are public domain titles mastered from the best available [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] elements.

'''Bodymind''' is an approach to understand the relationship between the human [[Human body|body]] and [[mind]] where they are seen as a single integrated unit. It attempts to address the [[mind–body problem]] and resists the Western traditions of [[mind–body dualism]]. The term bodymind is also typically seen and encountered in [[disability studies]], referring to the intricate and often times inseparable relationship between the body and the mind, and how these two units might act as one. The field of [[psychosomatic medicine]] investigates the embodied manifestations of psychological processes.  

== Dualism vs holism ==
In the field of philosophy, the theory of dualism is the speculation that the mental and the physical parts of us- like our minds and our bodies- are different or separate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Robinson|first=Howard|title=Dualism|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/dualism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Holism is the idea or speculation that all the properties of a system- such as the system of our thoughts, and the system of our body- cannot be determined or explained by looking at its components individually. Rather, the whole system looked at a complete whole is a determiner in understanding and viewing the idea, concept, or theory being questioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_metaphysics.html|title=Metaphysics - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

On the Western side of the globe, popular culture tends to be more on the side that there are two centers of our being that makes us who we are and how we see and interact with the world. The first is the mind – the center of our thoughts, and the heart (or body) – which is the center of our feelings. In Western culture, there is more of a debate on whether these different parts that make us unique are sperate or connected.

In Eastern culture, especially in areas such as and surrounding India and the Middle East, the idea of body-mind is the exact opposite. The words “mind” and “heart’ both translate into “chitta,” which refers to the mind. “Chitta” is one of the three overlapping terms used that refers to the mind. The other two are “manas” and  “[[viññāṇa]].” Together, they are parts that make up the whole or entirety of our minds, and our mental processes as a whole. Often used in practices such as yoga, commonly used and followed in more “self-help” medicines, In the Indian model, this heart-mind has three aspects: the capability of paying attention and sensory processing, the creation of our identity or self-image (more commonly known as Ego), and the capacity to imagine things, form judgements, and making decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embodiedphilosophy.com/on-the-mind-the-difference-between-eastern-and-western-conceptions/|title=On the Mind: the Difference between Eastern and Western Conceptions|date=2017-08-14|website=#embodiedphilosophy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

== Historical background ==
An important figure in the concept and belief of body-mind is an American philosopher, scholar, and professor of philosophy, religion, and culture, William H. Poteat (19 April, 1919 – 17 May 2000). Throughout the course of his lifetime, Poteat was known for his great contributions to Post-Critical Philosophy and for being the leader of formative and influential ideas such as “bodymind.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whpoteat.org/|title=whpoteat.org|website=whpoteat.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> As a man who emphasized in philosophy, it is said he identified himself as a “” practicing dialectician.” He was known to encourage and challenge not only himself, but those around him, to question, understand, and challenge the reasoning and facts of the confusing aspects of modern life. Poteat drew his inspirations and ideas from Michael Polanyi, who wrote “The Stability of Beliefs” in 1952. In this essay, Polanyi spoke about how there are two ways of holding beliefs. He stated, “Some are held by the explicit profession of certain articles of faith, as the Apostles’ Creed when recited in the words of the Book of Common Prayer. The other form of belief is held implicitly by reliance on a particular conceptual framework by which all experience is interpreted.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1952|title=The Stability of Beliefs|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/685265|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=3|issue=11|pages=217–232|issn=0007-0882}}</ref> Other influential people Poteat looked to for further inspiration were the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), a man considered to be the first existential philosopher (philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and choice), the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961), and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975), a German-American philosopher and political theorist and many others. Together, these people and their ideas, along with Poteat’s own ideas and theories, helped him further understand and share the concept and ideas of what bodymind is in today’s modern world.

== Bodymind and religion ==
The approach to bodymind is believed in and viewed through multiple faiths and practices. These include Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada, and Zen Buddhism. Like many religions today, these different branches of Buddhism originate from the same root and tree. They have very similar ideas and beliefs, but there are differences in the way they practice and live their beliefs. However, in each of their faiths, the concept of bodymind, otherwise known as namarupa, is key. Another similarity that all the different branches of Buddhism share is the daily practice of “Sila” “Samhdai,” and “Prajna.” The idea and practice of Buddhism originated in India, and is now practiced throughout the world. The core teachings of Buddhism are the Three Universal Truths, The Four Noble Truths, and The Noble Eightfold Path.

The three Noble Truths are: Nothing is lost in the universe, everything changes, and the law of cause and effect. The Four Noble Truths are: suffering exists (Dukkha), there is a cause of suffering (Samudaya), there is an end to suffering (Nirodha), and in order to end suffering, you must follow the Eightfold Path (Magga). Finally, the Eightfold Path consists of the following:

1)   Right understanding of the Four Noble Truths

2)   Right thinking

3)   Right speech

4)   Right conduct or action

5)   Right livelihood

6)   Right effort

7)   Right mindfulness

8)   Right concentration

Buddhism is one of the main ways in which we can view and more fully understand the bodymind approach- especially in today’s modern world of many different advancements, ideas, and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/|title=UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency|website=www.unhcr.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

== Modern understanding ==
“The mind is composed of mental fragments- sensations, feelings, thoughts, imaginations, all flowing now in an ordered sequence, now in a chaotic fashion…. On the other hand, the body is constructed under the underlying laws of physics, and its components obey the well-enumerated laws of physiology. It is these characteristic differences between these two – between mind and body – that lead to the Mind-Body problem.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=John G.|date=2010-10-28|title=Mind-body problem: New approaches|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mind-body_problem:_New_approaches|journal=Scholarpedia|language=en|volume=5|issue=10|pages=1580|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1580|issn=1941-6016}}</ref>There is still no concrete evidence if the mind has more impact on who we are, or of our bodies do. While the Western population tends to believe more in the idea of dualism, there is no reason to not believe the idea of holism. Many throughout the world who try to understand and live the idea of holism, say they feel more connected with themselves, with the environment, and with those around them. If anything, bodymind shows the significance of connected everything is- both in and outside ourselves. Bodymind is brought up in many different situations today in the modern world- especially in modern and alternative medicines.

==Relevance to alternative medicine==
In the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that

The term overlaps in significant ways, especially in its anti-dualist intention, with the philosophical term mindbody developed independently by philosopher [[William H. Poteat]].

== Relevance to disability studies ==
The term bodymind is most generally used in the academic field of disability studies. Disability scholars use the term bodymind to emphasize the interdependence and inseparability of the body and mind.

Prominent scholars who have written academically about the bodymind include Eli Clare, Margaret Price, Sami Schalk, Alyson Patsavas, and Alison Kafer. Clare and Price have proposed that the bodymind expresses the interrelatedness of mental and physical processes, and Schalk defines the bodymind similarly as it pertains to disability and race.

One of the first scholars to popularize the concept of bodymind is Eli Clare, a writer and activist for queer and disability studies. Clare uses bodymind in his work ''Brilliant Imperfection'' as a way to resist common Western assumptions that the body and mind are separate entities, or that the mind is “superior” to the body.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brilliant Imperfection: Grappling with Cure|last=Clare|first=Eli|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822362760|location=Durham|pages=xvi}}</ref> Similarly, scholar Margaret Price writes that the combination of ‘body’ and ‘mind’ in one term acknowledges that “mental and physical processes not only affect each other but also give rise to each other—that is, because they tend to act as one, even though they are conventionally understood as two”.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Margaret|date=2014|title=The Bodymind Problem and the Possibilities of Pain|journal=Hypatia|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=268–284|doi=10.1111/hypa.12127}}</ref>

Scholar Sami Schalk in her work ''Bodyminds Reimagined'' uses the term bodymind to recognize that “processes within our being impact one another in such a way that the notion of a physical versus mental process is difficult, if not impossible to clearly discern in most cases”.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Bodyminds Reimagined: (Dis)ability, Race, and Gender in Black Women's Speculative Fiction|last=Schalk|first=Samantha Dawn|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780822370734|location=Durham|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bodymindsreimagi00scha/page/269 269, 5]|url=https://archive.org/details/bodymindsreimagi00scha/page/269}}</ref> Schalk emphasizes the utility of the term bodymind as it relates to disability and race. In analyzing histories of race, gender, and disability, Schalk notes that it is important to recognize the non-physical impact of various oppressions. For Schalk, the term bodymind highlights the “psychic stress” of oppression.<ref name=\":0\" /> In relation to [[transgenerational trauma]] in people of color, bodymind is used to show how the psychological toll of oppression and its resulting stress has lasting mental and physical manifestations.

The connection between the body and mind is not merely theoretical; for example, the interrelation between mental and physical health is explored in the field of psychosomatic medicine, which investigates bodily processes in relation to social and psychological factors. For example, the psychiatric condition [[major depressive disorder]] often manifests physically in the forms of excessive sleeping, loss of appetite, weight gain or loss, back pain, and headaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007|title=Depression (major depressive disorder) - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>

'''Bodymind''' is an approach to understand the relationship between the human [[Human body|body]] and [[mind]] where they are seen as a single integrated unit. It attempts to address the [[mind–body problem]] and resists the Western traditions of [[mind–body dualism]].The term bodymind is also typically seen and encountered in [[disability studies]], referring to the intricate and often times inseparable relationship between the body and the mind, and how these two units might act as one. The field of [[psychosomatic medicine]] investigates the embodied manifestations of psychological processes.  

== Dualism vs holism ==
In the field of philosophy, the theory of dualism is the speculation that the mental and the physical parts of us- like our minds and our bodies- are different or separate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Robinson|first=Howard|title=Dualism|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/dualism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Holism is the idea or speculation that all the properties of a system- such as the system of our thoughts, and the system of our body- cannot be determined or explained by looking at it’s components individually. Rather, the whole system looked at a complete whole is a determiner in understanding and viewing the idea, concept, or theory being questioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_metaphysics.html|title=Metaphysics - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

On the Western side of the globe, popular culture tends to be more on the side that there are two centers of our being that make us who we are and how we see and interact with the world. The first is the mind- the center of our thoughts, and the heart (or body)- which is the center of our feelings. In Western culture, there is more of a debate on whether these different parts that make us unique are sperate or connected.

In Eastern culture, especially in areas such as and surrounding India and the Middle East, the idea of body mind is the exact opposite. The words “mind” and “heart’ both translate into “chitta,” which refers to the mind. “Chitta” is one of the three overlapping terms used that refers to the mind. The other two are “manas” and  “[[viññāṇa]].” Together, they are parts that make up the whole or entirety of our minds, and our mental processes as a whole. Often used in practices such as yoga, commonly used and followed in more “self-help” medicines, In the Indian model, this heart-mind has three aspects: the capability of paying attention and sensory processing, the creation of our identity or self-image (more commonly known as Ego), and the capacity to imagine things, form judgements, and making decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embodiedphilosophy.com/on-the-mind-the-difference-between-eastern-and-western-conceptions/|title=On the Mind: the Difference between Eastern and Western Conceptions|date=2017-08-14|website=#embodiedphilosophy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

== Historical background ==
An important figure in the concept and belief of body mind is an American philosopher, scholar, and professor of philosophy, religion, and culture, William H. Poteat (19 April, 1919 – 17 May 2000). Throughout the course of his lifetime, Poteat was known for his great contributions to Post-Critical Philosophy and for being the leader of formative and influential ideas such as “body mind.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whpoteat.org/|title=whpoteat.org|website=whpoteat.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> As a man who emphasized in philosophy, it is said he identified himself as a “” practicing dialectician.” He was known to encourage and challenge not only himself, but those around him, to question, understand, and challenge the reasoning and facts of the confusing aspects of modern life. Poteat drew his inspirations and ideas from Michael Polanyi, who wrote “The Stability of Beliefs” in 1952. In this essay, Polanyi spoke about how there are two ways of holding beliefs. He stated, “Some are held by the explicit profession of certain articles of faith, as the Apostles’ Creed when recited in the words of the Book of Common Prayer. The other form of belief is held implicitly by reliance on a particular conceptual framework by which all experience is interpreted.”<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1952|title=The Stability of Beliefs|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/685265|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=3|issue=11|pages=217–232|issn=0007-0882}}</ref> Other influential people Poteat looked to for further inspiration were the Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), a man considered to be the first existential philosopher (philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and choice), the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961), and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975), a German-American philosopher and political theorist and many others. Together, these people and their ideas, along with Poteat’s own ideas and theories, helped him further understand and share the concept and ideas of what body mind is in today’s modern world.

== Bodymind and religion ==
The approach to body mind is believed in and viewed through multiple faiths and practices. These include Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada, and Zen Buddhism. Like many religions today, these different branches of Buddhism originate from the same root and tree. They have very similar ideas and beliefs, but there are differences in the way they practice and live their beliefs. However, in each of their faiths, the concept of bodymind, otherwise known as namarupa, is key. Another similarity that all the different branches of Buddhism share is the daily practice of “Sila” “Samhdai,” and “Prajna.” The idea and practice of Buddhism originated in India, and is now practiced throughout the world. The core teachings of Buddhism are the Three Universal Truths, The Four Noble Truths, and The Noble Eightfold Path.

The three Noble Truths are: Nothing is lost in the universe, everything changes, and the law of cause and effect. The Four Noble Truths are: suffering exists (Dukkha), there is a cause of suffering (Samudaya), there is an end to suffering (Nirodha), and in order to end suffering, you must follow the Eightfold Path (Magga). Finally, the Eightfold Path consists of the following:

1)   Right understanding of the Four Noble Truths

2)   Right thinking

3)   Right speech

4)   Right conduct or action

5)   Right livelihood

6)   Right effort

7)   Right mindfulness

8)   Right concentration

Buddhism is one of the main ways in which we can view and more fully understand the bodymind approach- especially in today’s modern world of many different advancements, ideas, and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/|title=UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency|website=www.unhcr.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

== Modern understanding ==
“The mind is composed of mental fragments- sensations, feelings, thoughts, imaginations, all flowing now in an ordered sequence, now in a chaotic fashion…. On the other hand, the body is constructed under the underlying laws of physics, and its components obey the well-enumerated laws of physiology. It is these characteristic differences between these two – between mind and body – that lead to the Mind-Body problem.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=John G.|date=2010-10-28|title=Mind-body problem: New approaches|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mind-body_problem:_New_approaches|journal=Scholarpedia|language=en|volume=5|issue=10|pages=1580|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1580|issn=1941-6016}}</ref>There is still no concrete evidence if the mind has more impact on who we are, or of our bodies do. While the Western population tends to believe more in the idea of dualism, there is no reason to not believe the idea of holism. Many throughout the world who try to understand and live the idea of holism, say they feel more connected with themselves, with the environment, and with those around them. If anything, bodymind shows the significance of connected everything is- both in and outside ourselves. Bodymind is brought up in many different situations today in the modern world- especially in modern and alternative medicines.

==Relevance to alternative medicine==
In the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that

The term overlaps in significant ways, especially in its anti-dualist intention, with the philosophical term mindbody developed independently by philosopher [[William H. Poteat]].

== Relevance to disability studies ==
The term bodymind is most generally used in the academic field of disability studies. Disability scholars use the term bodymind to emphasize the interdependence and inseparability of the body and mind.

Prominent scholars who have written academically about the bodymind include Eli Clare, Margaret Price, Sami Schalk, Alyson Patsavas, and Alison Kafer. Clare and Price have proposed that the bodymind expresses the interrelatedness of mental and physical processes, and Schalk defines the bodymind similarly as it pertains to disability and race.

One of the first scholars to popularize the concept of bodymind is Eli Clare, a writer and activist for queer and disability studies. Clare uses bodymind in his work ''Brilliant Imperfection'' as a way to resist common Western assumptions that the body and mind are separate entities, or that the mind is “superior” to the body.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brilliant Imperfection: Grappling with Cure|last=Clare|first=Eli|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822362760|location=Durham|pages=xvi}}</ref> Similarly, scholar Margaret Price writes that the combination of ‘body’ and ‘mind’ in one term acknowledges that “mental and physical processes not only affect each other but also give rise to each other—that is, because they tend to act as one, even though they are conventionally understood as two”.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Price|first=Margaret|date=2014|title=The Bodymind Problem and the Possibilities of Pain|journal=Hypatia|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=268–284|doi=10.1111/hypa.12127}}</ref>

Scholar Sami Schalk in her work ''Bodyminds Reimagined'' uses the term bodymind to recognize that “processes within our being impact one another in such a way that the notion of a physical versus mental process is difficult, if not impossible to clearly discern in most cases”.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Bodyminds Reimagined: (Dis)ability, Race, and Gender in Black Women's Speculative Fiction|last=Schalk|first=Samantha Dawn|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2018|isbn=9780822370734|location=Durham|pages=[https://archive.org/details/bodymindsreimagi00scha/page/269 269, 5]|url=https://archive.org/details/bodymindsreimagi00scha/page/269}}</ref> Schalk emphasizes the utility of the term bodymind as it relates to disability and race. In analyzing histories of race, gender, and disability, Schalk notes that it is important to recognize the non-physical impact of various oppressions. For Schalk, the term bodymind highlights the “psychic stress” of oppression.<ref name=\":0\" /> In relation to [[transgenerational trauma]] in people of color, bodymind is used to show how the psychological toll of oppression and its resulting stress has lasting mental and physical manifestations.

The connection between the body and mind is not merely theoretical; for example, the interrelation between mental and physical health is explored in the field of psychosomatic medicine, which investigates bodily processes in relation to social and psychological factors. For example, the psychiatric condition [[major depressive disorder]] often manifests physically in the forms of excessive sleeping, loss of appetite, weight gain or loss, back pain, and headaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007|title=Depression (major depressive disorder) - Symptoms and causes|website=Mayo Clinic|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>

A year later, Lamjarred released another single titled \"Ana Machi Sahel\" ({{lang-ar|أنا ماشي ساهل}}), which he soon followed up with a black-and-white music video released on YouTube that features dozens of Lamjarred's fans, who have filmed themselves singing along to the song at home, in their cars and out and about.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/saad-lamjarreds-parents-fans-feature-his-new-music-video-861890|title=Saad Lamjarred's parents, fans feature in his new music video!|date=July 13, 2016|publisher=Albawaba}}</ref> Lamjarred didn't wait too long to release another single by the name of \"Ghaltana\" ({{lang-ar|غلطانة}}) in the form of a video clip directed by [[Amr Rouani]]. The video caught eyes because of its Wild West, gritty feel, inspired by Rouani's childhood love of [[Mad Max (franchise)|''Mad Max'' films]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisonlake/2018/06/05/singer-lamjarred-exports-moroccan-dialect-to-arab-world/|title=Singer Lamjarred Exports Moroccan Dialect to Arab World|first=Alison|last=Lake|work=Forbes}}</ref>

Following this success, Lamjarred's music production took a brief gap while he was on trial in Paris for \"sexual assault\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moroccoworldnews.com/2016/10/199920/moroccan-singer-saad-lamjarred-arrested-in-paris-for-sexual-assault/|title=Moroccan Singer Saad Lamjarred Arrested in Paris for 'Sexual Assault'|publisher=Morocco World News}}</ref> but soon made a come-back with his August 2017 comeback titled \"Let Go\".

Within 4 hours of publication, the official music video received over a million views on YouTube.

In July 2019, Lamjarred performed and released a duet with Egyptian actor and fellow singer [[Mohamed Ramadan (actor)|Mohamed Ramadan]] titled \"Ensay\" ({{lang-ar|إنساي}}), which garnered over 100 million views within a month of publication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.egypttoday.com/Article/4/73095/Ramadan-Lamjarred%E2%80%99s-Ensay-tops-YouTube-videos|title=Ramadan, Lamjarred's 'Ensay' tops YouTube videos|website=Egypt Today|first=Mustafa|last=Marie|date=July 22, 2019|accessdate=September 27, 2019}}</ref>

Orsi's foray into documentary filmmaking began when she teamed with director John Armstrong to produce '''''Bashkaus: Hard Labor in Siberia'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650709/bio|title=Agi Orsi Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' (Discovery Channel), a film that won a '''Gold Medal Living Book Award''' and the '''Grand Prize at the Telluride Mountain Film Festival'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainfilm.org/festival/personalities/john-armstrong|title=John Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=John Armstrong|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> for chronicling the first joint US-Soviet river expedition in Russia's Altai Mountains during a thaw in the Cold War.  Following that, Orsi teamed again with Armstrong to produce '''''Curtain of Ice''''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/curtain-of-ice/oclc/27479917|title=Curtain of Ice|last=|first=|date=|website=World Cat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>(Discovery Channel), documenting the first-on water crossing of the Bering Strait, the \"Curtain of Ice,\" reuniting Eskimos separated for decades during the US-Russia arms escalation. The documentary also tells the story of Jim Noyes, a paraplegic with a broken spine who finds a new purpose for living after making the crossing.

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2011|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans sports and footwear apparel company that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues or gentrified influences to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with personal stories of drug abuse, mental illness, transgender power and undocumented survival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

== Film Financing ==
To finance '''''Dogtown and Z-Boys''''', Orsi sought and obtained financing from Vans footwear and apparel company, which manufactured deck shoes with \"sticky souls\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theskateboarder.net/best-skate-shoes/|title=The 13 Best Skateboard Shoes of 2020|last=|first=|date=1019|website=Skateboarder|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> popular with skateboarders in the 70s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.documentary.org/feature/and-now-word-about-sponsors-taking-corporate-route-funding-your-project|title=And Now, A Word About Sponsors: Taking the Corporate Route to Funding Your Project|last=Fairweather|first=Kathleen|date=2003|website=IDA (International Documentary Association)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=2003|access-date=}}</ref> Although the deal with Vans was negotiated quickly, Orsi acknowledged most film financing involves a longer process of negotiation.

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans sports and footwear apparel company that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues or gentrified influences to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with personal stories of drug abuse, mental illness, transgender power and undocumented survival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

'''''ChalkZone''''' is an American animated television series created by [[Bill Burnett (writer)|Bill Burnett]] and [[Larry Huber]] for [[Nickelodeon]] that ran from 2002 until 2008.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=120-121 }}</ref> The series follows Rudy Tabootie, an elementary school student whose magic chalk allows him into the ChalkZone, an alternate dimension where everything drawn on a blackboard and erased becomes real. The show concentrates on the adventures of Rudy, his sidekick Snap, and classmate, Penny Sanchez, within the ChalkZone.

''ChalkZone'' originally aired as part of [[Fred Seibert]]'s ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' animated shorts showcase in 1998. The series ran on Nickelodeon from March 22, 2002, through August 23, 2008, with 40 episodes in total. It was produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]].

==Premise==
Rudy Tabootie (voiced by [[E. G. Daily]]) is a 10-year-old fifth-grader who loves to draw, but Reggie Bullnerd ([[Candi Milo]]), the school bully, is always teasing him or getting him into trouble with Mr. Wilter (Robert Cait), Rudy's grumpy school teacher who strongly dislikes cartoons especially Rudy's passion for art. One day while in detention, Rudy discovers a piece of \"White Lightning\" chalk, which allows access to the ChalkZone, a place where everything and everyone that has ever been drawn in chalk and erased takes form as living or is tangible. He soon makes friends with Snap (Candi Milo), a small, blue, [[humanoid]] drawing made by Rudy when he was only eight. Snap wears a superhero uniform and is very adventurous and witty. Rudy only lets one other person know about ChalkZone, his best friend and crush Penny Sanchez (speaking voice, [[Hynden Walch]]; singing voice, [[Robbyn Kirmssè]]), who acts as the [[genius]] of the group.

While in ChalkZone, the trio are introduced to Cyclops ([[Rodger Bumpass]]), the kilt-wearing guardian of the magic chalk mines where Rudy obtains his magic chalk (Rudy later draws a second eye for him and renames him \"Biclops\"); Queen Rapsheeba (Rosslynn Taylor), ChalkZone's song artist whom Snap has a crush on; and Blocky (Candi Milo; Robert Cait), a light green block friend of Snap's and Rudy's first-ever drawing. They are also faced with villains such as Skrawl ([[Jim Cummings]]), a drawing who blames Rudy for being ugly and wants to destroy him; and the Craniacs ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a series of robot drawings obsessed with collecting futuristic devices.

==Characters==

===Main===

===Supporting===
* Reginald  \"Reggie\" Bullnerd (voiced by Candi Milo): Reggie is the school bully. Gets stuck in a lot of things and his full name is shown in the unaired episode \"Teachers' Lounge\". He gets into trouble all the time and even has a school record with its own file drawer.
* Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Tabootie (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]): Joe is Rudy's father, who runs a meat shop. His voice resembles that of [[Ned Flanders]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', but in a high-disorted pitch.
* Mildred Trish \"Millie\" Tabootie (voiced by [[Miriam Flynn]]): Millie is Rudy's mother, who calls Rudy down in an opera singing-esque voice.
* Horace T. Wilter (voiced by Robert Cait): Horace is Rudy's cartoon-hating school teacher. He comes close to learning about ChalkZone in the episode \"Secret Passages.\"
* Dr. Sanchez (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]): Dr. Sanchez is Penny's mother, who is a doctor and scientist.
* Biclops (voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]]): Rodger is the guardian of the Magic Chalk Mines. He was originally named \"Cyclops\" until Rudy gave him a second eye.

The Craniacs are based on [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] from the [[Superman|Superman comics]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}
* Bruno Bullnerd (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is Reggie's father

==Production==
''ChalkZone'' was the creation of Bill Burnett and Larry Huber, with Huber's idea of a boy with magic chalk and Burnett's idea of a world behind the chalkboard. The concept's origin dated back during the production of [[Hanna Barbera]]'s ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' where Seibert initially wanted Huber to develop a cartoon for the showcase and assigned him with Burnett, who was writing for ''[[Cow & Chicken]]'' at the time, to develop a pilot for a potential series.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyfMOLKS5Wk Keep on Chalkin' with Bill Burnett - Chatterbox 1/13/20 - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Development fell through at the last minute from the result of [[Warner Bros. Animation]] acquiring Hanna Barbera Cartoons. The concept came back when Seibert developed Frederator Studios and was pitched as a short on Nickelodeon's ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' before getting the greenlight in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Cartoon Show Will Honor Irreverence|first=Harlene|last=Ellin|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-18/news/9807180055_1_looney-tunes-bugs-bunny-shorts|date=July 18, 1998|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215095446/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-18/news/9807180055_1_looney-tunes-bugs-bunny-shorts|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1999, ''ChalkZone'' became the first spin-off of ''Oh Yeah!

All Rights Reserved.}}</ref> The show's air-date was up for debate until the lack of new programming and the US' [[September 11 attacks|critical situation at the time]] led the decision to air the series in 2002. Frederator Studios announced in 2005 that the series had been cancelled at 40 episodes.

The show is remembered for featuring one-minute music videos sung by Rudy and his friends at the end of each episode. Several songs Bill Burnett created prior to ChalkZone's production, i.e. Insect Aside and Dream Alotta Dreams, were implanted into the series. A popular rumor about the show is that it was based on [[Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings]]. In fact, Bill Burnett debunked this in a 2013 interview, revealing that he was not even aware of the series' existence until after ''ChalkZone'' entered production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old School Lane's Nickelodeon Tribute: Interview with Bill Burnett|url=http://oldschoollane.blogspot.com/2013/01/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute_4384.html|website=Old School Lane|accessdate=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005201028/http://oldschoollane.blogspot.com/2013/01/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute_4384.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|date=2013-01-28}}</ref> Although Burnett did mention that [[Harold and the Purple Crayon]] was an influence on Larry's idea for the \"boy with magic chalk\" concept. A one-hour special, \"The Big Blow Up\", premiered on August 6, 2004. The final season featured new character designs with a slimmer line quality and a zooming chalk transition as new artists and oversea studios were used for the remainder of the series.

The show had three different variations of the theme song released to the public, one from the 2001 Nickelodeon album, \"The Newest Nicktoons\", which used a synthesizer instead of a guitar and had an early version of Penny's voice which was a demo Bill Burnett created in order for the song to get the green-light, an early version of the final version from the album \"ChalkZone: In The Zone\", where the guitar was used and Penny's early voice was still used, and the final version which was shown on regular episodes. Bill Burnett's original idea for the concepts' score was something in akin to simplistic children's toy instrument melodies to fit the show's children's \"chalk-drawing\" theme, but the Nickelodeon crew suggested a more techno rock-based score to give the show a huge contrast from the premise. Steve Rucker was brought into the music composition team and some of his compositions were later re-written upon request by Burnett and Moon to fit the series better, much to his discourage.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Broadcast==
The pilot for the series first aired on December 31, 1999, as part of Nickelodeon's annual New Year's Eve block,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=19 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010202151100/http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|archivedate=February 2, 2001}}</ref> but due to being delayed by Nickelodeon for undisclosed reasons, the series made its official premiere on March 22, 2002, as the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-ChalkZone/|title=Nickelodeon Chalks Up More ChalkZone|first=Ryan|last=Ball|date=May 8, 2003|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215093427/http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-chalkzone/|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817185332/http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 17, 2002|title=Nickelodeon Draws Best Kid Ratings in Four Years, Ranks as Number-One Net for First Quarter '02, SpongeBob SquarePants and ChalkZone Etch Out Top-Rated Territory, Kids Find The Fairly OddParents Fairly Fascinating|date=April 2, 2002|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>

The show aired in reruns on \"[[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]]\" for more than a year from February 1, 2003, to September 11, 2004. In June 2005, following the announcement that the series had been cancelled, the fourth season of the series premiered. Of the season's eleven episodes, only five would be aired that year before Nickelodeon [[Hiatus (television)|abruptly halted]] the broadcast of new episodes. The remaining six episodes would not air until three years later in June and August 2008. The final episode aired on August 23, 2008.

Since the series' cancellation, reruns aired on [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] until October 28, 2013. ''ChalkZone'' reruns aired on [[NickSplat]] (then known as \"The Splat\") for two nights only on November 12 and 13, 2016 as part of a block that ran every weekend from August until December commemorating the 25th anniversary of the [[Nicktoons]] franchise. As of October 2018, NickSplat –including ''ChalkZone''– has been a subscription channel based on [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]].

==Home media==
During the show's original run, there weren't any DVD releases specifically for ''ChalkZone''. The episode \"Future Zone\" was released on the Nickstravaganza! VHS. Three episodes (\"Gift Adrift\", \"French Fry Falls\", and \"Eschucha Mi Corazon\") were released for the Nickstravaganza! 2 DVD (only \"French Fry Falls\" was included on the VHS). The Christmas episode, \"When Santas Collide\", was featured on the 2006 DVD Nick Picks Holiday. A Complete Series DVD set for ChalkZone was finally released through Amazon.com's CreateSpace manufacture-on-demand program on October 13, 2014; despite the title, however, it is missing the episode \"The Smooch\" due to music licensing issues. A soundtrack album ''In the Zone'' has also been released.<ref>{{citation|title=Rudy & ChalkZone Gang: In the Zone [EP, Soundtrack]|work=Amazon.com|asin=B000084U51}}</ref> The entire series is available on [[Amazon Video]] and the [[PlayStation Store]].

==Reception==

'''''ChalkZone''''' is an American animated television series created by [[Bill Burnett (writer)|Bill Burnett]] and [[Larry Huber]] for [[Nickelodeon]] that ran from 2002 until 2008.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=120-121 }}</ref> The series follows Rudy Tabootie, an elementary school student whose magic chalk allows him into the ChalkZone, an alternate dimension where everything drawn on a blackboard and erased becomes real. The show concentrates on the adventures of Rudy, his sidekick Snap, and classmate, Penny Sanchez, within the Chalkzone.

''ChalkZone'' originally aired as part of [[Fred Seibert]]'s ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' animated shorts showcase in 1998. The series ran on Nickelodeon from March 22, 2002, through August 23, 2008, with 40 episodes in total. It was produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]].

==Premise==
Rudy Tabootie (voiced by [[E. G. Daily]]) is a 10-year-old fifth-grader who loves to draw, but Reggie Bullnerd ([[Candi Milo]]), the school bully, is always teasing him or getting him into trouble with Mr. Wilter (Robert Cait), Rudy's grumpy school teacher who strongly dislikes cartoons especially Rudy's passion for art. One day while in detention, Rudy discovers a piece of \"White Lightning\" chalk, which allows access to the ChalkZone, a place where everything and everyone that has ever been drawn in chalk and erased takes form as living or is tangible. He soon makes friends with Snap (Candi Milo), a small, blue, [[humanoid]] drawing made by Rudy when he was only eight. Snap wears a superhero uniform and is very adventurous and witty. Rudy only lets one other person know about ChalkZone, his best friend and crush Penny Sanchez (speaking voice, [[Hynden Walch]]; singing voice, [[Robbyn Kirmssè]]), who acts as the [[genius]] of the group.

While in ChalkZone, the trio are introduced to Cyclops ([[Rodger Bumpass]]), the kilt-wearing guardian of the magic chalk mines where Rudy obtains his magic chalk (Rudy later draws a second eye for him and renames him \"Biclops\"); Queen Rapsheeba (Rosslynn Taylor), ChalkZone's song artist whom Snap has a crush on; and Blocky (Candi Milo; Robert Cait), a light green block friend of Snap's and Rudy's first-ever drawing. They are also faced with villains such as Skrawl ([[Jim Cummings]]), a drawing who blames Rudy for being ugly and wants to destroy him; and the Craniacs ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a series of robot drawings obsessed with collecting futuristic devices.

===Supporting===
* Reginald  \"Reggie\" Bullnerd (voiced by Candi Milo): Reggie is the school bully. Gets stuck in a lot of things and his full name is shown in the unaired episode \"Teachers' Lounge\". He gets into trouble all the time and even has a school record with its own file drawer.
* Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Tabootie (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]): Joe is Rudy's father, who runs a meat shop. His voice resembles that of [[Ned Flanders]] from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', but in a high-disorted pitch.
* Mildred Trish \"Millie\" Tabootie (voiced by [[Miriam Flynn]]): Millie is Rudy's mother, who calls Rudy down in an opera singing-esque voice.

* Bruno Bullnerd (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) is Reggie's father

==Production==
''ChalkZone'' was the creation of Bill Burnett and Larry Huber, with Huber's idea of a boy with magic chalk and Burnett's idea of a world behind the chalkboard. The concept's origin dated back during the production of [[Hanna Barbera]]'s ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' where Seibert initially wanted Huber to develop a cartoon for the showcase and assigned him with Burnett, who was writing for ''[[Cow & Chicken]]'' at the time, to develop a pilot for a potential series.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyfMOLKS5Wk Keep on Chalkin' with Bill Burnett - Chatterbox 1/13/20 - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Development fell through at the last minute from the result of [[Warner Bros. Animation]] acquiring Hanna Barbera Cartoons. The concept came back when Seibert developed Frederator Studios and was pitched as a short on Nickelodeon's ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' before getting the greenlight in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Cartoon Show Will Honor Irreverence|first=Harlene|last=Ellin|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-18/news/9807180055_1_looney-tunes-bugs-bunny-shorts|date=July 18, 1998|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215095446/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-18/news/9807180055_1_looney-tunes-bugs-bunny-shorts|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1999, ''ChalkZone'' became the first spin-off of ''Oh Yeah!

All Rights Reserved.}}</ref> The show's air-date was up for debate until the lack of new programming and the US' [[September 11 attacks|critical situation at the time]] led the decision to air the series in 2002. Frederator Studios announced in 2005 that the series had been cancelled at 40 episodes.

The show is remembered for featuring one-minute music videos sung by Rudy and his friends at the end of each episode. Several songs Bill Burnett created prior to ChalkZone's production, i.e. Insect Aside and Dream Alotta Dreams, were implanted into the series. A popular rumor about the show is that it was based on [[Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings]]. In fact, Bill Burnett debunked this in a 2013 interview, revealing that he was not even aware of the series' existence until after ''ChalkZone'' entered production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old School Lane's Nickelodeon Tribute: Interview with Bill Burnett|url=http://oldschoollane.blogspot.com/2013/01/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute_4384.html|website=Old School Lane|accessdate=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005201028/http://oldschoollane.blogspot.com/2013/01/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute_4384.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|date=2013-01-28}}</ref> Although Burnett did mention that [[Harold and the Purple Crayon]] was an influence on Larry's idea for the \"boy with magic chalk\" concept. A one-hour special, \"The Big Blow Up\", premiered on August 6, 2004. The final season featured new character designs with a slimmer line quality and a zooming chalk transition as new artists and oversea studios were used for the remainder of the series.

The show had three different variations of the theme song released to the public, one from the 2001 Nickelodeon album, \"The Newest Nicktoons\", which used a synthesizer instead of a guitar and had an early version of Penny's voice which was a demo Bill Burnett created in order for the song to get the green-light, an early version of the final version from the album \"ChalkZone: In The Zone\", where the guitar was used and Penny's early voice was still used, and the final version which was shown on regular episodes. Bill Burnett's original idea for the concepts' score was something in akin to simplistic children's toy instrument melodies to fit the show's children's \"chalk-drawing\" theme, but the Nickelodeon crew suggested a more techno rock-based score to give the show a huge contrast from the premise. Steve Rucker was brought into the music composition team and some of his compositions were later re-written upon request by Burnett and Moon to fit the series better, much to his discourage.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

==Broadcast==
The pilot for the series first aired on December 31, 1999, as part of Nickelodeon's annual New Year's Eve block,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=19 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010202151100/http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|archivedate=February 2, 2001}}</ref> but due to being delayed by Nickelodeon for undisclosed reasons, the series made its official premiere on March 22, 2002, as the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-ChalkZone/|title=Nickelodeon Chalks Up More ChalkZone|first=Ryan|last=Ball|date=May 8, 2003|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215093427/http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-chalkzone/|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817185332/http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 17, 2002|title=Nickelodeon Draws Best Kid Ratings in Four Years, Ranks as Number-One Net for First Quarter '02, SpongeBob SquarePants and ChalkZone Etch Out Top-Rated Territory, Kids Find The Fairly OddParents Fairly Fascinating|date=April 2, 2002|publisher=[[Viacom (2005–present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>

The show aired in reruns on \"[[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]]\" for more than a year from February 1, 2003, to September 11, 2004. In June 2005, following the announcement that the series had been cancelled, the fourth season of the series premiered. Of the season's eleven episodes, only five would be aired that year before Nickelodeon [[Hiatus (television)|abruptly halted]] the broadcast of new episodes. The remaining six episodes would not air until three years later in June and August 2008. The final episode aired on August 23, 2008.

Since the series' cancellation, reruns aired on [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] until October 28, 2013. ''ChalkZone'' reruns aired on [[NickSplat]] (then known as \"The Splat\") for two nights only on November 12 and 13, 2016 as part of a block that ran every weekend from August until December commemorating the 25th anniversary of the [[Nicktoons]] franchise. As of October 2018, NickSplat –including ''ChalkZone''– has been a subscription channel based on [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]].

==Home media==
During the show's original run, there weren't any DVD releases specifically for ''ChalkZone''. The episode \"Future Zone\" was released on the Nickstravaganza! VHS. Three episodes (\"Gift Adrift\", \"French Fry Falls\", and \"Eschucha Mi Corazon\") were released for the Nickstravaganza! 2 DVD (only \"French Fry Falls\" was included on the VHS). The Christmas episode, \"When Santas Collide\", was featured on the 2006 DVD Nick Picks Holiday. A Complete Series DVD set for ChalkZone was finally released through Amazon.com's CreateSpace manufacture-on-demand program on October 13, 2014; despite the title, however, it is missing the episode \"The Smooch\" due to music licensing issues. A soundtrack album ''In the Zone'' has also been released.<ref>{{citation|title=Rudy & ChalkZone Gang: In the Zone [EP, Soundtrack]|work=Amazon.com|asin=B000084U51}}</ref> The entire series is available on [[Amazon Video]] and the [[PlayStation Store]].

Most notable is Orsi's collaboration with documentary film director and skateboarder Stacey Peralta to win '''Sundance Festival's Audience and Best Director''' award for '''''Dogtown and Z-Boys''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/26/movies/film-review-skating-on-top-of-the-world-during-an-endless-summer.html)|title=FILM REVIEW; Skating on Top of the World During an Endless Summer|last=Holden|first=Stephen|date=2002|website=New York Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a documentary, narrated by Sean Penn, that explores the world of skateboarding, its impact on surf culture and the disturbing aftermath of lost stardom. Orsi again teamed with Peralta to produce '''''Riding Giants''''' (Studio Canal/Sony Classics), the first documentary to ever open the Sundance Film Festival and winner of the 2004 '''A.C.E.

In Riding Giants director Stacy Peralta pays tribute to the adventurous surfers riding the world's most daunting 20-foot high waves, only to yearn for even more challenging thrill rides.

Additionally Orsi worked with director and professional surfer Sam George to produce '''''Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau''''' (ESPN''''')'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/espn-films-30-30-hawaiian-154949024.html|title=ESPN Films: \"30 for 30\" \"Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau\" Wins Emmy Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Yahoo Finance/Marketwired|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=May 29, 2014|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' a biographical film of the big wave surfer Eddie Aikau who became the symbol of Aloha and celebration of Hawaiian culture.

Orsi's foray into documentary filmmaking began when she teamed with director John Armstrong to produce '''''Bashkaus: Hard Labor in Siberia'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650709/bio|title=Agi Orsi Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' (Discovery Channel), a film that won a '''Gold Medal Living Book Award''' and the '''Grand Prize at the Telluride Mountain Film Festival'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainfilm.org/festival/personalities/john-armstrong|title=John Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=John Armstrong|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> for chronicling the first joint US-Soviet river expedition in Russia's Altai Mountains during a thaw in the Cold War.  Following that, Orsi teamed again with Armstrong to produce '''''Curtain of Ice''''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/curtain-of-ice/oclc/27479917|title=Curtain of Ice|last=|first=|date=|website=World Cat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>(Discovery Channel), documenting the first-on water crossing of the Bering Strait, the \"Curtain of Ice,\" reuniting Eskimos separated for decades during the US-Russia arms escalation. The documentary also tells the story of Jim Noyes, a paraplegic with a broken spine who finds a new purpose for living after making the crossing.

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2011|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary, released in 2009 by Cinema Libre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/clsblog/2013/03/20/lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Lost Angels Now on DVD|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, was financed for $300,000 by DreamWorks and Universal Pictures and Participant Media, with contributions from the Hilton Foundation and Community Supportive Housing. The film takes a critical look at then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's Safer City Initiative which made it a crime to panhandle, sleep, sit or store personal items on sidewalks and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homeless-losangeles/los-angeles-accused-of-criminalizing-homelessness-idUSTRE56E0MC20090715|title=Los Angeles accused of criminalizing homelessness|last=Gorman|first=Steve|date=2009|website=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Narrated by actress Catherine Keener, Lost Angels points to the success of supportive housing with wrap-around mental health and employment services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/get_involved.html|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is my Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Los Angeles earned recognition for the following awards: '''2011 Voice Award from SAMHSA''' (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) and '''Ghetto Award-Radar Hamburg International Film Festival.''' The documentary was also an official selection for the Los Angeles Film Festival (Premiere), One World Human Rights Film Festival (Prague), Human Rights Film Festival (London), Oaxaca Film Festival, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/assets/lost-angels-press-notes-FINAL.pdf|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans sports and footwear apparel company that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues or gentrified influences to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with personal stories of drug abuse, mental illness, transgender power and undocumented survival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Additionally Orsi worked with director and professional surfer Sam George to produce '''''Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau''''' (ESPN''''')'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/espn-films-30-30-hawaiian-154949024.html|title=ESPN Films: \"30 for 30\" \"Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau\" Wins Emmy Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Yahoo Finance/Marketwired|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=May 29, 2014|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' a biographical film of the big wave surfer Eddie Aikau who became the symbol of Aloha and celebration of Hawaiian culture. The documentary premiered on [[ESPN]] on October 1, 2013 and won an '''Emmy for Best Sports Documentary Series''', making it one of the few surf-related films to ever receive such recognition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2014/05/29/hawaii-news/hawaiian-the-legend-of-eddie-aikau-wins-emmy-award/|title=Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau|last=|first=|date=2020|website=West Hawaii Today|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The documentary that chronicles Aikau's emergence as a legendary surfer and lifeguard who saved lives but lost his own at sea also won awards for '''Best Picture and Best Director at the Malibu International Film Festival'''; '''Best Picture, Best Documentary and Audience Favorite at the Maui Film Festival''', as well as '''Best Documentary at Surfer Poll'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2014/05/29/hawaii-news/hawaiian-the-legend-of-eddie-aikau-wins-emmy-award/|title=Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddi Akau|last=|first=|date=2020|website=West Hawaii Today|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi's foray into documentary filmmaking began when she teamed with director John Armstrong to produce '''''Bashkaus: Hard Labor in Siberia'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650709/bio|title=Agi Orsi Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' (Discovery Channel), a film that won a '''Gold Medal Living Book Award''' and the '''Grand Prize at the Telluride Mountain Film Festival'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainfilm.org/festival/personalities/john-armstrong|title=John Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=John Armstrong|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> for chronicling the first joint US-Soviet river expedition in Russia's Altai Mountains during a thaw in the Cold War.  Following that, Orsi teamed again with Armstrong to produce '''''Curtain of Ice''''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/curtain-of-ice/oclc/27479917|title=Curtain of Ice|last=|first=|date=|website=World Cat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>(Discovery Channel), documenting the first-on water crossing of the Bering Strait, the \"Curtain of Ice,\" reuniting Eskimos separated for decades during the US-Russia arms escalation. The documentary also tells the story of Jim Noyes, a paraplegic with a broken spine who finds a new purpose for living after making the crossing.

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2011|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary, released in 2009 by Cinema Libre by Cinema Libre<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/clsblog/2013/03/20/lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Lost Angels Now on DVD|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>, was financed for $300,000 by DreamWorks and Universal Pictures and Participant Media, with contributions from the Hilton Foundation and Community Supportive Housing. The film takes a critical look at then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's Safer City Initiative which made it a crime to panhandle, sleep, sit or store personal items on sidewalks and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homeless-losangeles/los-angeles-accused-of-criminalizing-homelessness-idUSTRE56E0MC20090715|title=Los Angeles accused of criminalizing homelessness|last=Gorman|first=Steve|date=2009|website=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Narrated by actress Catherine Keener, Lost Angels points to the success of supportive housing with wrap-around mental health and employment services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/get_involved.html|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is my Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Los Angeles earned recognition for the following awards: '''2011 Voice Award from SAMHSA''' (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) and '''Ghetto Award-Radar Hamburg International Film Festival.''' The documentary was also an official selection for the Los Angeles Film Festival (Premiere), One World Human Rights Film Festival (Prague), Human Rights Film Festival (London), Oaxaca Film Festival, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/assets/lost-angels-press-notes-FINAL.pdf|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans sports and footwear apparel company that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues or gentrified influences to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with personal stories of drug abuse, mental illness, transgender power and undocumented survival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

He is currently the [[head coach]] of [[Sporting Kansas City]] in [[Major League Soccer]]. As of 2018, Vermes is currently the longest tenured head coach in MLS and has won four major trophies as a manager, the second most of all active coaches in [[MLS]].

As a player, Vermes spent several seasons playing in Hungary, the Netherlands, before establishing himself as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] in [[Major League Soccer]], playing for [[MetroStars]], [[Colorado Rapids]] and the [[Kansas City Wizards]].
Vermes was also a regular member of the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] throughout the 1990s, and represented his country at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

On April 4, 2013, Vermes was elected to the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite news|title=Delran native Peter Vermes elected to U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/soccer/Delran_native_Peter_Vermes_elected_to_US_Soccer_Hall_of_Fame.html|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=The Inquirer|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===High school and college===
Vermes was born in [[Willingboro Township, New Jersey|Willingboro, New Jersey]]. He grew up in [[Delran Township, New Jersey]] and played high school soccer at [[Delran High School]].  He graduated in 1984, having scored 109 goals. In 1999, he was named by ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s.<ref>Jandoli, Ron. [https://web.archive.org/web/20030110132039/http://nj.com/hssports/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fhssports%2Fcentury%2Fstories%2Fbsoccerdecades.html \"The Century's Best – Boys Soccer: Top 10 Players of each decade\"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', November 7, 1999, backed up by the [[Internet Archive]] as of January 10, 2003. Accessed September 11, 2008.</ref>

Vermes played his first year in college on the [[Loyola Greyhounds men's soccer|men's soccer team]] at [[Loyola College in Maryland]] under head coach Bill Sento. Vermes then transferred and played three years of [[college soccer]] at [[Rutgers University]], from 1985 to 1987.  In his final season, Vermes scored 21 goals and 10 assists for the team, finishing a first team [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|All-American]], as well as runner-up for the National Player of the Year Award.  During that season, Vermes led Rutgers to their first victory in the NCAA Tournament in 26 years, scoring the winning goal in a contest against [[Seton Hall University]].

===Professional===
After graduating, Vermes would go to Europe, where he played with [[Győri ETO FC|Rába ETO FC]] of Hungary in 1989 and [[FC Volendam|Volendam]] of the Dutch [[Eredivisie]] in 1990.  In May 1991, Vermes returned to the United States and played three games, scoring a single goal against with the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–1993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] of the [[American Professional Soccer League]].  He then moved to Spain where he played for [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Segunda División|Second Division]] club [[UE Figueres|Figueres]] from 1991–1995.

Like many American players, Vermes returned to the United States to join the recently founded domestic league [[Major League Soccer]]. In January 1995, he signed with the new league that would not begin league play until 1996.  Therefore, MLS loaned Vermes to the [[New York Centaurs|New York Fever]] of the [[USL Second Division|USISL]] where he played 25 games, scoring 16 goals in the 1995 season.  In 1996, Vermes was drafted by the [[MetroStars|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]] in the third round of the [[MLS Inaugural Draft]] (29th overall) and captained the team in its first season.  Although he played the most minutes of any MetroStar that year, the MetroStars traded Vermes on February 3, 1997 to the [[Colorado Rapids]] for [[Kerry Zavagnin]].  Vermes would play three years for the Rapids before being traded again, this time to the [[Kansas City Wizards]] with [[Matt McKeon]] for Scott Vermillion and a player [[allocation (MLS)|allocation]].

With the Wizards, Vermes helped the Wizards finish the season first in the league with a 16–7–9 record, having allowed only 29 goals in 32 games, and eventually winning the [[MLS Cup]].  Vermes was recognized as the [[MLS Defender of the Year Award|MLS Defender of the Year]], while his teammate [[Tony Meola]] won both the [[MLS Goalkeeper of the Year]] and [[MLS MVP]] awards.  Vermes played two more seasons with the Wizards, struggling with injuries but playing every game he was healthy for, before announcing his retirement at the end of the 2002 season.

===International===
Vermes received his first cap May 14, 1988 against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], and would in all receive 66 caps for the team, playing in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. In the 1990 World Cup, he nearly bagged a goal against Italy with a shot against Italian goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]]. After seeing his playing time wane with the team in late 1993 and early 1994, Vermes was one of the final cuts from the 1994 U.S. World Cup team.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-28/sports/sp-51473_1_peter-vermes \"Vermes Cut by U.S. Team,\" Los Angeles Times, April 28, 1994.]</ref> He later said he thought that his outspoken comments had doomed him politically.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-11/sports/sp-56307_1_world-cup \"Stunned Armstrong Released by U.S. Team : World Cup: Veteran defender thought he was competing for a starting job before being cut with three others,\" Los Angeles Times, May 11, 1994.]</ref>  A forward early in his career, his performance in defense in MLS led to his comeback to the National team in that position after years of absence, but he was cut again from the U.S. roster in January 1998.<ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-01-17/sports/9801180639_1_world-cup-players-cup-team \"U.S. Team Makes First Cuts,\" Orlando Sentinel, January 17, 1998.]</ref>

Vermes was named the 1988 [[U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year]] and U.S. Olympic Player of the Year.

In 1989, he scored six goals for the U.S. [[Futsal]] team, which took third place, at the [[FIFA Futsal World Championship]] in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. He ended his futsal career with 11 caps and 7 goals.

==Coaching career==

===Kansas City===
Vermes was appointed as the technical Director for the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer in  November 2006.

He was named interim manager of the Wizards on August 4, 2009, one day after predecessor [[Curt Onalfo]] was fired by the team.

==Playing career==

===High school and college===
Vermes was born in [[Willingboro Township, New Jersey|Willingboro, New Jersey]]. He grew up in [[Delran Township, New Jersey]] and played high school soccer at [[Delran High School]].  He graduated in 1984, having scored 109 goals. In 1999, he was named by ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s.<ref>Jandoli, Ron. [https://web.archive.org/web/20030110132039/http://nj.com/hssports/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fhssports%2Fcentury%2Fstories%2Fbsoccerdecades.html \"The Century's Best – Boys Soccer: Top 10 Players of each decade\"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', November 7, 1999, backed up by the [[Internet Archive]] as of January 10, 2003. Accessed September 11, 2008.</ref>

Vermes played his first year in college on the [[Loyola Greyhounds men's soccer|men's soccer team]] at [[Loyola College in Maryland]] under head coach Bill Sento. Vermes then transferred and played three years of [[college soccer]] at [[Rutgers University]], from 1985 to 1987.  In his final season, Vermes scored 21 goals and 10 assists for the team, finishing a first team [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|All-American]], as well as runner-up for the National Player of the Year Award.  During that season, Vermes led Rutgers to their first victory in the NCAA Tournament in 26 years, scoring the winning goal in a contest against [[Seton Hall University]].

===Professional===
After graduating, Vermes would go to Europe, where he played with [[Győri ETO FC|Rába ETO FC]] of Hungary in 1989 and [[FC Volendam|Volendam]] of the Dutch [[Eredivisie]] in 1990.  In May 1991, Vermes returned to the United States and played three games, scoring a single goal against with the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–1993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] of the [[American Professional Soccer League]].  He then moved to Spain where he played for [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Segunda División|Second Division]] club [[UE Figueres|Figueres]] from 1991–1995.

Like many American players, Vermes returned to the United States to join the recently founded domestic league [[Major League Soccer]]. In January 1995, he signed with the new league that would not begin league play until 1996.  Therefore, MLS loaned Vermes to the [[New York Centaurs|New York Fever]] of the [[USL Second Division|USISL]] where he played 25 games, scoring 16 goals in the 1995 season.  In 1996, Vermes was drafted by the [[MetroStars|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]] in the third round of the [[MLS Inaugural Draft]] (29th overall) and captained the team in its first season.  Although he played the most minutes of any MetroStar that year, the MetroStars traded Vermes on February 3, 1997 to the [[Colorado Rapids]] for [[Kerry Zavagnin]].  Vermes would play three years for the Rapids before being traded again, this time to the [[Kansas City Wizards]] with [[Matt McKeon]] for Scott Vermillion and a player [[allocation (MLS)|allocation]].

With the Wizards, Vermes helped the Wizards finish the season first in the league with a 16–7–9 record, having allowed only 29 goals in 32 games, and eventually winning the [[MLS Cup]].  Vermes was recognized as the [[MLS Defender of the Year Award|MLS Defender of the Year]], while his teammate [[Tony Meola]] won both the [[MLS Goalkeeper of the Year]] and [[MLS MVP]] awards.  Vermes played two more seasons with the Wizards, struggling with injuries but playing every game he was healthy for, before announcing his retirement at the end of the 2002 season.

===International===
Vermes received his first cap May 14, 1988 against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], and would in all receive 66 caps for the team, playing in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. In the 1990 World Cup, he nearly bagged a goal against Italy with a shot against Italian goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]]. After seeing his playing time wane with the team in late 1993 and early 1994, Vermes was one of the final cuts from the 1994 U.S. World Cup team.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-28/sports/sp-51473_1_peter-vermes \"Vermes Cut by U.S. Team,\" Los Angeles Times, April 28, 1994.]</ref> He later said he thought that his outspoken comments had doomed him politically.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-11/sports/sp-56307_1_world-cup \"Stunned Armstrong Released by U.S. Team : World Cup: Veteran defender thought he was competing for a starting job before being cut with three others,\" Los Angeles Times, May 11, 1994.]</ref>  A forward early in his career, his performance in defense in MLS led to his comeback to the National team in that position after years of absence, but he was cut again from the U.S. roster in January 1998.<ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-01-17/sports/9801180639_1_world-cup-players-cup-team \"U.S. Team Makes First Cuts,\" Orlando Sentinel, January 17, 1998.]</ref>

Vermes was named the 1988 [[U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year]] and U.S. Olympic Player of the Year.

In 1989, he scored six goals for the U.S. [[Futsal]] team, which took third place, at the [[FIFA Futsal World Championship]] in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. He ended his futsal career with 11 caps and 7 goals.

==Coaching career==

===Kansas City===
Vermes was appointed as the technical Director for the Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer in  November 2006.

He was named interim manager of the Wizards on August 4, 2009, one day after predecessor [[Curt Onalfo]] was fired by the team. The team was in sixth place in the MLS Eastern Conference with a 5–6–7 record.<ref>[http://kc.wizards.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20090804&content_id=6237082&vkey=news_kcw&fext=.jsp&team=t105 \"Vermes named Wizards interim coach,\" Kansas City Wizards Media Relations, Tuesday, August 4, 2009.]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Vermes would lead to the Wizards to a 3–7–2 record down the stretch.
Following the season, the Wizards removed the interim tag from his title.<ref>[http://www.soccerbyives.net/soccer_by_ives/2009/11/kansas-city-wizards-to-name-peter-vermes-head-coach.html \"Kansas City Wizards to name Peter Vermes head coach,\" Soccer by Ives, Tuesday, November 10, 2009.]</ref> As of 2020, Vermes is currently the longest tenured manager/head coach in the MLS.

The following year, Vermes led the club to the [[MLS Cup 2013|MLS Cup]], where they beat [[Real Salt Lake]], also in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. This makes him the only person to ever win the [[MLS Cup]] as both a player and a coach with the same team.<ref name=\"MLS Cup Coach and Player\">{{cite web|last=Brisendine|first=Steve|title=MLS Cup: Sporting Kansas City's Peter Vermes happy to reward hard-luck fans|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/mlscup/2013/news/article/2013/12/07/mls-cup-sporting-kansas-citys-peter-vermes-happy-reward-hard-luck-fans|work=MLSsoccer.com|publisher=Major League Soccer|accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref>

Vermes won his third trophy as Sporting KC manager when his side won the [[2015 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] by defeating the [[Philadelphia Union]] on penalties at [[Talen Energy Stadium]]. Two years later, Vermes added the [[2017 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup]] to his trophy haul when Sporting KC beat the [[New York Red Bulls]] 2–1 at [[Children's Mercy Park]].

On August 4, 2018, Vermes coached his 302nd regular-season match – a 1–0 victory over the [[Houston Dynamo]] – becoming the all-time leader in games coached with one club in [[MLS]] history.

===Other coaching and activities===

==Personal life==

Vermes's parents immigrated to the United States from [[Hungary]] as refugees during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 revolution]]. His father, Michael, was a professional footballer for [[Budapest Honvéd FC]] and operated an [[indoor soccer]] training center in [[New Jersey]] after immigrating.

remove extraneous space,safe,Hog Farm,"'''Michigan Stove Company''', which was based in [[Detroit, Michigan]], manufactured cooking stoves, heaters, and furnaces in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The company was known for its use of up-to-date technology in [[foundry]] applications. The company was considered to be the world's largest producer of stoves and ranges, and had branch offices in many large U.S. cities, as well as global distribution arrangements.

== History ==
[[File:Michigan Stove Company.png|thumb|Michigan Stove Company in Detroit showing Garland stove factory in 1891]]

The Michigan Stove Company was founded before the [[American Civil War]], when Americans cooked and heated their homes with an open [[hearth]]. This old technology was inefficient, costly, and dangerous. A few modern stoves for the elite and wealthy started to appear in Detroit in the 1830s. All stoves from the 1840s to the 1860s were made and shipped from [[New York City|New York]] via the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name=MIstoveBusiness/> [[Jeremiah Dwyer]] had apprenticed and worked for several years in New York to learn the stove business. In 1861, he and his  younger brother James bought out a failing Detroit [[reaper]] manufacturer that was trying to make stoves. They brought in [[Thomas W. Misner]] and their new firm became J. Dwyer & Company. There was a large demand for cooking and heating stoves at the time and the Dwyers became successful due to their stove-making skills. The Dwyer brothers were the first foundry operators in the [[midwestern United States]] to use modern engineering foundry techniques to make stoves.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}<ref name=WhenStovesWereHot>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= When stoves were the hot new thing|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |page=9  |location=Detroit, Michigan|date= January 24, 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Fuller|1899|page=254}} 

[[File:GarlandStoveAd.jpg|thumb|Garland stove advertisement, circa 1900|left]]
The first stoves made by the J. Dwyer & Company were sold to local residents through personal solicitation.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} In 1863, Misner sold his equity in the firm to [[William H. Tefft]] and [[Merrill I. Mills]].{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}{{sfn|Founding|1920|page=163}} Dwyer became acquainted with [[Charles DuCharme]], a wealthy Detroit man who sold him [[pig iron]] and materials so he could make his stoves.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} DuCharme invested in the company, which they incorporated as a stock company in 1864 and became the Detroit Stove Works.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}<ref name=InvestorDuCharme>{{cite web |url= https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/detroit-stove-works|title=Encyclopedia Of Detroit – Detroit Stove Works|publisher= Detroit Historical Society |accessdate=January 7, 2020}}</ref> The company's founders were Jeremiah Dwyer, James Dwyer, Merrill I Mills, Edwin S. Barbour, and William H. Tefft.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} The company made  a variety of cooking and heating stoves, which it marketed under their \"Jewel\" brand{{sfn|Loomis|2016|page=99}} and at its peak employed a thousand workers.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}

Dwyer was a compulsive worker and expanded the facilities at the Detroit Stove Works.{{sfn|Founding|1920|page=163}} Because of his exposure to the foundry's polluted air, he contracted a [[pulmonary disease]]{{sfn|Taylor|1909|page=417}} and was compelled to leave the foundry business for a while in 1869. Dwyer sold his ownership in the company to his brother and Edwin S Barbour, and went to live in the [[southern United States]].{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} He later returned to Detroit after his health recovered and again became active in the foundry business. Dwyer started the Michigan Stove Company with other investors in 1871.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}<ref name=InvestorDuCharme/>{{sfn|Taylor|1909|page=417}}

[[File:Employeesofmichstove1872.jpg|thumb|Michigan Stove Company employees in 1872]]
Dwyer's partners in the Michigan Stove Company were Charles DuCharme, [[Francis Palms]], Richard Long Sr., Merrill I. Mills, and [[George Harrison Barbour]].{{sfn|Founding|1920|page=163}} DuCharme became the president, Dwyer its vice president and general manager, Mills its treasurer, and Barbour its secretary. The company began manufacturing stoves, heaters, and furnaces on September 12, 1872. They first made \"Argand\" brand stove and paid a [[royalty payment|royalty]] to [[Perry & Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], for the rights to make their style and brand.{{sfn|Molders|1910|page=291}} Michigan Stove Company discontinued making \"Argand\" stoves and started making its own style of stoves, which were branded \"Garland\", in 1876.{{sfn|Depew|1895|page=359}} This name was chosen because Dwyer did not want to lose the customers who were loyal to the \"Argand\" brand stoves so chose a similar-sounding name for the company's new brand.{{sfn|Shaw|1907|page=622}}

There was a major fire at the Michigan Stove Company on January 8, 1907. It started in the evening and within a few hours had destroyed the manufacturing plant. The damage was estimated at $500,000, of which $400,000 was covered by insurance. The 2,200 men working at the factory became unemployed. The fire was first noticed at the coal-hopper in the engine room by the night watchman; within fifteen minutes it had spread to the center of the building. The fire department was notified but it was out of control by the time firefighters began hosing down the building. Thousands of Detroit residents soon arrived to watch the fire and had to be controlled by police. The [[World's Largest Stove|oversized replica stove]] being displayed adjacent to the factory was damaged as one of the plant’s six-story walls fell on it. The factory's inventory of 20,000 stoves were destroyed.<ref name=1907Fire>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Michigan Stove Co's Plant swept by fire; 1 dead, 6 are injured|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |page=1|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4695138/1907-michigan-stove-company-fire-big/  |location=Detroit, Michigan|date= January 9, 1907}}</ref>

The company had over a thousand employees and the value of its yearly production was about three-and-a-half million dollars.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} The company had few labor disputes because of Dwyer's diplomacy; during his presidency he would personally see them at his private office or their shop to resolve work issues.{{sfn|Carter|1920|page=12}} Most problems were settled amicably and the company became a [[union shop]].{{sfn|Feurer|2017|page=99}}

Michigan Stove Company's Oak Garland \"J\" series heater was intended for burning [[natural gas]], coal, [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], and wood. The company claimed any fuel could be used without modifications to the heater's body. When it burned natural gas, a ring of [[Gas burner|orifices]] was placed above the ash pit—a feature unique to this model. The placement of the gas-burning ring then required no modifications in the [[Firebox (architecture)|firebox]] construction so it could burn coal, coke, and wood as was originally intended for the main unit. The gas ring construction provided efficient heating; it extracted most of the heat because the gas was [[Superheating|superheated]] before being ignited. This heater was constructed with smooth, [[cold-rolled iron]] and a cast-iron body.{{sfn|Williams|1903|page=54}}

[[Category:Defunct organizations based in Michigan]]","'''Michigan Stove Company''', which was based in [[Detroit, Michigan]], manufactured cooking stoves, heaters, and furnaces in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . The company was known for its use of up-to-date technology in [[foundry]] applications. The company was considered to be the world's largest producer of stoves and ranges, and had branch offices in many large U.S. cities, as well as global distribution arrangements.

== History ==
[[File:Michigan Stove Company.png|thumb|Michigan Stove Company in Detroit showing Garland stove factory in 1891]]

The Michigan Stove Company was founded before the [[American Civil War]], when Americans cooked and heated their homes with an open [[hearth]]. This old technology was inefficient, costly, and dangerous. A few modern stoves for the elite and wealthy started to appear in Detroit in the 1830s. All stoves from the 1840s to the 1860s were made and shipped from [[New York City|New York]] via the [[Erie Canal]] and the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name=MIstoveBusiness/> [[Jeremiah Dwyer]] had apprenticed and worked for several years in New York to learn the stove business. In 1861, he and his  younger brother James bought out a failing Detroit [[reaper]] manufacturer that was trying to make stoves. They brought in [[Thomas W. Misner]] and their new firm became J. Dwyer & Company. There was a large demand for cooking and heating stoves at the time and the Dwyers became successful due to their stove-making skills. The Dwyer brothers were the first foundry operators in the [[midwestern United States]] to use modern engineering foundry techniques to make stoves.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}<ref name=WhenStovesWereHot>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= When stoves were the hot new thing|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |page=9  |location=Detroit, Michigan|date= January 24, 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Fuller|1899|page=254}} 

[[File:GarlandStoveAd.jpg|thumb|Garland stove advertisement, circa 1900|left]]
The first stoves made by the J. Dwyer & Company were sold to local residents through personal solicitation.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} In 1863, Misner sold his equity in the firm to [[William H. Tefft]] and [[Merrill I. Mills]].{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}{{sfn|Founding|1920|page=163}} Dwyer became acquainted with [[Charles DuCharme]], a wealthy Detroit man who sold him [[pig iron]] and materials so he could make his stoves.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} DuCharme invested in the company, which they incorporated as a stock company in 1864 and became the Detroit Stove Works.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}<ref name=InvestorDuCharme>{{cite web |url= https://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/detroit-stove-works|title=Encyclopedia Of Detroit – Detroit Stove Works|publisher= Detroit Historical Society |accessdate=January 7, 2020}}</ref> The company's founders were Jeremiah Dwyer, James Dwyer, Merrill I Mills, Edwin S. Barbour, and William H. Tefft.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} The company made  a variety of cooking and heating stoves, which it marketed under their \"Jewel\" brand{{sfn|Loomis|2016|page=99}} and at its peak employed a thousand workers.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}

Dwyer was a compulsive worker and expanded the facilities at the Detroit Stove Works.{{sfn|Founding|1920|page=163}} Because of his exposure to the foundry's polluted air, he contracted a [[pulmonary disease]]{{sfn|Taylor|1909|page=417}} and was compelled to leave the foundry business for a while in 1869. Dwyer sold his ownership in the company to his brother and Edwin S Barbour, and went to live in the [[southern United States]].{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}} He later returned to Detroit after his health recovered and again became active in the foundry business. Dwyer started the Michigan Stove Company with other investors in 1871.{{sfn|Burton|1922|page=546}}<ref name=InvestorDuCharme/>{{sfn|Taylor|1909|page=417}}

[[File:Employeesofmichstove1872.jpg|thumb|Michigan Stove Company employees in 1872]]
Dwyer's partners in the Michigan Stove Company were Charles DuCharme, [[Francis Palms]], Richard Long Sr., Merrill I. Mills, and [[George Harrison Barbour]].{{sfn|Founding|1920|page=163}} DuCharme became the president, Dwyer its vice president and general manager, Mills its treasurer, and Barbour its secretary. The company began manufacturing stoves, heaters, and furnaces on September 12, 1872. They first made \"Argand\" brand stove and paid a [[royalty payment|royalty]] to [[Perry & Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], for the rights to make their style and brand.{{sfn|Molders|1910|page=291}} Michigan Stove Company discontinued making \"Argand\" stoves and started making its own style of stoves, which were branded \"Garland\", in 1876.{{sfn|Depew|1895|page=359}} This name was chosen because Dwyer did not want to lose the customers who were loyal to the \"Argand\" brand stoves so chose a similar-sounding name for the company's new brand.{{sfn|Shaw|1907|page=622}}

There was a major fire at the Michigan Stove Company on January 8, 1907. It started in the evening and within a few hours had destroyed the manufacturing plant. The damage was estimated at $500,000, of which $400,000 was covered by insurance. The 2,200 men working at the factory became unemployed. The fire was first noticed at the coal-hopper in the engine room by the night watchman; within fifteen minutes it had spread to the center of the building. The fire department was notified but it was out of control by the time firefighters began hosing down the building. Thousands of Detroit residents soon arrived to watch the fire and had to be controlled by police. The [[World's Largest Stove|oversized replica stove]] being displayed adjacent to the factory was damaged as one of the plant’s six-story walls fell on it. The factory's inventory of 20,000 stoves were destroyed.<ref name=1907Fire>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= Michigan Stove Co's Plant swept by fire; 1 dead, 6 are injured|newspaper=Detroit Free Press |page=1|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4695138/1907-michigan-stove-company-fire-big/  |location=Detroit, Michigan|date= January 9, 1907}}</ref>

Michigan Stove Company's Oak Garland \"J\" series heater was intended for burning [[natural gas]], coal, [[Coke (fuel)|coke]], and wood. The company claimed any fuel could be used without modifications to the heater's body. When it burned natural gas, a ring of [[Gas burner|orifices]] was placed above the ash pit—a feature unique to this model. The placement of the gas-burning ring then required no modifications in the [[Firebox (architecture)|firebox]] construction so it could burn coal, coke, and wood as was originally intended for the main unit. The gas ring construction provided efficient heating; it extracted most of the heat because the gas was [[Superheating|superheated]] before being ignited. This heater was constructed with smooth, [[cold-rolled iron]] and a cast-iron body.{{sfn|Williams|1903|page=54}}

'''Porto Torres''' ({{lang-sdc|Posthudorra}}, {{lang-sc|Portu Turre}}) is a ''[[comune]]'' and city in the [[Province of Sassari]], northern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]].

It is situated on the north-west coast about {{convert|25|km|mi}} east of ''Capo del Falcone'' and in the center of the [[Gulf of Asinara]].

Founded during the [[1st century BC|1st century b.C]] with the name of ''Colonia [[Julia (gens)|Iulia]] Turris Libisonis, It was the first [[Roman Empire|roman]] settlement of the entire [[Sardinia|island]].''

<br />

==Geography==
Porto Torres' territory is situated on the north-west part of Sardinian Coast.

The extension of municipality is almost 10200 hectare and is subdivided in two parts, with almost the same extension.
One part includes the city, the industrial area and the Roman ruins; the latter is formed by the [[Asinara]] island with the smaller Isola Piana. This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].

The morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.

The communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].

==History==

[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]
In ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. § 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>

The ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.

[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].

Torres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842. At the time the area which had been built around the basilica of San Gavino joined the fishermen's community near the port to form the new ''Porto Torres''.

On 10th of May 1942 [[Benito Mussolini]] has visited the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fondoluce.archivioluce.com/LuceUnesco/avanzata/scheda/foto/IL3000006141/12/Mussolini-a-Porto-Torres.html?luoghi=Porto%20Torres|title=Mussolini a Porto Torres - Cinecittà Luce - Unesco|website=fondoluce.archivioluce.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>

'''Porto Torres''' ({{lang-sdc|Posthudorra}}, {{lang-sc|Portu Turre}}) is a ''[[comune]]'' and city in the [[Province of Sassari]], northern [[Sardinia]], [[Italy]].

It is situated on the north-west coast about {{convert|25|km|mi}} east of the Gorditanian promontory (Capo del Falcone), and on the spacious bay of the [[Gulf of Asinara]].

==Geography==
Porto Torres' territory is situated on the north-west part of Sardinian Coast.

The extension of municipality is almost 10200 hectare and is subdivided in two parts, with almost the same extension.
One part includes the city, the industrial area and the Roman ruins; the latter is formed by the [[Asinara]] island with the smaller Isola Piana. This part of territory is, since 1997, [[Asinara National Park|a national park]].

The morphology of \"city part\" is flat; the area of Porto Torres and the rest part of north-west Sardinia is characterized by a [[Nurra]] flat, there are some hill formation in the middle of the flat. Part of this hill formation is in Porto Torres' territory and the highest elevation of it is Monte Alvaro with it thickness of 342&nbsp;m.

The communal territory is crossed by two rivers, Rio Mannu and Fiume Santo. The first draws the edge of Porto Torres territory on west, while instead the latter flows near the city and was used as a fluvial way as early as the [[ancient Rome|Roman age]].

==History==

[[File:Roman bridge of Turris Libisonis, Porto Torres, Sardinia (16557754949).jpg|thumb|left|Roman bridge.]]
In ancient times, '''Turris Libyssonis''' was one of the most considerable cities in Sardinia. It was probably of purely [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] origin, founded apparently by [[Julius Caesar]], as it bore the title ''Colonia Julia''.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis>{{EB1911|wstitle=Turris Libisonis|inline=1}}</ref>  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] described it as a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]], the only on the island in his time, suggesting that there was previously no town on the spot, but merely a fort or ''castellum''.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Plin. iii. 12. s. 17.</ref> It is noticed also by [[Ptolemy]] and in the [[Antonine Itinerary|Itineraries]], but without any indication that it was a place of any importance.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: Ptol. iii. 3. § 5; Itin. Ant. p.&nbsp;83.</ref>

The ancient remains still existing prove that it must have been a considerable town under the [[Roman Empire]]. According to inscriptions on ancient milestones, the principal road through the island ran directly from Caralis ([[Cagliari]]) to Turris, a sufficient proof that the latter was a place much frequented. Indeed, two roads, which diverged at Othoca (modern [[Santa Giusta]]) connected Caralis to Turris, the more important keeping inland and the other following the west coast.<ref name=EB1911TurrisLibisonis/> It was also an [[episcopal see]] during the early part of the Middle Ages.

[[File:San Gavino Aussenansicht.JPG|Basilica of San Gavino|thumb|left|401x401px]]The existing port at Porto Torres, which is almost wholly artificial, is based in great part on Roman foundations; and there exist also the remains of a temple (which, as we learn from an inscription, was dedicated to Fortune, and restored in the reign of [[Philip the Arab|Philip]]), of ''[[Roman bath|thermae]]'', of a basilica and an aqueduct, as well as a bridge over the adjoining small river, still called the ''Fiume Turritano''. The ancient city continued to be inhabited till the 11th century, when the greater part of the population migrated to [[Sassari]], about {{convert|15|km|mi|0}} inland, and situated on a hill.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1857|p=1241}} Cites: De la Marmora, ''Voy. en Sardaigne'', vol. ii. pp.&nbsp;363,468-72; Smyth's Sardinia, pp.&nbsp;263-66.</ref> It was partly under [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] hands before, in the early 15th century, it was conquered by the [[house of Aragon|Aragonese]]. After the Spanish rule it was part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]].

Torres was separated from the comune of Sassari in 1842. At the time the area which had been built around the basilica of San Gavino joined the fishermen's community near the port to form the new ''Porto Torres''.

On 10th of May 1942 [[Benito Mussolini]] has visited the town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fondoluce.archivioluce.com/LuceUnesco/avanzata/scheda/foto/IL3000006141/12/Mussolini-a-Porto-Torres.html?luoghi=Porto%20Torres|title=Mussolini a Porto Torres - Cinecittà Luce - Unesco|website=fondoluce.archivioluce.com|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>

Announced in mid-2015 under the [[working title]] ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter'', the game is considered a departure from the previous games, which took place in a security office. Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights.

Upon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 4'' is the only game in the entire series that has no spoken dialogue. The fifth installment, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]'', was released on October 7, 2016.

Unlike previous ''Five Nights at Freddy's'' games, the game is not set in a security office, but in a child's bedroom; there are also no [[Closed-circuit television|security cameras]] and instead of \"Phone Guy\", the player is given on-screen instructions to help the player during the game.<ref name=\"KotakuAll\">{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-five-nights-at-freddys-4-so-f-1720003919 | title=Everything We Know About Five Nights at Freddy's 4 (So Far) | publisher=Kotaku | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Hernandez, Patricia}}</ref> The player is equipped with a flashlight, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second game]], although the light has unlimited power.<ref name= \"Destruct\">{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-five-nights-at-freddy-s-4-296612.phtml | title=Review: Five Nights at Freddy's 4 | publisher=[[Destructoid]] | date=July 24, 2015 | accessdate=July 25, 2015 | author=Rowen, Nic}}</ref> It can be used to ward away any animatronics seen down the hallway; however, if the player hears either Nightmare Bonnie's or Nightmare Chica's breathing at the door or they see Nightmare Fredbear or Nightmare upon turning on the flashlight, they must immediately close the door. Despite this, the door will eventually open ajar as the player walks away. The player must also monitor the closet to avoid getting attacked by Nightmare Foxy by closing it if necessary, similar to the [[Five Nights at Freddy's|first game]], as well as shooing three miniature animatronics nicknamed 'Freddles' by the FNAF community off the bed before they, once all three are together, summon Nightmare Freddy to attack the player. If the player is not careful in shining the light towards the hallways or leaves the doors, closet and bed unattended for too long, the player will be [[jumpscare]]d, leading to a [[game over]].

After beating each night, the player may play a timed minigame titled \"Fun with Plushtrap\" (In Halloween update, Plushtrap is replaced by Nightmare Balloon Boy) in which a plush edition of Springtrap, the central animatronic in ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]'', must be lured to the top of an \"X\" marked on the ground within a specific amount of time. If the player wins, the player will start the next night at 2:00 A.M. Like the nightmare animatronics, this timed minigame becomes more challenging as the game progresses. The time bonus does not apply to the unlockable modes. Additionally, if the player gets a game over, the bonus is no longer valid for further plays of the same level.

Like previous games, the game's main storyline takes place over five increasingly-difficult nights with unlockable extra levels. The first four nights will put the player against four animatronics: Nightmare Freddy, Nightmare Bonnie, Nightmare Chica and Nightmare Foxy (Nightmare Mangle in Halloween update). Nightmare Fredbear, who combines the scare tactics of the previous four, is the sole attacker on the fifth night. Completing all five nights will unlock an additional sixth night, where the four animatronics will haunt the player until Nightmare Fredbear takes over when the clock hits 4 AM. Completing the sixth night will unlock the \"Nightmare\" night, where the animatronics are very persistent and Nightmare Fredbear is replaced by the highly aggressive Nightmare, who has a unique game over screen compared to other animatronics. A secret code will unlock an eighth night or called as 20/20/20/20 mode based on the Custom Night modes from the first two games, which sets the [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] of the animatronics to maximum difficulty. Other unlockables include galleries of the various animatronics and jumpscares, as well as behind-the-scenes looks at the 3D-modelling process for Fredbear and Foxy.<ref name=\"Extras\">{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon| publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene =Extras menu| quote = }}</ref>

As in most of the previous entries of the series, the story of the game is revealed in interactive [[Retrogaming|Atari-style]] minigame sections between nights. Each of the minigames are set in a time frame corresponding to the five nights, beginning with \"5 days until the party\", up to \"0 days until the party.\"

== Plot ==
The game starts with a minigame which shows a child (different from the child in the main gameplay) who is locked in his bedroom with plush toys, which he calls his only friends.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Five Nights at Freddy's 4|developer=Scott Cawthon|publisher=|platform=[[Personal computer|PC]]|scene=Night 1 prologue|date=July 23, 2015|quote='''Boy:''' These are my friends.}}</ref> After the player survives the first night, the boy's Fredbear plush tells him that \"he\" (the boy's older brother) is hiding in the house, before the boy is jumpscared by him, who is wearing a Foxy mask.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 2 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' Now he is hiding again. He won't stop until you find him.}}</ref> After the second night, the boy is abandoned at the pizzeria (implied to be the Fredbear's Family Diner briefly mentioned in the [[Five Nights at Freddy's 2|second]] game), only to be warned by Fredbear's voice that \"he\" is coming and that he must be brave; however, since the boy is afraid of the animatronics and costumed mascots, he ends up bawling. An [[Easter egg (interaction design)|easter egg]] during this scene briefly shows William Afton from the second and [[Five Nights at Freddy's 3|third]] games fitting someone into the Spring Bonnie suit.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 3 prologue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're too late. Hurry the other way and find someone who will help! You know what will happen if he catches you! You can find help if you can get past them. You need to be strong.}}</ref>

After the third night, the minigame reveals that other children tease the boy, calling him a coward and crybaby,<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 4 prologue| quote = '''Boy 1:''' Aren't you the kid who always hides under the table and cries?

I hear they come to life at night. And if you die, they hide your body and never tell anyone.}}</ref> The boy sees his plush toys as his only friends and generally eschews interaction with other people in favor of them. Another easter egg in this minigame establishes the time period, via a commercial or TV show named \"''Fredbear and Friends''\" dated 1983. After the fourth night, it is revealed that he was once locked in the building's parts and services room as a prank.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 prologue| quote = '''You:''' Please let me out. PLEASE! Please let me out...}}</ref> If the fifth night is completed, the boy is shown crying at his birthday party in the pizzeria, with his brother (alongside other bullies) wearing the masks of the animatronics to terrorize the boy.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Your Brother's Friend:''' Wow, your brother is kind of a baby, isn't he? / '''Your Brother:''' It's hilarious.}}</ref> The bullies, deciding to prank the boy, grab him and try to get him close to the Fredbear animatronic's mouth for a \"kiss,\"<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Your Brother:''' Why don't we help him get a closer look!

I don't want to go! / '''Your Brother:''' You heard the little man! He wants to get even closer! Ha ha ha!}}</ref> and end up stuffing the boy's head into the animatronic's mouth.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 5 epilogue| quote = '''Your Brother:''' Hey guys, I think the little man said he wants to give Fredbear a big kiss! On THREE! One...two...}}</ref> Suddenly, Fredbear, who was in the middle of singing, forcefully closes his mouth, due to the boy's tears activating the spring locks, and crushes the boy's head while the brother and his friends stare in sheer horror, realizing their mistake.
 
After the sixth night, the boy hears his older brother apologizing to him<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Voice:''' Can you hear me? I don't know if you can hear me. I'm sorry.}}</ref> as Fredbear promises him that no matter how many times he \"breaks,\" he and the others will always be there to \"put him back together\" and will always be his friends.<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Fredbear:''' You're broken. We're still your friends. Do you still believe that? I'm still here. I will put you back together.}}</ref> The characters then fade out one by one, and the faint sound of a [[electrocardiography|heart monitor]] flatlining can be heard, death of the boy and ending the minigames. Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear.

10 years later, the older brother (most likely Mike Schmidt from the first game) is having nightmares after getting fired from the pizzeria, as many things confirm.

If the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game states that \"Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now.\"<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Nightmare epilogue}}</ref> Cawthon remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he would not disclose what was in it. He gave only one clue: \"What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together.\"

Throughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.

== Development and release ==
Beginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter''. The images, featuring the characters from the series, cryptically teased at a release on Halloween.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/28/five-nights-at-freddys-4-release-date/ | title = Five Night’s at Freddy’s 4 teased for Halloween release | first =Brenna | last = Hillier | date = April 28, 2015 | accessdate = May 16, 2015 | work = [[VG247]]|publisher = Videogaming 247 Ltd. }}</ref> A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game took place in the main character's house.

On October 31, 2015, two updates for the game were released. One consists of a set of cheat options, challenge modes, and an altered version of the \"Fun with Plushtrap\" minigame that uses a nightmare version of the character Balloon Boy (from ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'') in place of Plushtrap. The second is a \"Halloween Edition\" that makes cosmetic changes to Nightmare Bonnie and Nightmare Chica, and introduces nightmare versions of the ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2'''s characters Mangle and The Puppet, (known as Nightmarionne in-game) the former replacing Nightmare Foxy and the latter replacing Nightmare. Nightmare Chica's cupcake is also replaced with a [[Jack-o-Lantern]].

Announced in mid-2015 under the [[working title]] ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter'', the game is considered a departure from the previous games, which took place in a security office. Instead, the game takes place in a child's bedroom, placing an emphasis on timing and auditory warnings to complete nights.

Upon release, the game received polarizing reviews from critics; praise centered on its unsettling atmosphere, while others were divided over the game's new mechanics. ''Five Nights at Freddy's 4'' is the only game in the entire series that has no spoken dialogue. The fifth installment, ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]'', was released on October 7, 2016.

After the sixth night, the boy hears his older brother apologizing to him<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Night 6 epilogue| quote = '''Voice:''' Can you hear me?

We're still your friends. Do you still believe that? I'm still here. I will put you back together.}}</ref> The characters then fade out one by one, and the faint sound of a [[electrocardiography|heart monitor]] flatlining can be heard, death of the boy and ending the minigames. Following this, the player unlocks Nightmare mode, which is the same as the sixth night with the exception of a new animatronic, Nightmare, a more aggressive version of Nightmare Fredbear.


10 years later, the older brother (Most likely Mike Schmidt from the first game) is having nightmares after getting fired from the pizzeria, as many things confirm.

If the player completes Nightmare mode, an image of a locked metal trunk is displayed; if the player wiggles the padlocks, the game states that \"Perhaps some things are best left forgotten, for now.\"<ref>{{cite video game| title = Five Nights at Freddy's 4| developer = Scott Cawthon | publisher = | date = July 23, 2015| platform = [[Personal computer|PC]]| scene = Nightmare epilogue}}</ref> Cawthon remained cryptic about what is inside the trunk, and eventually announced that he would not disclose what was in it. He gave only one clue: \"What's in the box? It's the pieces [of the franchise's story] put together.\"


Throughout the game, if the screen is brightened or the player looks closely enough, the progression of the fate of the child can be seen through objects next to the bed. When the player turns to the bed, looking to the left of the Freddy plush, three objects appear at different points in time: a bottle of pills, an IV drip, and a vase of flowers.

== Development and release ==
Beginning April 27, 2015, Cawthon posted images on his website teasing at another game in the series, originally known as ''Five Nights at Freddy's: The Final Chapter''. The images, featuring the characters from the series, cryptically teased at a release on Halloween.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2015/04/28/five-nights-at-freddys-4-release-date/ | title = Five Night’s at Freddy’s 4 teased for Halloween release | first =Brenna | last = Hillier | date = April 28, 2015 | accessdate = May 16, 2015 | work = [[VG247]]|publisher = Videogaming 247 Ltd. }}</ref> A trailer was released on July 13, 2015, hinting that the game took place in the main character's house.

On October 31, 2015, two updates for the game were released. One consists of a set of cheat options, challenge modes, and an altered version of the \"Fun with Plushtrap\" minigame that uses a nightmare version of the character Balloon Boy (from ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 2]]'') in place of Plushtrap. The second is a \"Halloween Edition\" that makes cosmetic changes to Nightmare Bonnie and Nightmare Chica, and introduces nightmare versions of the ''Five Nights at Freddy's 2'''s characters Mangle and The Puppet, (known as Nightmarionne in-game) the former replacing Nightmare Foxy and the latter replacing Nightmare. Nightmare Chica's cupcake is also replaced with a [[Jack-o-Lantern]].

'''David Lee Marks''' (born August 22, 1948) is an American guitarist who was an early member of [[the Beach Boys]]. Marks was a neighborhood friend of the original band members while growing up in [[Hawthorne, California]], and was a frequent participant at the Wilson family Sunday night singalongs.<ref name=\"Stebbins, p. 18\">Stebbins, p. 18</ref> Following his initial departure from the group, Marks fronted the Marksmen and performed and recorded as a [[session musician]].

Marks joined the Beach Boys in February 1962. Since he did not appear on the 1961 single \"[[Surfin']]\", the first performance by the band that would become \"the Beach Boys\", most historians discount him as a true founding member of the group.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}} He performed on the band's first four albums, ''[[Surfin' Safari]]'' (1962), ''[[Surfin' U.S.A.]]'' (1963), ''[[Surfer Girl]]'' (1963), and ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'' (1963).  In August 1963, personal issues with manager [[Murry Wilson]] caused Marks to leave the group.<ref name=\"Stebbins-Marks\">{{cite book | last = Stebbins |first = Jon |author2=David Marks | title = The Lost Beach Boy | publisher = Virgin Books | location = London | year = 2007 | page =104 | isbn = 978-1-85227-391-0}}</ref> Afterward, Marks worked with acts including [[Casey Kasem]]'s Band Without a Name, the Moon, [[Delaney & Bonnie]], Colours, and [[Warren Zevon]], and studied [[jazz guitar|jazz]] and [[classical guitar]] at the [[Berklee College of Music]] and the [[New England Conservatory]].

From 1997 to 1999, Marks returned to the Beach Boys for their live performances. In 2007, he released an autobiography, entitled ''The Lost Beach Boy''. In 2012, he reunited with the group to record ''[[That's Why God Made the Radio]]''. Marks also joined the band on its 2012 [[The 50th Reunion Tour| fiftieth-anniversary tour]]. Following the tour's completion, Marks continued working with Wilson and Jardine on Wilson's solo performances and 2015 studio album, ''[[No Pier Pressure]]''.

==Biography==

===Early years===
At age seven, David Lee Marks moved into a house across the street from the family home of the three Wilson brothers, [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]], later to become the founding members of The Beach Boys.<ref name=northsalemdv >{{cite web|last=Pacchiana|first=Katherine|title=North Salem's Beach Boy David Marks - Good Vibes|url=http://northsalem.dailyvoice.com/neighbors/north-salems-beach-boy-david-marks-good-vibes|publisher=The North Salem Daily Voice|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> Marks is [[American Jews|Jewish American.]]<ref>The Secret Jewish History of the Beach Boys – The Forward

The houses were older and the Wilsons lived in a pretty small, modest two-bedroom home. The boys all shared a bedroom. When they got older, Brian started sleeping in the den more and more, which was a converted garage they had turned into a music room. They had a [[Hammond B-3]] organ, an upright piano, and a little hi-fi in there.\"<ref name=\"rock cellar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/09/04/david-marks-beach-boys-interview-in-his-own-words/#sthash.mZg6t7y5.dpbs |title=David Marks of the Beach Boys – In His Own Words (Interview) |first=Ken |last=Sharp |work=rockcellarmagazine.com |accessdate=23 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928080422/http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/09/04/david-marks-beach-boys-interview-in-his-own-words/#sthash.mZg6t7y5.dpbs |archive-date=28 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As the 1950s progressed Marks sang and played music with the Wilson family at their Sunday night singalongs.<ref name=\"Stebbins, p. 18\"/> Inspired by a 1958 performance by guitarist [[John Walker (musician)|John Maus]] (later of the 1960s [[The Walker Brothers|Walker Brothers]]),  Marks asked his parents to buy him a guitar, which they did on Christmas Eve, 1958.<ref name=northsalemdv />  He began taking lessons from Maus, who had been a student of [[Ritchie Valens]].<ref>Stebbins, p. 20</ref>

In 1959, Marks and Brian Wilson's youngest brother Carl had begun to develop their own style of playing [[electric guitars]].<ref>Stebbins, p. 22</ref>  Brian realized that the combination of Carl and Marks' playing brought a rock guitar sound to his original compositions, and the two teenagers participated in Brian's first songwriting efforts that led to the band's 1963 hit single \"[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]\".<ref>Stebbins, pp. 25–26</ref>

Marks was not on the Beach Boys first recording, \"[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]\" for [[Candix Records]] on October 16, 1961; this roster included [[Al Jardine]], a high school classmate of Brian Wilson's who had been singing and playing [[stand-up bass]] with the Wilson brothers and their cousin [[Mike Love]].<ref name=\"Leaf\">{{cite book | last = Leaf | first = David | title = The Beach Boys and the California Myth | publisher = Kingsport Press | location = Kingsport, Tennessee | year = 1978 | page = 27 | isbn = 0-89471-412-0}}</ref>  Over the next couple of months, Brian experimented with various combinations of musicians, including his mother Audree Wilson, but was not able to secure interest from a major label.

===The Beach Boys===
[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|Marks (far left) performing with The Beach Boys in November 1962]]

In mid-February 1962, a new line-up was established, excluding Al Jardine who had left for dentistry school. On April 16, 1962, the Beach Boys recorded a demo session at Western Recorders that produced the masters for the songs, \"[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]\" and \"[[409 (song)|409]]\" that would become the band's first double-sided hit, landing them a long-term contract with Capitol Records.

According to biographer [[Jon Stebbins]], Marks's guitar chemistry with Carl Wilson changed the sound of the band. Writing about the difference between the Beach Boys' Candix Records single and their first Capitol Records release, Stebbins stated: <blockquote>Compared to 'Surfin{{`}}', this was metal. No sign of stand-up bass or folk sensibility on this recording. And the tiny amateurish guitar sound and lazy feel of the [earlier demo] World Pacific version of 'Surfin' Safari' had now transformed into something crisp and modern. \"It was Carl and Dave who brought that electric guitar drive into the band\", says Al Jardine.  \"And because of that, Brian was able to expand a little bit.\"</blockquote>

Marks would continue to sing and play rhythm guitar with the Beach Boys long enough to record on the first four (plus) albums, including the early hit singles \"Surfin' Safari\", \"409\", \"[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]\", \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]]\", \"Surfer Girl\", \"[[In My Room]]\", and \"[[Be True to Your School]]\".  Marks also played over 100 concerts with the Beach Boys, toured across the United States with them, and appeared on their first string of national TV appearances.   While his time in the band was relatively short, Marks contributed to their tightly-knit foundational sound, as well as their youthful look on the early Beach Boys' album covers.

Although it is often assumed that Marks left the Beach Boys because Jardine wanted to return to the band, this was not the case.  Marks and Jardine were both part of the 1963 Beach Boys touring line-up.  Jardine initially returned on a part-time basis to fill-in on bass for Brian Wilson, who had already begun to detach himself from the touring band as early as the spring of 1963.

At the height of their first initial wave of international success, Marks quit the Beach Boys in late August 1963 toward the end of the group's summer tour during an argument with [[Murry Wilson]], the Wilson boys' father and the band's manager, but did not immediately leave the band until later that year when his parents and Murry came to blows over financial and managerial issues.  The first show without Marks on guitar was October 19, 1963,<ref>[http://members.tripod.com/~fun_fun_fun/11-1-63.html Beach Boys Concert-October 19, 1963]. Members.tripod.com (1963-10-19). Retrieved on 2013-08-25.</ref> though he would stay friends and be in close contact with various band members for many years, and he would remain, unbeknownst to him, a legal member of the Beach Boys until September 27, 1967.<ref name=\"Stebbins-Marks\"/>

===Post-Beach Boys career===
In February 1963, Dennis Wilson was injured in a car accident and his replacement was Mark Groseclose, who went to high school with Carl Wilson. Marks and Groseclose became friends and Marks eventually took over Groseclose's garage band, the Jaguars, which he renamed the Marksmen. The band was initially a side project for the aspiring songwriter, who was growing tired of his songs being passed over for Beach Boys records by Murry Wilson.

After Marks left the Beach Boys, the Marksmen became his full-time focus, becoming one of the first acts to be signed to [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]] in 1964. Murry Wilson reportedly threatened radio deejays in order to keep them from playing the Marksmen's records.<ref>Stebbins, pp. 113–118</ref> Later, the group signed with (and released a single on) [[Warner Bros. Records]], but in spite of packed concert venues up and down the state of California, lack of airplay precluded any further releases. The 2009 release of ''Marks & the Marksmen Ultimate Collector’s Edition 1963–1965'' marks the first-time the entire Marksmen catalog was made available to the public.

In 1966, Marks played with [[Casey Kasem]]'s Band Without a Name. He then worked with the late 1960s [[psychedelic pop]] band, The Moon, along with Matt Moore, Larry Brown, and David Jackson. The band signed a production deal with producer [[Mike Curb]] and released two under-promoted albums on the Imperial label.<ref>Stebbins, pp. 146–154</ref>  He also performed with [[Delaney and Bonnie]], Colours (recording lead guitar on their second album), and [[Warren Zevon]].<ref>Stebbins, p. 158</ref> By the time Marks was 21 years old, he had been signed to five label deals and had grown disillusioned with the Los Angeles music scene. In 1969, he relocated to [[Boston]], where he studied [[jazz guitar|jazz]] and [[classical guitar]] as a private student at the [[Berklee College of Music]] and the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] in 1970–71.

===1971–present===
In early 1971, after reuniting onstage in Boston with the Beach Boys, despite a public and chilly reception from Bruce Edwards, Marks received an offer from Mike Love to rejoin the band, but he declined.<ref>Stebbins, pp. 172–174</ref> Instead, he spent the next 25 years playing with artists like [[Buzz Clifford]], [[Daniel Moore (musician)|Daniel Moore]] (writer of \"My Maria\" and \"Shambala\"), [[Gary Montgomery]], [[Jim Keltner]], [[Carl Radle]], [[Leon Russell]], drummer-turned-actor [[Gary Busey]], [[Delbert McClinton]], [[Warren Zevon]], and many others, earning a reputation as a solid session guitarist without cashing in on his notoriety as having been a Beach Boy. Marks briefly played lead guitar for [[Delaney & Bonnie|Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]], but was let go and replaced by [[Eric Clapton]]. Marks was also offered the lead guitarist spot in Paul Revere and the Raiders, but turned down the offer because he did not want to dress up in a revolutionary war-era costume every time he played a show. Marks was a close friend of Warren Zevon for many years until they had a falling-out. In 1988, when the Beach Boys were inducted into [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Marks was neither invited nor acknowledged at the ceremony, an oversight which was finally rectified in 2007.

Marks eventually rejoined the Beach Boys as a full-time member playing lead guitar in 1997, when Carl Wilson, fighting cancer, was unable to continue touring with the group. After playing another 300 shows as an official Beach Boy again, Marks left the band for a second time in 1999 due to his own health issues when he was diagnosed with [[hepatitis C]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Celebrity Health – David Marks|work = BBC News|date = 2008-05-23|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7414433.stm|accessdate = 2011-10-11}}</ref>

Marks became a leader in the hepatitis C community, often appearing in the media to raise awareness of the disease.<ref>Stebbins, p. 228</ref>  In 2007, Marks co-wrote ''The Lost Beach Boy'' with Stebbins, which detailed his early career and related his \"lost years\", his health problems, his musical development, and his recovery and acceptance within the Beach Boys community.

On May 20, 2005, the original Beach Boys six-man line-up (including both Marks and Jardine) was memorialized on the [[Beach Boys Historic Landmark]] in [[Hawthorne, California]].  The following year, on June 13, 2006, Marks gathered with surviving Beach Boys Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Mike Love, and Bruce Johnston on the roof of the landmark Capitol Records building in Hollywood, where all five were presented with an RIAA [[Platinum record]] Award in recognition of two million in sales of the Beach Boys CD song collection ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]''.<ref>Stebbins, p. 236</ref>  In 2008, following the release of a career retrospective, ''The Lost Years'' (released to coincide with his book), he toured the UK as a \"special guest\" with the Beach Boys.  He also performed with Jardine and [[Dean Torrence]] of [[Jan & Dean]], in the \"Legends of Surf Music\" tour.

[[File:David Marks Solo.jpg|thumb|Performing with the Beach Boys in 2012]]

On December 16, 2011 it was announced that Marks would be reuniting with Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston for [[That's Why God Made the Radio|a new Beach Boys album]] and [[The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour in 2012]]. The group appeared at the 2012 [[Grammy Awards]] on February 12, followed by a 50-date tour that began in [[Tucson, Arizona]] in April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/#tour|title=The Beach Boys|website=The Beach Boys|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> [[Mike Love]] commented on working with Marks once again, stating, \"David rocks. A phenomenal guitarist. When he does those leads on \"[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]\", \"[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]\", and \"[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]\" it's so authentic. He and Carl committed on playing guitar since they were ten years old and were neighbors with each other from across the street in Hawthorne. He's a fantastic musician and a really fantastic guy to be with. He went through his issues with alcohol, but he's completely cooled out for maybe ten years now. It's going to be really great to be with him.\"<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-mike-love-talks-beach-boys-50th-anniversary-tour-20111219#ixzz1h6j7dhlS Mike Love 'Looking Forward' to Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Tour | Music News].

'''David Lee Marks''' (born August 22, 1948) is an American guitarist who was an early member of [[the Beach Boys]]. Marks was a neighborhood friend of the original band members while growing up in [[Hawthorne, California]], and was a frequent participant at the Wilson family Sunday night singalongs.<ref name=\"Stebbins, p. 18\">Stebbins, p. 18</ref> Following his initial departure from the group, Marks fronted the Marksmen and performed and recorded as a [[session musician]].

Marks joined the Beach Boys in February 1962. Since he did not appear on the 1961 single \"[[Surfin']]\", the first performance by the band that would become \"the Beach Boys\", most historians discount him as a true founding member of the group.{{sfn|Stebbins|2011}} He performed on the band's first four albums, ''[[Surfin' Safari]]'' (1962), ''[[Surfin' U.S.A.]]'' (1963), ''[[Surfer Girl]]'' (1963), and ''[[Little Deuce Coupe]]'' (1963).  In August 1963, personal issues with manager [[Murry Wilson]] caused Marks to leave the group.<ref name=\"Stebbins-Marks\">{{cite book | last = Stebbins |first = Jon |author2=David Marks | title = The Lost Beach Boy | publisher = Virgin Books | location = London | year = 2007 | page =104 | isbn = 978-1-85227-391-0}}</ref> Afterward, Marks worked with acts including [[Casey Kasem]]'s Band Without a Name, the Moon, [[Delaney & Bonnie]], Colours and [[Warren Zevon]], and studied [[jazz guitar|jazz]] and [[classical guitar]] at the [[Berklee College of Music]] and the [[New England Conservatory]].

From 1997 to 1999, Marks returned to the Beach Boys for their live performances. In 2007, he released an autobiography, entitled ''The Lost Beach Boy''. In 2012, he reunited with the group to record ''[[That's Why God Made the Radio]]''. Marks also joined the band on its 2012 [[The 50th Reunion Tour| fiftieth-anniversary tour]]. Following the tour's completion, Marks continued working with Wilson and Jardine on Wilson's solo performances and 2015 studio album, ''[[No Pier Pressure]]''.

==Biography==

===Early years===
At age seven, David Lee Marks moved into a house across the street from the family home of the three Wilson brothers, [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]], and [[Carl Wilson]], later to become the founding members of The Beach Boys.<ref name=northsalemdv >{{cite web|last=Pacchiana|first=Katherine|title=North Salem's Beach Boy David Marks - Good Vibes|url=http://northsalem.dailyvoice.com/neighbors/north-salems-beach-boy-david-marks-good-vibes|publisher=The North Salem Daily Voice|accessdate=25 July 2012}}</ref> Marks is [[American Jews|Jewish American.]]<ref>The Secret Jewish History of the Beach Boys – The Forward

As almost everyone knows, The Beach Boys—who find themselves on tour this summer—were primarily a family group, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} the brothers Wilson—Brian, Dennis ...\"</ref><ref>\"Good vibrations: The Beach Boys still get around\".

The houses were older and the Wilsons lived in a pretty small, modest two-bedroom home. The boys all shared a bedroom. When they got older, Brian started sleeping in the den more and more, which was a converted garage they had turned into a music room. They had a [[Hammond B-3]] organ, an upright piano, and a little hi-fi in there.\"<ref name=\"rock cellar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/09/04/david-marks-beach-boys-interview-in-his-own-words/#sthash.mZg6t7y5.dpbs |title=David Marks of the Beach Boys – In His Own Words (Interview) |first=Ken |last=Sharp |work=rockcellarmagazine.com |accessdate=23 November 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928080422/http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/09/04/david-marks-beach-boys-interview-in-his-own-words/#sthash.mZg6t7y5.dpbs |archive-date=28 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As the 1950s progressed Marks sang and played music with the Wilson family at their Sunday night singalongs.<ref name=\"Stebbins, p. 18\"/> Inspired by a 1958 performance by guitarist [[John Walker (musician)|John Maus]] (later of the 1960s [[The Walker Brothers|Walker Brothers]]),  Marks asked his parents to buy him a guitar, which they did on Christmas Eve, 1958.<ref name=northsalemdv />  He began taking lessons from Maus, who had been a student of [[Ritchie Valens]].<ref>Stebbins, p. 20</ref>

In 1959, Marks and Brian Wilson's youngest brother Carl had begun to develop their own style of playing [[electric guitars]].<ref>Stebbins, p. 22</ref>  Brian realized that the combination of Carl and Marks' playing brought a rock guitar sound to his original compositions, and the two teenagers participated in Brian's first songwriting efforts that led to the band's 1963 hit single \"[[Surfer Girl (song)|Surfer Girl]]\".<ref>Stebbins, pp. 25–26</ref>

Marks was not on the Beach Boys first recording, \"[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]\" for [[Candix Records]] on October 16, 1961; this roster included [[Al Jardine]], a high school classmate of Brian Wilson's who had been singing and playing [[stand-up bass]] with the Wilson brothers and their cousin [[Mike Love]].<ref name=\"Leaf\">{{cite book | last = Leaf | first = David | title = The Beach Boys and the California Myth | publisher = Kingsport Press | location = Kingsport, Tennessee | year = 1978 | page = 27 | isbn = 0-89471-412-0}}</ref>  Over the next couple of months, Brian experimented with various combinations of musicians, including his mother Audree Wilson, but was not able to secure interest from a major label.

===The Beach Boys===
[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|Marks (far left) performing with The Beach Boys in November 1962]]

In mid-February 1962, a new line-up was established, excluding Al Jardine who had left for dentistry school. On April 16, 1962, the Beach Boys recorded a demo session at Western Recorders that produced the masters for the songs, \"[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]\" and \"[[409 (song)|409]]\" that would become the band's first double-sided hit, landing them a long-term contract with Capitol Records.

According to biographer [[Jon Stebbins]], Marks's guitar chemistry with Carl Wilson changed the sound of the band. Writing about the difference between the Beach Boys' Candix Records single and their first Capitol Records release, Stebbins stated: <blockquote>Compared to 'Surfin{{`}}', this was metal. No sign of stand-up bass or folk sensibility on this recording. And the tiny amateurish guitar sound and lazy feel of the [earlier demo] World Pacific version of 'Surfin' Safari' had now transformed into something crisp and modern. \"It was Carl and Dave who brought that electric guitar drive into the band\", says Al Jardine.  \"And because of that, Brian was able to expand a little bit.\"</blockquote>

Marks would continue to sing and play rhythm guitar with the Beach Boys long enough to record on the first four (plus) albums, including the early hit singles \"Surfin' Safari\", \"409\", \"[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]\", \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]]\", \"Surfer Girl\", \"[[In My Room]]\", and \"[[Be True to Your School]]\".  Marks also played over 100 concerts with the Beach Boys, toured across the United States with them, and appeared on their first string of national TV appearances.   While his time in the band was relatively short, Marks contributed to their tightly-knit foundational sound, as well as their youthful look on the early Beach Boys' album covers.

Although it is often assumed that Marks left the Beach Boys because Jardine wanted to return to the band, this was not the case.  Marks and Jardine were both part of the 1963 Beach Boys touring line-up.  Jardine initially returned on a part-time basis to fill-in on bass for Brian Wilson, who had already begun to detach himself from the touring band as early as the spring of 1963.

At the height of their first initial wave of international success, Marks quit the Beach Boys in late August 1963 toward the end of the group's summer tour during an argument with [[Murry Wilson]], the Wilson boys' father and the band's manager, but did not immediately leave the band until later that year when his parents and Murry came to blows over financial and managerial issues.  The first show without Marks on guitar was October 19, 1963,<ref>[http://members.tripod.com/~fun_fun_fun/11-1-63.html Beach Boys Concert-October 19, 1963]. Members.tripod.com (1963-10-19). Retrieved on 2013-08-25.</ref> though he would stay friends and be in close contact with various band members for many years, and he would remain, unbeknownst to him, a legal member of the Beach Boys until September 27, 1967.<ref name=\"Stebbins-Marks\"/>

===Post-Beach Boys career===
In February 1963, Dennis Wilson was injured in a car accident and his replacement was Mark Groseclose, who went to high school with Carl Wilson. Marks and Groseclose became friends and Marks eventually took over Groseclose's garage band, the Jaguars, which he renamed the Marksmen. The band was initially a side project for the aspiring songwriter, who was growing tired of his songs being passed over for Beach Boys records by Murry Wilson.

After Marks left the Beach Boys, the Marksmen became his full-time focus, becoming one of the first acts to be signed to [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]] in 1964. Murry Wilson reportedly threatened radio deejays in order to keep them from playing the Marksmen's records.<ref>Stebbins, pp. 113–118</ref> Later, the group signed with (and released a single on) [[Warner Bros. Records]], but in spite of packed concert venues up and down the state of California, lack of airplay precluded any further releases. The 2009 release of ''Marks & the Marksmen Ultimate Collector’s Edition 1963–1965'' marks the first-time the entire Marksmen catalog was made available to the public.

In 1966, Marks played with [[Casey Kasem]]'s Band Without a Name. He then worked with the late 1960s [[psychedelic pop]] band, The Moon, along with Matt Moore, Larry Brown, and David Jackson. The band signed a production deal with producer [[Mike Curb]] and released two under-promoted albums on the Imperial label.<ref>Stebbins, pp. 146–154</ref>  He also performed with [[Delaney and Bonnie]], Colours (recording lead guitar on their second album), and [[Warren Zevon]].<ref>Stebbins, p. 158</ref> By the time Marks was 21 years old, he had been signed to five label deals and had grown disillusioned with the Los Angeles music scene. In 1969, he relocated to [[Boston]], where he studied [[jazz guitar|jazz]] and [[classical guitar]] as a private student at the [[Berklee College of Music]] and the [[New England Conservatory of Music]] in 1970–71.

===1971–present===
In early 1971, after reuniting onstage in Boston with the Beach Boys, despite a public and chilly reception from Bruce Edwards, Marks received an offer from Mike Love to rejoin the band, but he declined.<ref>Stebbins, pp. 172–174</ref> Instead, he spent the next 25 years playing with artists like [[Buzz Clifford]], [[Daniel Moore (musician)|Daniel Moore]] (writer of \"My Maria\" and \"Shambala\"), [[Gary Montgomery]], [[Jim Keltner]], [[Carl Radle]], [[Leon Russell]], drummer-turned-actor [[Gary Busey]], [[Delbert McClinton]], [[Warren Zevon]], and many others, earning a reputation as a solid session guitarist without cashing in on his notoriety as having been a Beach Boy. Marks briefly played lead guitar for [[Delaney & Bonnie|Delaney & Bonnie and Friends]], but was let go and replaced by [[Eric Clapton]]. Marks was also offered the lead guitarist spot in Paul Revere and the Raiders, but turned down the offer because he did not want to dress up in a revolutionary war-era costume every time he played a show. Marks was a close friend of Warren Zevon for many years until they had a falling-out. In 1988, when the Beach Boys were inducted into [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Marks was neither invited nor acknowledged at the ceremony, an oversight which was finally rectified in 2007.

Marks eventually rejoined the Beach Boys as a full-time member playing lead guitar in 1997, when Carl Wilson, fighting cancer, was unable to continue touring with the group. After playing another 300 shows as an official Beach Boy again, Marks left the band for a second time in 1999 due to his own health issues when he was diagnosed with [[hepatitis C]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Celebrity Health – David Marks|work = BBC News|date = 2008-05-23|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7414433.stm|accessdate = 2011-10-11}}</ref>

Marks became a leader in the hepatitis C community, often appearing in the media to raise awareness of the disease.<ref>Stebbins, p. 228</ref>  In 2007, Marks co-wrote ''The Lost Beach Boy'' with Stebbins, which detailed his early career and related his \"lost years\", his health problems, his musical development, and his recovery and acceptance within the Beach Boys community.

On May 20, 2005, the original Beach Boys six-man line-up (including both Marks and Jardine) was memorialized on the [[Beach Boys Historic Landmark]] in [[Hawthorne, California]].  The following year, on June 13, 2006, Marks gathered with surviving Beach Boys Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, Mike Love, and Bruce Johnston on the roof of the landmark Capitol Records building in Hollywood, where all five were presented with an RIAA [[Platinum record]] Award in recognition of two million in sales of the Beach Boys CD song collection ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]''.<ref>Stebbins, p. 236</ref>  In 2008, following the release of a career retrospective, ''The Lost Years'' (released to coincide with his book), he toured the UK as a \"special guest\" with the Beach Boys.  He also performed with Jardine and [[Dean Torrence]] of [[Jan & Dean]], in the \"Legends of Surf Music\" tour.

[[File:David Marks Solo.jpg|thumb|Performing with the Beach Boys in 2012]]

On December 16, 2011 it was announced that Marks would be reuniting with Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston for [[That's Why God Made the Radio|a new Beach Boys album]] and [[The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour in 2012]]. The group appeared at the 2012 [[Grammy Awards]] on February 12, followed by a 50-date tour that began in [[Tucson, Arizona]] in April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/#tour|title=The Beach Boys|website=The Beach Boys|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> [[Mike Love]] commented on working with Marks once again, stating, \"David rocks. A phenomenal guitarist. When he does those leads on \"[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin']]\", \"[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]\", and \"[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]\" it's so authentic. He and Carl committed on playing guitar since they were ten years old and were neighbors with each other from across the street in Hawthorne. He's a fantastic musician and a really fantastic guy to be with. He went through his issues with alcohol, but he's completely cooled out for maybe ten years now. It's going to be really great to be with him.\"<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-mike-love-talks-beach-boys-50th-anniversary-tour-20111219#ixzz1h6j7dhlS Mike Love 'Looking Forward' to Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Tour | Music News].

"days shoulde be 2 not zero, as shown in previous table",safe,K.roditakis,"[[File:spearman fig1.svg|300px|thumb|A Spearman correlation of 1 results when the two variables being compared are monotonically related, even if their relationship is not linear. This means that all data points with greater ''x'' values than that of a given data point will have greater ''y'' values as well. In contrast, this does not give a perfect Pearson correlation.]][[File:spearman fig2.svg|300px|thumb|When the data are roughly elliptically distributed and there are no prominent outliers, the Spearman correlation and Pearson correlation give similar values.]]
[[File:spearman fig3.svg|300px|thumb|The Spearman correlation is less sensitive than the Pearson correlation to strong outliers that are in the tails of both samples. That is because Spearman's ρ limits the outlier to the value of its rank.]]
In [[statistics]], '''Spearman's rank correlation coefficient''' or '''Spearman's ρ''', named after [[Charles Spearman]] and often denoted by the Greek letter [[rho (letter)|<math>\\rho</math>]] (rho) or as <math>r_s</math>, is a [[Nonparametric statistics|nonparametric]] measure of [[rank correlation]] ([[correlation and dependence|statistical dependence]] between the [[ranking]]s of two [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|variables]]). It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a [[monotonic]] function.

The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation]] between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.

Intuitively, the Spearman correlation between two variables will be high when observations have a similar (or identical for a correlation of 1) [[Ranking (statistics)|rank]] (i.e. relative position label of the observations within the variable: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) between the two variables, and low when observations have a dissimilar (or fully opposed for a correlation of −1) rank between the two variables.

Spearman's coefficient is appropriate for both [[continuous variable|continuous]] and discrete [[ordinal variable]]s.<ref>[[Level of measurement#Typology|Scale types]].</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Jmp For Basic Univariate And Multivariate Statistics: A Step-by-step Guide |last=Lehman |first=Ann |publisher=SAS Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-59047-576-8 |location=Cary, NC |page=123}}</ref> Both Spearman's <math>\\rho</math> and [[Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient|Kendall's <math>\\tau</math>]] can be formulated as special cases of a more [[general correlation coefficient]].

==Definition and calculation==
The Spearman correlation coefficient is defined as the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]] between the [[Ranking|rank variables]].<ref name=\"myers2003\">{{Cite book | last1=Myers | first1=Jerome L. | first2=Arnold D. |last2= Well | title=Research Design and Statistical Analysis | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum | year=2003 | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-8058-4037-7 | pages=508}}</ref>

For a sample of size ''n'', the ''n'' [[raw score]]s <math>X_i, Y_i</math> are converted to ranks <math>\\operatorname{rg} X_i, \\operatorname{rg} Y_i</math>, and <math>r_s</math> is computed as

: <math>
 r_s =
 \\rho_{\\operatorname{rg}_X,\\operatorname{rg}_Y} =
 \\frac{\\operatorname{cov}(\\operatorname{rg}_X, \\operatorname{rg}_Y)}
      {\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X} \\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y}},
</math>

where
: <math>\\rho</math> denotes the usual [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]], but applied to the rank variables,
: <math>\\operatorname{cov}(\\operatorname{rg}_X, \\operatorname{rg}_Y)</math> is the [[covariance]] of the rank variables,
: <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X}</math> and <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y}</math> are the [[standard deviation]]s of the rank variables.

Only if all ''n'' ranks are ''distinct integers'', it can be computed using the popular formula

: <math>r_s = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)},</math>

where
: <math>d_i = \\operatorname{rg}(X_i) - \\operatorname{rg}(Y_i)</math> is the difference between the two ranks of each observation,
: ''n'' is the number of observations.

Identical values are usually<ref>{{cite book | last=Dodge | first=Yadolah | date=2010 | title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Statistics | publisher=Springer-Verlag New York  | page=502 | isbn=978-0-387-31742-7 }}</ref> each assigned [[Ranking#Fractional ranking .28.221 2.5 2.5 4.22 ranking.29|fractional ranks]] equal to the average of their positions in the ascending order of the values, which is equivalent to averaging over all possible permutations.

If ties are present in the data set, the simplified formula above yields incorrect results: Only if in both variables all ranks are distinct, then <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X} \\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y} = \\operatorname{Var}{\\operatorname{rg}_X} = \\operatorname{Var}{\\operatorname{rg}_Y} = (n^2 - 1)/12</math> (calculated according to biased variance).
The first equation — normalizing by the standard deviation — may be used even when ranks are normalized to [0,&nbsp;1] (\"relative ranks\") because it is insensitive both to translation and linear scaling.
<!-- For example, if [1,2,3,4,5] vs. [1,3,3,3,5] has r_s=0.894, but the simplified formula yields 0.877. -->

The sign of the Spearman correlation indicates the direction of association between ''X'' (the independent variable) and ''Y'' (the dependent variable).  If  ''Y'' tends to increase when ''X'' increases, the Spearman correlation coefficient is positive.  If ''Y'' tends to decrease when ''X'' increases, the Spearman correlation coefficient is negative.  A Spearman correlation of zero indicates that there is no tendency for ''Y'' to either increase or decrease when ''X'' increases.  The Spearman correlation increases in magnitude as ''X'' and ''Y'' become closer to being perfectly monotone functions of each other.  When ''X'' and ''Y'' are perfectly monotonically related, the Spearman correlation coefficient becomes 1.  A perfectly monotone increasing relationship implies that for any two pairs of data values {{math|''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''X''<sub>''j''</sub>, ''Y''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, that {{math|''X''<sub>''i''</sub> − ''X''<sub>''j''</sub>}} and {{math|''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> − ''Y''<sub>''j''</sub>}} always have the same sign.  A perfectly monotone decreasing relationship implies that these differences always have opposite signs.

The Spearman correlation coefficient is often described as being \"nonparametric\".  This can have two meanings.  First, a perfect Spearman correlation results when ''X'' and ''Y'' are related by any [[monotonic function]]. Contrast this with the Pearson correlation, which only gives a perfect value when ''X'' and ''Y'' are related by a ''linear'' function. The other sense in which the Spearman correlation is nonparametric in that its exact sampling distribution can be obtained without requiring knowledge (i.e., knowing the parameters) of the [[joint probability distribution]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.

With <math>d^2_i</math> found, add them to find <math>\\sum d_i^2 = 194</math>. The value of ''n'' is 10. These values can now be substituted back into the equation

to give

: <math>\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\times 194}{10(10^2 - 1)},</math>

which evaluates to {{math|1=''ρ'' = −29/165 = −0.175757575...}} with a [[p-value|''p''-value]] = 0.627188 (using the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]]).

[[File:Spearman's Rank chart.png|thumb|Chart of the data presented. It can be seen that there might be a negative correlation, but that the relationship does not appear definitive.]]
That the value is close to zero shows that the correlation between IQ and hours spent watching TV is very low, although the negative value suggests that the longer the time spent watching television the lower the IQ. In the case of ties in the original values, this formula should not be used; instead, the Pearson correlation coefficient should be calculated on the ranks (where ties are given ranks, as described above {{Where|date=February 2018}}).

==Determining significance==
One approach to test whether an observed value of ''ρ'' is significantly different from zero (''r'' will always maintain {{nowrap|−1 ≤ ''r'' ≤ 1}}) is to calculate the probability that it would be greater than or equal to the observed ''r'', given the [[null hypothesis]], by using a [[Resampling (statistics)#Permutation tests|permutation test]]. An advantage of this approach is that it automatically takes into account the number of tied data values in the sample and the way they are treated in computing the rank correlation.

Another approach parallels the use of the [[Fisher transformation]] in the case of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. That is, [[confidence intervals]] and [[hypothesis test]]s relating to the population value ''ρ'' can be carried out using the Fisher transformation:

: <math>F(r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\frac{1 + r}{1 - r} = \\operatorname{arctanh} r.</math>

If ''F''(''r'') is the Fisher transformation of ''r'', the sample Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and ''n'' is the sample size, then

: <math>z = \\sqrt{\\frac{n - 3}{1.06}} F(r)</math>

is a [[standard score|''z''-score]] for ''r'', which approximately follows a standard [[normal distribution]] under the [[null hypothesis]] of [[statistical independence]] ({{math|1=''ρ'' = 0}}).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Choi |first=S. C. |year=1977 |title=Tests of Equality of Dependent Correlation Coefficients |journal=[[Biometrika]] |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=645–647 |doi=10.1093/biomet/64.3.645 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Fieller |first=E.

One can also test for significance using

: <math>t = r \\sqrt{\\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^2}},</math>

A generalization of the Spearman coefficient is useful in the situation where there are three or more conditions, a number of subjects are all observed in each of them, and it is predicted that the observations will have a particular order.  For example, a number of subjects might each be given three trials at the same task, and it is predicted that performance will improve from trial to trial.  A test of the significance of the trend between conditions in this situation was developed by E. B. Page<ref>{{cite journal |author=Page, E. B. |title=Ordered hypotheses for multiple treatments: A significance test for linear ranks |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=58 |pages=216–230 |year=1963 |doi=10.2307/2282965 |issue=301 |jstor=2282965 }}</ref> and is usually referred to as [[Page's trend test]] for ordered alternatives.

==Correspondence analysis based on Spearman's ρ==
Classic [[correspondence analysis]] is a statistical method that gives a score to every value of two nominal variables. In this way the Pearson [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] between them is maximized.

There exists an equivalent of this method, called [[grade correspondence analysis]], which maximizes Spearman's ρ or [[Kendall's τ]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Kowalczyk |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Pleszczyńska |editor2-first=E. |editor3-last=Ruland |editor3-first=F. | year=2004 |title=Grade Models and Methods for Data Analysis with Applications for the Analysis of Data Populations |series=Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing |volume=151 |publisher=Springer Verlag |location=Berlin Heidelberg New York |isbn=978-3-540-21120-4}}</ref>

This means that all data points with greater ''x'' values than that of a given data point will have greater ''y'' values as well.

In [[statistics]], '''Spearman's rank correlation coefficient''' or '''Spearman's ρ''', named after [[Charles Spearman]] and often denoted by the Greek letter [[rho (letter)|<math>\\rho</math>]] (rho) or as <math>r_s</math>, is a [[Nonparametric statistics|nonparametric]] measure of [[rank correlation]] ([[correlation and dependence|statistical dependence]] between the [[ranking]]s of two [[Variable (mathematics)#Applied statistics|variables]]). It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a [[monotonic]] function.

The Spearman correlation between two variables is equal to the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation]] between the rank values of those two variables; while Pearson's correlation assesses linear relationships, Spearman's correlation assesses monotonic relationships (whether linear or not). If there are no repeated data values, a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.

Intuitively, the Spearman correlation between two variables will be high when observations have a similar (or identical for a correlation of 1) [[Ranking (statistics)|rank]] (i.e. relative position label of the observations within the variable: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) between the two variables, and low when observations have a dissimilar (or fully opposed for a correlation of −1) rank between the two variables.

Spearman's coefficient is appropriate for both [[continuous variable|continuous]] and discrete [[ordinal variable]]s.<ref>[[Level of measurement#Typology|Scale types]].</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Jmp For Basic Univariate And Multivariate Statistics: A Step-by-step Guide |last=Lehman |first=Ann |publisher=SAS Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-59047-576-8 |location=Cary, NC |page=123}}</ref> Both Spearman's <math>\\rho</math> and [[Kendall tau rank correlation coefficient|Kendall's <math>\\tau</math>]] can be formulated as special cases of a more [[general correlation coefficient]].

==Definition and calculation==
The Spearman correlation coefficient is defined as the [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]] between the [[Ranking|rank variables]].<ref name=\"myers2003\">{{Cite book | last1=Myers | first1=Jerome L. | first2=Arnold D. |last2= Well | title=Research Design and Statistical Analysis | publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum | year=2003 | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-8058-4037-7 | pages=508}}</ref>

For a sample of size ''n'', the ''n'' [[raw score]]s <math>X_i, Y_i</math> are converted to ranks <math>\\operatorname{rg} X_i, \\operatorname{rg} Y_i</math>, and <math>r_s</math> is computed as

: <math>
 r_s =
 \\rho_{\\operatorname{rg}_X,\\operatorname{rg}_Y} =
 \\frac{\\operatorname{cov}(\\operatorname{rg}_X, \\operatorname{rg}_Y)}
      {\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X} \\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y}},
</math>

where
: <math>\\rho</math> denotes the usual [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|Pearson correlation coefficient]], but applied to the rank variables,
: <math>\\operatorname{cov}(\\operatorname{rg}_X, \\operatorname{rg}_Y)</math> is the [[covariance]] of the rank variables,
: <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X}</math> and <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y}</math> are the [[standard deviation]]s of the rank variables.

Only if all ''n'' ranks are ''distinct integers'', it can be computed using the popular formula

: <math>r_s = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)},</math>

where
: <math>d_i = \\operatorname{rg}(X_i) - \\operatorname{rg}(Y_i)</math> is the difference between the two ranks of each observation,
: ''n'' is the number of observations.

Identical values are usually<ref>{{cite book | last=Dodge | first=Yadolah | date=2010 | title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Statistics | publisher=Springer-Verlag New York  | page=502 | isbn=978-0-387-31742-7 }}</ref> each assigned [[Ranking#Fractional ranking .28.221 2.5 2.5 4.22 ranking.29|fractional ranks]] equal to the average of their positions in the ascending order of the values, which is equivalent to averaging over all possible permutations.

If ties are present in the data set, the simplified formula above yields incorrect results: Only if in both variables all ranks are distinct, then <math>\\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_X} \\sigma_{\\operatorname{rg}_Y} = \\operatorname{Var}{\\operatorname{rg}_X} = \\operatorname{Var}{\\operatorname{rg}_Y} = (n^2 - 1)/12</math> (calculated according to biased variance).
The first equation — normalizing by the standard deviation — may be used even when ranks are normalized to [0,&nbsp;1] (\"relative ranks\") because it is insensitive both to translation and linear scaling.
<!-- For example, if [1,2,3,4,5] vs. [1,3,3,3,5] has r_s=0.894, but the simplified formula yields 0.877. -->

The simplified method should also not be used in cases where the data set is truncated; that is, when the Spearman's correlation coefficient is desired for the top ''X'' records (whether by pre-change rank or post-change rank, or both), the user should use the Pearson correlation coefficient formula given above.<ref name=\"Jaber\">{{Cite book | last1=Al Jaber | first1=Ahmed Odeh | first2=Haifaa Omar  |last2=Elayyan | title=Toward Quality Assurance and Excellence in Higher Education | publisher=River Publishers | year=2018 | isbn=978-87-93609-54-9 | pages=284}}</ref>

With <math>d^2_i</math> found, add them to find <math>\\sum d_i^2 = 194</math>. The value of ''n'' is 10. These values can now be substituted back into the equation

: <math>\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\sum d_i^2}{n(n^2 - 1)}</math>

to give

: <math>\\rho = 1 - \\frac{6 \\times 194}{10(10^2 - 1)},</math>

which evaluates to {{math|1=''ρ'' = −29/165 = −0.175757575...}} with a [[p-value|''p''-value]] = 0.627188 (using the [[Student's t-distribution|''t''-distribution]]).

[[File:Spearman's Rank chart.png|thumb|Chart of the data presented. It can be seen that there might be a negative correlation, but that the relationship does not appear definitive.]]
That the value is close to zero shows that the correlation between IQ and hours spent watching TV is very low, although the negative value suggests that the longer the time spent watching television the lower the IQ. In the case of ties in the original values, this formula should not be used; instead, the Pearson correlation coefficient should be calculated on the ranks (where ties are given ranks, as described above {{Where|date=February 2018}}).

==Determining significance==
One approach to test whether an observed value of ''ρ'' is significantly different from zero (''r'' will always maintain {{nowrap|−1 ≤ ''r'' ≤ 1}}) is to calculate the probability that it would be greater than or equal to the observed ''r'', given the [[null hypothesis]], by using a [[Resampling (statistics)#Permutation tests|permutation test]]. An advantage of this approach is that it automatically takes into account the number of tied data values in the sample and the way they are treated in computing the rank correlation.

Another approach parallels the use of the [[Fisher transformation]] in the case of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. That is, [[confidence intervals]] and [[hypothesis test]]s relating to the population value ''ρ'' can be carried out using the Fisher transformation:

: <math>F(r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\frac{1 + r}{1 - r} = \\operatorname{arctanh} r.</math>

If ''F''(''r'') is the Fisher transformation of ''r'', the sample Spearman rank correlation coefficient, and ''n'' is the sample size, then

: <math>z = \\sqrt{\\frac{n - 3}{1.06}} F(r)</math>

is a [[standard score|''z''-score]] for ''r'', which approximately follows a standard [[normal distribution]] under the [[null hypothesis]] of [[statistical independence]] ({{math|1=''ρ'' = 0}}).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Choi |first=S. C. |year=1977 |title=Tests of Equality of Dependent Correlation Coefficients |journal=[[Biometrika]] |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=645–647 |doi=10.1093/biomet/64.3.645 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Fieller |first=E.

One can also test for significance using

: <math>t = r \\sqrt{\\frac{n - 2}{1 - r^2}},</math>

which is distributed approximately as [[Student's t-distribution|Student's ''t''-distribution]] with {{math|''n'' − 2}} degrees of freedom under the [[null hypothesis]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Press |last2=Vettering |last3=Teukolsky |last4=Flannery |year=1992 |title=Numerical Recipes in C: The Art of Scientific Computing |url=https://archive.org/details/numericalrecipes00pres_0 |url-access=registration |edition=2nd |page=640 |publisher=Cambridge University Press }}</ref> A justification for this result relies on a permutation argument.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kendall |first=M.

A generalization of the Spearman coefficient is useful in the situation where there are three or more conditions, a number of subjects are all observed in each of them, and it is predicted that the observations will have a particular order.  For example, a number of subjects might each be given three trials at the same task, and it is predicted that performance will improve from trial to trial.  A test of the significance of the trend between conditions in this situation was developed by E. B. Page<ref>{{cite journal |author=Page, E. B. |title=Ordered hypotheses for multiple treatments: A significance test for linear ranks |journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association |volume=58 |pages=216–230 |year=1963 |doi=10.2307/2282965 |issue=301 |jstor=2282965 }}</ref> and is usually referred to as [[Page's trend test]] for ordered alternatives.

==Correspondence analysis based on Spearman's ρ==
Classic [[correspondence analysis]] is a statistical method that gives a score to every value of two nominal variables. In this way the Pearson [[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]] between them is maximized.

There exists an equivalent of this method, called [[grade correspondence analysis]], which maximizes Spearman's ρ or [[Kendall's τ]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Kowalczyk |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Pleszczyńska |editor2-first=E. |editor3-last=Ruland |editor3-first=F. | year=2004 |title=Grade Models and Methods for Data Analysis with Applications for the Analysis of Data Populations |series=Studies in Fuzziness and Soft Computing |volume=151 |publisher=Springer Verlag |location=Berlin Heidelberg New York |isbn=978-3-540-21120-4}}</ref>

==Software Implementations==

* [[R (programming language)|R]]'s statistics base-package implements the test [http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/cor.test.html <code>cor.test(x, y, method = \"spearman\")</code>] in its \"stats\" package (also <code>cor(x, y, method = \"spearman\")</code> will work, but without returning the ''p''-value).

The group's first round of matches began on September 12 and its last matches were played on September 20. Most matches were played at the [[Yellow Dragon Sports Center|Yellow Dragon Stadium]] in [[Hangzhou]]. [[Norway women's national football team|Norway]] topped the group, joined in the second round by [[Australia women's national soccer team|Australia]], the only team Germany failed to beat. [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]] surprisingly failed to make the second round.

'''Édouard Kodjovi \"Edem\" Kodjo''' (May 23, 1938 – April 11, 2020), was a [[Togo]]lese politician and diplomat. He was Secretary-General of the [[Organisation of African Unity]]  from 1978 to 1983; later, in Togo, he was a prominent opposition leader after the introduction of multi-party politics. He served as [[Prime Minister of Togo|Prime Minister]] from 1994 to 1996 and again from 2005 to 2006. Kodjo was President of the [[Patriotic Pan-African Convergence]] (CPP).<ref>[http://www.republicoftogo.com/central.php?d=3&i=113&o=1&s=373 \"Une démocratie en bonne santé\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613173912/http://www.republicoftogo.com/central.php?o=1&s=373&d=3&i=113 |date=June 13, 2008 }}, Republicoftogo.com, January 12, 2007 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>  Kodjo died on April 11, 2020, in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicoftogo.com/Toutes-les-rubriques/Politique/Au-revoir-Edouard|title=Au revoir Edouard|date=May 11, 2020|website=République Togolaise|language=fr|url-status=live|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==
Kodjo was born in [[Sokodé]], [[Tchaoudjo|Tchaoudjo Prefecture]], [[French Togoland]] on May 23, 1938.<ref name=CENI>[http://www.cenitogo.tg/listecandidats/AVE.pdf List of candidates in Avé Prefecture in the 2007 election] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911142405/http://www.cenitogo.tg/listecandidats/AVE.pdf |date=September 11, 2008 }}, CENI website {{in lang|fr}}.</ref><ref name=Profil>[http://www.icilome.com/nouvelles/news.asp?id=83&idnews=1906&f= \"Présidentielles 2003 : Profil des candidats\"], iciLome.com, May 16, 2003 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> He had his secondary school education at West Africa Secondary School in Ghana.<ref name=CENI/><ref name=Profil/>

==Political and diplomatic career from the 1960s to the 1980s==
After completing his studies in France, he was an administrator at the ''[[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française]]''<ref name=Profil/> from November 1964 to June 1967. He then returned to Togo and was appointed by President [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]] as Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance in July 1967.<ref name=Visage>[http://www.diastode.org/Echos/invit5629.html \"EDEM KODJO À VISAGE DÉCOUVERT\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217112243/http://www.diastode.org/Echos/invit5629.html |date=February 17, 2005 }}, diastode.org {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> Kodjo participated in the creation of the [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT) ruling party in late 1969 and became the new party's Secretary-General.<ref name=Profil/><ref name=Visage/> He also wrote the \"Green Book\", which served as the ideological basis for the establishment of the RPT's single-party rule.<ref name=CDD>Morten Hagen and Michelle Spearing, [http://www.diastode.org/Droits/cdd.html \"TOGO – STALLED DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902023414/http://www.diastode.org/Droits/cdd.html |date=September 2, 2012 }}, Centre for Democracy & Development, November 28, 2000.</ref> He was removed from his position as RPT Secretary-General in 1971.<ref name=Profil/>

Kodjo served in Eyadéma's government as [[Minister of Finance (Togo)|Minister of Finance]] from 1973 to 1977,<ref>[https://finances.gouv.tg/node/98 Historique du ministère | Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances]</ref> and as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Togo)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1976 to 1978.<ref name=Profil/> He was elected as the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) at its summit in [[Khartoum]] on July 18–22, 1978.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/Fichiers/MFI/PolitiqueDiplomatie/575.asp \"Sommet de l’Union africaine – Durban 2002 (5) : L’OUA, quarante ans d'histoire…\"], rfi.fr, May 16, 2002 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> One of the key issues facing the OAU during Kodjo's five-year tenure was the status of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR), which claimed independence for the former colony of [[Spanish Sahara]], at that time partly occupied by Morocco. Kodjo controversially allowed the SADR to be seated as a member of the OAU on February 28, 1982, over the objections of Morocco and various other African countries that supported the Moroccan position. According to Kodjo, that decision was based simply on the fact that a majority of OAU member states had recognized the SADR, but it led to a serious crisis within the OAU, with a number of member states boycotting OAU meetings.<ref>Stefan Talmon, ''Recognition of Governments in International Law'' (1998), Oxford University Press, page 187.</ref> [[Senegal]]ese President [[Abdou Diouf]] accused Kodjo of \"mischief-making\".<ref>Omar A.

==Political career in the 1990s==
In 1991, a few months before the National Conference, Kodjo returned to Togo and founded a new opposition political party, the [[Togolese Union for Democracy]] (UTD).<ref name=Demo/> On July 20, 1993,<ref name=Chron>[http://www.diastode.org/Droits/tete_chro.html \"Démocratisation à la Togolaise\"], Tètè Tété, 1998 {{in lang|fr}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217151407/http://www.diastode.org/Droits/tete_chro.html |date=December 17, 2008 }}</ref> he was designated by the [[Collective of Democratic Opposition]] (COD II) as its sole candidate for the [[1993 Togolese presidential election|presidential election]] of August 25, 1993,<ref name=Profil/><ref name=Chron/><ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/1993-07-22_Articles_-ITALIE \"Togo. Le collectif de l’opposition\"], ''L'Humanité'', July 22, 1993 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> although [[Gilchrist Olympio]] of the [[Union of the Forces of Change]] (UFC) did not accept this decision.<ref name=Chron/> Along with fellow opposition leaders [[Yawovi Agboyibo]] and [[Djobo Boukari]], Kodjo announced on August 22 that he was withdrawing his candidacy and boycotting the election due to the number of registered voters being considered too high—a possible sign of preparations to rig the election.<ref>John R. Heilbrunn, \"Togo: The National Conference and Stalled Reform\", in ''Political Reform in Francophone Africa'' (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, page 240.</ref>

Along with other opposition leaders, Kodjo pressured Eyadéma to hold a free and fair [[1994 Togolese parliamentary election|parliamentary election in 1994]]. In this election, the [[Action Committee for Renewal]] (CAR) and the UTD together won an initial majority in the [[National Assembly of Togo|National Assembly]],<ref name=South>''Africa South of the Sahara 2004'' (2003), Routledge, page 1,145.</ref><ref name=Named>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D61131F937A15757C0A962958260 \"Togo Premier Named\"], ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1994.</ref> the CAR with 36 seats and the UTD with seven;<ref name=Named/> Kodjo himself won a seat from [[Lomé]].<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2f522,469f38e9c,0.html \"Chronology for Kabre in Togo\"], Minorities at Risk Project, 2004.</ref>  The CAR and UTD initially agreed to nominate CAR President Yawovi Agboyibo as Prime Minister. However, after the election in three constituencies was cancelled, the two parties lost their narrow majority, and Eyadéma invited Kodjo to form a government,<ref name=South/> announcing his appointment as Prime Minister on April 22, 1994;<ref name=Chron/><ref name=Named/> he took office on April 25.<ref name=Chron/> The CAR regarded Kodjo's appointment as a violation of the parties' agreement and refused to participate in his government.<ref name=\"South\"/> His acceptance of the position of Prime Minister, in addition to his earlier role in the establishment of the RPT regime, discredited him in the eyes of many opposition supporters.<ref name=CDD/> His government was announced on May 25, 1994; it included the RPT, the UTD, and some smaller parties not represented in the National Assembly. Although headed by Kodjo, the composition of the government was strongly dominated by the RPT.<ref>\"May 1994 – New government\", ''Keesing's Record of World Events'', volume 40, May 1994, Togo, page 39,995.</ref>

Kodjo served as Prime Minister of Togo until August 20, 1996. He resigned as Prime Minister after the RPT won the elections that were held over again in the constituencies where the results had been annulled, giving the RPT and its allies a parliamentary majority; a new government under [[Kwassi Klutse]] of the RPT was formed.<ref name=South/>

On the night of August 13, 1997, [[tear gas]] canisters were thrown at Kodjo's house while he was exiting it with guests. The UTD alleged that the canisters were thrown from a police vehicle.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/irinw30.html \"Togo – Opposition members attacked\"], IRIN-WA Daily Media Update 30–97, August 15, 1997.</ref> Kodjo announced on May 4, 1998 that he would not be a candidate in the [[1998 Togolese presidential election|June 1998 presidential election]], stressing the need for opposition unity.<ref>[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/Newsletters/irinw200.html \"Togo: Call for one opposition candidate\"], IRIN-West Africa Update 200, May 5, 1998.</ref> He backed the leading opposition candidate, UFC President Gilchrist Olympio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/OUEST/togo/togopartis/partisoppositiontogo.htm|title=Partis politiques d'opposition du Togo|work=Afrique Express|language=fr|access-date=April 13, 2020|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205164351/http://www.afrique-express.com/archive/OUEST/togo/togopartis/partisoppositiontogo.htm|archive-date=February 5, 2006}}</ref>

'''Édouard Kodjovi \"Edem\" Kodjo''' (May 23, 1938 – April 11, 2020), was a [[Togo]]lese politician and diplomat. He was Secretary-General of the [[Organisation of African Unity]]  from 1978 to 1983; later, in Togo, he was a prominent opposition leader after the introduction of multi-party politics. He served as [[Prime Minister of Togo|Prime Minister]] from 1994 to 1996 and again from 2005 to 2006. Kodjo was President of the [[Patriotic Pan-African Convergence]] (CPP).<ref>[http://www.republicoftogo.com/central.php?d=3&i=113&o=1&s=373 \"Une démocratie en bonne santé\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613173912/http://www.republicoftogo.com/central.php?o=1&s=373&d=3&i=113 |date=June 13, 2008 }}, Republicoftogo.com, January 12, 2007 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref>  Kodjo died on April 11, 2020, in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicoftogo.com/Toutes-les-rubriques/Politique/Au-revoir-Edouard|title=Au revoir Edouard|date=May 11, 2020|website=République Togolaise|language=fr|url-status=live|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>

==Political and diplomatic career from the 1960s to the 1980s==
After completing his studies in France, he was an administrator at the ''[[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française]]''<ref name=Profil/> from November 1964 to June 1967. He then returned to Togo and was appointed by President [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]] as Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance in July 1967.<ref name=Visage>[http://www.diastode.org/Echos/invit5629.html \"EDEM KODJO À VISAGE DÉCOUVERT\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217112243/http://www.diastode.org/Echos/invit5629.html |date=February 17, 2005 }}, diastode.org {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> Kodjo participated in the creation of the [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT) ruling party in late 1969 and became the new party's Secretary-General.<ref name=Profil/><ref name=Visage/> He also wrote the \"Green Book\", which served as the ideological basis for the establishment of the RPT's single-party rule.<ref name=CDD>Morten Hagen and Michelle Spearing, [http://www.diastode.org/Droits/cdd.html \"TOGO – STALLED DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902023414/http://www.diastode.org/Droits/cdd.html |date=September 2, 2012 }}, Centre for Democracy & Development, November 28, 2000.</ref> He was removed from his position as RPT Secretary-General in 1971.<ref name=Profil/>

Kodjo served in Eyadéma's government as [[Minister of Finance (Togo)|Minister of Finance]] from 1973 to 1977,<ref>[https://finances.gouv.tg/node/98 Historique du ministère | Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances]</ref> and as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Togo)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1976 to 1978.<ref name=Profil/> He was elected as the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) at its summit in [[Khartoum]] on July 18–22, 1978.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/Fichiers/MFI/PolitiqueDiplomatie/575.asp \"Sommet de l’Union africaine – Durban 2002 (5) : L’OUA, quarante ans d'histoire…\"], rfi.fr, May 16, 2002 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> One of the key issues facing the OAU during Kodjo's five-year tenure was the status of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR), which claimed independence for the former colony of [[Spanish Sahara]], at that time partly occupied by Morocco. Kodjo controversially allowed the SADR to be seated as a member of the OAU on February 28, 1982, over the objections of Morocco and various other African countries that supported the Moroccan position. According to Kodjo, that decision was based simply on the fact that a majority of OAU member states had recognized the SADR, but it led to a serious crisis within the OAU, with a number of member states boycotting OAU meetings.<ref>Stefan Talmon, ''Recognition of Governments in International Law'' (1998), Oxford University Press, page 187.</ref> [[Senegal]]ese President [[Abdou Diouf]] accused Kodjo of \"mischief-making\".<ref>Omar A.

Heilbrunn, \"Togo: The National Conference and Stalled Reform\", in ''Political Reform in Francophone Africa'' (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, page 240.</ref>

Along with other opposition leaders, Kodjo pressured Eyadéma to hold a free and fair [[1994 Togolese parliamentary election|parliamentary election in 1994]].

The '''''Tashahhud''''' ({{lang-ar|تَشَهُّد}}, meaning the \"testimony of [[Iman (concept)|faith]]\"), also known as '''at-Tahiyyat''' ({{lang-ar|ٱلتَّحِيَّات|link=no}}), is the portion of the [[Salah|Muslim prayer]] where the person sits on the ground facing the ''[[qibla]]'', [[Tasbih|glorifies]] [[God in Islam|God]], and greets the [[Muhammad|messenger]] and the righteous people of God followed by the [[Shahada|two testimonials]]. The recitation is followed by an invocation of the blessings and peace upon the prophet known as ''[[Salawat]]''.

==Origins==
There is a [[Hadith]], thought to be [[Sahih|authentic]] that states:<ref name=\"Bukhari\">{{Cite web |url=https://sunnah.com/urn/153690 |title=Hadith - Asking Permission  - Sahih al-Bukhari -  Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) |website=sunnah.com |access-date=2017-11-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115015608/https://sunnah.com/urn/153690 |archivedate=2017-11-15 }}</ref>
{{quote|Ibn Mas'ud is reported to have said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) taught me tashahhud taking my hand within his palms, in the same way as he taught me the chapter of the Quran, and we also read it after his passing away.}}

== Sunni tradition ==
=== Hanafi and Hanbali ===
[[Sunni Muslims]] from both the [[Hanafi]] and the [[Hanbali]] schools of thought and the minority [[Ibadi]] sect recite the Tashahhud (attributed to [[Abdullah ibn Masud]]) as:
{{quote|at-taḥiyyātu li-lāhi, wa-ṣ-ṣalawātu wa-ṭ-ṭayyibāt{{smallsup|u}}. as-salāmu ʿalayka ayyuhā n-nabīyu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuh{{smallsup|u}}. as-salāmu ʿalaynā wa-ʿalā ʿibādi -llāhi ṣ-ṣāliḥīn{{smallsup|a}}. ʾashhadu an lā ʾilāha ʾillā -llāhu wa-ashhadu ʾanna muḥammadan ʿabduhū wa-rasūluh{{smallsup|ū}}.}}
{{script/Arabic|التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ وَالصَّلَوَاتُ وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ، اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَ عَلَىٰ عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِينَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُوْلُهُ}}<ref>Bukhārī, nos 831, 835, 1202, 6230, 6265, 7381.</ref>

This translates as:
\"Salutations to God and prayers and good deeds. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and his blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger.\"

=== Maliki ===
A variant attributed to [[Umar]] preferred by the [[Maliki]] school is:
{{quote|At-taḥiyyātu li-lāh az-zākiyātu li-lāh aṭ-ṭayyibātu ṣ-ṣalawātu li-lāh{{smallsup|i}}. as-salāmu ʿalayka ʾayyuhā n-nabīyu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuh{{smallsup|ū}}. as-salāmu ʿalayna wa-ʿalā ʿibādi -llāhi ṣ-ṣalihīn{{smallsup|a}}. ʾashhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāhu wa-ʾashhadu ʾanna muḥammadan ʿabduhū wa-rasūluh{{smallsup|ū}}.}}

</ref>

This translates as:
\"Blessed salutations, pure actions, good words and prayers to God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I  bear witness that there is no god other than Allah and I  bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger.\"

=== Shafi'i ===
Another variant, attributed Ibn Abbas, preferred by Sunni Muslims belonging to [[Shafi'i]] school of thought, is:
{{quote|at-tāḥīyyātu l-mubārakātu ṣ-ṣalawātu ṭ-ṭayyibātu li-lāh{{smallsup|i}}. as-salāmu ʿalayka ʾayyuhā n-nabīyu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuhu. as-salāmu ʿalayna wa-ʿala ʿibādi llāhi ṣ-ṣāliḥīn{{smallsup|a}}. ʾashhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾillā -llāhu wa-ʾashhadu ʾanna muḥammadan rasūlu -llāh{{smallsup|i}}.}}
{{script/Arabic|التحيات المباركات الصلوات الطيبات لله، السلام عليك أيها النبي ورحمة الله وبركاته، السلام علينا، وعلى عباد الله الصالحين، أشهد أن لا إله إلا الله، وأشهد أن محمداً رسول الله}}<ref>Muslim, no 403.</ref>

This translates as:
\"Blessed salutations, prayers, good deeds to God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I bear witness that there is no god but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His  messenger.\"

=== Jafari ===
The [[Twelver]] [[Shias]] of the [[Ja'fari]] school recite the Tashahhud as:
{{quote|{{lang|ar|أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، وأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ.‌ ٱللَّٰهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَىٰ مُحَمَّدٍ وَآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ.}}

The Tashahhud is followed by the ''Taslim'', also known as the ''Salam''.

The bare minimum is to say 
\"{{transl|ar|as-salamu ʿalaykum}}\" ({{lang-ar|ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ|lit=peace be upon you|link=no}}).
It is highly recommended, though, to add \"{{transl|ar|wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuh}}\" ({{lang-ar|وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ  وَبَرَكَاتُهُ|lit=and God's mercy and blessings|link=no}}) .<ref name=\"sistani.org\"/>

It is highly recommended, though, to recite
{{quote|{{lang|ar|ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَىٰ عِبَادِ ٱللَّٰهِ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ، ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ}}

This translates as:
\"Peace be upon you O messenger of God, as well as God's mercy and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of God. Peace be upon you all, as well as God's mercy and His blessings.\"

=== Zaidi ===
For the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]], the middle Tashahhud after the second rakʿah is recited as:
{{quote|Bismillahi wa Billahiwa alhamdulillahi wal-asmā`ul-husna kulluhā lillahi. Ashhadu an lā ilāha ila Allāhu wahdahu lā sharīka lahu wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasūluhu<ref name=\"Zaydi\" />}}

After the last rakʿah, the Zaidi recite the Tashahhud in its full formula:
{{quote|Bismillahi wa Billahi wa alhamdulillahi wal-asmā`ul-husna kulluhā lillahi.<ref name=\"Zaydi\">}} This aforementioned wording (\"Bismillah wa Billahi...\") does appear in Zaydi books of hadith such as the Musnad of Imam Zayd (as), Amaali of Ahmed bin Isa bin Zayd (as), Sharh at-Tajreed and other books of hadith with complete chains of narrators. Its legitimacy and authenticity does not depend on whether Sunni narrators report it or not. If you peruse the Sunni books of hadith, you will find variant wordings for the tashahhud. As for the Sunni reports that narrate some of the wording of the Zaidi tashahhud: The wording \"Bimillah wa Billahi\" on the authority of Jabir (ra) appears in Sunan an-Nisa`i and Al-Mustadrak. Imam Hakim authenticated the report. There is another wording that says: \"Bismillahi wa khayr al-Asmaa.\" This is narrated from Umar in Al-Mustadrak and Al-Hakim said that it is authentic according to the criteria of Muslim. It also appears in the Sunan of al-Bayhaqi. There is also \"Bismillah wa Billahi wa khayr al-Asmaa\" narrated from Ibn Zubayr in the Mu'jam al-Kabeer and al-Mu'jam al-Aswat of at-Tabaraani.</ref>(Or alternatively: At-tahiyyātu lillāhi was-šalawāt waŧ-ŧayyibātu.)

Ka mā salayta wa bārakta ‘ala Ibrāhīm wa ‘ala āli Ibrāhīm. Innaka Hamīdun Majīd}}

== Quranism ==
The minority [[Quranist|Quranist sect]] reject the practice of Tashahhud as an [[Bid'ah|innovation]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-salat/salat_innovations_(P1206).html |title=True Islam - Salat Innovations |website=True Islam - Salat Innovations |access-date=2017-11-14 |quote=Reciting a prayer (called \"At-Tahiyaat\" or \"Tashahud\") during the Salat to commemorate Prophets Muhammad and Abraham and their families and friends! The Quran commands believers to dedicate their Salat and all worship practices to the name of God alone (6:162, 20:14). To praise or commemorate any other name during the Salat immediately invalidates the Salat and turns it into an act of shirk. Reciting a corrupt Shahada during Salat: God gave us the correct Shahada (Testimony) in the Quran (3:18). The Quranic Shahada is the one uttered by God Himself, the angels and all those endowed with knowledge. The corrupt innovation of adding the name of Muhammad to the Shahada is once again, an act of shirk. This corrupt Shahada is uttered during the Salat when the Quranic Shahada should be recited instead. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311082506/http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-salat/salat_innovations_(P1206).html |archivedate=2017-03-11 }}</ref>

{{script/Arabic|التَّحِيَّاتُ لِلّٰهِ وَالصَّلَوَاتُ وَالطَّيِّبَاتُ، اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ اللهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، اَلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَ عَلَىٰ عِبَادِ اللهِ الصَّالِحِينَ، أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُوْلُهُ}}<ref>Bukhārī, nos 831, 835, 1202, 6230, 6265, 7381.</ref>

This translates as:
\"Salutations to God and prayers and good deeds. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and his blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His messenger.\"

=== Maliki ===
A variant attributed to [[Umar]] preferred by the [[Maliki]] school is:
{{quote|At-taḥiyyātu li-lāh az-zākiyātu li-lāh aṭ-ṭayyibātu ṣ-ṣalawātu li-lāh{{smallsup|i}}. as-salāmu ʿalayka ʾayyuhā n-nabīyu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuh{{smallsup|ū}}. as-salāmu ʿalayna wa-ʿalā ʿibādi -llāhi ṣ-ṣalihīn{{smallsup|a}}. ʾashhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾillā llāhu wa-ʾashhadu ʾanna muḥammadan ʿabduhū wa-rasūluh{{smallsup|ū}}.}}

</ref>

This translates as:
\"Blessed salutations, pure actions, good words and prayers to God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I  bear witness that there is no god other than Allah and I  bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and messenger.\"

=== Shafi'i ===
Another variant, attributed Ibn Abbas, preferred by Sunni Muslims belonging to [[Shafi'i]] school of thought, is:
{{quote|at-tāḥīyyātu l-mubārakātu ṣ-ṣalawātu ṭ-ṭayyibātu li-lāh{{smallsup|i}}. as-salāmu ʿalayka ʾayyuhā n-nabīyu wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuhu. as-salāmu ʿalayna wa-ʿala ʿibādi llāhi ṣ-ṣāliḥīn{{smallsup|a}}. ʾashhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾillā -llāhu wa-ʾashhadu ʾanna muḥammadan rasūlu -llāh{{smallsup|i}}.}}

This translates as:
\"Blessed salutations, prayers, good deeds to God. Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the mercy of God and His blessings. Peace be on us and on the righteous servants of God. I bear witness that there is no god but God, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His  messenger.\"

=== Jafari ===
The [[Twelver]] [[Shias]] of the [[Ja'fari]] school recite the Tashahhud as:

An alternative version:

The Tashahhud is followed by the ''Taslim'', also known as the ''Salam''.

The bare minimum is to say 
\"{{transl|ar|as-salamu ʿalaykum}}\" ({{lang-ar|ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ|lit=peace be upon you|link=no}}).
It is highly recommended, though, to add \"{{transl|ar|wa-raḥmatu -llāhi wa-barakātuh}}\" ({{lang-ar|وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ  وَبَرَكَاتُهُ|lit=and God's mercy and blessings|link=no}}) .<ref name=\"sistani.org\"/>

It is highly recommended, though, to recite
{{quote|{{lang|ar|ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكَ أَيُّهَا ٱلنَّبِيُّ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ، ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْنَا وَعَلَىٰ عِبَادِ ٱللَّٰهِ ٱلصَّالِحِينَ، ٱلسَّلَامُ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَةُ ٱللَّٰهِ وَبَرَكَاتُهُ}}

This translates as:
\"Peace be upon you O messenger of God, as well as God's mercy and His blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of God. Peace be upon you all, as well as God's mercy and His blessings.\"

=== Zaidi ===
For the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]], the middle Tashahhud after the second rakʿah is recited as:
{{quote|Bismillahi wa Billahiwa alhamdulillahi wal-asmā`ul-husna kulluhā lillahi. Ashhadu an lā ilāha ila Allāhu wahdahu lā sharīka lahu wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasūluhu<ref name=\"Zaydi\" />}}

After the last rakʿah, the Zaidi recite the Tashahhud in its full formula:
{{quote|Bismillahi wa Billahi wa alhamdulillahi wal-asmā`ul-husna kulluhā lillahi.<ref name=\"Zaydi\">}} This aforementioned wording (\"Bismillah wa Billahi...\") does appear in Zaydi books of hadith such as the Musnad of Imam Zayd (as), Amaali of Ahmed bin Isa bin Zayd (as), Sharh at-Tajreed and other books of hadith with complete chains of narrators. Its legitimacy and authenticity does not depend on whether Sunni narrators report it or not. If you peruse the Sunni books of hadith, you will find variant wordings for the tashahhud. As for the Sunni reports that narrate some of the wording of the Zaidi tashahhud: The wording \"Bimillah wa Billahi\" on the authority of Jabir (ra) appears in Sunan an-Nisa`i and Al-Mustadrak. Imam Hakim authenticated the report. There is another wording that says: \"Bismillahi wa khayr al-Asmaa.\" This is narrated from Umar in Al-Mustadrak and Al-Hakim said that it is authentic according to the criteria of Muslim. It also appears in the Sunan of al-Bayhaqi. There is also \"Bismillah wa Billahi wa khayr al-Asmaa\" narrated from Ibn Zubayr in the Mu'jam al-Kabeer and al-Mu'jam al-Aswat of at-Tabaraani.</ref>(Or alternatively: At-tahiyyātu lillāhi was-šalawāt waŧ-ŧayyibātu.)

Ka mā salayta wa bārakta ‘ala Ibrāhīm wa ‘ala āli Ibrāhīm. Innaka Hamīdun Majīd}}

== Quranism ==
The minority [[Quranist|Quranist sect]] reject the practice of Tashahhud as an [[Bid'ah|innovation]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-salat/salat_innovations_(P1206).html |title=True Islam - Salat Innovations |website=True Islam - Salat Innovations |access-date=2017-11-14 |quote=Reciting a prayer (called \"At-Tahiyaat\" or \"Tashahud\") during the Salat to commemorate Prophets Muhammad and Abraham and their families and friends! The Quran commands believers to dedicate their Salat and all worship practices to the name of God alone (6:162, 20:14). To praise or commemorate any other name during the Salat immediately invalidates the Salat and turns it into an act of shirk. Reciting a corrupt Shahada during Salat: God gave us the correct Shahada (Testimony) in the Quran (3:18). The Quranic Shahada is the one uttered by God Himself, the angels and all those endowed with knowledge. The corrupt innovation of adding the name of Muhammad to the Shahada is once again, an act of shirk. This corrupt Shahada is uttered during the Salat when the Quranic Shahada should be recited instead. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170311082506/http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-salat/salat_innovations_(P1206).html |archivedate=2017-03-11 }}</ref>

Drex (Tommy Walker) is Captain Man's original sidekick who he never let out of the Man Cave. This caused Drex to go roughe rogue and cause havoc resulting in Captain Man defeating him. Years later at Swellview Prison during its \"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\" event, Drex was paroled from prison because the parole board chairman's daughter got into the computers and made him eligible for parole. Drex began his revenge on Captain Man and even caused trouble for Kid Danger. Thanks to his new powers, Kid Danger defeated Drex and he was imprisoned in the Man Cave.

In \"Back to the Danger,\" Drex is accidentally freed when Vice-Mayor Willard had the power to Swellview shut off for a brief time. Using Time Jerker's time machine, Drex went back in time to prevent Ray from getting his powers. During the conflict, Drex got exposed to the same method and gained a reptilian left hand. Captain Man and Kid Danger were able to sent Drex to prehistoric times.

In the final bunch of episodes, Drex befriended a tribe of cavemen where he swayed them to his side. Once they froze themselves and were thawed out due to global warming, Drex began his revenge on Captain Man and Kid Danger by sending some cavemen to attack Henry at his house while he and two cavemen raided the Man Cave. During this time, his last name is revealed to be Stinkelbaum. Obtaining the Memory Wiper device while tricking Schwoz into making some adjustments, Drex plans to erase Swellview's memories of Captain Man. His plans were thwarted by Captain Man and Kid Danger as the drone that Jasper controls drops Drex off at Swellview Prison.

Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.

Masvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mettā Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].

== Career ==

Cynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.

1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. ''Focus'' was listed in Rock Hard magazine's book as one of ''The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62273803|title=Best of Rock & Metal : die 500 stärksten Scheiben aller Zeiten|date=2005|publisher=Heel|others=Rensen, Michael., Heine, Uwe., Stratmann, Holger., Villalonga, Marc.|isbn=3-89880-517-4|location=Königswinter|oclc=62273803}}</ref>. ''[[Loudwire]]'' writer Graham Hartmann named Focus the ninth best debut metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/cynic-focus-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 9: Cynic, 'Focus' – Best Debut Metal Albums|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. [[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. 

Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. 
[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[Æon Spoke]]]]



During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[Æon Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' Æon Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''.  Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.

Cynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus. In his review,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\" 
[[File:Carbon-based anatomy by cynic.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Carbon Based Anatomy]]
Since ''Traced In Air'', Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''[[Re-Traced]]'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''[[Carbon-Based Anatomy]]'' (2011). ''Rolling Stone'' music critic Hank Shteamer raved in his review<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|title=Cynic: Carbon-Based Anatomy EP|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> of ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'': \"The title track is a perfectly paced stunner...Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.\"

In 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death ''Human'' line up and toured worldwide in honor of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). 
[[File:KindlyBentToFreeUs.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Kindly Bent to Free Us]]





Cynic's third full-length album, ''[[Kindly Bent to Free Us]]'', released in 2014, was hailed by [[Malcolm Dome|Malcome Dome]] of ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' magazine as \"an album that transcends all the limitations of genre and era... There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/cynic-kindly-bent-to-free-us|title=Cynic: Kindly Bent To Free Us|last=February 2014|first=Malcolm Dome 11|website=Prog Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> The album rose to No. 4 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Heatseekers chart in February 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.

\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]

\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk][[File:Onward with Love.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Onward with Love, 2015]]




In 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[Æon Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.

==Early life==

Paul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.

Masvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mettā Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].

== Career ==

Cynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\".

'''Paul Albert Masvidal''' (born January 20, 1971) is a guitarist, singer, songwriter, artist, producer, and a founding member of the band [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[Æon Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.

==Early life==

Paul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.

Masvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mettā Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].

== Career ==

Cynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.

[[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. 

Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. 


[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[Æon Spoke]]]]



During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[Æon Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' Æon Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''.  Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.

==Personal life==

As an inventor, Masvidal filed a successful patent ([http://www.vidatak.com/index.html Vidatak] EZ Board US Patent No. 6,422,875) in 1999 (which was approved in 2002),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6,422,875.PN.&OS=PN/6,422,875&RS=PN/6,422,875|title=United States Patent: 6422875 - Device for communicating with a voice-disabled patient}}</ref> involving a device to assist voice-disabled individuals. Masvidal's interest stems from his extensive volunteer work with AIDS patients, the terminally ill and the elderly in the Los Angeles area.

In May 2014, he publicly revealed his homosexuality along with fellow Cynic member [[Sean Reinert]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Brown | first= August | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-c1-gay-heavy-metal-20140508-story.html | title = Cynic's Paul Masvidal, Sean Reinert are out and ready to be loud | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = May 8, 2014 | accessdate = August 7, 2016 }}</ref>

Although he was seen by far the most with this instrument, he was also seen playing a Gibson SG with Æon Spoke. Since Masvidal's association with the DTA (earlier called ''Death To All'') tours in 2013, a touring tribute to his former band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and the songs of [[Chuck Schuldiner]], he has been playing his signature Strandberg ''Masvidalien'' headless 6-string guitar.

'''Paul Albert Masvidal''' (born January 20, 1971) is a guitarist, singer, songwriter, artist, producer, and a founding member of the band [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]]. He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[Æon Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.

==Early life==

Paul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.

Masvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mettā Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].

== Career ==

Cynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM Lack of Comprehension]\". After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.

''[[Loudwire]]'' writer Graham Hartmann named Focus the ninth best debut metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/cynic-focus-best-debut-metal-albums/|title=No. 9: Cynic, 'Focus' – Best Debut Metal Albums|last=Hartmann|first=Graham|website=Loudwire|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>. [[Roadrunner Records|''Roadrunner'']] released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. 

Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]] and began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. 


[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|left|thumb|152x152px|[[Æon Spoke]]]]During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[Æon Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single \"Silence\". The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' Æon Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''.  Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.

[[File:Cynic - Traced in Air.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Traced in Air]]
Cynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''[[Traced in Air|Traced In Air]]'', their comeback opus. In his review,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\" 
[[File:Cynicretraced.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Re-Traced]][[File:Carbon-based anatomy by cynic.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Carbon Based Anatomy]]
Since ''Traced In Air'', Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''[[Re-Traced]]'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''[[Carbon-Based Anatomy]]'' (2011). ''Rolling Stone'' music critic Hank Shteamer raved in his review<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|title=Cynic: Carbon-Based Anatomy EP|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> of ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'': \"The title track is a perfectly paced stunner...Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.\"

In 2013, Masvidal joined forces with other original members of the Death ''Human'' line up and toured worldwide in honor of [[Chuck Schuldiner]]'s legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). 

[[File:KindlyBentToFreeUs.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Kindly Bent to Free Us]]Cynic's third full-length album, ''[[Kindly Bent to Free Us]]'', released in 2014, was hailed by [[Malcolm Dome|Malcome Dome]] of ''[[Prog (magazine)|Prog]]'' magazine as \"an album that transcends all the limitations of genre and era... There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/cynic-kindly-bent-to-free-us|title=Cynic: Kindly Bent To Free Us|last=February 2014|first=Malcolm Dome 11|website=Prog Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> The album rose to No. 4 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s Heatseekers chart in February 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.

\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]

\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk]


[[File:Onward with Love.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Onward with Love, 2015]]In 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, OwL unveiled a video for the song \"Kali In My Arms\", which was featured in the HBO TV series and film, ''[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]''. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full-length record by 2021.

In 2016, Masvidal, along with collaborator [[Amy Correia]], composed the musical score for the award-winning feature film ''[[The Tiger Hunter]]'', featuring lead actor [[Danny Pudi]] 

Masvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures. His credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''.

Music writer Jeff Wagner, in his book ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]:'' Four Decades of Progressive Heavy Metal, stated that \"any viewer of ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', ''That '70s Show'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and any number of random television programs has probably stumbled across Cynic's core members without even knowing it.\" In 2015, Masvidal produced a children's album for actor [[Jim Carrey]] titled ''How Roland Rolls''.

[[File:Cynic Humanoid.jpg|left|thumb|150x150px|Cynic - Humanoid (Single)]]In January 2018, Cynic released a digital single, titled \"Humanoid\".

[[File:Masvidalien Cosmo.png|thumb|203x203px|The Masvidalien Cosmo|alt=]]Masvidal has been playing [[Steinberger]] GM & GR headless 6-string guitars since his beginnings as a professional musician. Although he was seen by far the most with this instrument, he was also seen playing a Gibson SG with Æon Spoke. Since Masvidal's association with the DTA (earlier called ''Death To All'') tours in 2013, a touring tribute to his former band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and the songs of [[Chuck Schuldiner]], he has been playing his signature Strandberg ''Masvidalien'' headless 6-string guitar. He also had his recording debut with this new Strandberg guitar on Cynic's 2014 release, ''[[Kindly Bent to Free Us]]''.
Masvidal lent his name to a line of signature instruments aptly named, ''Masvidalien Cosmo''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://strandbergguitars.com/artists/paul-masvidal/|title=Paul Masvidal|website=.strandberg* Guitars|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> produced by Sweden's award-winning '''[https://strandbergguitars.com/ .strandberg* Guitars]'''.

'''Édouard Kodjovi \"Edem\" Kodjo''' (May 23, 1938 – April 11, 2020), was a [[Togo]]lese politician and diplomat. He was Secretary-General of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] from 1978 to 1983; later, in Togo, he was a prominent opposition leader after the introduction of multi-party politics. He served as [[Prime Minister of Togo|Prime Minister]] from 1994 to 1996 and again from 2005 to 2006. Kodjo was President of the [[Patriotic Pan-African Convergence]] (CPP).<ref>[http://www.republicoftogo.com/central.php?d=3&i=113&o=1&s=373 \"Une démocratie en bonne santé\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613173912/http://www.republicoftogo.com/central.php?o=1&s=373&d=3&i=113 |date=June 13, 2008 }}, Republicoftogo.com, January 12, 2007 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> Kodjo died on April 11, 2020, in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicoftogo.com/Toutes-les-rubriques/Politique/Au-revoir-Edouard|title=Au revoir Edouard|date=May 11, 2020|website=République Togolaise|language=fr|url-status=live|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early career===
After completing his studies in France, he was an administrator at the ''[[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française]]''<ref name=Profil/> from November 1964 to June 1967. He then returned to Togo and was appointed by President [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]] as Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance in July 1967.<ref name=Visage>[http://www.diastode.org/Echos/invit5629.html \"EDEM KODJO À VISAGE DÉCOUVERT\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217112243/http://www.diastode.org/Echos/invit5629.html |date=February 17, 2005 }}, diastode.org {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> Kodjo participated in the creation of the [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT) ruling party in late 1969 and became the new party's Secretary-General.<ref name=Profil/><ref name=Visage/> He also wrote the \"Green Book\", which served as the ideological basis for the establishment of the RPT's single-party rule.<ref name=CDD>Morten Hagen and Michelle Spearing, [http://www.diastode.org/Droits/cdd.html \"TOGO – STALLED DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902023414/http://www.diastode.org/Droits/cdd.html |date=September 2, 2012 }}, Centre for Democracy & Development, November 28, 2000.</ref> He was removed from his position as RPT Secretary-General in 1971.<ref name=Profil/>

Kodjo served in Eyadéma's government as [[Minister of Finance (Togo)|Minister of Finance]] from 1973 to 1977,<ref>[https://finances.gouv.tg/node/98 Historique du ministère | Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances]</ref> and as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Togo)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1976 to 1978.<ref name=Profil/> He was elected as the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) at its summit in [[Khartoum]] on July 18–22, 1978.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/Fichiers/MFI/PolitiqueDiplomatie/575.asp \"Sommet de l’Union africaine – Durban 2002 (5) : L’OUA, quarante ans d'histoire…\"], rfi.fr, May 16, 2002 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> One of the key issues facing the OAU during Kodjo's five-year tenure was the status of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR), which claimed independence for the former colony of [[Spanish Sahara]], at that time partly occupied by Morocco. Kodjo controversially allowed the SADR to be seated as a member of the OAU on February 28, 1982, over the objections of Morocco and various other African countries that supported the Moroccan position. According to Kodjo, that decision was based simply on the fact that a majority of OAU member states had recognized the SADR, but it led to a serious crisis within the OAU, with a number of member states boycotting OAU meetings.<ref>Stefan Talmon, ''Recognition of Governments in International Law'' (1998), Oxford University Press, page 187.</ref> [[Senegal]]ese President [[Abdou Diouf]] accused Kodjo of \"mischief-making\".<ref>Omar A.

====1990s====
In 1991, a few months before the National Conference, Kodjo returned to Togo and founded a new opposition political party, the [[Togolese Union for Democracy]] (UTD).<ref name=Demo/> On July 20, 1993,<ref name=Chron>[http://www.diastode.org/Droits/tete_chro.html \"Démocratisation à la Togolaise\"], Tètè Tété, 1998 {{in lang|fr}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217151407/http://www.diastode.org/Droits/tete_chro.html |date=December 17, 2008 }}</ref> he was designated by the [[Collective of Democratic Opposition]] (COD II) as its sole candidate for the [[1993 Togolese presidential election|presidential election]] of August 25, 1993,<ref name=Profil/><ref name=Chron/><ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/1993-07-22_Articles_-ITALIE \"Togo.

Heilbrunn, \"Togo: The National Conference and Stalled Reform\", in ''Political Reform in Francophone Africa'' (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, page 240.</ref>

Along with other opposition leaders, Kodjo pressured Eyadéma to hold a free and fair [[1994 Togolese parliamentary election|parliamentary election in 1994]]. In this election, the [[Action Committee for Renewal]] (CAR) and the UTD together won an initial majority in the [[National Assembly of Togo|National Assembly]],<ref name=South>''Africa South of the Sahara 2004'' (2003), Routledge, page 1,145.</ref><ref name=Named>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D61131F937A15757C0A962958260 \"Togo Premier Named\"], ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1994.</ref> the CAR with 36 seats and the UTD with seven;<ref name=Named/> Kodjo himself won a seat from [[Lomé]].<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2f522,469f38e9c,0.html \"Chronology for Kabre in Togo\"], Minorities at Risk Project, 2004.</ref> The CAR and UTD initially agreed to nominate CAR President Yawovi Agboyibo as Prime Minister.

Kodjo served as Prime Minister of Togo until August 20, 1996. He resigned as Prime Minister after the RPT won the elections that were held over again in the constituencies where the results had been annulled, giving the RPT and its allies a parliamentary majority; a new government under [[Kwassi Klutse]] of the RPT was formed.<ref name=South/>

On the night of August 13, 1997, [[tear gas]] canisters were thrown at Kodjo's house while he was exiting it with guests.

Following the disputed [[2005 Togolese presidential election|April 2005 presidential election]], which occurred shortly after Eyadema's death, Eyadema's son and successor [[Faure Gnassingbé]] named Kodjo, a representative of the moderate opposition, as Prime Minister again on June 8, 2005, choosing him instead of a candidate from the radical opposition.<ref name=Sans/><ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=47579&SelectRegion=West_Africa&SelectCountry=TOGO \"President snubs opponents for 'moderate' prime minister\"], IRIN, June 9, 2005.</ref> He took office on June 9, succeeding [[Koffi Sama]].<ref>\"Former Togolese premier hands over to successor, Edem Kodjo – radio report\", Radio Togo, June 10, 2005.</ref>

At a CPP congress in late April 2009, Kodjo announced that he was retiring from day-to-day politics in order to make way for younger leadership.

'''Édouard Kodjovi \"Edem\" Kodjo''' (May 23, 1938 – April 11, 2020), was a [[Togo]]lese politician and diplomat. He was Secretary-General of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] from 1978 to 1983; later, in Togo, he was a prominent opposition leader after the introduction of multi-party politics. He served as [[Prime Minister of Togo|Prime Minister]] from 1994 to 1996 and again from 2005 to 2006. Kodjo was President of the [[Patriotic Pan-African Convergence]] (CPP).<ref>[http://www.republicoftogo.com/central.php?d=3&i=113&o=1&s=373 \"Une démocratie en bonne santé\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613173912/http://www.republicoftogo.com/central.php?o=1&s=373&d=3&i=113 |date=June 13, 2008 }}, Republicoftogo.com, January 12, 2007 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> Kodjo died on April 11, 2020, in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.republicoftogo.com/Toutes-les-rubriques/Politique/Au-revoir-Edouard|title=Au revoir Edouard|date=May 11, 2020|website=République Togolaise|language=fr|url-status=live|access-date=April 12, 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==

==Career==
After completing his studies in France, he was an administrator at the ''[[Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française]]''<ref name=Profil/> from November 1964 to June 1967. He then returned to Togo and was appointed by President [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]] as Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance in July 1967.<ref name=Visage>[http://www.diastode.org/Echos/invit5629.html \"EDEM KODJO À VISAGE DÉCOUVERT\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050217112243/http://www.diastode.org/Echos/invit5629.html |date=February 17, 2005 }}, diastode.org {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> Kodjo participated in the creation of the [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT) ruling party in late 1969 and became the new party's Secretary-General.<ref name=Profil/><ref name=Visage/> He also wrote the \"Green Book\", which served as the ideological basis for the establishment of the RPT's single-party rule.<ref name=CDD>Morten Hagen and Michelle Spearing, [http://www.diastode.org/Droits/cdd.html \"TOGO – STALLED DEMOCRATIC TRANSITION\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902023414/http://www.diastode.org/Droits/cdd.html |date=September 2, 2012 }}, Centre for Democracy & Development, November 28, 2000.</ref> He was removed from his position as RPT Secretary-General in 1971.<ref name=Profil/>

Kodjo served in Eyadéma's government as [[Minister of Finance (Togo)|Minister of Finance]] from 1973 to 1977,<ref>[https://finances.gouv.tg/node/98 Historique du ministère | Ministère de l'Economie et des Finances]</ref> and as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Togo)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 1976 to 1978.<ref name=Profil/> He was elected as the Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) at its summit in [[Khartoum]] on July 18–22, 1978.<ref>[http://www.rfi.fr/Fichiers/MFI/PolitiqueDiplomatie/575.asp \"Sommet de l’Union africaine – Durban 2002 (5) : L’OUA, quarante ans d'histoire…\"], rfi.fr, May 16, 2002 {{in lang|fr}}.</ref> One of the key issues facing the OAU during Kodjo's five-year tenure was the status of the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR), which claimed independence for the former colony of [[Spanish Sahara]], at that time partly occupied by Morocco. Kodjo controversially allowed the SADR to be seated as a member of the OAU on February 28, 1982, over the objections of Morocco and various other African countries that supported the Moroccan position. According to Kodjo, that decision was based simply on the fact that a majority of OAU member states had recognized the SADR, but it led to a serious crisis within the OAU, with a number of member states boycotting OAU meetings.<ref>Stefan Talmon, ''Recognition of Governments in International Law'' (1998), Oxford University Press, page 187.</ref> [[Senegal]]ese President [[Abdou Diouf]] accused Kodjo of \"mischief-making\".<ref>Omar A.

====1990s====
In 1991, a few months before the National Conference, Kodjo returned to Togo and founded a new opposition political party, the [[Togolese Union for Democracy]] (UTD).<ref name=Demo/> On July 20, 1993,<ref name=Chron>[http://www.diastode.org/Droits/tete_chro.html \"Démocratisation à la Togolaise\"], Tètè Tété, 1998 {{in lang|fr}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217151407/http://www.diastode.org/Droits/tete_chro.html |date=December 17, 2008 }}</ref> he was designated by the [[Collective of Democratic Opposition]] (COD II) as its sole candidate for the [[1993 Togolese presidential election|presidential election]] of August 25, 1993,<ref name=Profil/><ref name=Chron/><ref>[https://www.humanite.fr/1993-07-22_Articles_-ITALIE \"Togo.

Heilbrunn, \"Togo: The National Conference and Stalled Reform\", in ''Political Reform in Francophone Africa'' (1997), ed. John F. Clark and David E. Gardinier, page 240.</ref>

Along with other opposition leaders, Kodjo pressured Eyadéma to hold a free and fair [[1994 Togolese parliamentary election|parliamentary election in 1994]]. In this election, the [[Action Committee for Renewal]] (CAR) and the UTD together won an initial majority in the [[National Assembly of Togo|National Assembly]],<ref name=South>''Africa South of the Sahara 2004'' (2003), Routledge, page 1,145.</ref><ref name=Named>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE7D61131F937A15757C0A962958260 \"Togo Premier Named\"], ''The New York Times'', April 24, 1994.</ref> the CAR with 36 seats and the UTD with seven;<ref name=Named/> Kodjo himself won a seat from [[Lomé]].<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,469f2f522,469f38e9c,0.html \"Chronology for Kabre in Togo\"], Minorities at Risk Project, 2004.</ref> The CAR and UTD initially agreed to nominate CAR President Yawovi Agboyibo as Prime Minister.

Although headed by Kodjo, the composition of the government was strongly dominated by the RPT.<ref>\"May 1994 – New government\", ''Keesing's Record of World Events'', volume 40, May 1994, Togo, page 39,995.</ref>

Kodjo served as Prime Minister of Togo until August 20, 1996. He resigned as Prime Minister after the RPT won the elections that were held over again in the constituencies where the results had been annulled, giving the RPT and its allies a parliamentary majority; a new government under [[Kwassi Klutse]] of the RPT was formed.<ref name=South/>

On the night of August 13, 1997, [[tear gas]] canisters were thrown at Kodjo's house while he was exiting it with guests.

Following the disputed [[2005 Togolese presidential election|April 2005 presidential election]], which occurred shortly after Eyadema's death, Eyadema's son and successor [[Faure Gnassingbé]] named Kodjo, a representative of the moderate opposition, as Prime Minister again on June 8, 2005, choosing him instead of a candidate from the radical opposition.<ref name=Sans/><ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=47579&SelectRegion=West_Africa&SelectCountry=TOGO \"President snubs opponents for 'moderate' prime minister\"], IRIN, June 9, 2005.</ref> He took office on June 9, succeeding [[Koffi Sama]].<ref>\"Former Togolese premier hands over to successor, Edem Kodjo – radio report\", Radio Togo, June 10, 2005.</ref>

In Riding Giants director Stacy Peralta pays tribute to the adventurous surfers riding the world's most daunting 20-foot high waves, only to yearn for even more challenging thrill rides.

Additionally Orsi worked with director and professional surfer Sam George to produce '''''Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau''''' (ESPN''''')'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/espn-films-30-30-hawaiian-154949024.html|title=ESPN Films: \"30 for 30\" \"Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau\" Wins Emmy Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Yahoo Finance/Marketwired|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=May 29, 2014|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' a biographical film of the big wave surfer Eddie Aikau who became the symbol of Aloha and celebration of Hawaiian culture.

Orsi's foray into documentary filmmaking began when she teamed with director John Armstrong to produce '''''Bashkaus: Hard Labor in Siberia'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650709/bio|title=Agi Orsi Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' (Discovery Channel), a film that won a '''Gold Medal Living Book Award''' and the '''Grand Prize at the Telluride Mountain Film Festival'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainfilm.org/festival/personalities/john-armstrong|title=John Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=John Armstrong|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> for chronicling the first joint US-Soviet river expedition in Russia's Altai Mountains during a thaw in the Cold War.  Following that, Orsi teamed again with Armstrong to produce '''''Curtain of Ice''''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/curtain-of-ice/oclc/27479917|title=Curtain of Ice|last=|first=|date=|website=World Cat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>(Discovery Channel), documenting the first-on water crossing of the Bering Strait, the \"Curtain of Ice,\" reuniting Eskimos separated for decades during the US-Russia arms escalation. The documentary also tells the story of Jim Noyes, a paraplegic with a broken spine who finds a new purpose for living after making the crossing.

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2011|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary, released in 2009 by Paramount Pictures, was financed for $300,000 by DreamWorks and Universal Pictures and Participant Media, with contributions from the Hilton Foundation and Community Supportive Housing, takes a critical look at then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's Safer City Initiative which made it a crime to panhandle, sleep, sit or store personal items on sidewalks and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homeless-losangeles/los-angeles-accused-of-criminalizing-homelessness-idUSTRE56E0MC20090715|title=Los Angeles accused of criminalizing homelessness|last=Gorman|first=Steve|date=2009|website=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The film, narrated by actress Catherine Keener, points to the success of supportive housing with wrap-around mental health and employment services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/get_involved.html|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is my Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Los Angeles earned recognition for the following awards: '''2011 Voice Award from SAMHSA''' (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) and '''Ghetto Award-Radar Hamburg International Film Festival.''' The documentary was also an official selection for the Los Angeles Film Festival (Premiere), One World Human Rights Film Festival (Prague), Human Rights Film Festival (London), Oaxaca Film Festival, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/assets/lost-angels-press-notes-FINAL.pdf|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with poignant personal stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Additionally Orsi worked with director and professional surfer Sam George to produce '''''Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau''''' (ESPN''''')'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/espn-films-30-30-hawaiian-154949024.html|title=ESPN Films: \"30 for 30\" \"Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau\" Wins Emmy Award|last=|first=|date=Yahoo Finance/Marketwired|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=May 29, 2014|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' a biographical film of the big wave surfer Eddie Aikau who became the symbol of Aloha and celebration of Hawaiian culture. The documentary premiered on [[ESPN]] on October 1, 2013 and won an '''Emmy for Best Sports Documentary Series''', making it one of the few surf-related films to ever receive such recognition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2014/05/29/hawaii-news/hawaiian-the-legend-of-eddie-aikau-wins-emmy-award/|title=Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau|last=|first=|date=4/12/20|website=West Hawaii Today|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The documentary that chronicles Aikau's emergence as a legendary surfer and lifeguard who saved lives but lost his own at sea also won awards for '''Best Picture and Best Director at the Malibu International Film Festival'''; '''Best Picture, Best Documentary and Audience Favorite at the Maui Film Festival''', as well as '''Best Documentary at Surfer Poll'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2014/05/29/hawaii-news/hawaiian-the-legend-of-eddie-aikau-wins-emmy-award/|title=Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddi Akau|last=|first=|date=4/12/2020|website=West Hawaii Today|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi's foray into documentary filmmaking began when she teamed with director John Armstrong to produce '''''Bashkaus: Hard Labor in Siberia'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650709/bio|title=Agi Orsi Bio|last=|first=|date=IMDB|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' (Discovery Channel), a film that won a '''Gold Medal Living Book Award''' and the '''Grand Prize at the Telluride Mountain Film Festival'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainfilm.org/festival/personalities/john-armstrong|title=John Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=John Armstrong|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> for chronicling the first joint US-Soviet river expedition in Russia's Altai Mountains during a thaw in the Cold War.  Following that, Orsi teamed again with Armstrong to produce '''''Curtain of Ice''''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/curtain-of-ice/oclc/27479917|title=Curtain of Ice|last=|first=|date=World Cat|website=World Cat|url-status=live|archive-url=1992|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>(Discovery Channel), documenting the first-on water crossing of the Bering Strait, the \"Curtain of Ice,\" reuniting Eskimos separated for decades during the US-Russia arms escalation. The documentary also tells the story of Jim Noyes, a paraplegic with a broken spine who finds a new purpose for living after making the crossing.

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=IMDB|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=Website for the Grammy Nominations & Winners|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=11/19/15|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=10/12/11|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary, released in 2009 by Paramount Pictures, was financed for $300,000 by DreamWorks and Universal Pictures and Participant Media, with contributions from the Hilton Foundation and Community Supportive Housing, takes a critical look at then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's Safer City Initiative which made it a crime to panhandle, sleep, sit or store personal items on sidewalks and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homeless-losangeles/los-angeles-accused-of-criminalizing-homelessness-idUSTRE56E0MC20090715|title=Los Angeles accused of criminalizing homelessness|last=Gorman|first=Steve|date=7/14/09|website=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The film, narrated by actress Catherine Keener, points to the success of supportive housing with wrap-around mental health and employment services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/get_involved.html|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is my Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Los Angeles earned recognition for the following awards: '''2011 Voice Award from SAMHSA''' (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) and '''Ghetto Award-Radar Hamburg International Film Festival.'''

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with poignant personal stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

[[File:MaxWeber1919FotoLeifGeiges.jpg|thumb|right|[[Germany|German]] scholar [[Max Weber]] notably articulated a theory of rationality divided human capacity to think through things in four ways.<ref name=kalberg>https://www.bu.edu/sociology/files/2010/03/Weberstypes.pdf</ref>]] 

'''Rationality''' is the quality or state of being rational – that is, being based on or agreeable to [[reason]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rationality|title=Definition of RATIONALITY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational|title=Definition of RATIONAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref> Rationality implies the conformity of one's beliefs with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s to believe, and of one's actions with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s for action. \"Rationality\" has different specialized meanings in [[philosophy]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/reason|title=Reason|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[game theory]] and [[political science]].

To determine what behavior is the most rational, one needs to make several key assumptions, and also needs a logical formulation of the problem. When the goal or problem involves making a decision, rationality factors in all information that is available (e.g. complete or incomplete [[knowledge]]). Collectively, the formulation and background assumptions are the models within which rationality applies. Rationality is relative: if one accepts a model in which benefitting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior that is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a model in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is deemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also specifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed and formulated.

==Theories of rational thinking==
===Max Weber===
The German scholar [[Max Weber]] proposed an interpretation of [[Social actions|social action]] that distinguished between four different [[ideal type|idealized types]] of rationality.<ref name=kalberg/>

The first, which he called ''Zweckrational'' or purposive/[[instrumental rationality]], is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were \"rationally pursued and calculated.\" The second type, Weber called ''Wertrational'' or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motives, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion—to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered \"meaningfully oriented.\" The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.

The advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that ground or motive can be given—for religious or affect reasons, for example—that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the ''Zweckrational'' orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are ''Wertrational''.

Weber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power)<ref>[[Jürgen Habermas]] (1984) ''The Theory of Communicative Action Volume&nbsp;1; Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', Cambridge: Polity Press.</ref> and also from a [[feminist]] perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power.<ref>Eagleton, M. (ed) (2003) ''A Concise Companion to Feminist Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> An alternative position on rationality (which includes both [[bounded rationality]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=David |last2=Simon |first2=Herbert A. |title=Note: Some Conditions of Macroeconomic Stability |journal=Econometrica |date=July 1949 |volume=17 |issue=3/4 |pages=245–8 |doi=10.2307/1905526 |jstor=1905526 }}</ref> as well as the affective and value-based arguments of Weber) can be found in the critique of Etzioni (1988),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Etzioni |first1=Amitai |title=Normative-affective factors: Toward a new decision-making model |journal=Journal of Economic Psychology |date=June 1988 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=125–150 |doi=10.1016/0167-4870(88)90048-7 }} Republished in: {{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03900-7_5 |chapter=Normative-Affective Factors: Toward a New Decision-Making Model |title=Essays in Socio-Economics |pages=91–119 |series=Studies in Economic Ethics and Philosophy |year=1999 |last1=Etzioni |first1=Amitai |isbn=978-3-642-08415-7 }}</ref> who reframes thought on decision-making to argue for a reversal of the position put forward by Weber. Etzioni illustrates how purposive/instrumental reasoning is subordinated by normative considerations (ideas on how people 'ought' to behave) and affective considerations (as a support system for the development of human relationships).

===Psychology===
In the [[psychology of reasoning]], psychologists and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have defended different positions on human rationality. One prominent view, due to [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.&nbsp;J. Byrne]] among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson-Laird |first1=Philip N. |last2=Byrne |first2=Ruth M. J. |title=Corrigendum: 'If' and the problems of conditional reasoning |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=1 September 2009 |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=282–287 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.003 }}</ref> However, it has been argued that many standard tests of reasoning, such as those on the [[conjunction fallacy]], on the [[Wason selection task]], or the [[base rate fallacy]] suffer from methodological and conceptual problems. This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], favor a conception of [[bounded rationality]], especially for tasks under high uncertainty.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Thomas |title=The 'Rationality Wars' in Psychology: Where They Are and Where They Could Go |journal=Inquiry |date=February 2012 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=66–81 |doi=10.1080/0020174X.2012.643628 }}</ref>

===Richard Brandt===
[[Richard Brandt]] proposed a \"reforming definition\" of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of [[psychotherapy|cognitive-psychotherapy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethical Theory: The Problems of Normative and Critical Ethics|url=https://archive.org/details/ethicaltheorypro0000bran|url-access=registration|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Richard B. Brandt|year=1959}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>

==Quality==
Abulof argues that rationality has become an \"essentially contested concept,\" as its \"proper use… inevitably involves endless disputes.\" He identifies \"four fronts\" for the disputes about the meaning of rationality: 
# The purpose, or function, of ascribing rationality: Is it descriptive/explanatory, prescriptive or subjunctive (rationality \"as if\" real)? 
# The subject of rationality: What, or who is rational: the choice, the act, or the choosing actor?
# Cognition: What is the quality of the cognitive decision-making process: minimal (calculative intentionality) or optimal (expected-utility)? 
# Rationale: Is rationality merely instrumental, that is, agnostic about the logic of human action and its motivations (instrumental rationality) or does it substantially inform them (substantive rationality, focusing on material maximization)?<ref name=\"Abulof\">{{cite journal |last1=Abulof |first1=Uriel |title=The malpractice of 'rationality' in international relations |journal=Rationality and Society |date=16 July 2015 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=358–384 |doi=10.1177/1043463115593144 }}</ref>

It is believed by some philosophers (notably [[A.&nbsp;C. Grayling]]) that a good rationale must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis, that may be called rational, is expected to be highly objective, logical and \"mechanical\". If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been, even slightly, influenced by personal emotions, feelings, instincts, or culturally specific moral codes and norms, then the analysis may be termed irrational, due to the injection of subjective bias.

Modern [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] show that studying the role of emotion in mental function (including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans), that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example, an individual with a massively damaged [[amygdala]] or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Theoretical and practical==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jesús Mosterín]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.<ref>Mosterín, Jesús (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acción humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.</ref> Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.

The distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.

Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to [[consistency|logical consistency]] and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mosterín |first1=Jesús |title=Acceptance without belief |journal=Manuscrito |date=2002 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313–335 |url=https://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/manuscrito/article/view/8644540 }}</ref> Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one's best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.

==Examples in different fields==

===Logic===
{{main|Logic and rationality}}
As the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.

===Economics===
Rationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this.<ref>{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality—basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational—that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information—in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.

Debates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are \"really\" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.

Others think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.

===Artificial intelligence===
Within [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of \"performance\", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].<ref>Johnson-Laird, P.N. & Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum.</ref>

===International relations===
There is an ongoing debate over the merits of using “rationality” in the study of [[international relations]] (IR). Some scholars hold it indispensable.<ref>Bueno De Mesquita, Bruce (2010) Foreign Policy Analysis and Rational Choice Models. In The International Studies Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Allen Denemark. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Others are more critical.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walt |first1=Stephen M. |title=Rigor or Rigor Mortis? Rational Choice and Security Studies |journal=International Security |date=April 1999 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=5–48 |doi=10.1162/isec.23.4.5 }}</ref> Still, the pervasive and persistent usage of \"rationality\" in political science and IR is beyond dispute. \"Rationality\" remains ubiquitous in this field. Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to \"foreign policy\" allude to \"rationality\"—and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on \"malpractice\": rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of \"rationality\" they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between \"us and them.\"<ref name=Abulof/>

[[File:MaxWeber1919FotoLeifGeiges.jpg|thumb|right|[[Germany|German]] scholar [[Max Weber]] notably articulated a theory of rationality divided human capacity to think through things in four ways.<ref name=kalberg>https://www.bu.edu/sociology/files/2010/03/Weberstypes.pdf</ref>]] 

'''Rationality''' is the quality or state of being rational – that is, being based on or agreeable to [[reason]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rationality|title=Definition of RATIONALITY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational|title=Definition of RATIONAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref> Rationality implies the conformity of one's beliefs with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s to believe, and of one's actions with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s for action. \"Rationality\" has different specialized meanings in [[philosophy]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/reason|title=Reason|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[game theory]] and [[political science]].

To determine what behavior is the most rational, one needs to make several key assumptions, and also needs a logical formulation of the problem. When the goal or problem involves making a decision, rationality factors in all information that is available (e.g. complete or incomplete [[knowledge]]). Collectively, the formulation and background assumptions are the models within which rationality applies. Rationality is relative: if one accepts a model in which benefitting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior that is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a model in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is deemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also specifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed and formulated.

==Theories of rational thinking==
===Max Weber===
The German scholar [[Max Weber]] proposed an interpretation of [[Social actions|social action]] that distinguished between four different [[ideal type|idealized types]] of rationality.<ref name=kalberg/>

The first, which he called ''Zweckrational'' or purposive/[[instrumental rationality]], is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were \"rationally pursued and calculated.\" The second type, Weber called ''Wertrational'' or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motives, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion—to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered \"meaningfully oriented.\" The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.

The advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that ground or motive can be given—for religious or affect reasons, for example—that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the ''Zweckrational'' orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are ''Wertrational''.

Weber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power)<ref>[[Jürgen Habermas]] (1984) ''The Theory of Communicative Action Volume&nbsp;1; Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', Cambridge: Polity Press.</ref> and also from a [[feminist]] perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power.<ref>Eagleton, M. (ed) (2003) ''A Concise Companion to Feminist Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> An alternative position on rationality (which includes both [[bounded rationality]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hawkins |first1=David |last2=Simon |first2=Herbert A. |title=Note: Some Conditions of Macroeconomic Stability |journal=Econometrica |date=July 1949 |volume=17 |issue=3/4 |pages=245–8 |doi=10.2307/1905526 |jstor=1905526 }}</ref> as well as the affective and value-based arguments of Weber) can be found in the critique of Etzioni (1988),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Etzioni |first1=Amitai |title=Normative-affective factors: Toward a new decision-making model |journal=Journal of Economic Psychology |date=June 1988 |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=125–150 |doi=10.1016/0167-4870(88)90048-7 }} Republished in: {{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-03900-7_5 |chapter=Normative-Affective Factors: Toward a New Decision-Making Model |title=Essays in Socio-Economics |pages=91–119 |series=Studies in Economic Ethics and Philosophy |year=1999 |last1=Etzioni |first1=Amitai |isbn=978-3-642-08415-7 }}</ref> who reframes thought on decision-making to argue for a reversal of the position put forward by Weber. Etzioni illustrates how purposive/instrumental reasoning is subordinated by normative considerations (ideas on how people 'ought' to behave) and affective considerations (as a support system for the development of human relationships).

===Psychology===
In the [[psychology of reasoning]], psychologists and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have defended different positions on human rationality. One prominent view, due to [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.&nbsp;J. Byrne]] among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Johnson-Laird |first1=Philip N. |last2=Byrne |first2=Ruth M. J. |title=Corrigendum: 'If' and the problems of conditional reasoning |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |date=1 September 2009 |volume=13 |issue=9 |pages=282–287 |doi=10.1016/j.tics.2009.08.003 }}</ref> However, it has been argued that many standard tests of reasoning, such as those on the [[conjunction fallacy]], on the [[Wason selection task]], or the [[base rate fallacy]] suffer from methodological and conceptual problems. This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], favor a conception of [[bounded rationality]], especially for tasks under high uncertainty.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sturm |first1=Thomas |title=The 'Rationality Wars' in Psychology: Where They Are and Where They Could Go |journal=Inquiry |date=February 2012 |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=66–81 |doi=10.1080/0020174X.2012.643628 }}</ref>

===Richard Brandt===
[[Richard Brandt]] proposed a \"reforming definition\" of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of [[psychotherapy|cognitive-psychotherapy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Ethical Theory: The Problems of Normative and Critical Ethics|url=https://archive.org/details/ethicaltheorypro0000bran|url-access=registration|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Richard B. Brandt|year=1959}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>

==Quality==
Abulof argues that rationality has become an \"essentially contested concept,\" as its \"proper use… inevitably involves endless disputes.\" He identifies \"four fronts\" for the disputes about the meaning of rationality: 
# The purpose, or function, of ascribing rationality: Is it descriptive/explanatory, prescriptive or subjunctive (rationality \"as if\" real)? 
# The subject of rationality: What, or who is rational: the choice, the act, or the choosing actor?
# Cognition: What is the quality of the cognitive decision-making process: minimal (calculative intentionality) or optimal (expected-utility)? 
# Rationale: Is rationality merely instrumental, that is, agnostic about the logic of human action and its motivations (instrumental rationality) or does it substantially inform them (substantive rationality, focusing on material maximization)?<ref name=\"Abulof\">{{cite journal |last1=Abulof |first1=Uriel |title=The malpractice of 'rationality' in international relations |journal=Rationality and Society |date=16 July 2015 |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=358–384 |doi=10.1177/1043463115593144 }}</ref>

It is believed by some philosophers (notably [[A.&nbsp;C. Grayling]]) that a good rationale must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis, that may be called rational, is expected to be highly objective, logical and \"mechanical\". If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been, even slightly, influenced by personal emotions, feelings, instincts, or culturally specific moral codes and norms, then the analysis may be termed irrational, due to the injection of subjective bias.

Modern [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] show that studying the role of emotion in mental function (including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans), that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example, an individual with a massively damaged [[amygdala]] or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Theoretical and practical==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jesús Mosterín]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.<ref>Mosterín, Jesús (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acción humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.</ref> Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.

The distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.

Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to [[consistency|logical consistency]] and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mosterín |first1=Jesús |title=Acceptance without belief |journal=Manuscrito |date=2002 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=313–335 |url=https://periodicos.sbu.unicamp.br/ojs/index.php/manuscrito/article/view/8644540 }}</ref> Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one's best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.

==Examples in different fields==

===Logic===
{{main|Logic and rationality}}
As the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.

===Economics===
Rationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this.<ref>{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality—basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational—that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information—in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.

Debates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are \"really\" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.

Others think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.

===Artificial intelligence===
Within [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of \"performance\", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].<ref>Johnson-Laird, P.N. & Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum.</ref>

===International relations===
There is an ongoing debate over the merits of using “rationality” in the study of [[international relations]] (IR). Some scholars hold it indispensable.<ref>Bueno De Mesquita, Bruce (2010) Foreign Policy Analysis and Rational Choice Models. In The International Studies Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Allen Denemark. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.{{page needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Others are more critical.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Walt |first1=Stephen M. |title=Rigor or Rigor Mortis? Rational Choice and Security Studies |journal=International Security |date=April 1999 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=5–48 |doi=10.1162/isec.23.4.5 }}</ref> Still, the pervasive and persistent usage of \"rationality\" in political science and IR is beyond dispute. \"Rationality\" remains ubiquitous in this field. Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to \"foreign policy\" allude to \"rationality\"—and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on \"malpractice\": rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of \"rationality\" they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between \"us and them.\"<ref name=Abulof/>

Orsi's foray into documentary filmmaking began when she teamed with director John Armstrong to produce '''''Bashkaus: Hard Labor in Siberia'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650709/bio|title=Agi Orsi Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' (Discovery Channel), a film that won a '''Gold Medal Living Book Award''' and the '''Grand Prize at the Telluride Mountain Film Festival'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainfilm.org/festival/personalities/john-armstrong|title=John Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=John Armstrong|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> for chronicling the first joint US-Soviet river expedition in Russia's Altai Mountains during a thaw in the Cold War.  Following that, Orsi teamed again with Armstrong to produce '''''Curtain of Ice''''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/curtain-of-ice/oclc/27479917|title=Curtain of Ice|last=|first=|date=|website=World Cat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>(Discovery Channel), documenting the first-on water crossing of the Bering Strait, the \"Curtain of Ice,\" reuniting Eskimos separated for decades during the US-Russia arms escalation. The documentary also tells the story of Jim Noyes, a paraplegic with a broken spine who finds a new purpose for living after making the crossing.

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2011|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary, released in 2009 by Paramount Pictures, was financed for $300,000 by DreamWorks and Universal Pictures and Participant Media, with contributions from the Hilton Foundation and Community Supportive Housing. The film takes a critical look at then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's Safer City Initiative which made it a crime to panhandle, sleep, sit or store personal items on sidewalks and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homeless-losangeles/los-angeles-accused-of-criminalizing-homelessness-idUSTRE56E0MC20090715|title=Los Angeles accused of criminalizing homelessness|last=Gorman|first=Steve|date=2009|website=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Narrated by actress Catherine Keener, Lost Angels points to the success of supportive housing with wrap-around mental health and employment services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/get_involved.html|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is my Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Los Angeles earned recognition for the following awards: '''2011 Voice Award from SAMHSA''' (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) and '''Ghetto Award-Radar Hamburg International Film Festival.''' The documentary was also an official selection for the Los Angeles Film Festival (Premiere), One World Human Rights Film Festival (Prague), Human Rights Film Festival (London), Oaxaca Film Festival, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/assets/lost-angels-press-notes-FINAL.pdf|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with poignant personal stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2011|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary, released in 2009 by Paramount Pictures, was financed for $300,000 by DreamWorks and Universal Pictures and Participant Media, with contributions from the Hilton Foundation and Community Supportive Housing, takes a critical look at then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's Safer City Initiative which made it a crime to panhandle, sleep, sit or store personal items on sidewalks and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homeless-losangeles/los-angeles-accused-of-criminalizing-homelessness-idUSTRE56E0MC20090715|title=Los Angeles accused of criminalizing homelessness|last=Gorman|first=Steve|date=2009|website=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The film, narrated by actress Catherine Keener, points to the success of supportive housing with wrap-around mental health and employment services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/get_involved.html|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is my Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Los Angeles earned recognition for the following awards: '''2011 Voice Award from SAMHSA''' (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) and '''Ghetto Award-Radar Hamburg International Film Festival.''' The documentary was also an official selection for the Los Angeles Film Festival (Premiere), One World Human Rights Film Festival (Prague), Human Rights Film Festival (London), Oaxaca Film Festival, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/assets/lost-angels-press-notes-FINAL.pdf|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with poignant personal stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

'''[[Cunning folk|Cunning Folk Traditions]]''', sometimes referred to as [[folk religion|Folk Magic]], were intertwined with the early culture and practice of the '''[[Latter Day Saint movement]]'''.  These traditions were widespread in unorganized religion in the parts of Europe and America where the Latter Day Saint movement began in the 1820s and 1830s.<ref>Walker, Ronald W.

Early church leaders were tolerant of these traditions, but by the beginning of the 20th century folk practices were not considered part of the [[orthopraxy]] of most branches of the movement, including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).<ref>Stapley, Johnathan. The Power of Godliness: Mormon Liturgy and Cosmology. Oxford University Press, 2018: page 4, 107.</ref>  The extent that the founder of the movement [[Joseph Smith]] and his early followers participated in the culture has been the subject of controversy since before the church's founding in 1830, and continues to this day.<ref>Walker, Ronald W.

==Joseph Smith Family==

The Smith family practiced a form of [[folk religion]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=xx–xxi}}: A 1985 memorandum sent from the headquarters of the LDS [[Church Educational System]] to regional and local administrators read, \"Even if the [Mark Hofmann] letters were to be unauthentic, such issues as Joseph Smith's involvement in treasure-seeking and folk magic remain. Ample evidence exists for both of these, even without the letters.\"</ref> which, although not uncommon in this time and place, was criticized by many contemporary Protestants \"as either fraudulent illusion or the workings of the Devil.\"<ref>{{citation |first=Keith |last=Thomas |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |location=New York |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |year=1971 |page=256}}</ref> Both Joseph Smith, Sr. and at least two of his sons worked at \"money digging,\" using [[Seer stones (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]] in mostly unsuccessful attempts to locate lost items and buried treasure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1838a|pp=42–43}} (saying that he had been a \"money digger\" but that it \"was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it\"). {{citation |journal=[[Elders' Journal|Elders' Journal of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] |volume=1 |issue=43 |date=July 1838 |title=Elders Journal}}. For a discussion of Smith's money-digging activities by an academic LDS biographer, see {{harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=48–49}}.</ref> In a draft of her memoirs, Lucy Mack Smith referred to folk magic:<blockquote>I shall change my theme for the present, but let not my reader suppose that because I shall pursue another topic for a season that we stopt our labor and went at trying to win the faculty of Abrac, drawing magic circles or soothsaying, to the neglect of all kinds of business. We never during our lives suffered one important interest to swallow up every other obligation. But whilst we worked with our hands, we endeavored to remember the service of and the welfare of our souls.<ref>{{Citation

Michael Quinn]] has written that Lucy Mack Smith viewed these magical practices as \"part of her family's religious quest\" while denying that they prevented \"family members from accomplishing other, equally important work.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|page=55}}: \"Joseph Smith's mother did not deny her family participation in occult activities but simply affirmed that these did not prevent family members from accomplishing other, equally important work.\" In a note at {{harvnb|Vogel|1996|p=285}} (n. 84), Dan Vogel argues that this sentence from the draft may have been excised from the 1853 edition of Lucy Mack Smith's memoirs because of its allusion to folk magic, \"which was a sensitive subject for those not wishing to give credence to claims made in affidavits collected in 1833 by Philastus Hurlbut.\"</ref>  [[Jan Shipps]] notes that while Smith's \"religious claims were rejected by many of the persons who had known him in the 1820s because they remembered him as a practitioner of the magic arts,\" others of his earliest followers were attracted to his claims \"for precisely the same reason.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Shipps|1985|p=18}}.</ref>

Smith reports using seer stones in the translation of the Book of Mormon<ref>\"History, 1838–1856, volume A-1 [23 December 1805–30 August 1834],\" p. 9, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed April 1, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/11</ref>, as well as in the reception of several early revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants.<ref>{{citation | first = James R.

===Treasure Seeking Activities===
{{see also|Joseph Smith and the criminal justice system}}
From about 1819, Smith regularly practiced [[scrying]], a form of [[divination]] in which a \"seer\" looked into a [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]] to receive supernatural knowledge.<ref>{{citation | title = Seer Stones | url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/seer-stones?lang=eng }}</ref> Smith usually practiced \"peeping\" or seeing by putting a stone at the bottom of a white stovepipe hat, putting his face over the hat to block the light, then divining information from the stone.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=164}}; {{Harvtxt|Mather|1880|p=199}}. According to an account of an interview with Joseph Smith Sr., the 14-year-old Joseph borrowed a stone from a person working as a local crystal gazer {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|pp=305–306}} which reportedly showed him the underground location of another stone near his home, which he located at a depth of about twenty-two feet.  According to another story, in either 1819 {{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=19}} or 1822 {{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=240}}, while the older Smith males were digging a well for a Palmyra neighbor, they found an unusual stone {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=163}}, described as either white and glassy and shaped like a child's foot or \"chocolate-colored, somewhat egg-shaped.\" {{Harvtxt|Roberts|1930|loc=1:129}}. Smith then used this stone as a seer stone.{{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=20}}.</ref>  Smith and his father achieved \"something of a mysterious local reputation in the profession—mysterious because there is no record that they ever found anything despite the readiness of some local residents to pay for their efforts.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Ostling|1999|p=25}}.</ref>

In late 1825, Josiah Stowell, a well-to-do farmer from [[Bainbridge (town), New York|South Bainbridge]], [[Chenango County, New York]], who had been searching for a lost Spanish mine near [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]] with another seer, traveled to Manchester to hire Smith \"on account of having heard that he possessed certain keys, by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=69}}. </ref> Smith worked for Stowell for nearly a month before prevailing upon him to give up the enterprise.<ref>\"History, 1838–1856, volume A-1 [23 December 1805–30 August 1834],\" p. 8, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed April 1, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/10</ref>

==Notable early examples 1820–1838==
Smith's early use of seer stones is not well documented but one account describes him borrowing the seer stone of a local girl, possibly Sally Chase, and using it to find his own first stone.<ref name=MacKay2016>{{cite book

One of Joseph Smith's early [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]], now canonized in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], stated that [[Oliver Cowdery]] had the power to use a [[dowsing|divining rod]].<ref>{{citation | title = Divining Rods | url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/divining-rods?lang=eng }}</ref>

[[Hiram Page]], one of the [[Eight Witnesses]] of the Book of Mormon, was living with his in-laws the [[Peter Whitmer Sr.|Whitmers]] in [[Fayette, New York]]. Smith arrived in August 1830 to discover Page using a black \"[[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seerstone]]\" to produce revelations for the church. The revelations were regarding the organization and location of [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. Cowdery and the Whitmer family believed the revelations were authentic. In response, Smith announced in a new revelation during the church's September conference that Page's revelations were of the devil (Doctrine and Covenants, {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 28|verse=11}}). At the conference there was considerable discussion on the topic. Page agreed to discard the stone and the revelations and join in following Smith as the sole [[prophet, seer, and revelator|revelator]] for the church. The members present confirmed this unanimously [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|with a vote]]. The fate of the stone and revelations was not recorded by contemporary sources and has been the subject of interest ever since.<ref name=MacKay2016 />  Martin Harris's brother Emer stated second-hand in 1856 that the stone was ground to powder and the associated revelations were burned.<ref>Emer Harris statement, in Utah Stake General Minutes, Local Record 9629, ser. 11, vol. 10 (1855-60), 6 April 1856, Church History Library.</ref>  Apostle [[Alvin R.

(Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1968), 257-259</ref>  The validity of this claim has been questioned.<ref name=MacKay2016 />

A young woman living at the home of David Whitmer in Ohio in 1838 reported receiving a number of revelations about the downfall of Joseph Smith by looking through a black stone that she had found. Some disaffected church members followed after her.<ref>{{Citation

}} \"At this time a certain young woman, who was living at David Whitmer’s uttered a prophecy; which she said was given her, by looking through a black stone that she had found. This prophecy gave some altogether a new idea of things. She said, the reason why one third of the church would turn away from Joseph was, because that he was in transgression himself; and would fall from his office on account of the same; that David Whitmer or Martin Harris would fill Joseph’s place: and that the one, who did not succeed him, would be councillor to him who did. This girl soon became an object of great attention among those who were disaffected. Dr. Williams, the ex justice of the peace, became her scribe; and wrote her revelations for her. Jared Carter, who lived in the same house with David Whitmer, soon imbibed the same spirit; and I was informed, that he said in one of their meetings, that he had 'power to raise Joe. Smith to the highest heaven, or Sink him down to the lowest hell.' ... his confession was received, and he was forgiven. But the rest of his party continued obstinate They still held their secret meetings at David Whitmer’s; and when the young woman, who was their instructress was through giving what revelations she intended for the evening, she would jump out of her chair and dance over the floor, boasting of her power until she was perfectly exhausted. Her proselytes would also, in the most vehement manner, proclaim their purity and holiness, and the mighty power which they were going to have.\"</ref>

==Nauvoo Period 1839–1847==
In 1841, apostles [[Wilford Woodruff]] and [[George A. Smith]] confiscated several seer stones and [[grimoire]]s from convert William Mountford in [[Staffordshire|Staffordshire, England]]. The grimoires were destroyed and seer stones were sent to Nauvoo. Joseph Smith examined the stones and stated that they were \"Urim and Thummim as good as ever was upon the earth\" but that they had been \"consecrated to devils.\"<ref>Stapley, Johnathan.

'''[[Cunning folk|Cunning Folk Traditions]]''', sometimes referred to as [[folk religion|Folk Magic]], were intertwined with the early culture and practice of the '''[[Latter Day Saint movement]]'''.  These traditions were widespread in unorganized religion in the parts of Europe and America where the Latter Day Saint movement began in the 1820s and 1830s.<ref>Walker, Ronald W. (1984) \"Joseph Smith: The Palmyra Seer,\" BYU Studies Quarterly: Vol. 24 : Iss. 4 , Article 5.

The Power of Godliness: Mormon Liturgy and Cosmology. Oxford University Press, 2018: page 106.</ref>  

Early church leaders were tolerant of these traditions, but by the beginning of the 20th century folk practices were not considered part of the [[orthopraxy]] of most branches of the movement, including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).<ref>Stapley, Johnathan. The Power of Godliness: Mormon Liturgy and Cosmology. Oxford University Press, 2018: page 4, 107.</ref>  The extent that the founder of the movement [[Joseph Smith]] and his early followers participated in the culture has been the subject of controversy since before the church's founding in 1830, and continues to this day.<ref>Walker, Ronald W.

==Joseph Smith Family==

The Smith family practiced a form of [[folk religion]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Quinn|1998|p=xx–xxi}}: A 1985 memorandum sent from the headquarters of the LDS [[Church Educational System]] to regional and local administrators read, \"Even if the [Mark Hofmann] letters were to be unauthentic, such issues as Joseph Smith's involvement in treasure-seeking and folk magic remain. Ample evidence exists for both of these, even without the letters.\"</ref> which, although not uncommon in this time and place, was criticized by many contemporary Protestants \"as either fraudulent illusion or the workings of the Devil.\"<ref>{{citation |first=Keith |last=Thomas |title=Religion and the Decline of Magic |location=New York |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |year=1971 |page=256}}</ref> Both Joseph Smith, Sr. and at least two of his sons worked at \"money digging,\" using [[Seer stones (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]] in mostly unsuccessful attempts to locate lost items and buried treasure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1838a|pp=42–43}} (saying that he had been a \"money digger\" but that it \"was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it\"). {{citation |journal=[[Elders' Journal|Elders' Journal of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] |volume=1 |issue=43 |date=July 1838 |title=Elders Journal}}. For a discussion of Smith's money-digging activities by an academic LDS biographer, see {{harvnb|Bushman|2005|pp=48–49}}.</ref> In a draft of her memoirs, Lucy Mack Smith referred to folk magic:<blockquote>I shall change my theme for the present, but let not my reader suppose that because I shall pursue another topic for a season that we stopt our labor and went at trying to win the faculty of Abrac, drawing magic circles or soothsaying, to the neglect of all kinds of business. We never during our lives suffered one important interest to swallow up every other obligation. But whilst we worked with our hands, we endeavored to remember the service of and the welfare of our souls.<ref>{{Citation

}}</ref></blockquote> [[D. Michael Quinn]] has written that Lucy Mack Smith viewed these magical practices as \"part of her family's religious quest\" while denying that they prevented \"family members from accomplishing other, equally important work.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Quinn|1998|page=55}}: \"Joseph Smith's mother did not deny her family participation in occult activities but simply affirmed that these did not prevent family members from accomplishing other, equally important work.\" In a note at {{harvnb|Vogel|1996|p=285}} (n. 84), Dan Vogel argues that this sentence from the draft may have been excised from the 1853 edition of Lucy Mack Smith's memoirs because of its allusion to folk magic, \"which was a sensitive subject for those not wishing to give credence to claims made in affidavits collected in 1833 by Philastus Hurlbut.\"</ref>  [[Jan Shipps]] notes that while Smith's \"religious claims were rejected by many of the persons who had known him in the 1820s because they remembered him as a practitioner of the magic arts,\" others of his earliest followers were attracted to his claims \"for precisely the same reason.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Shipps|1985|p=18}}.</ref>

Smith reports using seer stones in the translation of the Book of Mormon<ref>\"History, 1838–1856, volume A-1 [23 December 1805–30 August 1834],\" p. 9, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed April 1, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/11</ref>, as well as in the reception of several early revelations in the Doctrine and Covenants.<ref>{{citation | first = James R.

===Treasure Seeking Activities===
{{see also|Joseph Smith and the criminal justice system}}
From about 1819, Smith regularly practiced [[scrying]], a form of [[divination]] in which a \"seer\" looked into a [[Seer stones in Mormonism|seer stone]] to receive supernatural knowledge.<ref>{{citation | title = Seer Stones | url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/seer-stones?lang=eng }}</ref> Smith usually practiced \"peeping\" or seeing by putting a stone at the bottom of a white stovepipe hat, putting his face over the hat to block the light, then divining information from the stone.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=164}}; {{Harvtxt|Mather|1880|p=199}}. According to an account of an interview with Joseph Smith Sr., the 14-year-old Joseph borrowed a stone from a person working as a local crystal gazer {{Harvtxt|Lapham|1870|pp=305–306}} which reportedly showed him the underground location of another stone near his home, which he located at a depth of about twenty-two feet.  According to another story, in either 1819 {{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=19}} or 1822 {{Harvtxt|Howe|1834|p=240}}, while the older Smith males were digging a well for a Palmyra neighbor, they found an unusual stone {{Harvtxt|Harris|1859|p=163}}, described as either white and glassy and shaped like a child's foot or \"chocolate-colored, somewhat egg-shaped.\" {{Harvtxt|Roberts|1930|loc=1:129}}. Smith then used this stone as a seer stone.{{Harvtxt|Tucker|1867|p=20}}.</ref>  Smith and his father achieved \"something of a mysterious local reputation in the profession—mysterious because there is no record that they ever found anything despite the readiness of some local residents to pay for their efforts.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Ostling|1999|p=25}}.</ref>

In late 1825, Josiah Stowell, a well-to-do farmer from [[Bainbridge (town), New York|South Bainbridge]], [[Chenango County, New York]], who had been searching for a lost Spanish mine near [[Harmony Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania]] with another seer, traveled to Manchester to hire Smith \"on account of having heard that he possessed certain keys, by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye.\"<ref>{{Harvtxt|Vogel|2004|p=69}}. </ref> Smith worked for Stowell for nearly a month before prevailing upon him to give up the enterprise.<ref>\"History, 1838–1856, volume A-1 [23 December 1805–30 August 1834],\" p. 8, The Joseph Smith Papers, accessed April 1, 2020, https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/history-1838-1856-volume-a-1-23-december-1805-30-august-1834/10</ref>

==Notable early examples 1820–1838==
Smith's early use of seer stones is not well documented but one account describes him borrowing the seer stone of a local girl, possibly Sally Chase, and using it to find his own first stone.<ref name=MacKay2016>{{cite book

Smith kept his gold Bible hid.” And, obedient to her directions, they gathered their forces and laid siege to the cooper shop.\"</ref>

One of Joseph Smith's early [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]], now canonized in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], stated that [[Oliver Cowdery]] had the power to use a [[dowsing|divining rod]].<ref>{{citation | title = Divining Rods | url = https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/topics/divining-rods?lang=eng }}</ref>

[[Hiram Page]], one of the [[Eight Witnesses]] of the Book of Mormon, was living with his in-laws the [[Peter Whitmer Sr.|Whitmers]] in [[Fayette, New York]]. Smith arrived in August 1830 to discover Page using a black \"[[Seer stone (Latter Day Saints)|seerstone]]\" to produce revelations for the church. The revelations were regarding the organization and location of [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]]. Cowdery and the Whitmer family believed the revelations were authentic. In response, Smith announced in a new revelation during the church's September conference that Page's revelations were of the devil (Doctrine and Covenants, {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 28|verse=11}}). At the conference there was considerable discussion on the topic. Page agreed to discard the stone and the revelations and join in following Smith as the sole [[prophet, seer, and revelator|revelator]] for the church. The members present confirmed this unanimously [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|with a vote]]. The fate of the stone and revelations was not recorded by contemporary sources and has been the subject of interest ever since.<ref name=MacKay2016 />  Martin Harris's brother Emer stated second-hand in 1856 that the stone was ground to powder and the associated revelations were burned.<ref>Emer Harris statement, in Utah Stake General Minutes, Local Record 9629, ser. 11, vol. 10 (1855-60), 6 April 1856, Church History Library.</ref>  Apostle [[Alvin R. Dyer]] stated that he had discovered Page's seerstone in 1955, that it had been passed down through Jacob Whitmer's family.<ref>Dyer, Alvin R., ''Refiner's Fire: The Significance of Events Transpiring in Missouri'', 2nd ed. rev. (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 1968), 257-259</ref>  The validity of this claim has been questioned.<ref name=MacKay2016 />

A young woman living at the home of David Whitmer in Ohio in 1838 reported receiving a number of revelations about the downfall of Joseph Smith by looking through a black stone that she had found. Some disaffected church members followed after her.<ref>{{Citation

}} \"At this time a certain young woman, who was living at David Whitmer’s uttered a prophecy; which she said was given her, by looking through a black stone that she had found. This prophecy gave some altogether a new idea of things. She said, the reason why one third of the church would turn away from Joseph was, because that he was in transgression himself; and would fall from his office on account of the same; that David Whitmer or Martin Harris would fill Joseph’s place: and that the one, who did not succeed him, would be councillor to him who did. This girl soon became an object of great attention among those who were disaffected. Dr. Williams, the ex justice of the peace, became her scribe; and wrote her revelations for her. Jared Carter, who lived in the same house with David Whitmer, soon imbibed the same spirit; and I was informed, that he said in one of their meetings, that he had 'power to raise Joe. Smith to the highest heaven, or Sink him down to the lowest hell.' ... his confession was received, and he was forgiven. But the rest of his party continued obstinate They still held their secret meetings at David Whitmer’s; and when the young woman, who was their instructress was through giving what revelations she intended for the evening, she would jump out of her chair and dance over the floor, boasting of her power until she was perfectly exhausted. Her proselytes would also, in the most vehement manner, proclaim their purity and holiness, and the mighty power which they were going to have.\"</ref>

==Nauvoo Period 1839–1847==
In 1841, apostles [[Wilford Woodruff]] and [[George A. Smith]] confiscated several seer stones and [[grimoire]]s from convert William Mountford in [[Staffordshire|Staffordshire, England]]. The grimoires were destroyed and seer stones were sent to Nauvoo. Joseph Smith examined the stones and stated that they were \"Urim and Thummim as good as ever was upon the earth\" but that they had been \"consecrated to devils.\"<ref>Stapley, Johnathan.

In Riding Giants director Stacy Peralta pays tribute to the adventurous surfers riding the world's most daunting 20-foot high waves, only to yearn for even more challenging thrill rides.

Additionally Orsi worked with director and professional surfer Sam George to produce '''''Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau''''' (ESPN''''')'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/espn-films-30-30-hawaiian-154949024.html|title=ESPN Films: \"30 for 30\" \"Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau\" Wins Emmy Award|last=|first=|date=|website=Yahoo Finance/Marketwired|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=May 29, 2014|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' a biographical film of the big wave surfer Eddie Aikau who became the symbol of Aloha and celebration of Hawaiian culture.

Orsi's foray into documentary filmmaking began when she teamed with director John Armstrong to produce '''''Bashkaus: Hard Labor in Siberia'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650709/bio|title=Agi Orsi Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' (Discovery Channel), a film that won a '''Gold Medal Living Book Award''' and the '''Grand Prize at the Telluride Mountain Film Festival'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainfilm.org/festival/personalities/john-armstrong|title=John Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=John Armstrong|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> for chronicling the first joint US-Soviet river expedition in Russia's Altai Mountains during a thaw in the Cold War.  Following that, Orsi teamed again with Armstrong to produce '''''Curtain of Ice''''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/curtain-of-ice/oclc/27479917|title=Curtain of Ice|last=|first=|date=|website=World Cat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>(Discovery Channel), documenting the first-on water crossing of the Bering Strait, the \"Curtain of Ice,\" reuniting Eskimos separated for decades during the US-Russia arms escalation. The documentary also tells the story of Jim Noyes, a paraplegic with a broken spine who finds a new purpose for living after making the crossing.

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2011|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary, released in 2009 by Paramount Pictures, was financed for $300,000 by DreamWorks and Universal Pictures and Participant Media, with contributions from the Hilton Foundation and Community Supportive Housing, takes a critical look at then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's Safer City Initiative which made it a crime to panhandle, sleep, sit or store personal items on sidewalks and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homeless-losangeles/los-angeles-accused-of-criminalizing-homelessness-idUSTRE56E0MC20090715|title=Los Angeles accused of criminalizing homelessness|last=Gorman|first=Steve|date=2009|website=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The film, narrated by actress Catherine Keener, points to the success of supportive housing with wrap-around mental health and employment services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/get_involved.html|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is my Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Los Angeles earned recognition for the following awards: '''2011 Voice Award from SAMHSA''' (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) and '''Ghetto Award-Radar Hamburg International Film Festival.''' The documentary was also an official selection for the Los Angeles Film Festival (Premiere), One World Human Rights Film Festival (Prague), Human Rights Film Festival (London), Oaxaca Film Festival, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/assets/lost-angels-press-notes-FINAL.pdf|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with poignant personal stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary premiered on [[ESPN]] on October 1, 2013 and won an '''Emmy for Best Sports Documentary Series''', making it one of the few surf-related films to ever receive such recognition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2014/05/29/hawaii-news/hawaiian-the-legend-of-eddie-aikau-wins-emmy-award/|title=Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddie Aikau|last=|first=|date=2020|website=West Hawaii Today|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The documentary that chronicles Aikau's emergence as a legendary surfer and lifeguard who saved lives but lost his own at sea also won awards for '''Best Picture and Best Director at the Malibu International Film Festival'''; '''Best Picture, Best Documentary and Audience Favorite at the Maui Film Festival''', as well as '''Best Documentary at Surfer Poll'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2014/05/29/hawaii-news/hawaiian-the-legend-of-eddie-aikau-wins-emmy-award/|title=Hawaiian: The Legend of Eddi Akau|last=|first=|date=2020|website=West Hawaii Today|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi's foray into documentary filmmaking began when she teamed with director John Armstrong to produce '''''Bashkaus: Hard Labor in Siberia'''''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0650709/bio|title=Agi Orsi Bio|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>''',''' (Discovery Channel), a film that won a '''Gold Medal Living Book Award''' and the '''Grand Prize at the Telluride Mountain Film Festival'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountainfilm.org/festival/personalities/john-armstrong|title=John Armstrong|last=|first=|date=|website=John Armstrong|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> for chronicling the first joint US-Soviet river expedition in Russia's Altai Mountains during a thaw in the Cold War.  Following that, Orsi teamed again with Armstrong to produce '''''Curtain of Ice''''' <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/curtain-of-ice/oclc/27479917|title=Curtain of Ice|last=|first=|date=|website=World Cat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>(Discovery Channel), documenting the first-on water crossing of the Bering Strait, the \"Curtain of Ice,\" reuniting Eskimos separated for decades during the US-Russia arms escalation. The documentary also tells the story of Jim Noyes, a paraplegic with a broken spine who finds a new purpose for living after making the crossing.

Departing from the adventure sports genre, Orsi served as supervising producer on '''''Amazing Journey: The Story of The Who''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462441/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Amazing Journey: The Story of the Who|last=|first=|date=|website=IMDB|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a 2007 documentary '''''nominated for a Grammy''' '''Award''''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/who|title=The Who|last=|first=|date=|website=Grammy.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> co-directed by [[Murray Lerner]] and [[Paul Crowder (filmmaker)|Paul Crowder]], integrating archival footage of The Who's concerts at Monterrey and Woodstock and interviews with the stars of the English band known for its ear-shattering volumes and distortions, as well as its mixture of pop hits, traditional jazz, rock and R & B. The film's soundtrack features a compilation of the band's greatest hits, among them the single, \"My Generation,\" written by Peter Townshend. Included in the documentary is original footage, never seen before, of the 1970 Leeds University appearance in which The Who's performance disintegrated into \"chaotic noise\" as a result of amphetamine use, resulting in a fist fight between band members and the temporary expulsion of lead singer Roger Daltrey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/daltrey-walks-out-on-who/|title=When Roger Daltrey Walked Out, Then Right Back into the Who|last=Wawzenek|first=Bryan|date=|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Far from the concert stage, Orsi went to downtown Los Angeles to produce '''''Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home''''', a documentary that evolved from the 2009 movie “The Soloist.” Starring Robert Downey Jr. and Jamie Foxx, The Soloist is based on stories LA Times columnist Steve Lopez wrote about a Julliard-educated homeless musician. In contrast to The Soloist's laser focus on the musician, Lost Angels weaves together the stories of several Skid Row residents and extras from The Soloist, including a cat lover who feeds stray cats as she wheels carts of trash up and down Skid Row, an Olympic athlete and track and field coach tormented by drug addiction, a gospel singer with a rare congenital disease and a transgender Vietnam Veteran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-oct-12-la-fi-ct-onlocation-20111012-story.html|title=On Location: ‘Lost Angels’ documentary focuses on L.A. skid row|last=Verrier|first=Richard|date=2011|website=Los Angeles Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reellifewithjane.com/2013/05/review-lost-angels-skid-row-is-my-home/|title=Film Review & Perspective: ‘Lost Angels: Skid Row Is My Home’|last=Miraz|first=Jacqueline|date=May 20, 2013|website=Reel Life with Jane|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The documentary, released in 2009 by Paramount Pictures, was financed for $300,000 by DreamWorks and Universal Pictures and Participant Media, with contributions from the Hilton Foundation and Community Supportive Housing, takes a critical look at then Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa's Safer City Initiative which made it a crime to panhandle, sleep, sit or store personal items on sidewalks and other public spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-homeless-losangeles/los-angeles-accused-of-criminalizing-homelessness-idUSTRE56E0MC20090715|title=Los Angeles accused of criminalizing homelessness|last=Gorman|first=Steve|date=2009|website=Reuters|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The film, narrated by actress Catherine Keener, points to the success of supportive housing with wrap-around mental health and employment services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/get_involved.html|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is my Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Los Angeles earned recognition for the following awards: '''2011 Voice Award from SAMHSA''' (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) and '''Ghetto Award-Radar Hamburg International Film Festival.''' The documentary was also an official selection for the Los Angeles Film Festival (Premiere), One World Human Rights Film Festival (Prague), Human Rights Film Festival (London), Oaxaca Film Festival, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cinemalibrestudio.com/skidrowismyhome/assets/lost-angels-press-notes-FINAL.pdf|title=Lost Angels: Skid Row is My Home|last=|first=|date=|website=Cinema Libre Studio|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

Orsi also produced '''''Los Punks; We Are All We Have''''', a 2016 documentary financed by Vans that explores the punk rock scene blaring from backyards and dirt lots in East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights and South Los Angeles, where the mohawk-sporting musicians, some with troubled pasts—suicide attempts, police arrests—do not need corporate music conglomerates or concert venues to make a name for their hardcore selves. Los Punks, directed by punk rocker Angela Boatwright, premiered at the 2016 Slamdance Film Festival, where critics applauded its gritty depiction of homegrown East LA music bands—Las Cochinas, Corrupted Youth, Rhythmic Asylum—integrated with poignant personal stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-los-punks-movie-20160525-snap-story.html|title='Los Punks’ documentary goes behind the scenes of L.A.'s underground punk rock scene|last=Roberts|first=Randall|date=May 26, 2016|website=LA Times|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

'''Henry Francis Montgomery Stuart''' (29 April 1902{{spaced ndash}}2 February 2000) was an Irish writer. He was awarded one of the highest artistic accolades in Ireland, being elected a [[Saoi]] of [[Aosdána]], before his death in 2000.<ref> Irish Times, In honour of Francis Stuart? October 10, 1996 [https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/in-honour-of-francis-stuart-1.94304]</ref> His years in [[Nazi Germany]] led to a great deal of controversy.<ref> The Guardian, February 4 2000, obituary of Francis Stuart [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/04/2]</ref>

==Early life==
Francis Stuart was born in [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], Australia<ref name=\"irishmeninparis\" /><ref name=\"ricorso\" /> on 29 April 1902 to [[Protestantism in Ireland|Irish Protestant]] parents, Henry Irwin Stuart and Elizabeth Barbara Isabel Montgomery; his father was an alcoholic and killed himself when Stuart was an infant. This prompted his mother to return to Ireland and Stuart's childhood was divided between his home in Ireland and [[Rugby School]] in England, where he boarded.

In 1920, at age 17, he became a Catholic and married [[Iseult Gonne]], [[Maud Gonne]]'s daughter. Maud Gonne's companion, [[Mary Barry O'Delaney]], stood as his godmother upon his conversion.<ref name=Maume>{{cite book|last1=Maume|first1=Patrick|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=O'Delaney, Mary Barry}}</ref> Aged 24 years, Iseult had had a romantic but unsettled life. Maud Gonne's estranged husband [[John MacBride]] was executed in 1916 for taking part in the [[Easter Rising]]. Iseult Gonne's father was the right-wing French politician, [[Lucien Millevoye]], with whom Maud Gonne had had an affair between 1887 and 1899. Because of her complex family situation, Iseult was often passed off as Maud Gonne's niece in conservative circles in Ireland. Iseult grew up in Paris and London. She had been proposed to by [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1917 (he had also earlier proposed to her mother; Yeats was 50 at the time, Iseult 20) and had a brief affair with [[Ezra Pound]] prior to meeting Stuart. Pound and Stuart both believed in the primacy of the artist over the masses and were subsequently drawn to [[fascism]]; Stuart to [[Nazi Germany]] and Pound to [[Fascist Italy]].

==IRA involvement==
Gonne and Stuart had a baby daughter who died in infancy. Perhaps to recover from this tragedy, they travelled for a while in Europe but returned to Ireland as the [[Irish Civil War]] began. Unsurprisingly given Gonne's strong opinions, the couple were caught up on the anti-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) side of this fight. Stuart was involved in gun running and was interned after a botched raid.

==Literary career==
After independence, Stuart participated in the literary life of [[Dublin]] and wrote poetry and novels. His novels were successful and his writing was publicly supported by Yeats. Yeats, however, seemed to have had mixed feelings for Stuart who was, after all, married to a woman he regarded almost as a daughter and, even, as a possible wife. In his poem \"Why should not Old Men be Mad?\" (1936) in which he lists what he regards as provocations to rage, he claims he has seen
:\"A girl that knew all Dante once
:Live to bear children to a dunce\"
The first of these lines is accepted as referring to Gonne and the second to Stuart (Elborn 1990).

Stuart and Gonne had three children, a daughter Dolores who died three months old, a son Ian and a daughter Katherine. Ian Stuart went on to become an artist and was married for a time to the sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] and later to the Berlin-trained artist and jewellery designer Anna Stuart [7] whom he first met in 1970. They gave Stuart three grandchildren; food entrepreneur Laragh, photographer Suki and sculptress Sophia.

Stuart's time with Gonne may not have been an entirely happy time; from the accounts given in his apparently autobiographical novels, both he and his wife struggled with personal demons and their internal anguish poisoned their marriage. In her letters to close friend William Butler Yeats, Iseult Gonne's mother Maud Gonne characterizes Francis Stuart as being emotionally, financially, and physically abusive towards Iseult: \"Stuart's conduct towards Iseult is shocking. While they were staying with me in Dublin he struck her & one day knocked her down. He threw her out of her own room with such violence that she fell on the landing half dressed at the feet of Claud Chevasse who was staying in the house at the time.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>  Another time, neighbors reported seeing a fire in the couple's house: \"They found Iseult in her dressing gown outside. Stuart had locked himself in her room from where the flames were coming. They could see him pouring petroleum. Finally he opened the door -- he had been burning Iseult's clothes to punish her! Frequently he locked her up without food.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>

==Involvement with the Third Reich==
It was also during the 1930s that Stuart became friendly with German Intelligence ([[Abwehr]]) agent [[Helmut Clissmann]] and his Irish wife Elizabeth. Clissmann was working for the German Academic Exchange Service and the ''[[Deutsche Akademie]]'' (DA). He was facilitating academic exchanges between Ireland and the [[Third Reich]] but also forming connections which might be of benefit to German Intelligence. Clissmann was also a representative of the [[Nazi]] ''Auslandorganisation'' (AO) – the Nazi Party's foreign organisation – in pre-war Ireland.

Stuart was also friendly with the head of the German Legation in Dublin, Dr [[Eduard Hempel]], largely as a result of Maud Gonne MacBride's rapport with him. By 1938 Stuart was seeking a way out of his marriage and the provincialism of Irish life. Iseult intervened with Clissmann to arrange for Stuart to travel to Germany to give a series of academic lectures in conjunction with the DA. Stuart travelled to Germany in April 1939 and his host in Germany was Professor [[Walter F. Schirmer]], the senior member of the English faculty with the DA and [[Berlin University]]. He eventually visited Munich, Hamburg, Bonn and Cologne. At the completion of his lecture tour he accepted an appointment as lecturer in English and Irish literature at Berlin University to begin in 1940, two years after Jews had been barred from German universities by the Nazis' [[Nuremberg Laws]].

In July 1939 Stuart returned home to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] and confirmed at the outbreak of war in September that he would still take the place in Berlin. When Stuart's plans for travelling to Germany were finalised, he received a visit from his brother-in-law, [[Seán MacBride]], this meeting followed the seizure of an IRA radio transmitter on 29 December 1939, which had been used to contact Germany. Stuart, MacBride, [[Seamus O'Donovan]], and IRA Chief of Staff [[Stephen Hayes (Irish Republican)|Stephen Hayes]] then met at O'Donovan's house. Stuart was told to take a message to Abwehr HQ in Berlin. He travelled alone to [[Nazi Germany]], something that was possible because Ireland was neutral in the [[Second World War]], and arrived in Berlin during January 1940. Upon arrival he delivered the IRA message and had some discussion with the Abwehr on the conditions in Ireland and the fate of the IRA-Abwehr radio link. He also reactivated his acquaintance with Abwehr asset Helmut Clissmann who was acting as an advisor to SS Colonel Dr [[Edmund Vessenmayer]]. Through Clissmann Stuart was introduced to [[Sonderführer]] Kurt Haller. Around August 1940, Stuart was asked by Haller if he would participate in [[Operation Dove (Ireland)|Operation Dove]] and he agreed although he was later dropped in favour of [[Frank Ryan (Irish republican)|Frank Ryan]]. In so far as is known he had no further contact with German Intelligence although he did maintain links with Frank Ryan up to his death and funeral in June 1944.

===Time in Berlin===

Between March 1942 and January 1944 Stuart worked as part of the ''Redaktion-Irland'' (also sometimes referred to as ''Irland-Redaktion'', \"''Editorial Ireland\"'' in English) team, reading radio broadcasts containing Nazi propaganda which were aimed at and heard in Ireland. Before deciding to accept this job he discussed it with Frank Ryan, and they agreed that no anti-Semitic or anti-Soviet statements should be made. He was dropped from the ''Redaktion-Irland'' team in January 1944 because he objected to the anti-Soviet material that was presented to him and deemed essential by his supervisors. His [[passport]] was taken from him by the [[Gestapo]] after this event.<ref>David O'Donoghue: Hitler's Irish Voices – The Story of German Radio's Wartime Irish Service. Beyond the Pale, Dublin 1998 {{ISBN|1-900960-04-4}}</ref>

In his radio broadcasts he frequently spoke with admiration of [[Hitler]] and expressed the hope that Germany would help unite Ireland. After the war he maintained that he was not drawn to Germany by support for Nazism, but that he was fascinated by wartime Germany as a dark spectacle of the grotesque and as a celebration of destruction. Stuart described one such event at the Berlin Olympic stadium in June 1939 as: \"A most amazing thing. Such a spectacle and organisation.\"<ref name=\"Hull, p.310\">Hull, p.310</ref>

===Anti-semitism===
Stuart is known to have read only one piece of what might be considered anti-semitic propaganda for Redaktion-Irland: his first, and even then it was a single sentence. Whilst enthralled with the macabre spectacle of wartime Nazi Germany, he is also on record via his letters as deploring much of what he saw around him.<ref name=indo>{{Cite news | last=Cronin | first= Anthony| title=Healing the Wounds of Francis Stuart |newspaper=[[The Irish Independent]] |page = 1| date=27 June 1999}}</ref> 

However, Stuart did write the following in a 1924 IRA pamphlet (discovered by Brendan Barrington, see Bibliography):<blockquote>Austria, in 1921, had been ruined by the war, and was far, far poorer than Ireland is today, for besides having no money she was overburdened with innumerable debts. At that time Vienna was full of Jews, who controlled the banks and the factories and even a large part of the Government; the Austrians themselves seemed about to be driven out of their own city.<ref>Colm Tóibín, [http://www.colmtoibin.com/essays/lrb/CTLRBSept012000b.htm \"Issues of Truth and Invention\" (Part II)], ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 1 September 2000, on colmtoibin.com</ref></blockquote>In a lengthy article for  the lrb [[Colm Tóibín]] wrote , \"Let us accept then that Stuart was anti-semitic, that he admired Hitler, that he was a rabid Irish nationalist.\" <ref> [http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geKYk4SgBbvDoA6hNXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1526774456/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lrb.co.uk%2fv23%2fn01%2fcolm-toibin%2fissues-of-truth-and-invention/RK=2/RS=xgZ.2iSFCpxsngFxqMzlmoHROC4- issues of truth and invention lrb]</ref>

==Post World War II==
In 1945 Stuart decided to return to Ireland with a former student, Gertrude Meissner; they were unable to do so and were arrested and detained by Allied troops. After they were released, Stuart and Meissner lived in Germany and then France and England. They married in 1954 after Iseult's death and in 1958 they returned to settle in Ireland. In 1971 Stuart published his best known work, ''Black List Section H'', an [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]]<ref>{{cite book | title=The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature | work=Black List Section H | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Welch (ed.), Robert | authorlink=Robert Welch (author) | year=1996 | isbn=0198661584 | url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00welc }}</ref> documenting his life and distinguished by a queasy sensitivity to moral complexity and moral ambiguity.

In 1991 he made an extended appearance on British television: on 16 March he took part in an ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' discussion called ''The Luck of The Irish?'' alongside [[J. P. Donleavy]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], [[Emily O'Reilly]], [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Paul Hill]] and others.<ref>See [[List of After Dark editions#Series 4]]</ref>

'''Henry Francis Montgomery Stuart''' (29 April 1902{{spaced ndash}}2 February 2000) was an Irish writer. He was awarded one of the highest artistic accolades in Ireland, being elected a [[Saoi]] of [[Aosdána]], before his death in 2000.<ref> Irish Times, In honour of Francis Stuart? October 10, 1996 [https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/in-honour-of-francis-stuart-1.94304]</ref> His years in [[Nazi Germany]] led to a great deal of controversy.<ref> The Guardian, February 4 2000, obituary of Francis Stuart [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/04/2]</ref>

==Early life==
Francis Stuart was born in [[Townsville]], [[Queensland]], Australia<ref name=\"irishmeninparis\" /><ref name=\"ricorso\" /> on 29 April 1902 to [[Protestantism in Ireland|Irish Protestant]] parents, Henry Irwin Stuart and Elizabeth Barbara Isabel Montgomery; his father was an alcoholic and killed himself when Stuart was an infant. This prompted his mother to return to Ireland and Stuart's childhood was divided between his home in Ireland and [[Rugby School]] in England, where he boarded.

In 1920, at age 17, he became a Catholic and married [[Iseult Gonne]], [[Maud Gonne]]'s daughter. Maud Gonne's companion, [[Mary Barry O'Delaney]], stood as his godmother upon his conversion.<ref name=Maume>{{cite book|last1=Maume|first1=Patrick|editor1-last=McGuire|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=Quinn|editor2-first=James|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|chapter=O'Delaney, Mary Barry}}</ref> Aged 24 years, Iseult had had a romantic but unsettled life. Maud Gonne's estranged husband [[John MacBride]] was executed in 1916 for taking part in the [[Easter Rising]]. Iseult Gonne's own father was the right-wing French politician, [[Lucien Millevoye]], with whom Maud Gonne had had an affair between 1887 and 1899. Because of her complex family situation, Iseult was often passed off as Maud Gonne's niece in conservative circles in Ireland. Iseult grew up in Paris and London. She had been proposed to by [[W. B. Yeats]] in 1917 (he had also earlier proposed to her mother; Yeats was 50 at the time, Iseult 20) and had a brief affair with [[Ezra Pound]] prior to meeting Stuart. Pound and Stuart both believed in the primacy of the artist over the masses and were subsequently drawn to fascism: Stuart to [[Nazi Germany]] and Pound to [[fascism|fascist]] Italy.

==IRA involvement==
Gonne and Stuart had a baby daughter who died in infancy. Perhaps to recover from this tragedy, they travelled for a while in Europe but returned to Ireland as the [[Irish Civil War]] began. Unsurprisingly given Gonne's strong opinions, the couple were caught up on the anti-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) side of this fight. Stuart was involved in gun running and was interned after a botched raid.

==Literary career==
After independence, Stuart participated in the literary life of [[Dublin]] and wrote poetry and novels. His novels were successful and his writing was publicly supported by Yeats. Yeats, however, seemed to have had mixed feelings for Stuart who was, after all, married to a woman he regarded almost as a daughter and, even, as a possible wife. In his poem \"Why should not Old Men be Mad?\" (1936) in which he lists what he regards as provocations to rage, he claims he has seen
:\"A girl that knew all Dante once
:Live to bear children to a dunce\"
The first of these lines is accepted as referring to Gonne and the second to Stuart (Elborn 1990).

Stuart and Gonne had three children, a daughter Dolores who died three months old, a son Ian and a daughter Katherine. Ian Stuart went on to become an artist and was married for a time to the sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] and later to the Berlin-trained artist and jewellery designer Anna Stuart [7] whom he first met in 1970. They gave Stuart three grandchildren; food entrepreneur Laragh, photographer Suki and sculptress Sophia.

Stuart's time with Gonne may not have been an entirely happy time; from the accounts given in his apparently autobiographical novels, both he and his wife struggled with personal demons and their internal anguish poisoned their marriage. In her letters to close friend William Butler Yeats, Iseult Gonne's mother Maud Gonne characterizes Francis Stuart as being emotionally, financially, and physically abusive towards Iseult: \"Stuart's conduct towards Iseult is shocking. While they were staying with me in Dublin he struck her & one day knocked her down. He threw her out of her own room with such violence that she fell on the landing half dressed at the feet of Claud Chevasse who was staying in the house at the time.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>  Another time, neighbors reported seeing a fire in the couple's house: \"They found Iseult in her dressing gown outside. Stuart had locked himself in her room from where the flames were coming. They could see him pouring petroleum. Finally he opened the door -- he had been burning Iseult's clothes to punish her! Frequently he locked her up without food.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=MacBride White|editor1-first=Anna|title=The Gonne-Yeats Letters 1893-1938|date=1992|publisher=W W Norton|isbn=9780393034455|page=[https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404 404]|url=https://archive.org/details/gonneyeatsletter00maud/page/404}}</ref>

==Involvement with the Third Reich==
It was also during the 1930s that Stuart became friendly with German Intelligence ([[Abwehr]]) agent [[Helmut Clissmann]] and his Irish wife Elizabeth. Clissmann was working for the German Academic Exchange Service and the ''[[Deutsche Akademie]]'' (DA). He was facilitating academic exchanges between Ireland and the [[Third Reich]] but also forming connections which might be of benefit to German Intelligence. Clissmann was also a representative of the [[Nazi]] ''Auslandorganisation'' (AO) – the Nazi Party's foreign organisation – in pre-war Ireland.

Stuart was also friendly with the head of the German Legation in Dublin, Dr [[Eduard Hempel]], largely as a result of Maud Gonne MacBride's rapport with him. By 1938 Stuart was seeking a way out of his marriage and the provincialism of Irish life. Iseult intervened with Clissmann to arrange for Stuart to travel to Germany to give a series of academic lectures in conjunction with the DA. Stuart travelled to Germany in April 1939 and his host in Germany was Professor [[Walter F. Schirmer]], the senior member of the English faculty with the DA and [[Berlin University]]. He eventually visited Munich, Hamburg, Bonn and Cologne. At the completion of his lecture tour he accepted an appointment as lecturer in English and Irish literature at Berlin University to begin in 1940, two years after Jews had been barred from German universities by the Nazis' [[Nuremberg Laws]].

In July 1939 Stuart returned home to [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] and confirmed at the outbreak of war in September that he would still take the place in Berlin. When Stuart's plans for travelling to Germany were finalised, he received a visit from his brother-in-law, [[Seán MacBride]], this meeting followed the seizure of an IRA radio transmitter on 29 December 1939, which had been used to contact Germany. Stuart, MacBride, [[Seamus O'Donovan]], and IRA Chief of Staff [[Stephen Hayes (Irish Republican)|Stephen Hayes]] then met at O'Donovan's house. Stuart was told to take a message to Abwehr HQ in Berlin. He travelled alone to [[Nazi Germany]], something that was possible because Ireland was neutral in the [[Second World War]], and arrived in Berlin during January 1940. Upon arrival he delivered the IRA message and had some discussion with the Abwehr on the conditions in Ireland and the fate of the IRA-Abwehr radio link. He also reactivated his acquaintance with Abwehr asset Helmut Clissmann who was acting as an advisor to SS Colonel Dr [[Edmund Vessenmayer]]. Through Clissmann Stuart was introduced to [[Sonderführer]] Kurt Haller. Around August 1940, Stuart was asked by Haller if he would participate in [[Operation Dove (Ireland)|Operation Dove]] and he agreed although he was later dropped in favour of [[Frank Ryan (Irish republican)|Frank Ryan]]. In so far as is known he had no further contact with German Intelligence although he did maintain links with Frank Ryan up to his death and funeral in June 1944.

===Time in Berlin===

Between March 1942 and January 1944 Stuart worked as part of the ''Redaktion-Irland'' (also sometimes referred to as ''Irland-Redaktion'', \"''Editorial Ireland\"'' in English) team, reading radio broadcasts containing Nazi propaganda which were aimed at and heard in Ireland. Before deciding to accept this job he discussed it with Frank Ryan, and they agreed that no anti-Semitic or anti-Soviet statements should be made. He was dropped from the ''Redaktion-Irland'' team in January 1944 because he objected to the anti-Soviet material that was presented to him and deemed essential by his supervisors. His [[passport]] was taken from him by the [[Gestapo]] after this event.<ref>David O'Donoghue: Hitler's Irish Voices – The Story of German Radio's Wartime Irish Service. Beyond the Pale, Dublin 1998 {{ISBN|1-900960-04-4}}</ref>

In his radio broadcasts he frequently spoke with admiration of [[Hitler]] and expressed the hope that Germany would help unite Ireland. After the war he maintained that he was not drawn to Germany by support for Nazism, but that he was fascinated by wartime Germany as a dark spectacle of the grotesque and as a celebration of destruction. Stuart described one such event at the Berlin Olympic stadium in June 1939 as: \"A most amazing thing. Such a spectacle and organisation.\"<ref name=\"Hull, p.310\">Hull, p.310</ref>

===Anti-semitism===
Stuart is known to have read only one piece of what might be considered anti-semitic propaganda for Redaktion-Irland: his first, and even then it was a single sentence. Whilst enthralled with the macabre spectacle of wartime Nazi Germany, he is also on record via his letters as deploring much of what he saw around him.<ref name=indo>{{Cite news | last=Cronin | first= Anthony| title=Healing the Wounds of Francis Stuart |newspaper=[[The Irish Independent]] |page = 1| date=27 June 1999}}</ref> 

However, Stuart did write the following in a 1924 IRA pamphlet (discovered by Brendan Barrington, see Bibliography):<blockquote>Austria, in 1921, had been ruined by the war, and was far, far poorer than Ireland is today, for besides having no money she was overburdened with innumerable debts. At that time Vienna was full of Jews, who controlled the banks and the factories and even a large part of the Government; the Austrians themselves seemed about to be driven out of their own city.<ref>Colm Tóibín, [http://www.colmtoibin.com/essays/lrb/CTLRBSept012000b.htm \"Issues of Truth and Invention\" (Part II)], ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 1 September 2000, on colmtoibin.com</ref></blockquote>In a lengthy article for  the lrb [[Colm Tóibín]] wrote , \"Let us accept then that Stuart was anti-semitic, that he admired Hitler, that he was a rabid Irish nationalist.\" <ref> [http://r.search.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geKYk4SgBbvDoA6hNXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTByOHZyb21tBGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwMxBHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzcg--/RV=2/RE=1526774456/RO=10/RU=https%3a%2f%2fwww.lrb.co.uk%2fv23%2fn01%2fcolm-toibin%2fissues-of-truth-and-invention/RK=2/RS=xgZ.2iSFCpxsngFxqMzlmoHROC4- issues of truth and invention lrb]</ref>

==Post World War II==
In 1945 Stuart decided to return to Ireland with a former student, Gertrude Meissner; they were unable to do so and were arrested and detained by Allied troops. After they were released, Stuart and Meissner lived in Germany and then France and England. They married in 1954 after Iseult's death and in 1958 they returned to settle in Ireland. In 1971 Stuart published his best known work, ''Black List Section H'', an [[Biography in literature|autobiographical fiction]]<ref>{{cite book | title=The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature | work=Black List Section H | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Welch (ed.), Robert | authorlink=Robert Welch (author) | year=1996 | isbn=0198661584 | url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00welc }}</ref> documenting his life and distinguished by a queasy sensitivity to moral complexity and moral ambiguity.

In 1991 he made an extended appearance on British television: on 16 March he took part in an ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' discussion called ''The Luck of The Irish?'' alongside [[J. P. Donleavy]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], [[Emily O'Reilly]], [[Guildford Four and Maguire Seven|Paul Hill]] and others.<ref>See [[List of After Dark editions#Series 4]]</ref>

In 1996 Stuart was elected a [[Saoi]] of [[Aosdána]]. This is a high honour in the Irish art world and the influential [[Irish language]] poet [[Máire Mhac an tSaoi]] objected strongly, referring to Stuart's actions during the war and claiming that he held anti-Semitic opinions. When it was put to a vote, she was the only person to vote for the motion (there were 70 against, with 14 abstentions).<ref>The Irish Times, 27 November 1997</ref> She resigned from Aosdána in protest, sacrificing a government stipend by doing so. While the Aosdána affair was ongoing, ''[[Irish Times]]'' columnist [[Kevin Myers]] attacked Stuart as a Nazi sympathiser; Stuart sued for [[libel]] and the case was settled out of court. The statement from the ''Irish Times'' read out in the High Court accepted \"that Mr Stuart never expressed anti-Semitism in his writings or otherwise\".<ref name=indo/>

For some years before his death he lived in [[County Clare]] with his partner Fionuala and in [[County Wicklow]] with his son Ian and daughter-in-law Anna in a house outside [[Laragh, County Wicklow|Laragh]] village.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Stuart died of natural causes on 2 February 2000 at the age of 97 in County Clare.

==Selection for simplicity and complexity==

Usually organisms that have a higher rate of reproduction than their competitors have an evolutionary advantage. Consequently, organisms can evolve to become simpler and thus multiply faster and produce more offspring, as they require fewer resources to reproduce. A good example are parasites such as Plasmodium - the parasite responsible for [[malaria]] - and [[mycoplasma]]; these organisms often dispense with traits that are made unnecessary through parasitism on a host.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sirand-Pugnet, P. |author2=Lartigue, C. |author3=Marenda, M.  |title=Being Pathogenic, Plastic, and Sexual while Living with a Nearly Minimal Bacterial Genome |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e75 |year=2007 |pmid=17511520 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0030075 |pmc=1868952 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

A lineage can also dispense with complexity when a particular complex trait merely provides no selective advantage in a particular environment. Loss of this trait need not necessarily confer a selective advantage, but may be lost due to the accumulation of mutations if its loss does not confer an immediate selective disadvantage.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Maughan, H. |author2=Masel, J. |author3=Birky, W. C. |author4=Nicholson, W. L.  |title=The roles of mutation accumulation and selection in loss of sporulation in experimental populations of Bacillus subtilis |doi=10.1534/genetics.107.075663 |journal=Genetics |volume=177 |pages=937–948 |year=2007 |pmid=17720926 |pmc=2034656 |issue=2}}</ref> For example, a [[parasitic organisms|parasitic organism]] may dispense with the synthetic pathway of a metabolite where it can readily scavenge that metabolite from its host. Discarding this synthesis may not necessarily allow the parasite to conserve significant energy or resources and grow faster, but the loss may be fixed in the population through mutation accumulation if no disadvantage is incurred by loss of that pathway. Mutations causing loss of a complex trait occur more often than mutations causing gain of a complex trait.{{cn}}

With selection, evolution can also produce more complex organisms. Complexity often arises in the co-evolution of hosts and pathogens,<ref name=\"arms_race\">{{cite journal |author1=Dawkins, Richard  |author1link=Richard Dawkins |author2=Krebs, J. R. |title=Arms Races between and within Species |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=205 |issue=1161 |pages=489–511 |year=1979 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0081 |pmid=42057 |bibcode=1979RSPSB.205..489D }}</ref> with each side developing ever more sophisticated adaptations, such as the [[immune system]] and the many techniques pathogens have developed to evade it. For example, the parasite ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]'', which causes [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], has evolved so many copies of its major surface [[antigen]] that about 10% of its genome is devoted to different versions of this one gene. This tremendous complexity allows the parasite to constantly change its surface and thus evade the immune system through [[antigenic variation]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pays, E. |title=Regulation of antigen gene expression in Trypanosoma brucei |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=21 |issue=11 |pages=517–20 |year=2005 |pmid=16126458 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2005.08.016}}</ref>

More generally, the growth of complexity may be driven by the [[co-evolution]] between an organism and the [[ecosystem]] of [[predator]]s, [[prey]] and [[parasite]]s to which it tries to stay adapted: as any of these become more complex in order to cope better with the diversity of threats offered by the ecosystem formed by the others, the others too will have to adapt by becoming more complex, thus triggering an ongoing [[evolutionary arms race]]<ref name=\"arms_race\"/> towards more complexity.<ref>[[Francis Heylighen|Heylighen, F.]] (1999a) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BQWrppy8ooIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA17&dq=%22Heylighen%22+%22The+growth+of+structural+and+functional+complexity+...%22+&ots=p2cUiyexLo&sig=T6Dk_PTHRocBj8Lou81w_mHtJZA \"The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution]\", in F. Heylighen, J. Bollen & A. Riegler (eds.) The Evolution of Complexity Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, 17-44.</ref> This trend may be reinforced by the fact that ecosystems themselves tend to become more complex over time, as [[species diversity]] increases, together with the linkages or dependencies between species.

==Types of trends in complexity==
[[File:Evolution of complexity.svg|thumb|left|200px|Passive versus active trends in complexity. Organisms at the beginning are red. Numbers are shown by height with time moving up in a series.]]

If evolution possessed an active trend toward complexity ([[orthogenesis]]), as was widely believed in the 19th century,<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |url=https://archive.org/details/monadtomanconcep0000ruse |url-access=registration |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/monadtomanconcep0000ruse/page/526 526]–529 and passim}}</ref> then we would expect to see an active trend<!--right hand column in figure--> of increase over time in the most common value [[mode (statistics)|(the mode)]] of complexity among organisms.<ref name=Carroll>{{cite journal |author=Carroll SB |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11234024 |doi=10.1038/35059227|bibcode=2001Natur.409.1102C }}</ref> 

However, an increase in complexity can also be explained through a passive process.<ref name=Carroll/> Assuming unbiased random changes of complexity and the existence of a minimum complexity leads to an increase over time of the average complexity of the biosphere.This involves an increase in [[variance]], but the mode does not change. The trend towards the creation of some organisms with higher complexity over time exists, but it involves increasingly small percentages of living things.<ref name=\":0\" /> 

In this hypothesis, any appearance of evolution acting with an intrinsic direction towards increasingly complex organisms is a result of people concentrating on the small number of large, complex organisms that inhabit the [[Skewness|right-hand tail]] of the complexity distribution and ignoring simpler and much more common organisms. This passive model predicts that the majority of species are [[microorganism|microscopic]] [[prokaryote]]s, which is supported by estimates of 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> extant prokaryotes<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oren, A. |title=Prokaryote diversity and taxonomy: current status and future challenges |journal=Philos.

==Constructive neutral evolution==

Recently work in evolution theory has proposed that by relaxing [[selection pressure]], which typically acts to streamline [[genome]]s, the complexity of an organism increases by a process called constructive neutral evolution.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus1999\">{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Arlin |title=On the Possibility of Constructive Neutral Evolution |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=169–181 |doi=10.1007/PL00006540|pmid=10441669 |issn=0022-2844|bibcode=1999JMolE..49..169S |citeseerx=10.1.1.466.5042 }}</ref> Since the [[effective population size]] in eukaryotes (especially multi-cellular organisms) is much smaller than in prokaryotes,<ref name=\"SungAckerman2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=W. |last2=Ackerman |first2=M.

According to this model, new genes are created by non-[[adaptation (biology)|adaptive]] processes, such as by random [[gene duplication]]. These novel entities, although not required for viability, do give the organism excess capacity that can facilitate the mutational decay of functional subunits. If this decay results in a situation where all of the genes are now required, the organism has been trapped in a new state where the number of genes has increased. This process has been sometimes described as a complexifying ratchet.<ref name=\"LukešArchibald2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Lukeš |first1=Julius |last2=Archibald |first2=John M. |last3=Keeling |first3=Patrick J. |last4=Doolittle |first4=W.

Constructive neutral evolution has also been used to explain how ancient complexes, such as the spliceosome and the ribosome, have gained new subunits over time, how new alternative spliced isoforms of genes arise, how [[Ciliate#DNA_rearrangements_(gene_scrambling)|gene scrambling]] in [[ciliates]] evolved, and how pervasive pan-[[RNA editing]] may have arisen in ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]''.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus1999\"/><ref name=\"GrayLukes2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=M.

==History==
{{further|Orthogenesis}}

In the 19th century, some scientists such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) and [[Ray Lankester]] (1847–1929) believed that nature had an innate striving to become more complex with evolution. This belief may reflect then-current ideas of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) and of [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903) which envisaged the universe gradually evolving to a higher, more perfect state.

This view regarded the evolution of parasites from independent organisms to a parasitic species as \"[[Devolution (biology)|devolution]]\" or \"degeneration\", and contrary to nature. Social theorists have sometimes interpreted this approach metaphorically to decry certain categories of people as \"degenerate parasites\". Later scientists regarded biological devolution as nonsense; rather, lineages become simpler or more complicated according to whatever forms had a selective advantage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dougherty, Michael J. | title=Is the human race evolving or devolving? | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-human-race-evolvin/ | journal=Scientific American |date=July 1998 | quote=From a biological perspective, there is no such thing as devolution. All changes in the gene frequencies of populations--and quite often in the traits those genes influence--are by definition evolutionary changes. [...] When species do evolve, it is not out of need but rather because their populations contain organisms with variants of traits that offer a reproductive advantage in a changing environment.}}</ref>

With selection, evolution can also produce more complex organisms. Complexity often arises in the co-evolution of hosts and pathogens,<ref name=\"arms_race\">{{cite journal |author1=Dawkins, Richard  |author1link=Richard Dawkins |author2=Krebs, J.

More generally, the growth of complexity may be driven by the [[co-evolution]] between an organism and the [[ecosystem]] of [[predator]]s, [[prey]] and [[parasite]]s to which it tries to stay adapted: as any of these become more complex in order to cope better with the diversity of threats offered by the ecosystem formed by the others, the others too will have to adapt by becoming more complex, thus triggering an ongoing [[evolutionary arms race]]<ref name=\"arms_race\"/> towards more complexity.<ref>[[Francis Heylighen|Heylighen, F.]] (1999a) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=BQWrppy8ooIC&oi=fnd&pg=PA17&dq=%22Heylighen%22+%22The+growth+of+structural+and+functional+complexity+...%22+&ots=p2cUiyexLo&sig=T6Dk_PTHRocBj8Lou81w_mHtJZA \"The Growth of Structural and Functional Complexity during Evolution]\", in F. Heylighen, J. Bollen & A. Riegler (eds.)

==Types of trends in complexity==
[[File:Evolution of complexity.svg|thumb|left|200px|Passive versus active trends in complexity. Organisms at the beginning are red. Numbers are shown by height with time moving up in a series.]]

If evolution possessed an active trend toward complexity ([[orthogenesis]]), as was widely believed in the 19th century,<ref>{{cite book |last=Ruse |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Ruse |date=1996 |title=Monad to man: the Concept of Progress in Evolutionary Biology |url=https://archive.org/details/monadtomanconcep0000ruse |url-access=registration |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03248-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/monadtomanconcep0000ruse/page/526 526]–529 and passim}}</ref> then we would expect to see an active trend<!--right hand column in figure--> of increase over time in the most common value [[mode (statistics)|(the mode)]] of complexity among organisms.<ref name=Carroll>{{cite journal |author=Carroll SB |title=Chance and necessity: the evolution of morphological complexity and diversity |journal=Nature |volume=409 |issue=6823 |pages=1102–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11234024 |doi=10.1038/35059227|bibcode=2001Natur.409.1102C }}</ref> 

However, an increase in complexity can also be explained through a passive process.<ref name=Carroll/> Assuming unbiased random changes of complexity and the existence of a minimum complexity leads to an increase over time of the average complexity of the biosphere.This involves an increase in [[variance]], but the mode does not change. The trend towards the creation of some organisms with higher complexity over time exists, but it involves increasingly small percentages of living things.<ref name=\":0\" /> 

In this hypothesis, any appearance of evolution acting with an intrinsic direction towards increasingly complex organisms is a result of people concentrating on the small number of large, complex organisms that inhabit the [[Skewness|right-hand tail]] of the complexity distribution and ignoring simpler and much more common organisms. This passive model predicts that the majority of species are [[microorganism|microscopic]] [[prokaryote]]s, which is supported by estimates of 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> extant prokaryotes<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oren, A. |title=Prokaryote diversity and taxonomy: current status and future challenges |journal=Philos.

==Constructive neutral evolution==

Recently work in evolution theory has proposed that by relaxing [[selection pressure]], which typically acts to streamline [[genome]]s, the complexity of an organism increases by a process called constructive neutral evolution.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus1999\">{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Arlin |title=On the Possibility of Constructive Neutral Evolution |journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=169–181 |doi=10.1007/PL00006540|pmid=10441669 |issn=0022-2844|bibcode=1999JMolE..49..169S |citeseerx=10.1.1.466.5042 }}</ref> Since the [[effective population size]] in eukaryotes (especially multi-cellular organisms) is much smaller than in prokaryotes,<ref name=\"SungAckerman2012\">{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=W. |last2=Ackerman |first2=M.

According to this model, new genes are created by non-[[adaptation (biology)|adaptive]] processes, such as by random [[gene duplication]]. These novel entities, although not required for viability, do give the organism excess capacity that can facilitate the mutational decay of functional subunits. If this decay results in a situation where all of the genes are now required, the organism has been trapped in a new state where the number of genes has increased. This process has been sometimes described as a complexifying ratchet.<ref name=\"LukešArchibald2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Lukeš |first1=Julius |last2=Archibald |first2=John M. |last3=Keeling |first3=Patrick J. |last4=Doolittle |first4=W.

In other instances constructive neutral evolution does not promote the creation of new parts, but rather promotes novel interactions between existing players, which then take on new moonlighting roles.<ref name=\"LukešArchibald2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Lukeš |first1=Julius |last2=Archibald |first2=John M. |last3=Keeling |first3=Patrick J. |last4=Doolittle |first4=W.

Constructive neutral evolution has also been used to explain how ancient complexes, such as the spliceosome and the ribosome, have gained new subunits over time, how new alternative spliced isoforms of genes arise, how [[Ciliate#DNA_rearrangements_(gene_scrambling)|gene scrambling]] in [[ciliates]] evolved, and how pervasive pan-[[RNA editing]] may have arisen in ''[[Trypanosoma brucei]]''.<ref name=\"Stoltzfus1999\"/><ref name=\"GrayLukes2010\">{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=M.

==History==
{{further|Orthogenesis}}

In the 19th century, some scientists such as [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829) and [[Ray Lankester]] (1847–1929) believed that nature had an innate striving to become more complex with evolution. This belief may reflect then-current ideas of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) and of [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903) which envisaged the universe gradually evolving to a higher, more perfect state.

This view regarded the evolution of parasites from independent organisms to a parasitic species as \"[[Devolution (biology)|devolution]]\" or \"degeneration\", and contrary to nature. Social theorists have sometimes interpreted this approach metaphorically to decry certain categories of people as \"degenerate parasites\". Later scientists regarded biological devolution as nonsense; rather, lineages become simpler or more complicated according to whatever forms had a selective advantage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dougherty, Michael J. | title=Is the human race evolving or devolving? | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-the-human-race-evolvin/ | journal=Scientific American |date=July 1998 | quote=From a biological perspective, there is no such thing as devolution. All changes in the gene frequencies of populations--and quite often in the traits those genes influence--are by definition evolutionary changes. [...] When species do evolve, it is not out of need but rather because their populations contain organisms with variants of traits that offer a reproductive advantage in a changing environment.}}</ref>

'''Lipton''' is a British [[brand]] of [[tea]], owned by [[Unilever]]. Lipton was also a [[supermarket chain]] in the [[United Kingdom]] before it was sold to [[Argyll Foods]], to allow the company to focus solely on tea. The company is named after its founder [[Thomas Lipton]]. The Lipton ready-to-drink beverages are sold by Pepsi Lipton International, a company jointly owned by Unilever and [[PepsiCo]].

In 1871 [[Thomas Lipton]] (1848–1931) of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] used his small savings to open his own shop, and by the 1880s the business had grown to more than 200 shops.<ref name=\"fundinguniverse1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Thomas-J-Lipton-Company-Company-History.html |title=History of Thomas J.

The group traded in the [[high street]] under various names, but was registered on the UK stock market as Allied Suppliers.<ref>Allied Stores was originally formed in 1929 to act as the group's purchasing arm.</ref>  Lipton's became a supermarket chain focused on small towns, before Allied's acquisition by [[Argyll Foods]] in 1982.

===Tea===

<!-- Not then a Knight Commander (1901) or baronet (1902). -->[[Thomas Lipton]] began travelling the world for new items to stock in this store. One such item was tea, since sales had doubled from £40 million in the late 1870s to £80 million by the mid-1880s. He believed the price was far too high, so in 1890 he purchased his own tea gardens in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, where he packaged and sold the first Lipton tea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liptontea.com/article/detail/157721/lipton-history |title=From the tea garden to the tea pot: Sir Thomas Lipton's Vision |publisher=Lipton Tea |access-date=29 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029183508/http://www.liptontea.com/article/detail/157721/lipton-history |archivedate=29 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Staying true to this vision, he arranged packaging and shipping at low costs and sold his tea in packets by the pound (454g), half pound (227g), and quarter pound (113g), with the advertising slogan: \"Direct from the tea gardens to the teapot.\" Lipton teas were an immediate success in the United States.<ref name=\"fundinguniverse1\"/>

The Lipton tea business was acquired by consumer goods company Unilever in a number of separate transactions, starting with the purchase of the United States and Canadian Lipton business in 1938 and completed in 1972 when Unilever bought the remainder of the global Lipton business from [[Home and Colonial Stores|Allied Suppliers]].

In 1991, Unilever created a first [[joint venture]] with PepsiCo, the Pepsi Lipton Partnership, for the marketing of [[ready to drink]] (bottled and canned) teas in North America. This was followed in 2003 by a second joint venture, Pepsi-Lipton International (PLI), covering many non-United States markets. PLI was expanded in September 2007 to include a number of large European markets. PepsiCo and Unilever each control 50 per cent of the shares of these joint ventures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.just-drinks.com/article.aspx?id=91542 |title=PepsiCo and Unilever extend partnership |publisher=Just-drinks.com |access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref>

Due to the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]], food giant [[Unilever]] started recalling its Lipton milk tea powder in Hong Kong and Macau on 30 September 2008.

In 2011 [[PETA]] criticized Unilever for conducting and funding experiments on rabbits, pigs and other animals in an attempt to make human health claims about the tea’s ingredients. According to the animal rights organization, Unilever decided to end the practice of Lipton products after receiving more than 40,000 appeals from PETA supporters and days before PETA made plans to launch its \"Lipton CruelTEA\" campaign.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zelman |first1=Joanna |title=Unilever Ends Animal Testing On Lipton Tea Products After PETA Threatens Major Campaign |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/03/unilever-ends-animal-test_n_818225.html |access-date=10 February 2015 |work=Huffington Post |date=2 February 2011}}</ref> Unilever no longer tests their products on animals unless required to by governments as part of their regulatory requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/what-matters-to-you/developing-alternative-approaches-to-animal-testing.html |title=Developing alternative approaches to animal testing |publisher=Unilever |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>

Lipton's main pillar brands are Lipton Yellow Label and Lipton Iced Tea. Other product lines exist as well, like the Lipton pyramid ([[tetrahedron]]) range in Europe and North America, and Lipton Milk Tea in East Asia. In 2008, the brand launched Lipton Linea in Western Europe.

===Lipton Yellow Label===
Lipton Yellow Label has been sold since 1890, when Sir [[Thomas Lipton]] created the first version of the Yellow pack with a red Lipton shield, which to this day typifies the Lipton Yellow Label brand. It is sold in 150 countries worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lipton.com/en_en/#Lipton%20history-0,68|title=Lipton Tea|publisher=Lipton Tea|accessdate=29 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920021708/http://www.lipton.com/en_en/#Lipton%20history-0,68|archivedate=20 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Lipton Yellow Label is a [[Tea blending and additives|blend]] of several types of tea.

Lipton Yellow Label blend is available both in tea bags, the preferred format in Western Europe, North America and Australia, as well as loose packaged tea, the preferred format in much of the Middle East and throughout Asia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Lipton Yellow Label loose packed tea is rolled into small balls like [[Gunpowder tea|gunpowder green tea]].

===Lipton Iced Tea===
'''Lipton Iced Tea''', in many markets known as '''Lipton Ice Tea''',<ref>{{cite web|title=Lipton Ice Tea website|url=http://www.liptonicetea.com/}}</ref> is an [[iced tea]] brand sold by Lipton. It comes in four flavours.

===Lipton Brisk===
[[Brisk (beverage)|Brisk]], formerly Lipton Brisk, is an iced tea brand distributed primarily in North America as a [[joint venture]] between Lipton and PepsiCo. It differs from Lipton's other iced tea brands in that [[phosphoric acid]] is added to the blend, giving the beverage a distinctive tart flavor.

===Lipton Pyramid Tea===
Lipton also produces tea using the [[tetrahedral]] bag format as seen in other tea brands.

Lipton Clear was also launched in five variants&nbsp;– [[Earl Grey tea|Earl Grey Tea]], [[English breakfast tea|English Breakfast Tea]], Peach Mango Tea, [[Green tea|Green Tea]] Mandarin Orange, [[Mentha|Mint]] and [[Chamomile|Camomile]] Tea.

===Pure Leaf===
Pure Leaf is an iced tea brand distributed primarily in North America by the PepsiCo-Lipton joint venture. As opposed to Lipton Iced Tea and Brisk, both of which use a freeze-dried instant tea powder for a base, Pure Leaf is brewed in liquid.

==Lipton worldwide==
Available in over 110 countries, Lipton is particularly popular in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], parts of [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]] ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) as well as [[Latin America]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Despite its British origins, Lipton black tea (such as Yellow Label) is not marketed in the UK and is not found in mainstream British stores, because Unilever sells [[PG Tips]] in the UK. However, Lipton Ice Tea and fruit teas are available in the UK.

==Marketing and advertising==

In 1914, Lipton's tea were one of the sponsors for the first flight from Melbourne to Sydney by French aviator [[Maurice Guillaux]]. This was, at the time, the longest air mail and air freight flight in the world. Guillaux wrote, \"I found it the most delicious tea I have ever tasted....I found it very soothing to the nerves.\" Lipton printed 250,000 copies of the letter, and these could be had by sending to Lipton a one-penny stamp. For a threepenny stamp, Lipton would send out a quarter-pound pack of tea.<ref>''Sydney Morning Herald'', Saturday 25 July 1914.</ref>

In an attempt to change the negative perception of Lipton Ice Tea in the United Kingdom&nbsp;– as 60% claimed they do not like the taste before even trying it&nbsp;– Lipton underwent a [[London]]-based summer experiential marketing campaign in 2010 under the slogan \"Don't knock it 'til you’ve tried it!\".<ref name=\"Lipton launch campaign\">{{cite web |url=http://www.promomarketing.info/experiential/sampling/lipton-launch-dont-knock-it-until-youve-tried-it-c/3773 |title=Lipton launch lipton are haram 'Don't Knock it Until You've Tried It' Campaign |publisher=Promotional Marketing |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622195558/http://www.promomarketing.info/experiential/sampling/lipton-launch-dont-knock-it-until-youve-tried-it-c/3773 |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Roaming demonstrators handed out 498,968 samples over the 58-day run.  After the campaign, 87% of consumers claimed to enjoy Lipton Ice Tea, while 73% said they were more likely to purchase in the future.<ref name=\"Lipton Experiential Campaign\">{{cite web |url=http://www.idagency.com/work/product-sampling/lipton-ice-tea/#content |title= Lipton Experiential Marketing Results|publisher=iD Experiential}}</ref> Lipton also made commercials starring [[The Muppets]] for the 2014 [[Disney]] film ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}

==Product quality controversy==
In November 2011, the [[General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine]] of [[China]] found high levels of pesticides such as [[bifenthrin]] in one variety of Lipton tea. Unilever responded by clearing the shelves of all affected products.<ref name=Greenpeace>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-unilever-china-qualitybre83n0at-20120424,0,731198.story |title=Greenpeace says finds tainted Lipton tea bags in China |first=Ben |last=Blanchard |work=Chicago Tribune |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426125723/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-unilever-china-qualitybre83n0at-20120424%2C0%2C731198.story |archivedate=26 April 2012 }}</ref> In April 2012, the non-governmental organization [[Greenpeace]] raised questions about Lipton products once again, after two varieties of Lipton tea the group purchased in Beijing supermarkets failed safety tests, with the results allegedly failing to meet regulations as those enforced in the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"greenpeace1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/blog/lipton-tea-laced-with-toxic-pesticide-residue/blog/40093/|title=Lipton tea laced with toxic pesticide residue|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> Additionally, the group stated, \"Some of the detected pesticides are also banned for use in tea production by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.\" <ref name=\"greenpeace1\"/> Unilever China denied the findings, stating all Lipton products within the country were safe.<ref name=Greenpeace />

'''Lipton''' is a British [[brand]] of [[tea]], owned by [[Unilever]]. Lipton was also a [[supermarket chain]] in the [[United Kingdom]] before it was sold to [[Argyll Foods]], to allow the company to focus solely on tea. The company is named after its founder [[Thomas Lipton]]. The Lipton ready-to-drink beverages are sold by Pepsi Lipton International, a company jointly owned by Unilever and [[PepsiCo]]

[[File:Allied.GIF|thumb|right|The old Liptons, [[Galbraith supermarkets|Galbraith]], [[R & J Templeton|Templeton]] and [[Presto (UK supermarket)|Presto]] logos]]
In 1871 [[Thomas Lipton]] (1848–1931) of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] used his small savings to open his own shop, and by the 1880s the business had grown to more than 200 shops.<ref name=\"fundinguniverse1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Thomas-J-Lipton-Company-Company-History.html |title=History of Thomas J. Lipton Company |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=22 October 2012}}</ref> In 1929, the Lipton grocery retail business was one of the companies that merged with Home and Colonial Stores, Maypole Dairy Company, Vyes & Boroughs, Templetons, Galbraiths & Pearks to form a food group with more than 3,000 stores. The group traded in the [[high street]] under various names, but was registered on the UK stock market as Allied Suppliers.<ref>Allied Stores was originally formed in 1929 to act as the group's purchasing arm.</ref>  Lipton's became a supermarket chain focused on small towns, before Allied's acquisition by [[Argyll Foods]] in 1982. The supermarket business was rebranded as [[Presto (UK supermarket)|Presto]] during the 1980s.

===Tea===

<!-- Not then a Knight Commander (1901) or baronet (1902). -->[[Thomas Lipton]] began travelling the world for new items to stock in this store. One such item was tea, since sales had doubled from £40 million in the late 1870s to £80 million by the mid-1880s. He believed the price was far too high, so in 1890 he purchased his own tea gardens in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, where he packaged and sold the first Lipton tea.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liptontea.com/article/detail/157721/lipton-history |title=From the tea garden to the tea pot: Sir Thomas Lipton's Vision |publisher=Lipton Tea |access-date=29 October 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029183508/http://www.liptontea.com/article/detail/157721/lipton-history |archivedate=29 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Staying true to this vision, he arranged packaging and shipping at low costs and sold his tea in packets by the pound (454g), half pound (227g), and quarter pound (113g), with the advertising slogan: \"Direct from the tea gardens to the teapot.\" Lipton teas were an immediate success in the United States.<ref name=\"fundinguniverse1\"/>

The Lipton tea business was acquired by consumer goods company Unilever in a number of separate transactions, starting with the purchase of the United States and Canadian Lipton business in 1938 and completed in 1972 when Unilever bought the remainder of the global Lipton business from [[Home and Colonial Stores|Allied Suppliers]].

In 1991, Unilever created a first [[joint venture]] with PepsiCo, the Pepsi Lipton Partnership, for the marketing of [[ready to drink]] (bottled and canned) teas in North America. This was followed in 2003 by a second joint venture, Pepsi-Lipton International (PLI), covering many non-United States markets. PLI was expanded in September 2007 to include a number of large European markets. PepsiCo and Unilever each control 50 per cent of the shares of these joint ventures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.just-drinks.com/article.aspx?id=91542 |title=PepsiCo and Unilever extend partnership |publisher=Just-drinks.com |access-date=29 October 2014}}</ref>

Due to the [[2008 Chinese milk scandal]], food giant [[Unilever]] started recalling its Lipton milk tea powder in Hong Kong and Macau on 30 September 2008. The tea powder, which used Chinese milk powder as its raw ingredient, was recalled after the company's internal checks found traces of [[melamine]] in the powder.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080930/ap_on_re_as/as_hong_kong_tainted_milk |title=Lipton-brand milk tea powder recalled in Asia |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Yahoo!

In 2011 [[PETA]] criticized Unilever for conducting and funding experiments on rabbits, pigs and other animals in an attempt to make human health claims about the tea’s ingredients. According to the animal rights organization, Unilever decided to end the practice of Lipton products after receiving more than 40,000 appeals from PETA supporters and days before PETA made plans to launch its \"Lipton CruelTEA\" campaign.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zelman |first1=Joanna |title=Unilever Ends Animal Testing On Lipton Tea Products After PETA Threatens Major Campaign |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/02/03/unilever-ends-animal-test_n_818225.html |access-date=10 February 2015 |work=Huffington Post |date=2 February 2011}}</ref> Unilever no longer tests their products on animals unless required to by governments as part of their regulatory requirements.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/what-matters-to-you/developing-alternative-approaches-to-animal-testing.html |title=Developing alternative approaches to animal testing |publisher=Unilever |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>

It differs from Lipton's other iced tea brands in that [[phosphoric acid]] is added to the blend, giving the beverage a distinctive tart flavor.

===Lipton Pyramid Tea===
Lipton also produces tea using the [[tetrahedral]] bag format as seen in other tea brands.

Lipton Clear was also launched in five variants&nbsp;– [[Earl Grey tea|Earl Grey Tea]], [[English breakfast tea|English Breakfast Tea]], Peach Mango Tea, [[Green tea|Green Tea]] Mandarin Orange, [[Mentha|Mint]] and [[Chamomile|Camomile]] Tea.

===Pure Leaf===
Pure Leaf is an iced tea brand distributed primarily in North America by the PepsiCo-Lipton joint venture. As opposed to Lipton Iced Tea and Brisk, both of which use a freeze-dried instant tea powder for a base, Pure Leaf is brewed in liquid.

==Lipton worldwide==
Available in over 110 countries, Lipton is particularly popular in [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]], parts of [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]] ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) as well as [[Latin America]], and the [[Caribbean]]. Despite its British origins, Lipton black tea (such as Yellow Label) is not marketed in the UK and is not found in mainstream British stores, because Unilever sells [[PG Tips]] in the UK. However, Lipton Ice Tea and fruit teas are available in the UK.

==Marketing and advertising==

In 1914, Lipton's tea were one of the sponsors for the first flight from Melbourne to Sydney by French aviator [[Maurice Guillaux]]. This was, at the time, the longest air mail and air freight flight in the world. Guillaux wrote, \"I found it the most delicious tea I have ever tasted....I found it very soothing to the nerves.\" Lipton printed 250,000 copies of the letter, and these could be had by sending to Lipton a one-penny stamp. For a threepenny stamp, Lipton would send out a quarter-pound pack of tea.<ref>''Sydney Morning Herald'', Saturday 25 July 1914.</ref>

In an attempt to change the negative perception of Lipton Ice Tea in the United Kingdom&nbsp;– as 60% claimed they do not like the taste before even trying it&nbsp;– Lipton underwent a [[London]]-based summer experiential marketing campaign in 2010 under the slogan \"Don't knock it 'til you’ve tried it!\".<ref name=\"Lipton launch campaign\">{{cite web |url=http://www.promomarketing.info/experiential/sampling/lipton-launch-dont-knock-it-until-youve-tried-it-c/3773 |title=Lipton launch lipton are haram 'Don't Knock it Until You've Tried It' Campaign |publisher=Promotional Marketing |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622195558/http://www.promomarketing.info/experiential/sampling/lipton-launch-dont-knock-it-until-youve-tried-it-c/3773 |archivedate=22 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Roaming demonstrators handed out 498,968 samples over the 58-day run.  After the campaign, 87% of consumers claimed to enjoy Lipton Ice Tea, while 73% said they were more likely to purchase in the future.<ref name=\"Lipton Experiential Campaign\">{{cite web |url=http://www.idagency.com/work/product-sampling/lipton-ice-tea/#content |title= Lipton Experiential Marketing Results|publisher=iD Experiential}}</ref> Lipton also made commercials starring [[The Muppets]] for the 2014 [[Disney]] film ''[[Muppets Most Wanted]]''.{{clarify|date=July 2018}}

==Product quality controversy==
In November 2011, the [[General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine]] of [[China]] found high levels of pesticides such as [[bifenthrin]] in one variety of Lipton tea. Unilever responded by clearing the shelves of all affected products.<ref name=Greenpeace>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-unilever-china-qualitybre83n0at-20120424,0,731198.story |title=Greenpeace says finds tainted Lipton tea bags in China |first=Ben |last=Blanchard |work=Chicago Tribune |date=24 April 2012 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426125723/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-rt-us-unilever-china-qualitybre83n0at-20120424%2C0%2C731198.story |archivedate=26 April 2012 }}</ref> In April 2012, the non-governmental organization [[Greenpeace]] raised questions about Lipton products once again, after two varieties of Lipton tea the group purchased in Beijing supermarkets failed safety tests, with the results allegedly failing to meet regulations as those enforced in the [[European Union]].<ref name=\"greenpeace1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/news/blog/lipton-tea-laced-with-toxic-pesticide-residue/blog/40093/|title=Lipton tea laced with toxic pesticide residue|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=29 October 2014}}</ref> Additionally, the group stated, \"Some of the detected pesticides are also banned for use in tea production by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture.\" <ref name=\"greenpeace1\"/> Unilever China denied the findings, stating all Lipton products within the country were safe.<ref name=Greenpeace />

==Controversy==
In June 2017, Nav had received backlash from some members of his musical audience for continuously using the n-word in his songs such as on \"My Mind\", \"TTD\", and other songs. In an interview with Genius, Nav stated that the neighborhood he grew up in of Rexdale is very \"multicultural\" with members of the \"Chinese to white to black to Jamaican\" openly using the term with one another. He stated that it was commonly used among his friends, but once he had gotten global exposure, Nav said he started seeing some backlash. In this interview, Nav had stated that he'd no longer use this term in his music anymore, and that people wouldn't hear it on his then-upcoming collaboration project with [[Metro Boomin]], ''[[Perfect Timing (mixtape)|Perfect Timing]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://genius.com/a/nav-says-he-s-done-using-the-n-word-in-his-music |title=NAV Says He's Done Using the N-Word in His Music |access-date=2019-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524235713/https://genius.com/a/nav-says-he-s-done-using-the-n-word-in-his-music |archive-date=2019-05-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2018, Nav had publicly criticized [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] through a series of tweets and Instagram posts along with releasing the single, \"Freshman List\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/nav-debuts-freshman-list-single-ahead-of-tour-new-song.1977774.html | title=Nav Debuts \"Freshman List\" Single Ahead of Tour}}</ref> His main reason for criticizing the magazine was due to not being selected for the 2018 freshman cover. In his tweets, Nav shared his thoughts that had ranged \"from angry and bitter to motivational and inspirational\". After his tweets and release of the single, Nav decided to step it up a notch by sending shots at the outlet's editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten through now deleted Instagram posts and further continued to diss the outlet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://hiphopwired.com/747419/nav-blasts-xxls-editor-in-chief-says-freshmen-list-website-is-trash/ | title=Nav Blasts XXL's Editor-In-Chief, Says Freshmen List & Website is Trash| date=2018-03-20}}</ref>

In June 2018, Nav and Lil Uzi Vert were accused by Kid Buu of stealing his flow for their hit single, \"Wanted You\" which had charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, he was confronted a few months later by Cash, Nav's manager, and admitted that he was lying in an attempt to stir up controversy and gain attention.

In August 2018, Nav featured on Travis Scott's third studio album, ''[[Astroworld (album)|Astroworld]]'', on the song \"[[Yosemite (song)|Yosemite]]\" alongside fellow rapper [[Gunna (rapper)|Gunna]]. He was the subject of many [[Internet meme|memes]] mocking his feature, as the ending of the song, which Nav's four vocals lines were recorded, was initially mixed at a very low volume. Nav himself shared a meme on his Instagram, laughing at the error. Scott and producer [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] later confirmed this was an error, and re-mixed and re-released the track on streaming services with the updated vocal mix a week after the release of the song and album.

In March 2019 during an interview with Pitchfork, Nav expressed his frustration stating that \"Fame is something I want, it's a good problem to have. I'm still not there, because when I walk out of fucking Delilah in L.A. and [[TMZ]] will be standing out there with cameras and not even take a picture of me, I get sick.

==Controversy==
In June 2017, Nav had received backlash from some members of his musical audience for continuously using the n-word in his songs such as on \"My Mind\", \"TTD\", and other songs. In an interview with Genius, Nav stated that the neighborhood he grew up in of Rexdale is very \"multicultural\" with members of the \"Chinese to white to black to Jamaican\" openly using the term with one another. He stated that it was commonly used among his friends, but once he had gotten global exposure, Nav said he started seeing some backlash. In this interview, Nav had stated that he'd no longer use this term in his music anymore, and that people wouldn't hear it on his then-upcoming collaboration project with [[Metro Boomin]], ''[[Perfect Timing (mixtape)|Perfect Timing]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://genius.com/a/nav-says-he-s-done-using-the-n-word-in-his-music |title=NAV Says He's Done Using the N-Word in His Music |access-date=2019-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524235713/https://genius.com/a/nav-says-he-s-done-using-the-n-word-in-his-music |archive-date=2019-05-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2018, Nav had publicly criticized [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] through a series of tweets and Instagram posts along with releasing the single, \"Freshman List\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/nav-debuts-freshman-list-single-ahead-of-tour-new-song.1977774.html | title=Nav Debuts \"Freshman List\" Single Ahead of Tour}}</ref> His main reason for criticizing the magazine was due to not being selected for the 2018 freshman cover. In his tweets, Nav shared his thoughts that had ranged \"from angry and bitter to motivational and inspirational\". After his tweets and release of the single, Nav decided to step it up a notch by sending shots at the outlet's editor-in-chief Vanessa Satten through now deleted Instagram posts and further continued to diss the outlet.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://hiphopwired.com/747419/nav-blasts-xxls-editor-in-chief-says-freshmen-list-website-is-trash/ | title=Nav Blasts XXL's Editor-In-Chief, Says Freshmen List & Website is Trash| date=2018-03-20}}</ref>

In June 2018, Nav and Lil Uzi Vert were accused by Kid Buu of stealing his flow for their hit single, \"Wanted You\" which had charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, he was confronted a few months later by Cash, Nav's manager, and admitted that he was lying in an attempt to stir up controversy and gain attention.

In August 2018, Nav featured on Travis Scott's third studio album, ''[[Astroworld (album)|Astroworld]]'', on the song \"[[Yosemite (song)|Yosemite]]\" alongside fellow rapper [[Gunna (rapper)|Gunna]]. He was the subject of many [[Internet meme|memes]] mocking his feature, as the ending of the song, which Nav's four vocals lines were recorded, was initially mixed at a very low volume. Nav himself shared a meme on his Instagram, laughing at the error. Scott and producer [[Mike Dean (record producer)|Mike Dean]] later confirmed this was an error, and re-mixed and re-released the track on streaming services with the updated vocal mix a week after the release of the song and album.

In March 2019 during an interview with Pitchfork, Nav expressed his frustration stating that \"Fame is something I want, it's a good problem to have. I'm still not there, because when I walk out of fucking Delilah in L.A. and [[TMZ]] will be standing out there with cameras and not even take a picture of me, I get sick. I get in my fucking Lambo truck right in front of them. All my jewelry on and they don't even take one picture.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/levels/lunch-with-nav/ |title=Lunch with Nav |access-date=2019-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503070839/https://pitchfork.com/levels/lunch-with-nav/ |archive-date=2019-05-03 |url-status=live }}</ref> Nav further stated in the [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] interview that he hoped his latest project, ''[[Bad Habits (Nav album)|Bad Habits]]'' would help him become more noticed by TMZ along with other paparazzi. A week later, TMZ found Nav in New York and did a brief video interview with him, asking him questions about a possible collaboration project with [[Lil Uzi Vert]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tmz.com/videos/1_6al6q8fw/ |title=Canadian Rapper Nav on TMZ is Finally a Thing |access-date=2019-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401072001/https://www.tmz.com/videos/1_6al6q8fw/ |archive-date=2019-04-01 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Place of articulation}}
{{IPA notice}}
In [[articulatory phonetics]], a '''consonant''' is a [[speech sound]] that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the [[vocal tract]]. Examples are {{IPA|[p]}}, pronounced with the lips; {{IPA|[t]}}, pronounced with the front of the tongue; {{IPA|[k]}}, pronounced with the back of the tongue; {{IPA|[h]}}, pronounced in the throat; {{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|[s]}}, pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel ([[fricative]]s); and {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}, which have air flowing through the nose ([[nasal consonant|nasal]]s). Contrasting with consonants are [[vowel]]s.

Since the number of possible sounds in all of the world's languages is much greater than the number of letters in any one [[alphabet]], [[Linguistics|linguists]] have devised systems such as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) to assign a unique and unambiguous [[symbol]] to each attested consonant. In fact, the [[English alphabet]] has fewer consonant letters than English has consonant sounds, so [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s like \"ch\", \"sh\", \"th\", and \"zh\" are used to extend the alphabet, and some letters and digraphs represent more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled \"th\" in \"this\" is a different consonant from the \"th\" sound in \"thin\". (In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], they are transcribed {{IPA|[ð]}} and {{IPA|[θ]}}, respectively.)

==Etymology==
The word ''consonant'' comes from [[Latin]] oblique stem ''cōnsonant-,'' from ''cōnsonāns (littera)'' \"sounding-together (letter)\", a [[calque]] of Greek σύμφωνον ''sýmphōnon'' (plural ''sýmphōna'').<ref>{{LSJ|su/mfwnos|σύμφωνος|ref}}</ref><ref>Robert K. Barnhart, ''ed.'', ''Chambers Dictionary of Etymology'', Previously published as ''The Barnhart Dictionary of Etymology'', originally ©1988 The H.W. Wilson Company; Edinburgh, reprinted 2001: Chambers Harrap Publishers Ltd., p. 210.</ref>

[[Dionysius Thrax]] calls consonants ''sýmphōna'' \"pronounced with\" because they can only be pronounced with a vowel.{{efn|Dionysius Thrax:

:The remaining seventeen are consonants: b, g, d, z, th, k, l, m, n, x, p, r, s, t, ph, ch, ps. They are called consonants because they do not have a sound on their own, but, when arranged with vowels, they produce a sound.<ref name=\"Thrax\">[[Dionysius Thrax]]. τέχνη γραμματική (Art of Grammar), [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante02/DionysiosThrax/dio_tech.html#06 ς´ περὶ στοιχείου (6.

:Of these, eight are semivowels [half-pronounced]: z, x, ps, l, m, n, r, s. They are called semivowels, because, though a little weaker than the vowels, they are still harmonious [well-sounding] in their moaning and hissing.<ref name=\"Thrax\"/>}} and ''áphōna'', mute or silent consonants (\"unvoiced\"),<ref>{{LSJ|a)/fwnos|ἄφωνος|shortref}}</ref> which correspond to [[stop consonant|stop]]s, not [[voicelessness|voiceless]] consonants.{{efn|Dionysius Thrax:
:{{lang|grc|ἄφωνα δέ ἐστιν ἐννέα· β γ δ κ π τ θ φ χ. ἄφωνα δὲ λέγεται, ὅτι μᾶλλον τῶν ἄλλων ἐστὶν κακόφωνα, ὥσπερ ἄφωνον λέγομεν τὸν τραγωιδὸν τὸν κακόφωνον.}}
:Nine are silent [unpronounced]: b, g, d, k, p, t, th, ph, ch. They are called silent, because, more than the others, they are discordant [ill-sounding], just as we call the ill-sounding tragedy \"silent\".<ref name=\"Thrax\"/>}}

This description does not apply to some [[Natural language|human languages]], such as the [[Salishan languages]], in which stops sometimes occur without vowels (see [[Nuxálk language|Nuxálk]]), and the modern conception of consonant does not require co-occurrence with vowels.

==Letters==
The word '''consonant''' is also used to refer to a [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] of an [[alphabet]] that denotes a consonant sound. The 21 consonant letters in the English alphabet are [[B]], [[C]], [[D]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[M]], [[N]], [[P]], [[Q]], [[R]], [[S]], [[T]], [[V]], [[X]], [[Z]], and usually [[W]] and [[Y]]. The letter Y stands for the consonant {{IPA|/j/}} in ''yoke'', the vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} in ''myth'', the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} in ''funny'', and the diphthong {{IPA|/aɪ/}} in ''my''. W always represents a consonant except in combination with a vowel letter, as in ''growth'', ''raw'', and ''how'', and in a few [[loanword]]s from [[Welsh language|Welsh]], like ''crwth'' or ''cwm''.

In some other languages, such as Finnish, ''y'' only represents a vowel sound.

The consonant and the alphabet r not quite the same. This is because people say that y can be a vowel when it’s a constant.

==Consonants versus vowels==
Consonants and vowels correspond to distinct parts of a [[syllable]]: The most sonorous part of the syllable (that is, the part that's easiest to sing), called the ''syllabic peak'' or ''[[syllable nucleus|nucleus]],'' is typically a vowel, while the less sonorous margins (called the ''[[syllable onset|onset]]'' and ''[[syllable coda|coda]]'') are typically consonants. Such syllables may be abbreviated CV, V, and CVC, where C stands for consonant and V stands for vowel. This can be argued to be the only pattern found in most of the world's languages, and perhaps the primary pattern in all of them. However, the distinction between consonant and vowel is not always clear cut: there are syllabic consonants and non-syllabic vowels in many of the world's languages.

One blurry area is in segments variously called ''[[semivowel]]s'', ''semiconsonants'', or ''glides''. On one side, there are vowel-like segments that are not in themselves syllabic, but form [[diphthong]]s as part of the syllable nucleus, as the ''i'' in English ''boil'' {{IPA|[ˈbɔɪ̯l]}}. On the other, there are [[approximant]]s that behave like consonants in forming onsets, but are articulated very much like vowels, as the ''y'' in English ''yes'' {{IPA|[ˈjɛs]}}. Some phonologists model these as both being the underlying vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, so that the English word ''bit'' would [[phoneme|phonemically]] be {{IPA|/bit/}}, ''beet'' would be {{IPA|/bii̯t/}}, and ''yield'' would be phonemically {{IPA|/i̯ii̯ld/}}. Likewise, ''foot'' would be {{IPA|/fut/}}, ''food'' would be {{IPA|/fuu̯d/}}, ''wood'' would be {{IPA|/u̯ud/}}, and ''wooed'' would be {{IPA|/u̯uu̯d/}}. However, there is a (perhaps allophonic) difference in articulation between these segments, with the {{IPA|[j]}} in {{IPA|[ˈjɛs]}} ''yes'' and {{IPA|[ˈjiʲld]}} ''yield'' and the {{IPA|[w]}} of {{IPA|[ˈwuʷd]}} ''wooed'' having more constriction and a more definite place of articulation than the {{IPA|[ɪ]}} in {{IPA|[ˈbɔɪ̯l]}} ''boil'' or {{IPA|[ˈbɪt]}} ''bit'' or the {{IPA|[ʊ]}} of {{IPA|[ˈfʊt]}} ''foot''.

The other problematic area is that of syllabic consonants, segments articulated as consonants but occupying the nucleus of a syllable. This may be the case for words such as ''church'' in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] dialects of English, although phoneticians differ in whether they consider this to be a syllabic consonant, {{IPA|/ˈtʃɹ̩tʃ/}}, or a rhotic vowel, {{IPA|/ˈtʃɝtʃ/}}: Some distinguish an approximant {{IPA|/ɹ/}} that corresponds to a vowel {{IPA|/ɝ/}}, for ''rural'' as {{IPA|/ˈɹɝl/}} or {{IPA|[ˈɹʷɝːl̩]}}; others see these as a single phoneme, {{IPA|/ˈɹɹ̩l/}}.

Other languages use fricative and often trilled segments as syllabic nuclei, as in [[Czech language|Czech]] and several languages in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[China]], including [[Mandarin Chinese]]. In Mandarin, they are historically allophones of {{IPA|/i/}}, and spelled that way in [[Pinyin]]. Ladefoged and Maddieson<ref name=SOWL>{{SOWL}}</ref>{{page missing|date=August 2018}} call these \"fricative vowels\" and say that \"they can usually be thought of as syllabic fricatives that are allophones of vowels\". That is, phonetically they are consonants, but phonemically they behave as vowels.

Many [[Slavic languages]] allow the trill {{IPA|[r̩]}} and the lateral {{IPA|[l̩]}} as syllabic nuclei (see [[Words without vowels]]). In languages like [[Nuxálk language|Nuxalk]], it is difficult to know what the nucleus of a syllable is, or if all syllables even have nuclei. If the concept of 'syllable' applies in Nuxalk, there are syllabic consonants in words like {{IPA|/sx̩s/}} ({{IPA|/s̩xs̩/}}?) 'seal fat'. [[Miyako language|Miyako]] in Japan is similar, with {{IPA|/f̩ks̩/}} 'to build' and {{IPA|/ps̩ks̩/}} 'to pull'.

==Features==
{{Unreferenced section|date = August 2013}}{{Manner of articulation}}
Each spoken consonant can be distinguished by several phonetic ''[[Distinctive feature|features]]'':
* The [[manner of articulation]] is how air escapes from the vocal tract when the consonant or [[approximant]] (vowel-like) sound is made. Manners include stops, fricatives, and nasals.
* The [[place of articulation]] is where in the vocal tract the obstruction of the consonant occurs, and which speech organs are involved. Places include [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] (both lips), [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (tongue against the gum ridge), and [[velar consonant|velar]] (tongue against soft palate). In addition, there may be a simultaneous narrowing at another place of articulation, such as [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] or [[pharyngealisation]]. Consonants with two simultaneous places of articulation are said to be [[Co-articulated consonant| coarticulated]].
* The [[phonation]] of a consonant is how the [[vocal cords]] vibrate during the articulation. When the vocal cords vibrate fully, the consonant is called [[voiced]]; when they do not vibrate at all, it is [[voiceless]].
* The [[voice onset time]] (VOT) indicates the timing of the phonation. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] is a feature of VOT. 
* The [[airstream mechanism]] is how the air moving through the vocal tract is powered. Most languages have exclusively [[pulmonic egressive]] consonants, which use the lungs and diaphragm, but [[ejective]]s, [[click consonant|click]]s, and [[implosive]]s use different mechanisms. 
* The [[gemination|length]] is how long the obstruction of a consonant lasts. This feature is borderline distinctive in English, as in \"wholly\" {{IPA|[hoʊlli]}} vs. \"holy\" {{IPA|[hoʊli]}}, but cases are limited to morpheme boundaries. Unrelated roots are differentiated in various languages such as Italian, Japanese, and Finnish, with two length levels, \"single\" and \"[[geminate]]\". [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and some [[Sami languages]] have three phonemic lengths: short, geminate, and long geminate, although the distinction between the geminate and overlong geminate includes suprasegmental features.
* The articulatory force is how much muscular energy is involved. This has been proposed many times, but no distinction relying exclusively on force has ever been demonstrated.

All English consonants can be classified by a combination of these features, such as \"voiceless alveolar stop\" {{IPA|[t]}}. In this case, the airstream mechanism is omitted.

Some pairs of consonants like ''p::b'', ''t::d'' are sometimes called [[fortis and lenis]], but this is a [[phonology|phonological]] rather than phonetic distinction.

Consonants are scheduled by their features in a number of IPA charts:
{{IPA pulmonic consonants}}
{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|notes=no}}
{{IPA co-articulated consonants}}

==Examples==
The recently extinct [[Ubykh language]] had only 2 or 3 vowels but 84 consonants;<ref>Georges Dumézil and Tevfik Esenç, 1975, ''Le verbe oubykh: études descriptives et comparatives''. Adrien Maisonneuve: Paris.</ref> the [[Taa language]] has 87 consonants under [[consonant cluster|one analysis]], 164 under [[linguo-pulmonic|another]], plus some 30 vowels and tone.<ref>Naumann, Christfied (2008). \"The Consonantal System of West !Xoon\". ''3rd International Symposium on Khoisan Languages and Linguistics''. Riezlern.</ref> The types of consonants used in various languages are by no means universal. For instance, nearly all [[Australian languages]] lack fricatives; a large percentage of the world's languages lack voiced stops as phonemes, such as {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}. Most languages, however, do include one or more fricatives, with {{IPA|[s]}} being the most common, and a [[liquid consonant]] or two, with {{IPA|[l]}} the most common. The approximant {{IPA|[w]}} is also widespread, and virtually all languages have one or more [[nasal consonant|nasals]], though a very few, such as the Central dialect of [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], lack even these. This last language has the smallest number of consonants in the world, with just six.

===Most common===
The most common consonants around the world are the three voiceless stops {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[k]}}, and the two nasals {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}. However, even these common five are not universal. Several languages in the vicinity of the [[Sahara Desert]], including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], lack {{IPA|[p]}}. Several languages of North America, such as [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], lack both of the labials {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[m]}}. The [[Wichita language]] of [[Oklahoma]] and some West African languages, such as [[Ijo languages|Ijo]], lack the consonant {{IPA|/n/}} on a phonemic level, but do use it as an [[allophone]] of another consonant (of {{IPA|/l/}} in the case of Ijo, and of {{IPA|/ɾ/}} in Wichita). A few languages on [[Bougainville Island]] and around [[Puget Sound]], such as [[Makah language|Makah]], lack both of the nasals {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. The 'click language' [[Nǁng language|Nǁng]] lacks {{IPA|[t]}},{{efn|Nǀu has a {{IPA|[ts]}} instead. [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to lack a {{IPA|[t]}}, but it actually has a consonant that varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}.}} and colloquial [[Samoan language|Samoan]] lacks both alveolars, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}.{{efn|Samoan words written with the letters ''t'' and ''n'' are pronounced with {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} except in formal speech. However, Samoan does have an alveolar consonant, {{IPA|[l]}}.}} Despite the 80-odd consonants of [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]], it lacks the plain velar {{IPA|/k/}} in native words, as do the related [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] and [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] languages. But with a few striking exceptions, such as [[Xavante language|Xavante]] and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]—which have no dorsal consonants whatsoever—nearly all other languages have at least one velar consonant: the few languages that do not have a simple {{IPA|[k]}} usually have a consonant that is very similar.{{efn|The Niʻihau–Kauaʻi dialect of [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to have no {{IPA|[k]}}, but as in other dialects of Hawaiian it has a consonant that varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}, with {{IPA|[t]}} before {{IPA|[i]}} but {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginnings of words, though they are often in [[free variation]].}} For instance, an areal feature of the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast is that historical *{{IPA|[k]}} has become palatalized in many languages, so that [[Saanich language|Saanich]] for example has {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[kʷ]}} but no plain {{IPA|[k]}};<ref>Ian Maddieson and Sandra Ferrari Disner, 1984, ''Patterns of Sounds.'' Cambridge University Press</ref><ref>[http://wals.info/feature/18 The World Atlas of Language Structures Online: Absence of Common Consonants]</ref> similarly, historical *{{IPA|[k]}} in the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] became palatalized to {{IPA|/kʲ/}} in [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} in most [[Circassian languages|Circassian]] dialects.<ref>Viacheslav A.

* The [[manner of articulation]] is how air escapes from the vocal tract when the consonant or [[approximant]] (vowel-like) sound is made. Manners include stops, fricatives, and nasals.
* The [[place of articulation]] is where in the vocal tract the obstruction of the consonant occurs, and which speech organs are involved. Places include [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] (both lips), [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (tongue against the gum ridge), and [[velar consonant|velar]] (tongue against soft palate). In addition, there may be a simultaneous narrowing at another place of articulation, such as [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] or [[pharyngealisation]]. Consonants with two simultaneous places of articulation are said to be [[Co-articulated consonant| coarticulated]].
* The [[phonation]] of a consonant is how the [[vocal cords]] vibrate during the articulation. When the vocal cords vibrate fully, the consonant is called [[voiced]]; when they do not vibrate at all, it is [[voiceless]].
* The [[voice onset time]] (VOT) indicates the timing of the phonation. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] is a feature of VOT. 
* The [[airstream mechanism]] is how the air moving through the vocal tract is powered. Most languages have exclusively [[pulmonic egressive]] consonants, which use the lungs and diaphragm, but [[ejective]]s, [[click consonant|click]]s, and [[implosive]]s use different mechanisms. 
* The [[gemination|length]] is how long the obstruction of a consonant lasts. This feature is borderline distinctive in English, as in \"wholly\" {{IPA|[hoʊlli]}} vs. \"holy\" {{IPA|[hoʊli]}}, but cases are limited to morpheme boundaries. Unrelated roots are differentiated in various languages such as Italian, Japanese, and Finnish, with two length levels, \"single\" and \"[[geminate]]\". [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and some [[Sami languages]] have three phonemic lengths: short, geminate, and long geminate, although the distinction between the geminate and overlong geminate includes suprasegmental features.
* The articulatory force is how much muscular energy is involved. This has been proposed many times, but no distinction relying exclusively on force has ever been demonstrated.

All English consonants can be classified by a combination of these features, such as \"voiceless alveolar stop\" {{IPA|[t]}}. In this case, the airstream mechanism is omitted.

Some pairs of consonants like ''p::b'', ''t::d'' are sometimes called [[fortis and lenis]], but this is a [[phonology|phonological]] rather than phonetic distinction.

Consonants are scheduled by their features in a number of IPA charts:
{{IPA pulmonic consonants}}
{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|notes=no}}
{{IPA co-articulated consonants}}

==Examples==
The recently extinct [[Ubykh language]] had only 2 or 3 vowels but 84 consonants;<ref>Georges Dumézil and Tevfik Esenç, 1975, ''Le verbe oubykh: études descriptives et comparatives''. Adrien Maisonneuve: Paris.</ref> the [[Taa language]] has 87 consonants under [[consonant cluster|one analysis]], 164 under [[linguo-pulmonic|another]], plus some 30 vowels and tone.<ref>Naumann, Christfied (2008). \"The Consonantal System of West !Xoon\". ''3rd International Symposium on Khoisan Languages and Linguistics''. Riezlern.</ref> The types of consonants used in various languages are by no means universal. For instance, nearly all [[Australian languages]] lack fricatives; a large percentage of the world's languages lack voiced stops as phonemes, such as {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}. Most languages, however, do include one or more fricatives, with {{IPA|[s]}} being the most common, and a [[liquid consonant]] or two, with {{IPA|[l]}} the most common. The approximant {{IPA|[w]}} is also widespread, and virtually all languages have one or more [[nasal consonant|nasals]], though a very few, such as the Central dialect of [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], lack even these. This last language has the smallest number of consonants in the world, with just six.

===Most common===
The most common consonants around the world are the three voiceless stops {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[k]}}, and the two nasals {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}. However, even these common five are not universal. Several languages in the vicinity of the [[Sahara Desert]], including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], lack {{IPA|[p]}}. Several languages of North America, such as [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], lack both of the labials {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[m]}}. The [[Wichita language]] of [[Oklahoma]] and some West African languages, such as [[Ijo languages|Ijo]], lack the consonant {{IPA|/n/}} on a phonemic level, but do use it as an [[allophone]] of another consonant (of {{IPA|/l/}} in the case of Ijo, and of {{IPA|/ɾ/}} in Wichita). A few languages on [[Bougainville Island]] and around [[Puget Sound]], such as [[Makah language|Makah]], lack both of the nasals {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. The 'click language' [[Nǁng language|Nǁng]] lacks {{IPA|[t]}},{{efn|Nǀu has a {{IPA|[ts]}} instead. [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to lack a {{IPA|[t]}}, but it actually has a consonant that varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}.}} and colloquial [[Samoan language|Samoan]] lacks both alveolars, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}.{{efn|Samoan words written with the letters ''t'' and ''n'' are pronounced with {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} except in formal speech. However, Samoan does have an alveolar consonant, {{IPA|[l]}}.}} Despite the 80-odd consonants of [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]], it lacks the plain velar {{IPA|/k/}} in native words, as do the related [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] and [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] languages. But with a few striking exceptions, such as [[Xavante language|Xavante]] and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]—which have no dorsal consonants whatsoever—nearly all other languages have at least one velar consonant: the few languages that do not have a simple {{IPA|[k]}} usually have a consonant that is very similar.{{efn|The Niʻihau–Kauaʻi dialect of [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to have no {{IPA|[k]}}, but as in other dialects of Hawaiian it has a consonant that varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}, with {{IPA|[t]}} before {{IPA|[i]}} but {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginnings of words, though they are often in [[free variation]].}} For instance, an areal feature of the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast is that historical *{{IPA|[k]}} has become palatalized in many languages, so that [[Saanich language|Saanich]] for example has {{IPA|[tʃ]}} and {{IPA|[kʷ]}} but no plain {{IPA|[k]}};<ref>Ian Maddieson and Sandra Ferrari Disner, 1984, ''Patterns of Sounds.'' Cambridge University Press</ref><ref>[http://wals.info/feature/18 The World Atlas of Language Structures Online: Absence of Common Consonants]</ref> similarly, historical *{{IPA|[k]}} in the [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] became palatalized to {{IPA|/kʲ/}} in [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} in most [[Circassian languages|Circassian]] dialects.<ref>Viacheslav A. Chirikba, 1996, ''Common West Caucasian: the reconstruction of its phonological system and parts of its lexicon and morphology'', p. 192. Research School CNWS: Leiden.</ref>

The most ''frequent'' consonant (that is, the one appearing most often in speech) in many languages is {{IPA|[p]}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vistawide.com/languages/language_statistics.htm|title=World Language Statistics and Facts|website=www.vistawide.com|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>
