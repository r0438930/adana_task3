In the 2008–09 season, the team was played in the [[Liga 3 (Georgia)|Meore Liga]]. Shiola Shiolashvili led the team to first place in the third tier.

'''CP Ramachandran''' (1923 – 15 April 1997) was an [[India]]n [[journalist]] and political activist.

==Early life==
Ramachandran was born in [[Burma]] of [[Malayali]] parents, Alath Krishnan Nair from Mannur in Palakkad District and Chittenippattu Puthenveettil Janaki Amma, from [[Ottapalam]], [[Kerala]], India. After a short period in Burma, CP spent his boyhood in Ottapalam. His education was in Ottapalam and [[Government Victoria College, Palakkad]]. After his intermediate schooling he joined the Royal Navy as a mid-ship man. During the Naval Mutiny in 1946, he was under surveillance by the Intelligence Department, as he had a strong Communist Party background prior to his Naval life. After leaving the Navy he worked in the Army for two years in Ahammed Nagar. Finishing his military life, he returned home in 1948, the year after independence, and became very active in the Party once again. All his party works were centred on Ottapalam. When the Party was banned, CP was arrested and sent to Kannur Central Jail. After his release set out to Bombay whilst the police watched him continuously. In 1952 he was called by [[A. K. Gopalan]] and immediately started woreking for Goplan's election campaign.

==Career==
In 1953, following the instructions of [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]], CP went to Delhi to join the Party newspaper ''Crossroads'', which later became ''New Age'', and began his career as a journalist. Until 1955 CP was a reporter with the paper. When he had some disagreements with the basic ideas of his Party, he started to write his views in ''[[Shankar's Weekly]]'' under the name 'Agastya'. Although Namboodiripad warned him, CP was not prepared to compromise, resulting in his expulsion from the Party along with [[Edathatta Narayan]] and [[Aruna Asaf Ali]]. He then joined ''Shankar's Weekly'' as Assistant Editor. His columns, entitled 'Man Of The Week' and 'Free Thinking', were very popular. He met Jalabala Vaidya, then a trainee reporter and now the famous theatre actress, and in 1958 they got married. CP's marriage lasted just six years as they obtained a mutual divorce in 1964, after fathering two children Jai and Anasuya. In 1960 CP joined [[The Hindustan Times]] as Parliament Correspondent. His column 'Last Week in Parliament' was much discussed. When B G Vargeese was fired from the paper in 1974, CP filed a suit against Birla who was the owner of the newspaper. It became a notable chapter in the history of [[Indian Journalism]]. In 1986 CP retired from ''Hindustan Times'' as Deputy Editor.

==Death==
He never wished to remain in Delhi, where he had lived most of his life as an intellectual and a journalist, so went back to his mother in [[Parali, Palakkad]], and was with her when she died. CP lived his last 11 years in Parli, until he died on 15 April 1997. His daughter Anasuya and son Jai were with him at the end

The book titled 'C P Ramachandran-Dialogues, Memories and Essays' (സി.പി.രാമചന്ദ്രന്‍-സംഭാഷണം,സ്മരണ, ലേഖനങ്ങള്‍) edited by noted Malayalam critic Reghunathan Parali and published by Kerala Press Academy, Kakkanad is a valuable work in Malayalam that compiles and throws light into the life and thoughts of the veteran journalist. The book is consisting of a prolonged conversation and writings by C P Ramachandran and many other writings on him by noted writers and journalists who had direct experience with him.

'''Telecom Egypt Sporting Club''' ({{lang-ar|نادي المصرية للإتصالات للألعاب الرياضية}}), is an [[Egypt]]ian football club based in [[Cairo]], Egypt. The club is currently playing in the [[Egyptian Second Division]], the second-highest league in the [[Egyptian football league system]]. Telecom Egypt is the club affiliated to [[Telecom Egypt]] company, which is known in Egypt with its Arabic transliteration '''El Masreya lel Etesalat'''.

The club became known after its top performances in the Egyptian Second Division, and later rose to fame for the first time after being promoted to the '''Egyptian Premier League''' in season 2007–08.

In season 2008–09 the club attracted much attention after they signed a contract with the retired legendary Egyptian player [[Hossam Hassan]] to coach the team. At the time of the signing the club was highly threatened of relegation, and Hossam's main objective was to maintain the club's stance in the [[Egyptian Premier League]], the same way he did with [[El-Masry]], the club he coached the past season. However, and after many extraordinary performances against Egyptian top club, Itesalat club was relegated to the Egyptian Second Division in circumstances that are considered controversial.

'''State Trunk Highway 171''' (often called '''Highway 171''', '''STH-171''' or '''WIS&nbsp;171''') is a [[state highway (US)|state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Wisconsin]]. It runs east–west in southwest Wisconsin from near [[Ferryville, Wisconsin|Ferryville]] to [[Boaz, Wisconsin|Boaz]].

==Route description==
The highway begins at an intersection with [[Wisconsin Highway 35|WIS&nbsp;35]] east of [[Lake Winneshiek]], a lake along the [[Mississippi River]]. From there, it runs eastward, following Copper Creek until it ends just west of [[Mount Sterling, Wisconsin|Mount Sterling]], where it intersects [[Wisconsin Highway 27|WIS&nbsp;27]]. The highway then runs eastward before curving to the north to run along an unnamed creek, which the highway follows to the southeast until it drains into the [[Kickapoo River]], at which point the highway crosses it to run along Main Street in [[Gays Mills, Wisconsin|Gays Mills]]. East of Gays Mills, the highway curves up a hill and runs eastward, running concurrently with [[U.S. Route 61|US&nbsp;61]] for {{conv|0.2|mi|km}} in [[Rolling Ground, Wisconsin|Rolling Ground]]. From there, the highway runs eastward to meet an unnamed creek and the English Run before curving to follow a different tributary of the English Run. After that tributary ends, the highway intersects with County Trunk Highway (CTH) UU and then curves southeast to another unnamed creek which begins near CTH-F. The highway follows it until reaching CTH-E in [[Boaz, Wisconsin]] where it runs northward along Mill Creek before terminating at [[U.S. Route 14 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;14]].<ref name=gmaps/>

'''Lystrup''' is a town in [[Aarhus Municipality]], [[Denmark]]. It is located 10&nbsp;km north of [[Aarhus]] city centre, west of [[Egå]] and the [[Bay of Aarhus]]. It had a population of 10,425 (1 January 2019),<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref> and is the second most populous urban area of [[Aarhus Municipality]].

==Schools==
[[Image:Lystrup Tunnel.JPG|thumb|right|The network of tunnels and pathways in Lystrup, makes it easy to avoid heavy traffic. Here the tunnel beneath Sønderskovvej shot from the east.]]
Three schools ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110718120740/http://www.lystrup-skole.dk/Infoweb/Designskabelon8/Rammeside.asp?Action=&Side=&Klasse=&Id= Lystrup Skole], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070206163645/http://www.elsted-skole.dk/Infoweb/Designskabelon8/Rammeside.asp?Action=&Side=&Klasse=&Id= Elsted Skole] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20070225195549/http://www.elevskole.skoleintra.dk/Infoweb/Designskabelon1/Rammeside.asp?Action=&Side=&Klasse=&Id= Elev Skole]), several kindergartens, after-school centres and private daycarers makes Lystrup a suburb full of childlife, and the town has seen a substantial inflow of family residents in recent years.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Shopping==
Lystrup also provides good shopping possibilities, with several smaller, specialized boutiques along with one major, and three minor supermarkets. [http://www.superbrugsen.dk/includefiles/MODULER/CCMS/show_page.asp?iMappeID=53&sSideNavn=forside SuperBrugsen] is one of the big co-operative supermarket chains in [[Denmark]]. Lystrup also provides a local library, for all citizens of Aarhus to loan books, free of charge.

==Sports==
Lystrup also has great sport facilities, and local club [http://www.lystrup.dk/ L.I.F] offers a wide range of activities on all levels, including football (soccer), water polo, tennis, handball, swimming, badminton, squash and basketball.

==Industry==
A huge industrial area lies on the east side of Lystrup, and one of Denmark and Europe's biggest defence companies [[Terma A/S|Terma]] has its headquarters here.

==Public transport==
Public transportation in Lystrup and Aarhus is primarily by buses, but Lystrup also has a small train-station for the local train, that serves the citizens of eastern [[Jutland]] from the city of Grenaa to [[Aarhus]]. Also buses 1A, 18 and 32 go to the town several times an hour. All public transportation is provided by [http://www.midttrafik.dk Midttrafik].

==Recreational areas==
Lystrup has a forest and four parks. Centrally in the town, north of the railroad, lies Southern Forest ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Sønderskov), officially rated as a dog forest where visitors may let their dogs roam freely. Southern forest is used for a wide range of recreational activities such as horseback-riding, jogging and scouting.

Gilesgate was originally the main street in a settlement associated with [[Kepier Hospital|the Hospital of St Giles]] which was sited by the existing [[St Giles Church, Durham|St Giles Church]].  The street was divided in the 1960s by the construction of the A690 and the demolition of a number of houses, pubs and shops at the foot of Gilesgate Bank to construct a roundabout.  East of Gilesgate itself was [[Gilesgate Moor]].  During the 19th century, housing extended along the Sherburn and Sunderland Roads and the colliery village of [[New Durham, Durham|New Durham]] was built within the parish.

'''David Ellis Lardner''' (11 March 1919 – 19 October 1944) was an editor, a [[Film criticism|movie critic]], and later a [[war correspondent]] for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine. He was the fourth son of humorist [[Ring Lardner]]. He was killed when a [[land mine]] exploded under the [[Willys MB|jeep]] he was riding in while covering the European Theatre of [[World War II]]. He had been in Europe for four months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1944/10/22/archives/david-lardner-killed-correspondent-son-of-humorist-dies-on-front.html |title=David Lardner Killed; Correspondent, Son of Humorist, Dies on Front Near Aachen |publisher=[[New York Times]], page 25 |date=1944-10-22 |accessdate=2019-11-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/49423630/ |title=David Lardner, War Correspondent, Killed With the U.S. Fifth Army Near Aachen |publisher=[[The San Bernardino Sun|The San Bernardino Daily Sun]], page 1|date=1944-10-23 |accessdate=2019-11-27}}</ref>

==Background==
David Lardner, the last of four sons born to noted writer and humorist Ring Lardner and Ellis Abbott, remained unnamed for two months after his birth, and his father ran a contest for naming suggestions, none of which were used.

David Lardner became an anonymous reporter and interviewer for \"The Talk of the Town\" column in ''The New Yorker'' in 1939 at the age of 20, as well as a movie reviewer. Shortly after he married his wife [[Frances Chaney|Frances]], he was given responsibility for another department, \"Notes on Sports.\"

His two children, Katharine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0488061/ |title=Kate Lardner|publisher=[[IMDb]] |date=2019-11-27 |accessdate=2019-11-27}}</ref> and Joe, were born while he was writing this column.

David's opinionated style of writing is what made him valuable at ''The New Yorker''. He only gave his opinion of things that he was knowledgeable about, which included movies and sports.

The \"Notes on Sports\" column continued intermittently for more than two years, but was discontinued permanently when David left to cover World War Two in London.

He asked for an overseas assignment after being rejected for military service because of poor eyesight.

==Death==
Lardner and Russell Hill, correspondent for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', were riding in a jeep from the combat-devastated city of [[Aachen]] to a press camp on 19 October 1944. Lardner had only joined the [[First Army (United States)|First Army]] press corps a few days before, on his first war assignment.

Hill suggested that they take a short-cut. The road chosen had just been swept for mines by engineers but the mines had been left stacked by the road for retrieval the following day, and the vehicle swerved into a pile of them. \"One report said the jeep touched off a string of seven antivehicular mines.\"

Lardner was blown from the jeep and knocked unconscious. He died a few hours later in a hospital. Hill was also injured, and the driver was killed. Lardner was 25.

The purported '''flag of Blackbeard''', consisting of a horned skeleton using a spear to pierce a bleeding heart, is typically attributed to the pirate Edward Teach, better known as [[Blackbeard]]. However, contrary to [[popular belief]], there is no accurate description of any specific flag used by Blackbeard during his piracy beyond using black flags or \"bloody flags\"<ref name=nc>{{cite web|url=https://www.qaronline.org/blog/2017-10-06/did-you-know-blackbeards-flag|title=Did You Know Blackbeard's Flag is a Modern Design? |website=Queen Anne's Revenge Project |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> and, in any case, the \"flag of Blackbeard\" appears to be an early 20th-century design.<ref name=mf/>

== History ==
During the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], Blackbeard was one of the most infamous pirates on the seas. The only record there is of what flag he flew was in 1718 in a newspaper report which stated that Blackbeard's fleet, including his flagship ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', during an attack on the ''Protestant Caesar'' flew black flags with death heads and \"bloody flags\".<ref name=mf /> However it did not state which ship Blackbeard was on at the time.<ref>{{cite book | first =Baylus | last =Brooks |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R39dDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT311&dq=%22Bloody+Flags%22+blackbeard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5tpb72PLeAhWsI8AKHdsEC0sQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Bloody+Flags%22+blackbeard&f=false |title=Quest for Blackbeard: The True Story of Edward Thache and His World | publisher = Lulu Press | volume =  | year = 2017 | isbn = 1365795926}}</ref>

Following a revival in interest in piracy in the 20th century, the flag first appeared in an article in ''[[The Mariner's Mirror]]'' magazine as a general pirate's flag in 1912 but the article made no assertion of it being Blackbeard's flag.<ref name=nc /> Later in the century approximately around the 1970s it started to be ascribed as Blackbeard's flag and was often used as such in books and television programmes portraying him.<ref name=mf>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/531982/facts-about-pirate-blackbeard|title=15 Facts About Blackbeard|date=22 November 2018|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>

The purported '''flag of Blackbeard''', consisting of a horned skeleton using a spear to pierce a bleeding heart, is typically attributed to the pirate Edward Teach, better known as [[Blackbeard]]. However, contrary to [[popular belief]], there is no accurate description of any specific flag used by Blackbeard during his piracy beyond using black flags or \"bloody flags\"<ref name=nc>{{cite web|url=https://www.qaronline.org/blog/2017-10-06/did-you-know-blackbeards-flag|title=Did You Know Blackbeard's Flag is a Modern Design? |website=Queen Anne's Revenge Project |accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> and, in any case, the \"flag of Blackbeard\" appears to be an early 20th-century design.<ref name=mf/>

== History ==
During the [[Golden Age of Piracy]], Blackbeard was one of the most infamous pirates on the seas. The only record there is of what flag he flew was in 1718 in a newspaper report which stated that Blackbeard's fleet, including his flagship ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', during an attack on the ''Protestant Caesar'' flew black flags with death heads and \"bloody flags\".<ref name=mf /> However it did not state which ship Blackbeard was on at the time.<ref>{{cite book | first =Baylus | last =Brooks |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R39dDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT311&dq=%22Bloody+Flags%22+blackbeard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5tpb72PLeAhWsI8AKHdsEC0sQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=%22Bloody+Flags%22+blackbeard&f=false |title=Quest for Blackbeard: The True Story of Edward Thache and His World | publisher = Lulu Press | volume =  | year = 2017 | isbn = 1365795926}}</ref>

Following a revival in interest in piracy in the 20th century, the flag first appeared in an article in ''[[The Mariner's Mirror]]'' magazine as a general pirate's flag in 1912 but the article made no assertion of it being Blackbeard's flag.<ref name=nc /> Later in the century approximately around the 1970s it started to be ascribed as Blackbeard's flag and was often used as such in books and television programmes portraying him.<ref name=mf>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/531982/facts-about-pirate-blackbeard|title=15 Facts About Blackbeard|date=22 November 2018|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref> Some academic institutions such as the [[Smithsonian]] have also incorrectly described it as the flag of Blackbeard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ocean.si.edu/human-connections/history-cultures/blackbeards-pirate-flag|title=Blackbeard’s Pirate Flag|website=Smithsonian Ocean|accessdate=2 January 2019}}</ref>

'''Chris Whitey Sims''' (born 1966) is a musician, songwriter and first amendment activist known for his work with [[The Leaving Trains]], Graveyard Rodeo and his current band Tender.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/music/bandwidth/article/Tender-punk-rock-with-metal-edge-4276236.php|title=Tender: punk rock with metal edge|work=SFGate|accessdate=24 October 2015}}</ref>

==Musical career==
In 1991 Falling James Moreland briefly disbanded The Leaving Trains to form The Power of Sky. Along with Power of Sky's bassist, Chris Whitey Sims, Moreland reassembled a new Leaving Trains with Bobby Belltower (who had briefly played in the previous incarnation of the band) and Lenny Montoya. This lineup produced two albums on SST Records: Loser Illusion Part 0 released 1991 (SST284), and The Lump in My Forehead released 1992 (SST288), with James Moreland and Chris Whitey Sims as primary songwriters.

Chris Sims also performed with [[Pepper Keenan]] in Graveyard Rodeo, a local New Orleans band in the mid-1980s as featured in Life, Death and Heavy Blues from the Bayou.

Sims also appears on The FuckEmos album \"Airshow\" released by Man's Ruin (MR-181) in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2001-03-02/fuckemos-airshow-2000/|title=Review: Fuckemos - Music - The Austin Chronicle|work=austinchronicle.com|accessdate=21 October 2015}}</ref>

==Reshaping the musical direction of the Leaving Trains==
(The Leaving Trains sound) changed early in 1991, when (Falling James) Moreland hooked up with his new bandmate and writing partner, Chris Whitey Sims. \"He's very caustic and insulting and macho,\" Moreland said. \"He really sets people off because he's so insulting. Because of him chiding me and kicking me, I got to the point where I stopped writing about myself and my horrible love life, and we started writing about anything around us.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-02-20/entertainment/ca-3797_1_moreland|title=Playing With Hazardous Material : Leaving Trains' Raucous Rockers Know From Experience How Dangerous Dissent Can Be|work=latimes|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref>

Charity work

The Cakrani Family and humanitarian aid after 1920

This is from the dairy of a member of a prominent family, Hajredin Bey Cakrani, who was based in Cakran, Fier, South of Albania. He was one of three brothers called Bektash, Hajredin and Sulo Bey. They formed The Cakrani Foundation which was active in Albania from 1920.
Initially, The Cakrani Foundation provided humanitarian aid for refugees affected by the Spanish Flu, the Balkan Wars and World War One. Later, it supported poor children through offering scholarships during King Zog’s reign, and saved all Jewish refugees who lived in Berat after the German occupation of Albania in September 1943.
The family helped refugees from Kosovo between the year 1932-1935 after King Zog had sent most of them to settle in Fier, around the Seman river. All Albanian-Kosovars who now live in that part of Albania are the descendants of the Kosovar refugees of the year 1932-1935.
The Cakrani Foundation tried to aid The Perugia Division, which numbered 8000 in total after the Italian capitulation in September 1943. They rescued 500 of them and hid them in Mallakaster, where with the family’s help they built a camp, which also functioned as a hospital.
Kujtim Cakrani a leading officer of Balli Kombetar, managed to hide all the Jewish families in Lushnja and Mallakaster. To stop people denouncing the Jews, Kadri Cakrani gave a roof to all of the families who they found in Berat.
The level of humanitarian aid offered by this one family to people who needed it in Albania from 1914-1944 is extraordinary. All the help offered and given came from their own pockets. This family had to stop their help to the ones who were most in need in early 1945, following the persecution of the family by the communists.
Today, The Cakrani Foundation has been renewed since 2000. It offers similar help to the original foundation to the ones that need it most. This foundation is run by the lawyer Kujtim Cakrani, who is a descendant of the original Cakrani family.

'''Spanish flu aid relief'''
Here is a quote taken from the Hajredin Bej’s diary, a book published in Albanian by the historian Kastriot Bimo, stating:
“We returned back home and saw refugees on the way which possibly are as a result of the flu and the victims of the Greeks, who have burnt down their villages, and 50-100 souls are dying every day, which is not a inconsiderable loss of life. We have been told that this flu is spread across Europe, and it’s killing people en masse. Refugees, we have been told, have come via Vlora and from both sides of Vjosa river. This is the last we needed at this time for our nation. I can easily call this a tragedy. We didn’t wait for the summer, but got together with all the local notables and appealed to everyone to collect things for the refugees, like clothes, food and money, and we as brothers to get this done, decided to give this responsibility to our ladies. Also, we have instructed our servants to help with this”.
According to Marigo Posio’s chronicle of the times, the contribution of the Cakrani brothers, Hajredin, Sule and Bektash Bey, and their family to the refugees they were able to help was fourteen cows, 120 sheep, 200 Francs in money and clothes.

'''Malpaís de Güímar''' or '''Badlands of Guimar''' consist of a [[volcanic cone]], subsidiary cones, and several [[basalt]]ic [[lava]] flows in the [[Güímar|Güímar municipality]] on the island of [[Tenerife]], in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]].  They total in area about 290 hectares. The lava flows are quite recent, with the typical [[aa (lava flow)|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]] type less than 10,000 years old. The large cone is called ''Montaña Grande'' (''Big Mountain'') and reaches a height of {{convert|276|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

==Geography==

The Malpaís de Güímar were formed by a series of volcanic eruptions, the most recent and most evident occurring from fissures in the side of the Montaña Grande cone less than 10,000 years ago.  Two peaks from former eruptions stand above the lava plain, ''Montaña de la Mar'' (\"Mountain of the Sea\") and ''Las Morras del Corcho'' (\"Cork Bluff\"). In addition to aa lava flows, there have been [[Pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic]] eruptions of ash and [[volcanic bomb]]s that formed the various cones.  The crater of Montaña Grande is about 300 meters in diameter and about 50 meters deep. It has a certain asymmetry, being wider towards leeward due to the action of the wind during its period of formation.  The shore line has eroded since the last eruptions, and beaches have formed in a few areas.  In places [[lava tube]]s have been exposed.  Notable is ''Cueva Honda'' (\"Deep Cave\"), which was formed by a large gas bubble within a lava tube.

==Climate==

There is little rainfall, and what does fall is quickly transported away from the surface by the volcanic soil.  The area is washed by the [[tradewinds]], and temperatures vary between a 17&nbsp;°C average in January and 23&nbsp;°C in August. In addition the area has a very high rate of days of sunshine, upwards of 2,500 hours per year.  The relative humidity hovers around 70%.

[[File:Medjerda.jpg|thumb|a view of the river]]
{{hatnote|'Bagradas' and 'Bagradas River' redirect here. For the battles, see [[Battle of the Bagradas River (disambiguation)]].}}
The '''Medjerda River''' ({{lang-ar|وادي مجردة}}), the [[classical antiquity|classical]] '''Bagrada''', is a river in North Africa flowing from northeast [[Algeria]] through [[Tunisia]] before emptying into the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and [[Lake of Tunis]]. With a length of {{convert|450|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, it is the longest river of Tunisia. It is also known as the '''Wadi Majardah''' or '''Mejerha''' ({{lang-fr|Oued Majardah}}).<ref>Azedine Beschaouch, ''De l'Africa latino-chrétienne à l'Ifriqiya arabo-musulmane: questions de toponymie'', CRAI, vol. 130, n°3, 1986, pp. 530-549</ref>

==Course==
The Medjerda River originates in the [[Tell Atlas]], part of the [[Atlas Mountains]], in northeastern Algeria and then flows eastwards to Tunisia, then entering the [[Gulf of Utica]] of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Its course has a length of {{convert|460|km|mi}}. It is the most important and longest rivers in Tunisia and is dammed in several locations, being a major supplier of water to the country's wheat crops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jica.go.jp/tunisia/english/activities/activity03.html|title=Study on Integrated Basin Management of the Medjerda River {{!}} Tunisia {{!}} Countries & Regions {{!}} JICA|website=www.jica.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-07-28}}</ref>

The Gulf of Utica was formed during the postglacial transgression about 6,000 years ago. Over time, fluvial deposits from the Medjerda gradually filled up the northern part of the gulf. The succession of events during historical times has been inferred from ancient documents and archaeological evidence.

Besides morphological ground observations, aerial and satellite photographs have been used to analyze how the landscape has evolved over the past 3,000 years. The gulf's southern part was filled up in late ancient times. The sea gradually withdrew from the northern part during the Middle Ages and modern times. The Ghar el Melh lagoon is the last vestige of what used to be the Utica gulf.

Following the last big flood in 1973, the Medjerda shifted, once again, its course. It now flows through a canal originally dug to evacuate the overflow of flood waters.<ref>Ameur Oueslati, [[Faouzia Charfi]] & Fadhel Baccar, ''La basse vallée de Oued Majerda et la lagune de Ghar El Melh'', projet WADI</ref>

==History==
Historically the Medjerda is Tunisia's crucial waterway providing water to the country supply facilities, it is also vital to the people living near the river. Water from the Medjerda is used for [[irrigation]] and is pivotal to the region's agriculture.

A very strategic river in North Africa, it was fought over and settled many times in history by the [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Punics]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Arabs]], and the [[Ottomans]]. Several major cities, such as [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], [[Carthage]], and eventually [[Tunis]] were founded on or in close proximity to it. The former ports of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Ghar el-Melh]] (Rusucmona or Porto Farina) were, however, eventually closed off from the sea due to the silting of their harbors.

The '''Medjerda River''' ({{lang-ar|واد مجردا}}), the [[classical antiquity|classical]] '''Bagrada''', is a river in North Africa flowing from northeast [[Algeria]] through [[Tunisia]] before emptying into the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and [[Lake of Tunis]]. With a length of {{convert|450|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, it is the longest river of Tunisia. It is also known as the '''Wadi Majardah''' or '''Mejerha''' ({{lang-fr|Oued Majardah}}).<ref>Azedine Beschaouch, ''De l'Africa latino-chrétienne à l'Ifriqiya arabo-musulmane: questions de toponymie'', CRAI, vol. 130, n°3, 1986, pp. 530-549</ref>

==Course==
The Medjerda River originates in the [[Tell Atlas]], part of the [[Atlas Mountains]], in northeastern Algeria and then flows eastwards to Tunisia, then entering the [[Gulf of Utica]] of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Its course has a length of {{convert|460|km|mi}}. It is the most important and longest rivers in Tunisia and is dammed in several locations, being a major supplier of water to the country's wheat crops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jica.go.jp/tunisia/english/activities/activity03.html|title=Study on Integrated Basin Management of the Medjerda River {{!}} Tunisia {{!}} Countries & Regions {{!}} JICA|website=www.jica.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-07-28}}</ref>

The Gulf of Utica was formed during the postglacial transgression about 6,000 years ago. Over time, fluvial deposits from the Medjerda gradually filled up the northern part of the gulf. The succession of events during historical times has been inferred from ancient documents and archaeological evidence.

Besides morphological ground observations, aerial and satellite photographs have been used to analyze how the landscape has evolved over the past 3,000 years. The gulf's southern part was filled up in late ancient times. The sea gradually withdrew from the northern part during the Middle Ages and modern times. The Ghar el Melh lagoon is the last vestige of what used to be the Utica gulf.

Following the last big flood in 1973, the Medjerda shifted, once again, its course. It now flows through a canal originally dug to evacuate the overflow of flood waters.<ref>Ameur Oueslati, [[Faouzia Charfi]] & Fadhel Baccar, ''La basse vallée de Oued Majerda et la lagune de Ghar El Melh'', projet WADI</ref>

==History==
Historically the Medjerda is Tunisia's crucial waterway providing water to the country supply facilities, it is also vital to the people living near the river. Water from the Medjerda is used for [[irrigation]] and is pivotal to the region's agriculture.

A very strategic river in North Africa, it was fought over and settled many times in history by the [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Punics]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandals]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Arabs]], and the [[Ottomans]]. Several major cities, such as [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], [[Carthage]], and eventually [[Tunis]] were founded on or in close proximity to it. The former ports of [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]] and [[Ghar el-Melh]] (Rusucmona or Porto Farina) were, however, eventually closed off from the sea due to the silting of their harbors.

The story is built around members of a lower-middle-class family living in an urban slum.

Krishna is a paper boy, and his mother works as a sweeper. Krishna falls in love with Kamala, a domestic worker to a rich family, and the two marry.
