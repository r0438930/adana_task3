It was the capital of the Miami nation and related [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes.{{efn|According to J. Dunn, Jr., this name was \"usually said to mean \"blackberry patch,\" or \"blackberry bush,\" this plant being considered an emblem of antiquity because it sprang up on the sites of old villages.

The [[Miami tribe]] established its settlement of [[Kekionga]] at the confluence of the [[Maumee River|Maumee]], [[St. Joseph River (Maumee River)|St. Joseph]], and [[St. Marys River (Indiana and Ohio)|St. Marys]] rivers. It was the capital of the Miami nation and related [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes.{{efn|According to J. Dunn, Jr., this name was \"usually said to mean \"blackberry patch,\" or \"blackberry bush,\" this plant being considered an emblem of antiquity because it sprang up on the sites of old villages. This theory rests on the testimony of Barron, a longtime French trader on the Wabash.

In 1760, France ceded the area to Britain after its forces in North America surrendered during the [[Seven Years' War]], known on the North American front as the [[French and Indian War]]. In 1763, various Native American nations rebelled against British rule and retook the fort as part of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]].
