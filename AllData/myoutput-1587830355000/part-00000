He is known for his distinctive musical and narrative style which includes [[deadpan]] delivery and singing paired with colorful [[Surrealism|surrealist]], [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]], and [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]] graphics. Wurtz first published material on [[YouTube]] in 2013. He set up a website in 2014, presenting a catalog of music and videos he had created since 2002. Wurtz proceeded to upload edited versions of his videos on short-form [[Online video platform|video-sharing website]] [[Vine (service)|Vine]], where he enjoyed initial popularity. He experienced breakout success on YouTube with his [[Animated documentary|animated documentaries]], ''history of japan'' (2016), and ''history of the entire world, i guess'' (2017).

He is known for his distinctive musical and narrative style which includes [[deadpan]] delivery and singing paired with colorful [[Surrealism|surrealist]], [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]], and [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]] graphics.

Wurtz proceeded to upload edited versions of his videos on short-form [[Online video platform|video-sharing website]] [[Vine (service)|Vine]], where he enjoyed initial popularity. He experienced breakout success on YouTube with his [[Animated documentary|animated documentaries]], ''history of japan'' (2016), and ''history of the entire world, i guess'' (2017).
