In all seven published cases that have provided sexual orientation information, all subjects grew up to be attracted to females. Six cases were exclusively attracted to females, with one case 'predominantly' attracted to females. In an article in the journal ''[[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]],'' six researchers including [[J. Michael Bailey]] state this establishes a strong case that male sexual orientation is partly established before birth:\n{{Quote|text=\"This is the result we would expect if male sexual orientation were entirely due to nature, and it is opposite of the result expected if it were due to nurture, in which case we would expect that none of these individuals would be predominantly attracted to women.

Six of the seven identified as heterosexual males at follow up, despite being surgically altered and reared as females, with researchers adding: \"available evidence indicates that in such instances, parents are deeply committed to raising these children as girls and in as gender-typical a manner as possible.\" Bailey et al. describe the occurrence of these sex reassignments as \"the near-perfect quasi-experiment\" in measuring the impact of 'nature' versus 'nurture' with regards to male homosexuality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Urban setting ==\nIn 1994, [[Edward Laumann|Edward Laumann's]] study of sexual practices in the United States found that a higher proportion of people in urban and city environments report homosexual orientation than in rural areas. However the authors note this may largely driven by migration, as homosexual people move to urban environments for increased acceptance, and because cities provide visible gay and lesbian communities, especially if they feel constrained by negative sanctions toward open homosexuality in their local social networks of friends and family. The authors also hypothesized that large cities could provide a congenial environment for the development and expression of same-gender interest, not out of deliberate choice, but that the environment provides increased opportunities for, and fewer sanctions against, the expression of same-gender attraction.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=3RbyuQAYsdMC&pg=PA561&lpg=PA561 | title = The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States | first1 = Edward O. | last1 = Laumann | first2 = John H. | last2 = Gagnon | first3 = Robert T. | last3 = Michael | first4 = Stuart | last4 = Michaels | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-226-46957-7 | pages = 308 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Sex in America: A Definitive Survey|last1=Laumann|first1=Edward| last2 = Michael | first2 = Robert | last3 = Kolata | first3 = Gina | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-446-67183-5|date=September 1, 1995|url=https://archive.org/details/sexinamericadefi00mich}}</ref> This idea was further elaborated in Laumann's later book, The Sexual Organization of the City, which showed that expression of sexual orientation is contingent on the existence of \"sex marketplaces,\" or venues where people with specific sexual orientations can congregate and meet.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Edward O. | last1 = Laumann | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Ellingson | first3 = Jenna | last3 = Mahay | first4 = Anthony | last4 = Paik | first5 = Yoosik | last5 = Youm | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2004 | title = The Sexual Organization of the City | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press }}</ref>\n\n== History of sexual abuse ==\nThe [[American Psychiatric Association]] states: \"...no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse.

In all seven published cases that have provided sexual orientation information, all subjects grew up to be attracted to females. Six cases were exclusively attracted to females, with one case 'predominantly' attracted to females. In an article in the journal ''[[Psychological Science in the Public Interest]],'' six researchers including [[J. Michael Bailey]] state this establishes a strong case that male sexual orientation is partly established before birth:\n{{Quote|text=\"This is the result we would expect if male sexual orientation were entirely due to nature, and it is opposite of the result expected if it were due to nurture, in which case we would expect that none of these individuals would be predominantly attracted to women. They show how difficult it is to derail the development of male sexual orientation by psychosocial means\"|author=|title=|source=}}\nThey further argue that this raises questions about the significance of the social environment on sexual orientation, stating, \"If one cannot reliably make a male human become attracted to other males by cutting off his penis in infancy and rearing him as a girl, then what other psychosocial intervention could plausibly have that effect?\" It is further stated that neither [[cloacal exstrophy]] (resulting in a malformed penis), nor surgical accidents, are associated with abnormalities of prenatal androgens, thus, the brains of these individuals were male-organized at birth. Six of the seven identified as heterosexual males at follow up, despite being surgically altered and reared as females, with researchers adding: \"available evidence indicates that in such instances, parents are deeply committed to raising these children as girls and in as gender-typical a manner as possible.\" Bailey et al. describe the occurrence of these sex reassignments as \"the near-perfect quasi-experiment\" in measuring the impact of 'nature' versus 'nurture' with regards to male homosexuality.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Urban setting ==\nIn 1994, [[Edward Laumann|Edward Laumann's]] study of sexual practices in the United States found that a higher proportion of people in urban and city environments report homosexual orientation than in rural areas. However the authors note this may largely driven by migration, as homosexual people move to urban environments for increased acceptance, and because cities provide visible gay and lesbian communities, especially if they feel constrained by negative sanctions toward open homosexuality in their local social networks of friends and family. The authors also hypothesized that large cities could provide a congenial environment for the development and expression of same-gender interest, not out of deliberate choice, but that the environment provides increased opportunities for, and fewer sanctions against, the expression of same-gender attraction.<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=3RbyuQAYsdMC&pg=PA561&lpg=PA561 | title = The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States | first1 = Edward O. | last1 = Laumann | first2 = John H. | last2 = Gagnon | first3 = Robert T. | last3 = Michael | first4 = Stuart | last4 = Michaels | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-226-46957-7 | pages = 308 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Sex in America: A Definitive Survey|last1=Laumann|first1=Edward| last2 = Michael | first2 = Robert | last3 = Kolata | first3 = Gina | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=[[Grand Central Publishing]]|isbn=978-0-446-67183-5|date=September 1, 1995|url=https://archive.org/details/sexinamericadefi00mich}}</ref> This idea was further elaborated in Laumann's later book, The Sexual Organization of the City, which showed that expression of sexual orientation is contingent on the existence of \"sex marketplaces,\" or venues where people with specific sexual orientations can congregate and meet.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Edward O. | last1 = Laumann | first2 = Stephen | last2 = Ellingson | first3 = Jenna | last3 = Mahay | first4 = Anthony | last4 = Paik | first5 = Yoosik | last5 = Youm | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2004 | title = The Sexual Organization of the City | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press }}</ref>\n\n== History of sexual abuse ==\nThe [[American Psychiatric Association]] states: \"...no specific psychosocial or family dynamic cause for homosexuality has been identified, including histories of childhood sexual abuse.
