Noblemen loyal to the kings also received this [[Noble titles|Title]].\n\nThe title itself is derived from the title [[Emir]]. ''Emir'', meaning \"commander\" or \"Prince\", is derived from the Semitic [[triconsonantal|root]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\"Amr\"}}'', meaning \"command\". Originally it simply meant \"commander\" or \"leader\", usually in reference to a group of people. It came to be used as a title of governors or rulers, typically in smaller states, and usually renders the English word \"prince\". The word entered English in 1595, from the French ''\u00e9mir''.<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=amir&searchmode=none EtymologyOnLine</ref>\n\n==Persian Empires==\n[[File:Meeting between Babur and Sultan 'Ali Mirza near Samarqand.jpg|thumb|Meeting between [[Babur]] Mirza and Sultan [[Ali Mirza Safavi|Ali Mirza]] near [[Samarqand]]]]\n[[File:Elkas_Mirza.jpg|thumb|Alqas Mirza meeting [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].

''Emir'', meaning \"commander\" or \"Prince\", is derived from the Semitic [[triconsonantal|root]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|\"Amr\"}}'', meaning \"command\". Originally it simply meant \"commander\" or \"leader\", usually in reference to a group of people. It came to be used as a title of governors or rulers, typically in smaller states, and usually renders the English word \"prince\". The word entered English in 1595, from the French ''\u00e9mir''.<ref>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=amir&searchmode=none EtymologyOnLine</ref>\n\n==Persian Empires==\n[[File:Meeting between Babur and Sultan 'Ali Mirza near Samarqand.jpg|thumb|Meeting between [[Babur]] Mirza and Sultan [[Ali Mirza Safavi|Ali Mirza]] near [[Samarqand]]]]\n[[File:Elkas_Mirza.jpg|thumb|Alqas Mirza meeting [[Suleiman the Magnificent]].
