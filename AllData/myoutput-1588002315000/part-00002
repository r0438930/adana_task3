A reporter named Alka meets Amol Dwivedi ([[Vikrant Massey]]), the creator and head of a foundation for acid attack Survivors, and informs him about Malti ([[Deepika Padukone]]), an acid attack survivor fighting for a ban on sale of acid. Malti is looking for employment, and Alka puts her in touch with Amol, who employs her in his foundation.\n\nIn April 2005, Malti is attacked in a busy market street in [[New Delhi]]. The Police investigate - based on Malti's and her boyfriend Rajesh's ([[Ankit Bisht]]) testimony, they suspect Basheer \"Babbu\" Khan ([[Vishal Dahiya]]), a family friend of Malti's,  and his brother's wife Parveen Shaikh. The police arrest Babbu after triangulating his phone signal in the same area as the attack, while Malti undergoes a series of surgeries to reconstruct her severely damaged face. Malti's parents work as domestic help in Shiraz's ([[Payal Nair]]) house; she helps financially with Malti's treatment and hires Archana Bajaj ([[Madhurjeet Sarghi]]) to be Malti's lawyer.\n\nArchana notes that acid attacks and burning someone with hot water come under the same section of the Indian Penal Code, so the punishment will be the same. In the first hearings, it is clear that Babbu and Parveen are guilty, as Malti's story is corroborated by witnesses and Parveen has the tell-tale burnt fingers from throwing acid. However, as the law doesn't treat acid attack as a serious crime, Babbu is able to make bail and continue on with his life. Malti recognizes the need for a change to the law and regulations on acid sale, and She and Archana prepare a petition. Meanwhile, Malti's brother Rohit is diagnosed with advanced intestinal tuberculosis.\n\nIn August 2009, the court sentences Basheer Khan to 10 years and Parveen Shaikh to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment, but they appeal the verdict to the High Court. Meanwhile, Malti collects funds for treatment and legal action for other acid attack survivors. She and the foundation fight for her petition, eventually succeeding in having the penal code amended. In 2013, another acid attack at a Mumbai railway station claims the life of Pinky Rathore, which leads to public outrage and leads to regulations on acid sale. Meanwhile, Malti becomes the face of [[acid attack]] survivors and develops feelings towards Amol.\n\nFinally, it is revealed that Basheer indeed planned the acid attack on Malti in a fit of jealousy, and carried it out with help from Parveen Shaikh.  In October 2013, the Delhi High Court rejects Basheer's appeal, sending the attackers to jail. The film ends with another acid attack in December 2013, and laments that despite the new regulations and media exposure, the frequency of acid attacks has not decreased over time, while acid is still bought and sold freely in India.\n\nThe film is based on the real-life story of [[acid attack]] survivor [[Laxmi Agarwal]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Deepika Padukone tears up at 'Chhapaak' trailer launch, calls it career's most special film |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/deepika-padukone-tears-up-at-chhapaak-trailer-launch-calls-it-careers-most-special-film/articleshow/72454924.cms |accessdate=20 December 2019 |publisher=economictimes.indiatimes.com}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Malti<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/deepikas-next-chhapaak-is-a-story-of-undying-human-spirit/articleshow/68549587.cms|title=Deepika's next 'Chhapaak' is a story of undying human spirit|newspaper=[[Times Of India]]|date=25 March 2019|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Vikrant Massey]] as Amol\n* Madhurjeet Sarghi as Archana Bajaj\n* [[Anand Tiwari]] as Bajaj's husband\n* Vaibhavi Upadhyaya as Minakshi\n* [[Payal Nair]] as Shiraz\n* Vishal Dahiya as Basheer Khan, the acid attacker<ref name=\"BH 9 Jan attacker\">{{cite news |last1=Hungama |first1=Bollywood |title=REVEALED: Meet the actor who plays Basheer Khan, the acid attacker in Chhapaak : Bollywood News - Bollywood Hungama |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/revealed-meet-actor-plays-babban-shaikh-acid-attacker-chhapaak/ |accessdate=9 January 2020 |date=8 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n* Ankit Bisht as Rajesh<ref name=\"BH 9 Jan attacker\" />\n* Geeta Agarwal\n* Manohar Teli\n* Sharvari Deshpande\n* Delzad Hivale \n* [[Anjana Om Kashyap]] (herself)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\nOn 10 December 2019, the official trailer was launched by [[Fox Star Studios]].

A reporter named Alka meets Amol Dwivedi ([[Vikrant Massey]]), the creator and head of a foundation for acid attack Survivors, and informs him about Malti ([[Deepika Padukone]]), an acid attack survivor fighting for a ban on sale of acid. Malti is looking for employment, and Alka puts her in touch with Amol, who employs her in his foundation.\n\nIn April 2005, Malti is attacked in a busy market street in [[New Delhi]]. The Police investigate - based on Malti's and her boyfriend Rajesh's ([[Ankit Bisht]]) testimony, they suspect Basheer \"Babbu\" Khan ([[Vishal Dahiya]]), a family friend of Malti's,  and his brother's wife Parveen Shaikh. The police arrest Babbu after triangulating his phone signal in the same area as the attack, while Malti undergoes a series of surgeries to reconstruct her severely damaged face. Malti's parents work as domestic help in Shiraz's ([[Payal Nair]]) house; she helps financially with Malti's treatment and hires Archana Bajaj ([[Madhurjeet Sarghi]]) to be Malti's lawyer.\n\nArchana notes that acid attacks and burning someone with hot water come under the same section of the Indian Penal Code, so the punishment will be the same. In the first hearings, it is clear that Babbu and Parveen are guilty, as Malti's story is corroborated by witnesses and Parveen has the tell-tale burnt fingers from throwing acid. However, as the law doesn't treat acid attack as a serious crime, Babbu is able to make bail and continue on with his life. Malti recognizes the need for a change to the law and regulations on acid sale, and She and Archana prepare a petition. Meanwhile, Malti's brother Rohit is diagnosed with advanced intestinal tuberculosis.\n\nIn August 2009, the court sentences Basheer Khan to 10 years and Parveen Shaikh to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment, but they appeal the verdict to the High Court. Meanwhile, Malti collects funds for treatment and legal action for other acid attack survivors. She and the foundation fight for her petition, eventually succeeding in having the penal code amended. In 2013, another acid attack at a Mumbai railway station claims the life of Pinky Rathore, which leads to public outrage and leads to regulations on acid sale. Meanwhile, Malti becomes the face of [[acid attack]] survivors and develops feelings towards Amol.\n\nFinally, it is revealed that Basheer indeed planned the acid attack on Malti in a fit of jealousy, and carried it out with help from Parveen Shaikh.  In October 2013, the Delhi High Court rejects Basheer's appeal, sending the attackers to jail. The film ends with another acid attack in December 2013, and laments that despite the new regulations and media exposure, the frequency of acid attacks has not decreased over time, while acid is still bought and sold freely in India.\n\nThe film is based on the real-life story of [[acid attack]] survivor [[Laxmi Agarwal]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Deepika Padukone tears up at 'Chhapaak' trailer launch, calls it career's most special film |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/deepika-padukone-tears-up-at-chhapaak-trailer-launch-calls-it-careers-most-special-film/articleshow/72454924.cms |accessdate=20 December 2019 |publisher=economictimes.indiatimes.com}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Deepika Padukone]] as Malti<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/deepikas-next-chhapaak-is-a-story-of-undying-human-spirit/articleshow/68549587.cms|title=Deepika's next 'Chhapaak' is a story of undying human spirit|newspaper=[[Times Of India]]|date=25 March 2019|accessdate=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n* [[Vikrant Massey]] as Amol\n* Madhurjeet Sarghi as Archana Bajaj\n* [[Anand Tiwari]] as Bajaj's husband\n* Vaibhavi Upadhyaya as Minakshi\n* [[Payal Nair]] as Shiraz\n* Vishal Dahiya as Basheer Khan, the acid attacker<ref name=\"BH 9 Jan attacker\">{{cite news |last1=Hungama |first1=Bollywood |title=REVEALED: Meet the actor who plays Basheer Khan, the acid attacker in Chhapaak : Bollywood News - Bollywood Hungama |url=https://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/bollywood/revealed-meet-actor-plays-babban-shaikh-acid-attacker-chhapaak/ |accessdate=9 January 2020 |date=8 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n* Ankit Bisht as Rajesh<ref name=\"BH 9 Jan attacker\" />\n* Geeta Agarwal\n* Manohar Teli\n* Sharvari Deshpande\n* Delzad Hivale \n* [[Anjana Om Kashyap]] (herself)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Release==\nOn 10 December 2019, the official trailer was launched by [[Fox Star Studios]].
