Nowadays, Ybanags are well educated and the source of the province's top politicians, professionals and a world class athlete.<ref>{{cite news|title=Province of Isabela Official Website: Cabagan|url=http://provinceofisabela.ph/index.php/municipalities/2013-07-10-14-46-43/2013-07-10-14-48-19|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring Christmas, the Cabagan Square Park could be seen flashing brightly with many Christmas lights and lanterns. Cabagan's top schools are Cabagan Science Elementary School; Saint Ferdinand College - Cabagan Campus; Isabela State University; and Delfin Albano High School (Main Campus). The Malasi Lake is a sanctuary for migratory birds located in barangay San Antonio and has been hailed by the DENR. The biggest gymnasium in Isabela and in the whole Region 2 is located in this town and the century-old well that was built by the Spaniards, located at St. Ferdinand College, Cabagan Campus. The carousel in Cabagan Square Park has been dubbed by the townspeople as the largest in the Philippines.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nCabagan is politically subdivided into 26 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}}\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Aggub\n* Anao\n* Angancasilian\n* Balasig\n* Cansan\n* Casibarag Norte\n* Casibarag Sur\n* Catabayungan\n* Cubag\n* Garita\n* Luquilu\n* Mabangug\n* Magassi\n* Ngarag\n* Pilig Abajo\n* Pilig Alto\n* Centro ([[Poblacion]])\n* San Bernardo\n* San Juan\n* Saui\n* Tallag\n* Ugad\n* Union\n* Masipi East\n* Masipi West\n* San Antonio\n}}\n\n==History==\nEtymologically, the name Cabagan may have originated from the native word ''bag'' or ''bajaque'', not because \"G-strings\" were used here or made in Cabagan, but most probably because there were stores in the village, Cabagan could have also been derived from the word ''cabbagang'', meaning \"pilgrim\" or stranger. Based on the fact that Cabagan at the time, was in constant contact with members of the \"pagan tribes\" from Diffun, namely southern [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] as well as with the \"Kalingas\", of the neighboring Cordillera mountains.\n\n===Various Cabagan===\nThe Cabagan of old, that existed from 1646 to 1877 was simply called, \"Cabagan\".\nIn 1877, the Spaniards decided to transfer present-day Cabagan to a new site, abandoning the old Cabagan.\nIn 1888, the Spaniards resurrected the abandoned Cabagan, into a new town.  With this development, there were now two Cabagans.\nThe Spaniards rectified the predicament by naming the first Cabagan as ''Cabagan Viejo'', and the second Cabagan as ''Cabagan Nuevo'' or the new Cabagan.\nApparently, the name was not to the liking of the new rulers, the Americans.  When the Americans came to rule the Philippines after the Spaniards, they renamed Cabagan Nuevo as simply \"Cabagan\", and the old namesake, as the town of San Pablo.\n\n===Foundation===\nThe old Cabagan, Cabagan Viejo which is now called \"San Pablo\", was the key town in the colonization of the Irrayas and to some extent [[Diffun, Quirino|Diffun]], i.e., southern Isabela. The Irraya rebelled and the only ones that the Spaniards could claim, were some three hundred families who agreed to establish the village of Maquilla, near [[Tuguegarao|Tuguegarao City]]. Cabagan became a charter town in November 30, 1646 and ecclesiastically in May 15, 1647 with [[Saint Paul the Apostle]] as the patron saint.\n\n===New Cabagan (Cabagan Nuevo)===\nThe new Cabagan came to exist, because the Spanish government decreed that in January 25, 1877, the old Cabagan or [[San Pablo, Isabela|San Pablo]] of today, be transferred from its old site, to the one that is now occupying.  The brainchild of the transfer of Cabagan, was parish priest Pedro Ricart, who then made representations with the Spanish government, for the transfer.  Father Jose Burgues ''History of Cagayan Valley'' gave the unhealthiness of the old site, the reason for the transfer.  Others had stated though, that Cabagan was transferred because progress appeared to be bypassing the old Cabagan, in favor of the villages to the south, near Cabagan's present site. The new site was the area between the villages of Ugad and Luquilu, villages that exists up to this day.  The site is not far from the old, with the church of the new Cabagan just some three kilometers or so, south from that of the old.\nThe transfer was not without friction though.  A number of Cabagan's inhabitants opposed the transfer.  But the missionary's will had prevailed.  In contempt, as it were of the natives' opposition, the missionary uprooted the Church of the old Cabagan and brought the images and other vestments, to the new Cabagan.\nWhen the Spaniards established a new town, they also endeavored to build a massive church and convent made of stone, brick and mortar.  From 1877, when the new Cabagan was established, and culminating with the [[Philippine Revolution]] that deposed the ruling Spaniards 19 years later (1896), the then governing Spaniards were still not able to complete all constructions needed, for the new Cabagan.\nCabagan is a known meeting place among revolutionaries during the Spanish occupation.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census |align=none\n| cols = 2\n| title = Population census of Cabagan\n| 1903 = 5289\n| 1918 = 13112\n| 1939 = 18795\n| 1948 = 21651\n| 1960 = 17924\n| 1970 = 23370\n| 1975 = 24987\n| 1980 = 28908\n| 1990 = 34999\n| 1995 = 35054\n| 2000 = 41536\n| 2007 = 43562\n| 2010 = 45732\n| 2015 = 50174\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Cabagan, Isabela, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n===Language===\n\nCabagan, as part of the Irraya region and its language, was Irraya.  The Spaniards however, made the [[Ibanag language|Ibanag]] \"The Official Language of the Valley\", and had exerted all efforts that everyone speak the dialect.  Since then, the Irraya tongue gradually disappeared from the Cabagan psyche.\n\nWhen some people utter Irraya before, they were discouraged or forbidden to speak, because that was the language of the \"pagans\" at that time, the [[Kalinga people|Kalingas]].  Whenever the townsfolk enter the poblacion, none would speak of Irraya, for they would be considered despicably as, a \"Kalinga\" or as \"ignorant persons\", living in the mountains.\n\nToday, no one speaks Irraya. There are however, a few barrios in Cabagan today, like San Bernardo and Tallag, wherein the Ibanag dialect gets interspersed with Irraya.

Based on the fact that Cabagan at the time, was in constant contact with members of the \"pagan tribes\" from Diffun, namely southern [[Isabela (province)|Isabela]] as well as with the \"Kalingas\", of the neighboring Cordillera mountains.\n\n===Various Cabagan===\nThe Cabagan of old, that existed from 1646 to 1877 was simply called, \"Cabagan\".\nIn 1877, the Spaniards decided to transfer present-day Cabagan to a new site, abandoning the old Cabagan.\nIn 1888, the Spaniards resurrected the abandoned Cabagan, into a new town.  With this development, there were now two Cabagans.\nThe Spaniards rectified the predicament by naming the first Cabagan as ''Cabagan Viejo'', and the second Cabagan as ''Cabagan Nuevo'' or the new Cabagan.\nApparently, the name was not to the liking of the new rulers, the Americans.  When the Americans came to rule the Philippines after the Spaniards, they renamed Cabagan Nuevo as simply \"Cabagan\", and the old namesake, as the town of San Pablo.\n\n===Foundation===\nThe old Cabagan, Cabagan Viejo which is now called \"San Pablo\", was the key town in the colonization of the Irrayas and to some extent [[Diffun, Quirino|Diffun]], i.e., southern Isabela. The Irraya rebelled and the only ones that the Spaniards could claim, were some three hundred families who agreed to establish the village of Maquilla, near [[Tuguegarao|Tuguegarao City]]. Cabagan became a charter town in November 30, 1646 and ecclesiastically in May 15, 1647 with [[Saint Paul the Apostle]] as the patron saint.\n\n===New Cabagan (Cabagan Nuevo)===\nThe new Cabagan came to exist, because the Spanish government decreed that in January 25, 1877, the old Cabagan or [[San Pablo, Isabela|San Pablo]] of today, be transferred from its old site, to the one that is now occupying.  The brainchild of the transfer of Cabagan, was parish priest Pedro Ricart, who then made representations with the Spanish government, for the transfer.  Father Jose Burgues ''History of Cagayan Valley'' gave the unhealthiness of the old site, the reason for the transfer.  Others had stated though, that Cabagan was transferred because progress appeared to be bypassing the old Cabagan, in favor of the villages to the south, near Cabagan's present site. The new site was the area between the villages of Ugad and Luquilu, villages that exists up to this day.  The site is not far from the old, with the church of the new Cabagan just some three kilometers or so, south from that of the old.\nThe transfer was not without friction though.  A number of Cabagan's inhabitants opposed the transfer.  But the missionary's will had prevailed.  In contempt, as it were of the natives' opposition, the missionary uprooted the Church of the old Cabagan and brought the images and other vestments, to the new Cabagan.\nWhen the Spaniards established a new town, they also endeavored to build a massive church and convent made of stone, brick and mortar.  From 1877, when the new Cabagan was established, and culminating with the [[Philippine Revolution]] that deposed the ruling Spaniards 19 years later (1896), the then governing Spaniards were still not able to complete all constructions needed, for the new Cabagan.\nCabagan is a known meeting place among revolutionaries during the Spanish occupation.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census |align=none\n| cols = 2\n| title = Population census of Cabagan\n| 1903 = 5289\n| 1918 = 13112\n| 1939 = 18795\n| 1948 = 21651\n| 1960 = 17924\n| 1970 = 23370\n| 1975 = 24987\n| 1980 = 28908\n| 1990 = 34999\n| 1995 = 35054\n| 2000 = 41536\n| 2007 = 43562\n| 2010 = 45732\n| 2015 = 50174\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Cabagan, Isabela, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n===Language===\n\nCabagan, as part of the Irraya region and its language, was Irraya.  The Spaniards however, made the [[Ibanag language|Ibanag]] \"The Official Language of the Valley\", and had exerted all efforts that everyone speak the dialect.  Since then, the Irraya tongue gradually disappeared from the Cabagan psyche.\n\nWhen some people utter Irraya before, they were discouraged or forbidden to speak, because that was the language of the \"pagans\" at that time, the [[Kalinga people|Kalingas]].  Whenever the townsfolk enter the poblacion, none would speak of Irraya, for they would be considered despicably as, a \"Kalinga\" or as \"ignorant persons\", living in the mountains.\n\nToday, no one speaks Irraya. There are however, a few barrios in Cabagan today, like San Bernardo and Tallag, wherein the Ibanag dialect gets interspersed with Irraya.  However, some older generation townsfolk, could also remember sentences in Irraya.\n\nIlocano is also spoken in parts of Cabagan because of migration of poor Ilocanos from other parts of Luzon to seek opportunities.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box|location = Cabagan, Isabela\n|width=auto\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan high C = 29\n| Feb high C = 30\n| Mar high C = 32\n| Apr high C = 35\n| May high C = 35\n| Jun high C = 35\n| Jul high C = 34\n| Aug high C = 33\n| Sep high C = 32\n| Oct high C = 31\n| Nov high C = 30\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Jan low C = 19\n| Feb low C = 20\n| Mar low C = 21\n| Apr low C = 23\n| May low C = 23\n| Jun low C = 24\n| Jul low C = 23\n| Aug low C = 23\n| Sep low C = 23\n| Oct low C = 22\n| Nov low C = 21\n| Dec low C = 20\n| Jan precipitation mm = 31.2 \n| Jan rain days = 10\n| Feb precipitation mm = 23 \n| Feb rain days = 6\n| Mar precipitation mm = 27.7 \n| Mar rain days = 5\n| Apr precipitation mm = 28.1 \n| Apr rain days = 5\n| May precipitation mm = 113.5\n| May rain days = 13\n| Jun precipitation mm = 141.4 \n| Jun rain days = 12\n| Jul precipitation mm = 176.4\n| Jul rain days = 15\n| Aug precipitation mm = 236.6 \n| Aug rain days = 15\n| Sep precipitation mm = 224.9 \n| Sep rain days = 15\n| Oct precipitation mm = 247.7 \n| Oct rain days = 17\n| Nov precipitation mm = 222.9 \n| Nov rain days = 16\n| Dec precipitation mm = 178 \n| Dec rain days = 15\n|source 1 = World Weather Online<ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = http://www.worldweatheronline.com/Cabagan-weather-averages/Isabela/PH.aspx\n| title = Cabagan, Isabela: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = World Weather Online\n| accessdate = 31 October 2015}}</ref>\n| date=October 2015}} \n\n==Attractions==\n* Cabagan is famous for its eponymously named 'Pansi Cabagan' a local dish which was introduced by a Chinese trader in 1887 and has gained popularity in different parts of Luzon.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pancit Cabagan: Recipe and Origin |url=https://www.atbp.ph/2016/05/17/pancit-cabagan-recipe-origin/|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> There are several popular restaurants (locally called 'Panciterias') serving this dish along the main road/highway in Barangay Centro, Anao, Ugad and Cubag which include Felicitas Panciteria, Aling Kikay, Loling's Panciteria, Eddie's Restaurant, Josie's Panciteria, KJM, KCJM, Mariloi's Panciteria, Pin-tag Bistro Cafe and Zein's Panciteria.\n* Malasi Tree Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, a bird sanctuary located in Barangay San Antonio, declared by DENR as critical habitat for Philippine ducks and migratory and endemic species of birds are spotted regularly <ref>{{cite news|title=Birdwatch.pH: Malassi Lakes Trip Report |url=http://www.birdwatch.ph/html/visitingbirders/birders20040207.html|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Amazing Malasi Lakes |url=http://www.pbase.com/liquidstone/malasi012007|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref> \n* Cabagan Square Park in Barangay Centro, with its Carousel which is the largest in the Philippines <ref>{{cite news|title=Historical Landmarks, Places of Interest, and Things To Do in the Philippines|url=http://www.aroundphilippines.com/p/historical-landmarks-in-philippines.html|accessdate=23 February 2017}}</ref>\n* Tulap Falls, a recently discovered waterfalls in Barangay Masipi East <ref>{{cite news|title=Tulap Falls -
