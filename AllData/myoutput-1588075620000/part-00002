Classical Judaic writings and Jewish mysticism, especially the [[Zohar]] and the [[Kabbalah]] of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]], are frequently cited in Chabad works. These texts are used both as sources of Chabad teachings and as material requiring interpretation by Chabad authors. Chabad philosophy is rooted in the teachings of Rabbis [[Yisroel ben Eliezer]], (the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism) and [[Magid of Mezritch|Dovber ben Avraham]], the \"Maggid of Mezritch\" (Rabbi Yisroel's successor).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nRabbi Shneur Zalman's teachings formed the basis of Chabad philosophy, as expanded by succeeding generations. Many Chabad activities today are understood as applications of Shneur Zalman's teachings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Tanya ===\n{{Main|Tanya}}\n\nThe ''Tanya'' ({{Lang-he-n|\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0}}) is a book by Rabbi Shneur Zalman was first published in 1797.  It is the first schematic treatment of [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidic moral philosophy]] and its metaphysical foundations.<ref name=\"sacks\" />\n\nAccording to the ''Tanya'', the intellect consists of three interconnected processes: ''Chochma'' (wisdom), ''Bina'' (understanding), and ''Da'at'' (knowledge). While other branches of Hasidism focused primarily on the idea that \"God desires the heart,\" Shneur Zalman argued that God also desires the mind, and that the mind is the \"gateway\" to the heart. With the Chabad philosophy he elevated the mind above the heart, arguing that ''\"understanding is the mother of fear and love for God\"''.<ref>''Tanya'', Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Chapter 13.</ref>\n\nThe ''Tanya'' has five sections.  The original name of the first section is ''Sefer Shel Beinonim'', the ''Book of the Intermediates''. It is also known as ''Likutei Amarim'' \u2014 ''Collected Sayings''. ''Sefer Shel Beinonim'' analyzes the inner struggle of the individual and the path to resolution. Citing the biblical verse \"the matter is very near to you, in your mouth, your heart, to do\",<ref>Deuturonomy 30:14.</ref> the philosophy is based on the notion that the human is not inherently evil; rather, every individual has an inner conflict that is characterized by two different inclinations, the good and the bad.<ref name=\"sacks tanya\">''The Encyclopedia of Hasidism'', \"Tanya\", Jonathan Sacks, pp. 475\u2013477 (15682\u201311236)</ref>\n\nChabad often contrasted itself with what is termed the ''[[Chagat]]'' schools of Hasidism.<ref>\"Chagat\" is an acronym for \"Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet\" (kindness, severity, beauty), the Kabbalistic terms for the three primary emotions. Schools of Hasidic thought stressing emotive patterns of worship have been termed \"Chagat\" in the Chabad philosophy.</ref> While all schools of Hasidism have a certain focus on the emotions, Chagat saw emotions as a reaction to physical stimuli, such as dancing, singing, or beauty. Shneur Zalman, on the other hand, taught that the emotions must be led by the mind, and thus the focus of Chabad thought was to be [[Torah]] study and prayer rather than [[esotericism]] and song.<ref name=\"sacks\" /> As a Talmudist, Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In ''[[Tanya]]'', he defines his approach as ''moach shalit al halev'' ([[Hebrew]]: \"\u05de\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\", \"the brain ruling the heart\").<ref>''Tanya'', ch. 12</ref>\n\n== Community ==\n[[File:Rabbi Schneerson - Lag BaOmer parade.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Lag BaOmer]] parade in front of Chabad headquarters at [[770 Eastern Parkway]], Brooklyn, New York, in 1987]]\nAn adherent of Chabad is called a Chabad Chasid (or Hasid) ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d1\"\u05d3}}), a Lubavitcher ({{lang-yi|\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05b7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8}}), a Chabadnik ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05d1\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7}}), or a Chabadsker ({{lang-yi|\u05d7\u05d1\u05d3\u05e1\u05e7\u05e2\u05e8}}).<ref>{{cite book |last=Cohen|first=J.

This is due in part to the existence of the number of Chabad supporters and affiliates who are not Orthodox (dubbed by some scholars as \"non-Orthodox Hasidim\"), the general lack of official recognition of political and religious distinctions within Judaism and the open relationship with non-Orthodox Jews represented by the activism of Chabad emissaries.

This is due to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson encouraging his followers to reach out to other Jews.<ref>''Hayom Yom'', p. A38</ref> Chabad outreach includes activities promoting the practice of Jewish commandments ([[Mitzvah campaigns]]), as well as other forms of Jewish outreach. Much of Chabad's outreach is performed by Chabad emissaries (see [[Shaliach (Chabad)]]).\n\n==== Mitzvah campaigns ====\n{{Main|Mitzvah campaigns}}\n\n[[The Rebbes of Chabad]] have issued the call to all Jews to attract non-observant Jews to adopt Orthodox Jewish observance, teaching that this activity is part of the process of bringing the ''[[Jewish messianism|Messiah]]''. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson issued a call to every Jew: ''\"Even if you are not fully committed to a Torah life, do something. Begin with a [[mitzvah]] \u2014 any mitzvah \u2014 its value will not be diminished by the fact that there are others that you are not prepared to do\"''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/62228/jewish/10-Point-Mitzvah-Campaign.htm |title=The Rebbe's 10-Point Mitzvah Campaign |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>\n\nSchneerson also suggested ten specific ''mitzvot'' that he believed were ideally suited for the emissaries to introduce to non-observant Jews. These were called \"''mivtzoim''\" \u2014 meaning \"campaigns\" or \"endeavors\". These were: lighting candles before [[Shabbat]] and the [[Jewish holiday]]s by Jewish women; putting on ''[[tefillin]]''; affixing a ''[[mezuzah]]''; regular ''[[Torah study]]''; giving [[Tzedakah]]; purchasing [[Sefer (Hebrew)|Jewish books]]; observing kashrut ([[kashrut|kosher]]); kindness to others; Jewish religious education, and observing ''[[niddah|the family purity]]'' laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn addition, Schneerson emphasized spreading awareness of preparing for and the coming of the [[Jewish messiah|moshiach]], consistent with his philosophy. He wrote on the responsibility to reach out to teach every fellow Jew with love, and implored that all Jews believe in the imminent coming of the moshiach as explained by [[Maimonides]]. He argued that redemption was predicated on Jews doing good deeds, and that gentiles should be educated about the ''[[Noahide Laws]]''. Chabad has been a prime force in disseminating awareness of these laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nSchneerson was emphatic about the need to encourage and provide strong education for every child, Jew and non-Jew alike. In honor of Schneerson's efforts in education the [[United States Congress]] has made [[Education and Sharing Day]] on the Rebbe's Hebrew Birthday ([[11 Nissan]]).\n\n==== Shluchim (Emissaries) ====\n{{Main|Shaliach (Chabad)}}\nFollowing the initiative of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson spurred on the movement to what has become known as ''shlichus'' (\"serving as an emissary [performing outreach]\") in 1950\u20131951. As a result, Chabad ''shluchim'' (\"emissaries\", sing. ''shliach'') have moved all over the world with the stated mission of encouraging non-observant Jews to adopt Orthodox Jewish observance. They assist Jews with all their religious needs, as well as with physical assistance and spiritual guidance and teaching. The stated goal is to encourage Jews to learn more about their Jewish heritage and to practice Judaism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Fishkoff, Sue, ''The Rebbe's Army'', Schocken books 2003 ({{ISBN|08052 11381}}){{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Chabad movement, motivated by Schneerson, has trained and [[Semikhah|ordained]] thousands of rabbis, educators, ritual slaughterers, and [[mohel|ritual circumcisers]], who are then accompanied by their spouses to many locations around the world. Typically, a young Lubavitch rabbi and his wife, in their early twenties, with one or two children, will move to a new location, and as they settle in will raise a large family who, as a family unit, will aim to fulfill their mandate of bringing Jewish people closer to Orthodox Judaism and encouraging gentiles to adhere to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> To date, there are around 5000 shluchim in 100 different countries.<ref name=ch100/>\n\n==== Mitzvah tank ====\n{{Main|Mitzvah tank}}\n[[File:Mitzvah tank - Golders Green - 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Chabad Lubavitch]] Mitzvah tank in [[Golders Green]], London]]\nA '''mitzvah tank''' is a vehicle used by Chabad members involved in outreach as a portable \"educational and outreach center\" and \"mini-synagogue\" (or \"minagogue\").

Kehot commonly distributes books written or transcribed from the rebbes of Chabad, prominent [[Hasidic Judaism|chassidim]] and other authors who have written Jewish materials.\n\n[[Kehot]] is a division of [[Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch]], the movement's educational arm.\n\n==== Media ====\nMore than any other Jewish movement, Chabad has used media as part of its religious, social, and political experience.

Two major leadership succession controversies occurred in the 1800s, one took place in the 1810s following the death of the movement's founder, the other occurred in the 1860s following the death of the third Rebbe. Two other minor offshoot groups were formed later in the movement's history. The movement's other major controversy is [[Chabad messianism]], which began in the 1990s.\n\n=== Succession disputes and offshoot groups ===\n{{Main|Chabad offshoot groups}}\nA number of groups have split from the Chabad movement, forming their own Hasidic groups, and at times, positioning themselves as possible successors of previous Chabad rebbes. Following the deaths of the first and third rebbes of Chabad, disputes arose over their succession.\n\n*'''The death of Rabbi Shneur Zalman''' \u2013 Following the death of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the first Chabad rebbe, a dispute over his succession led to a break within the movement. While the recognized successor was Rabbi Dovber Schneuri, a student of Rabbi Shneur Zalman, Rabbi [[Aaron HaLevi ben Moses of Staroselye|Aaron HaLevi]] assumed the title of rebbe, and led a number of followers from the town of [[Strashelye, Mogilev Province|Strashelye]]. The new group had two rebbes, Rabbi Aaron and his son Rabbi [[Haim Rephael of Strashelye|Haim Rephael]]. The new group eventually disbanded, following Rabbi Haim Rephael's death.<ref name=beck>{{cite web |last=Beck|first=Atara|title=Is Chabad Lubavitch|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=16 August 2012|url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Judaism/Is-Chabad-Lubavitch}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RcRAQAAIAAJ&dq=leadership+in+the+habad&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FetuUoaRGYmVhQfgu4DwDg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA|title=Leadership in the HaBaD Movement: A critical evaluation of HaBaD leadership, history, and succession|first=Avrum M. |last=Ehrlich |first2=Mark Avrum |last2=Ehrlich |publisher=Jason Aronson|year=2000|isbn=978-0765760555 |chapter=11: The Leadership of Dov Ber}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref> One of the main points the two rabbis disagreed on was the place of spiritual ecstasy in prayer.

While Rabbi Shmuel Schneersohn was recognized as the heir to the Chabad-Lubavitch line, several of his brothers formed groups of their own in the towns of [[Kopys]] (forming the [[Kapust|Kapust dynasty]]), [[Nezhin]] (forming the [[Niezhin (Hasidic dynasty)|Niezhin dynasty]]), [[Lyady, Vitebsk Region|Lyady]] (forming the [[Liadi (Hasidic dynasty)|Liadi dynasty]]), and [[Ovruch]] (forming the [[Avrutch (Hasidic dynasty)|Avrutch dynasty]]). The lifespan of these groups varied; Niezhin and Avrutch had one rebbe each, Liadi had two rebbes, and Kapust had four. Following the deaths of their last rebbes, these groups eventually disbanded.<ref name=\"pop\">''Encyclopedia of Hasidism, entry: Schneersohn, Shmaryahu Noah''. Naftali Lowenthal.

Classical Judaic writings and Jewish mysticism, especially the [[Zohar]] and the [[Kabbalah]] of Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]], are frequently cited in Chabad works. These texts are used both as sources of Chabad teachings and as material requiring interpretation by Chabad authors. Chabad philosophy is rooted in the teachings of Rabbis [[Yisroel ben Eliezer]], (the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism) and [[Magid of Mezritch|Dovber ben Avraham]], the \"Maggid of Mezritch\" (Rabbi Yisroel's successor).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nRabbi Shneur Zalman's teachings formed the basis of Chabad philosophy, as expanded by succeeding generations. Many Chabad activities today are understood as applications of Shneur Zalman's teachings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n=== Tanya ===\n{{Main|Tanya}}\n\nThe ''Tanya'' ({{Lang-he-n|\u05ea\u05e0\u05d9\u05d0}}) is a book by Rabbi Shneur Zalman was first published in 1797.  It is the first schematic treatment of [[Hasidic philosophy|Hasidic moral philosophy]] and its metaphysical foundations.<ref name=\"sacks\" />\n\nAccording to the ''Tanya'', the intellect consists of three interconnected processes: ''Chochma'' (wisdom), ''Bina'' (understanding), and ''Da'at'' (knowledge). While other branches of Hasidism focused primarily on the idea that \"God desires the heart,\" Shneur Zalman argued that God also desires the mind, and that the mind is the \"gateway\" to the heart. With the Chabad philosophy he elevated the mind above the heart, arguing that ''\"understanding is the mother of fear and love for God\"''.<ref>''Tanya'', Shneur Zalman of Liadi, Chapter 13.</ref>\n\nThe ''Tanya'' has five sections.  The original name of the first section is ''Sefer Shel Beinonim'', the ''Book of the Intermediates''. It is also known as ''Likutei Amarim'' \u2014 ''Collected Sayings''. ''Sefer Shel Beinonim'' analyzes the inner struggle of the individual and the path to resolution. Citing the biblical verse \"the matter is very near to you, in your mouth, your heart, to do\",<ref>Deuturonomy 30:14.</ref> the philosophy is based on the notion that the human is not inherently evil; rather, every individual has an inner conflict that is characterized by two different inclinations, the good and the bad.<ref name=\"sacks tanya\">''The Encyclopedia of Hasidism'', \"Tanya\", Jonathan Sacks, pp. 475\u2013477 (15682\u201311236)</ref>\n\nChabad often contrasted itself with what is termed the ''[[Chagat]]'' schools of Hasidism.<ref>\"Chagat\" is an acronym for \"Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet\" (kindness, severity, beauty), the Kabbalistic terms for the three primary emotions. Schools of Hasidic thought stressing emotive patterns of worship have been termed \"Chagat\" in the Chabad philosophy.</ref> While all schools of Hasidism have a certain focus on the emotions, Chagat saw emotions as a reaction to physical stimuli, such as dancing, singing, or beauty. Shneur Zalman, on the other hand, taught that the emotions must be led by the mind, and thus the focus of Chabad thought was to be [[Torah]] study and prayer rather than [[esotericism]] and song.<ref name=\"sacks\" /> As a Talmudist, Shneur Zalman endeavored to place Kabbalah and Hasidism on a rational basis. In ''[[Tanya]]'', he defines his approach as ''moach shalit al halev'' ([[Hebrew]]: \"\u05de\u05d5\u05d7 \u05e9\u05dc\u05d9\u05d8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05dc\u05d1\", \"the brain ruling the heart\").<ref>''Tanya'', ch. 12</ref>\n\n== Community ==\n[[File:Rabbi Schneerson - Lag BaOmer parade.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Lag BaOmer]] parade in front of Chabad headquarters at [[770 Eastern Parkway]], Brooklyn, New York, in 1987]]\nAn adherent of Chabad is called a Chabad Chasid (or Hasid) ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05e1\u05d9\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d1\"\u05d3}}), a Lubavitcher ({{lang-yi|\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05d0\u05b7\u05d5\u05d5\u05d9\u05d8\u05e9\u05e2\u05e8}}), a Chabadnik ({{lang-he|\u05d7\u05d1\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9\u05e7}}), or a Chabadsker ({{lang-yi|\u05d7\u05d1\u05d3\u05e1\u05e7\u05e2\u05e8}}).<ref>{{cite book |last=Cohen|first=J.

[[Steven Lapidus]] notes that there is mention of two Chabad congregations in a 1915 article in ''[[Canadian Jewish Chronicle]]'' listing the delegates of the first [[Canadian Jewish Conference]]. One congregation is listed as Chabad of Toronto, the other is simply listed as \"Libavitzer Congregation\". The sociologist [[William Shaffir]] has noted that some Chabad Hasidim and sympathizers did reside in Montreal before 1941, but does not elaborate further. Steven Lapidus also notes that in a 1931 obituary published in ''[[Keneder Odler]]'', a Canadian Yiddish newspaper, the deceased, Rabbi Menashe Lavut, is credited as the founder of Anshei Chabad in Montreal and the Nusach Ari synagogue.

This is due to Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson encouraging his followers to reach out to other Jews.<ref>''Hayom Yom'', p. A38</ref> Chabad outreach includes activities promoting the practice of Jewish commandments ([[Mitzvah campaigns]]), as well as other forms of Jewish outreach. Much of Chabad's outreach is performed by Chabad emissaries (see [[Shaliach (Chabad)]]).\n\n==== Mitzvah campaigns ====\n{{Main|Mitzvah campaigns}}\n\n[[The Rebbes of Chabad]] have issued the call to all Jews to attract non-observant Jews to adopt Orthodox Jewish observance, teaching that this activity is part of the process of bringing the ''[[Jewish messianism|Messiah]]''. Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson issued a call to every Jew: ''\"Even if you are not fully committed to a Torah life, do something. Begin with a [[mitzvah]] \u2014 any mitzvah \u2014 its value will not be diminished by the fact that there are others that you are not prepared to do\"''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/62228/jewish/10-Point-Mitzvah-Campaign.htm |title=The Rebbe's 10-Point Mitzvah Campaign |publisher=Chabad |accessdate=2010-05-12}}</ref>\n\nSchneerson also suggested ten specific ''mitzvot'' that he believed were ideally suited for the emissaries to introduce to non-observant Jews. These were called \"''mivtzoim''\" \u2014 meaning \"campaigns\" or \"endeavors\". These were: lighting candles before [[Shabbat]] and the [[Jewish holiday]]s by Jewish women; putting on ''[[tefillin]]''; affixing a ''[[mezuzah]]''; regular ''[[Torah study]]''; giving [[Tzedakah]]; purchasing [[Sefer (Hebrew)|Jewish books]]; observing kashrut ([[kashrut|kosher]]); kindness to others; Jewish religious education, and observing ''[[niddah|the family purity]]'' laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nIn addition, Schneerson emphasized spreading awareness of preparing for and the coming of the [[Jewish messiah|moshiach]], consistent with his philosophy. He wrote on the responsibility to reach out to teach every fellow Jew with love, and implored that all Jews believe in the imminent coming of the moshiach as explained by [[Maimonides]]. He argued that redemption was predicated on Jews doing good deeds, and that gentiles should be educated about the ''[[Noahide Laws]]''. Chabad has been a prime force in disseminating awareness of these laws.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nSchneerson was emphatic about the need to encourage and provide strong education for every child, Jew and non-Jew alike. In honor of Schneerson's efforts in education the [[United States Congress]] has made [[Education and Sharing Day]] on the Rebbe's Hebrew Birthday ([[11 Nissan]]).\n\n==== Shluchim (Emissaries) ====\n{{Main|Shaliach (Chabad)}}\nFollowing the initiative of Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson spurred on the movement to what has become known as ''shlichus'' (\"serving as an emissary [performing outreach]\") in 1950\u20131951. As a result, Chabad ''shluchim'' (\"emissaries\", sing. ''shliach'') have moved all over the world with the stated mission of encouraging non-observant Jews to adopt Orthodox Jewish observance. They assist Jews with all their religious needs, as well as with physical assistance and spiritual guidance and teaching. The stated goal is to encourage Jews to learn more about their Jewish heritage and to practice Judaism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Fishkoff, Sue, ''The Rebbe's Army'', Schocken books 2003 ({{ISBN|08052 11381}}){{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Chabad movement, motivated by Schneerson, has trained and [[Semikhah|ordained]] thousands of rabbis, educators, ritual slaughterers, and [[mohel|ritual circumcisers]], who are then accompanied by their spouses to many locations around the world. Typically, a young Lubavitch rabbi and his wife, in their early twenties, with one or two children, will move to a new location, and as they settle in will raise a large family who, as a family unit, will aim to fulfill their mandate of bringing Jewish people closer to Orthodox Judaism and encouraging gentiles to adhere to the [[Seven Laws of Noah]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> To date, there are around 5000 shluchim in 100 different countries.<ref name=ch100/>\n\n==== Mitzvah tank ====\n{{Main|Mitzvah tank}}\n[[File:Mitzvah tank - Golders Green - 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Chabad Lubavitch]] Mitzvah tank in [[Golders Green]], London]]\nA '''mitzvah tank''' is a vehicle used by Chabad members involved in outreach as a portable \"educational and outreach center\" and \"mini-synagogue\" (or \"minagogue\").

Following the deaths of the first and third rebbes of Chabad, disputes arose over their succession.\n\n*'''The death of Rabbi Shneur Zalman''' \u2013 Following the death of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the first Chabad rebbe, a dispute over his succession led to a break within the movement. While the recognized successor was Rabbi Dovber Schneuri, a student of Rabbi Shneur Zalman, Rabbi [[Aaron HaLevi ben Moses of Staroselye|Aaron HaLevi]] assumed the title of rebbe, and led a number of followers from the town of [[Strashelye, Mogilev Province|Strashelye]].
