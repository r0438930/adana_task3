They lived on [[Mullet Key]] and other barrier islands in the area, thanks to the plentiful fish, clams, conch, oysters and whelks from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], supplemented by occasional game food as well as the wild plants they gathered.<ref name=historic>Staff (ndg) [http://www.pinellascounty.org/park/pdf/Fort_DeSoto_historic_guide.pdf \"Fort De Soto County Park: Historic Guide\"] Pinellas County Parks & Recreation / Friends of Fort De Soto</ref>\n\nIn 1529, the Spanish explorer [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] investigated the barrier islands after his expedition landed somewhere between [[St. Pete Beach]] and [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]]. Ten years later, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando De Soto]] came ashore somewhere near the southern part of [[Tampa Bay]], beginning what would culminate in the conquest of Florida for the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name=historic />\n\n===Military use===\nIn 1849 a detachment of US Army engineers, including [[Robert E. Lee]], who would later become the commander of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate army]], surveyed the area. They recommended Mullet and [[Egmont Key]]s become fortified as appropriate site for coastal defense installations.  Both keys could only be reached by boat since they were islands off the mainland. Although no fortifications had yet been built, [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops were stationed on the two keys during the Civil War (1861\u20131865) to aid in the Union blockade of [[Tampa Bay]], with the [[Egmont Key Light|Egmont Key lighthouse]] acting as an observation tower. The keys were again abandoned by the military until 1882 when military reservations were officially created on the two keys. However, it would be several years before actual permanent construction would commence as a result of defense considerations linked to the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].<ref name=historic />\n\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - 12-inch steel coastal defense mortars.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Two of Fort De Soto's remaining four 12-inch coastal defense [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]] of Battery Laidley.

It took a crew of 12 men to operate them.<ref name=historic />]]\n\n[[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] established a [[quarantine]] station on the eastern side of Mullet Key in 1889. It became known as Mullet Key Quarantine Station. The [[Marine Hospital Service]] took over jurisdiction of the station in 1901. The duty of the station was to inspect aliens aboard ships arriving from foreign ports. By 1925 the station operated with fifteen buildings. The quarantine station operated until 1937, when the [[United States Public Health Service|Public Health Service]] transferred its operations there to Gadsden Point, near [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].\n\nThe main operation on Mullet Key, however, became Fort De Soto in 1900, named for Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. The Army post was officially a subpost of [[Egmont Key State Park|Fort Dade]], which was constructed on Egmont Key. These posts were to contain batteries of artillery and mortars to protect Tampa Bay from any invading forces. Construction of Fort De Soto began in November 1898 and completed in 1906. The foundation was constructed of a seashell concrete formula, and the walls and ceiling used a seashell, stone, and concrete mix. The main attractions at the completed post were the [[artillery battery|artillery]] and [[12-inch coast defense mortar]] batteries, Batteries Laidley and Bigelow. The post consisted of 29 buildings. The post's features included a large [[barracks]], a hospital, a [[guardhouse]], a [[blacksmith]] and carpenter shop, an administration building, and [[mess hall]] with kitchen, a bakery, and a storehouse. The site also had brick roads, concrete sidewalks, and a narrow-gauge railroad to aid in moving materials and supplies around the post.\n\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - 40 caliber gun 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|One of Fort De Soto Park's two 6-inch 40-caliber rapid-fire Armstrong guns. Originally located at Fort Dade on Egmont Key, the guns were refurbished and remounted for display at Fort De Soto in 1980.<ref name=historic />]]\n\nThe post was active from 1898 to 1910. At least one company was present at Fort De Soto at all times and many times several units were present. [[Mosquito]]es were a constant problem and the post was very hot in the summers.\n\nIn 1910 most troops were moved to [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] in Alabama. Only a caretaker force remained. By 1914 only an [[ordnance sergeant]] and [[game warden]] remained at the post. Through most of [[World War I]] a larger [[Caretaker (military)|caretaker]] force was at the post, usually with about twenty-two privates, two [[noncommissioned officer]]s, and two [[commissioned officer]]s. In 1917 four of the post's mortars were disassembled and shipped to [[Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery|Fort Rosecrans]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\nIn November 1922 the Army announced it would soon close both Forts De Soto and Dade. On May 25, 1923, the forts were officially abandoned, and only one caretaker remained at each post. A number of tropical storms and hurricanes severely damaged the buildings on the post. A few were destroyed, as was Battery Bigelow in 1932. The Army attempted to sell the post, but there was little interest. In September 1938 Pinellas County bought the areas on Mullet Key for $12,500.\n\n===Conversion to civilian use===\nShortly after Pinellas County purchased Mullet Key from the federal government in 1938, county commissioners granted a lease to Percy L. Roberts for the use of land and buildings on the island the Mullet Key Quarantine Service had once used. The ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' reported the Commission's action in its January 25, 1939, edition:\n\n<blockquote>Lease of Mullet Key buildings to Percy Roberts was ratified Monday by county commissioners who made no change in the tentative lease approved last week.{{parabr}}Roberts will pay the county $50 a month for the first year and $100 a month for the next two years for the lease of two buildings on the extreme south end of the county's property on the key.{{parabr}}The lessee will operate a daily boat service to the island and will serve fish dinners and rent fishing tackle. The distance from his dock near the Bee Line ferry will be 10 miles. He will land in a sheltered cove on the north end of the island. Trips will be started in about three weeks.<ref>Staff (January 24, 1939) ''[[St. Petersburg Times]] p.7</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - observation tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The remains of an observation tower]]\n[[File:Fort De Soto Park (8434900370).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Birds nesting at the top of the tower]]\n\nRoberts, a native of St. Petersburg and local plumbing contractor, had a simple business plan. First, run a passenger boat to Mullet Key facilitating access to the isolated island. This service was expected to attract both fishermen and sightseers. For the fishermen, easy access to the pristine fishing waters of lower Tampa Bay; for the sightseers, easy access to the ruins of historic Fort De Soto and the white-sand beaches facing the Gulf of Mexico. Secondly, establish a hotel and restaurant on the island. Roberts envisioned creating a venue on the island appealing to clubs, associations, and other organizations for group outings of members for fishing, sightseeing, and \"dining on fried mullet\".\n\nWith lease in hand and business plan formulated, and with the financial support of Charles R. Carter, a local insurance executive and president of the Bee Line Ferry Co., Roberts immediately began implementing his plan.\n\nFor transportation to the isolated island, the passenger boat Hobo was put into service. Hobo operated daily from the Bee Line Ferry Terminal at St. Petersburg's Pinellas Point, pulling away from the dock early morning and leaving for the return trip late afternoon. Hobo was also available for chartered trips in between scheduled runs. \"By boat\" was not the only means of transportation to the island. A strip of land on the island was cleared in response to requests by some who wanted to fly small aircraft in and out.\n\nLodging and eating accommodations on the island were fashioned by renovating a building vacated by the Quarantine Service in 1937. The facility at best was austere, but one who was tired and hungry could get a good night's sleep; plenty of coffee, a hearty serving of bacon and eggs for breakfast; any of an assortment of sandwiches for lunch; and, a family style meal of fried mullet with all the trimmings for supper. A screened-in porch was there for those who just wanted to lean back, prop up the feet, enjoy a cool beverage, and relax. This facility became known familiarly as Mullet Key Lodge.\n\nRubert \"Rube\" Allyn, a writer for the ''St. Petersburg Times'', included in his March 28, 1939, column, \"Along the Waterfront\":\n\n<blockquote>When the Pinellas county commissioners leased the old Fort De Soto, and Mullet Key to Percy Roberts, they did a fine thing for the tourists by opening up the vast uninhabited reaches of Mullet Key and the old fort to exploration parties ... Today for a nominal fee, one can take a boat at Pinellas Point, and go to Mullet Key, land at the old Quarantine dock, enjoy an old-fashioned fish dinner prepared in the same manner as the pioneers of 50 years ago, by the Roberts family, and explore miles of uninhabited beaches, bayous, and the old Spanish\u2013American War fort ...<ref>Allyn, Rubert (March 28, 1939) \"Along the Waterfront\" ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Bombing range===\nIn less than two years, Mullet Key Lodge became well established and profitable. However, this first for-profit business founded on the island was short-lived. The lease, granted to Roberts in 1939, had to be rescinded because the War Department decided it wanted the island back for use as a [[bombing range]] by the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] in support of air bases then being constructed in the Tampa Bay area. That pending transaction was reported by the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' on December 18, 1940:\n\n<blockquote>Mullet Key purchased by the county from the Treasury department in 1938 for $12,500 will soon be taken over by the United States Army Air Corps for use as a bombing range. The Air Corps will pay the county all that has been expended to date and will pay to Capt. Charles R. Carter all he has expended in improving the building into a fishing lodge. It is understood that Capt. Carter has an investment of about $8,000 while the county\u2019s total investment is about $13,800.<ref>Staff (December 18, 1940) ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' p.2</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1941, the federal government bought back Mullet Key from Pinellas County for $18,404. As planned, It was turned into a sub-post of [[MacDill AFB|MacDill Field]] and used as a bombing range throughout World War II.\n\n===County park===\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - Gulf Pier 2.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Gulf Pier at Fort De Soto Park, one of two fishing piers.]]\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto side bike path.jpg|thumb|275px|The bike path leading to Arrowhead Fishing and Camping Area.]]\n\nAfter World War II, the by then-renamed [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] had no need for Mullet Key, and it was a sold back to Pinellas County along with adjacent islands Sister Key, Hospital Key, Rattlesnake Key, and Scratch Key. The sale, for $26,495.54, was finalized in 1948. County officials immediately designated Fort De Soto and all of Mullet Key a county recreational area and declared it open to the public. Soon thereafter excursion passenger boats began regularly scheduled trips to the island.\n\nIn 1962, a toll road, the [[Pinellas Bayway]] (formerly [[State Road A19A (Florida)|State Road A19A]], now [[State Road 682 (Florida)|SR 682]]), was completed to the mainland, enabling island visitors to arrive by car. On December 21, 1962, Fort De Soto Park opened. On May 11, 1963, Fort De Soto Park was officially dedicated. Its facilities have been expanded over the years. The quartermaster storehouse was reconstructed to become the Quartermaster Storehouse Museum. On December 2, 1977, the Fort De Soto batteries were placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The four [[12-inch coast defense mortar|12-inch M1890 mortars]] and two [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun#US service|6-inch Armstrong guns]] at Fort De Soto are the only weapons of their type remaining in the United States.\n\n==Recreational activities and amenities==\nThe park is open year-round and has the following features:\n* Several thousand acres of firm-bottomed shallows, making the area a favored destination of wading anglers\n* Two piers, each allowing fishing. Both have bait, tackle and food concessions.\n* Various picnic areas.\n* Fort De Soto, built in 1898, abandoned in phases 1910 to 1948.\n* [[Quartermaster]] Storehouse Museum.\n* Two swimming areas, North Beach and East Beach.

[[Mosquito]]es were a constant problem and the post was very hot in the summers.\n\nIn 1910 most troops were moved to [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]] in Alabama. Only a caretaker force remained. By 1914 only an [[ordnance sergeant]] and [[game warden]] remained at the post. Through most of [[World War I]] a larger [[Caretaker (military)|caretaker]] force was at the post, usually with about twenty-two privates, two [[noncommissioned officer]]s, and two [[commissioned officer]]s. In 1917 four of the post's mortars were disassembled and shipped to [[Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery|Fort Rosecrans]] in [[San Diego, California]].\n\nIn November 1922 the Army announced it would soon close both Forts De Soto and Dade. On May 25, 1923, the forts were officially abandoned, and only one caretaker remained at each post. A number of tropical storms and hurricanes severely damaged the buildings on the post. A few were destroyed, as was Battery Bigelow in 1932. The Army attempted to sell the post, but there was little interest. In September 1938 Pinellas County bought the areas on Mullet Key for $12,500.\n\n===Conversion to civilian use===\nShortly after Pinellas County purchased Mullet Key from the federal government in 1938, county commissioners granted a lease to Percy L. Roberts for the use of land and buildings on the island the Mullet Key Quarantine Service had once used. The ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' reported the Commission's action in its January 25, 1939, edition:\n\n<blockquote>Lease of Mullet Key buildings to Percy Roberts was ratified Monday by county commissioners who made no change in the tentative lease approved last week.{{parabr}}Roberts will pay the county $50 a month for the first year and $100 a month for the next two years for the lease of two buildings on the extreme south end of the county's property on the key.{{parabr}}The lessee will operate a daily boat service to the island and will serve fish dinners and rent fishing tackle. The distance from his dock near the Bee Line ferry will be 10 miles. He will land in a sheltered cove on the north end of the island. Trips will be started in about three weeks.<ref>Staff (January 24, 1939) ''[[St. Petersburg Times]] p.7</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - observation tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The remains of an observation tower]]\n[[File:Fort De Soto Park (8434900370).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Birds nesting at the top of the tower]]\n\nRoberts, a native of St. Petersburg and local plumbing contractor, had a simple business plan. First, run a passenger boat to Mullet Key facilitating access to the isolated island. This service was expected to attract both fishermen and sightseers. For the fishermen, easy access to the pristine fishing waters of lower Tampa Bay; for the sightseers, easy access to the ruins of historic Fort De Soto and the white-sand beaches facing the Gulf of Mexico. Secondly, establish a hotel and restaurant on the island. Roberts envisioned creating a venue on the island appealing to clubs, associations, and other organizations for group outings of members for fishing, sightseeing, and \"dining on fried mullet\".\n\nWith lease in hand and business plan formulated, and with the financial support of Charles R. Carter, a local insurance executive and president of the Bee Line Ferry Co., Roberts immediately began implementing his plan.\n\nFor transportation to the isolated island, the passenger boat Hobo was put into service. Hobo operated daily from the Bee Line Ferry Terminal at St. Petersburg's Pinellas Point, pulling away from the dock early morning and leaving for the return trip late afternoon. Hobo was also available for chartered trips in between scheduled runs. \"By boat\" was not the only means of transportation to the island. A strip of land on the island was cleared in response to requests by some who wanted to fly small aircraft in and out.\n\nLodging and eating accommodations on the island were fashioned by renovating a building vacated by the Quarantine Service in 1937. The facility at best was austere, but one who was tired and hungry could get a good night's sleep; plenty of coffee, a hearty serving of bacon and eggs for breakfast; any of an assortment of sandwiches for lunch; and, a family style meal of fried mullet with all the trimmings for supper. A screened-in porch was there for those who just wanted to lean back, prop up the feet, enjoy a cool beverage, and relax. This facility became known familiarly as Mullet Key Lodge.\n\nRubert \"Rube\" Allyn, a writer for the ''St. Petersburg Times'', included in his March 28, 1939, column, \"Along the Waterfront\":\n\n<blockquote>When the Pinellas county commissioners leased the old Fort De Soto, and Mullet Key to Percy Roberts, they did a fine thing for the tourists by opening up the vast uninhabited reaches of Mullet Key and the old fort to exploration parties ... Today for a nominal fee, one can take a boat at Pinellas Point, and go to Mullet Key, land at the old Quarantine dock, enjoy an old-fashioned fish dinner prepared in the same manner as the pioneers of 50 years ago, by the Roberts family, and explore miles of uninhabited beaches, bayous, and the old Spanish\u2013American War fort ...<ref>Allyn, Rubert (March 28, 1939) \"Along the Waterfront\" ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Bombing range===\nIn less than two years, Mullet Key Lodge became well established and profitable. However, this first for-profit business founded on the island was short-lived. The lease, granted to Roberts in 1939, had to be rescinded because the War Department decided it wanted the island back for use as a [[bombing range]] by the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] in support of air bases then being constructed in the Tampa Bay area. That pending transaction was reported by the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' on December 18, 1940:\n\n<blockquote>Mullet Key purchased by the county from the Treasury department in 1938 for $12,500 will soon be taken over by the United States Army Air Corps for use as a bombing range. The Air Corps will pay the county all that has been expended to date and will pay to Capt. Charles R. Carter all he has expended in improving the building into a fishing lodge. It is understood that Capt. Carter has an investment of about $8,000 while the county\u2019s total investment is about $13,800.<ref>Staff (December 18, 1940) ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' p.2</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1941, the federal government bought back Mullet Key from Pinellas County for $18,404. As planned, It was turned into a sub-post of [[MacDill AFB|MacDill Field]] and used as a bombing range throughout World War II.\n\n===County park===\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto - Gulf Pier 2.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The Gulf Pier at Fort De Soto Park, one of two fishing piers.]]\n[[File:2018 Fort De Soto side bike path.jpg|thumb|275px|The bike path leading to Arrowhead Fishing and Camping Area.]]\n\nAfter World War II, the by then-renamed [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] had no need for Mullet Key, and it was a sold back to Pinellas County along with adjacent islands Sister Key, Hospital Key, Rattlesnake Key, and Scratch Key. The sale, for $26,495.54, was finalized in 1948. County officials immediately designated Fort De Soto and all of Mullet Key a county recreational area and declared it open to the public. Soon thereafter excursion passenger boats began regularly scheduled trips to the island.\n\nIn 1962, a toll road, the [[Pinellas Bayway]] (formerly [[State Road A19A (Florida)|State Road A19A]], now [[State Road 682 (Florida)|SR 682]]), was completed to the mainland, enabling island visitors to arrive by car. On December 21, 1962, Fort De Soto Park opened. On May 11, 1963, Fort De Soto Park was officially dedicated. Its facilities have been expanded over the years. The quartermaster storehouse was reconstructed to become the Quartermaster Storehouse Museum. On December 2, 1977, the Fort De Soto batteries were placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The four [[12-inch coast defense mortar|12-inch M1890 mortars]] and two [[QF 6 inch /40 naval gun#US service|6-inch Armstrong guns]] at Fort De Soto are the only weapons of their type remaining in the United States.\n\n==Recreational activities and amenities==\nThe park is open year-round and has the following features:\n* Several thousand acres of firm-bottomed shallows, making the area a favored destination of wading anglers\n* Two piers, each allowing fishing. Both have bait, tackle and food concessions.\n* Various picnic areas.\n* Fort De Soto, built in 1898, abandoned in phases 1910 to 1948.\n* [[Quartermaster]] Storehouse Museum.\n* Two swimming areas, North Beach and East Beach.
