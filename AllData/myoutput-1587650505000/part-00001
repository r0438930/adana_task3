He is Professor of Economics at [[University of Warwick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mjwaterson/|title=Michael Waterson}}</ref>\n\nWaterson's research is focused in the area of Industrial Economics, both theoretical and empirical. He has conducted research on [[Consumer Behaviour]], firms' reactions to this and related policy issues; [[Energy Economics]], including both supply and generation aspects; Supermarket pricing behaviour; and Transport policy. He has written or co-written 4 books, edited 2 books, written around 75 learned journal articles and several book chapters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2oH7-U4AAAAJ&hl=en|title=Michael Waterson - Google Scholar}}</ref>\n\nHe became a fellow of the [[Royal Society of Arts]] in 1989. \n\n== Early life and education ==\nWaterson received a BA in Economics from University of Warwick in 1971.

He has also held several administrative positions at the institute.<ref name=CV/>\n\nFrom 1994 to 1999, Waterson was the General Editor of ''Journal of Industrial Economics''.

In the beginning of his career, his research was focused on answering major questions using straightforward modeling and data exercises.

In the 1990s, he wrote a paper on product patents in the ''American Economic Review'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://econpapers.repec.org/article/aeaaecrev/v_3a80_3ay_3a1990_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a860-69.htm|title=The Economics of Product Patents}}</ref> a paper on vertical integration in the ''Economic Journal''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/ej/article-abstract/92/365/129/5220349|title= Vertical Integration, Variable Proportions and Oligopoly}}</ref> and a series of papers on vertical restraints with Paul Dobson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1344665|title=Retailer Power: Recent Developments and Policy Implications}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Vertical-Restraints-and-Competition-Policy-Waterson-Dobson/e90dcc7ab754dc408dd0cb765de794156b310230|title=Vertical Restraints and Competition Policy}}</ref>\n\nThe early 2000s saw the field of Industrial Economics take a turn towards more empirical work, but guided strongly by theory. This is reflected in Waterson's research of the time.

Two of these have been in the energy field, one on the valuation of the \u201cRough\u201d gas storage field<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233388871_A_Rough_Analysis_Valuing_Gas_Storage|title= A Rough Analysis: Valuing Gas Storage}}</ref> and the other on the impact of the Fukushima earthquake on German nuclear policy and the subsequent impact on countries outside Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eneeco/v66y2017icp450-465.html|title=The impact of the German response to the Fukushima earthquake}}</ref>\n\nWaterson has written several papers in the area of consumer and supermarket behaviour, including one in the ''Journal of Monetary Economics'' and a well-cited paper in the ''Journal of Agricultural Economics''.
