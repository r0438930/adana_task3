It was a product of the [[Arthur Freed]] unit at [[MGM]], and is notable for its combination of studio and location filming, as a result of Gene Kelly's insistence that some scenes be shot in [[New York City]], including at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], and [[Rockefeller Center]].\n\nThe film was an immediate success and won the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Music\u2014Scoring of a Musical Picture]], and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Cinematography (Color).

Riding the subway, Gabey falls in love with the picture of \"Miss Turnstiles\", who is actually called Ivy Smith, and fantasizes about what she's like in real life (\"Miss Turnstiles\").  The sailors race around New York attempting to find her in the brief period they have.\n\nThey are assisted by, and become romantically involved with, two women, and pair up: Ozzie with Claire, an anthropologist; and Chip with Hildy Esterhazy, an aggressively amorous taxi driver.  Claire claims that she's found her passionate \"Prehistoric Man\" in Ozzie at the [[American Museum of Natural History|Museum of Anthropological History]]. Hildy invites Chip to \"Come Up to My Place\". Finally finding Ivy, Gabey takes her on an imaginary date down his home town \"Main Street\" in a studio in [[Carnegie Hall|Symphonic Hall]] - not realising that she is also from the same town.  Later, Chip sincerely falls for Hildy telling her \"You're Awful\"&nbsp;\u2013 that is, awful nice to be with. That evening, all the couples meet at the top of the [[Empire State Building]] to celebrate a night \"On the Town\".\n\nBut when an ashamed Ivy walks out on Gabey to get to her late night work as a [[Burlesque|cooch dancer]], the friends tell a despondent Gabey, \"You Can Count on Me\", joined by Hildy's annoying, but well-meaning roommate, Lucy Schmeeler. They have a number of adventures before reuniting with Ivy at [[Coney Island]] just as their 24-hour leave ends and they must return to their ship to head off to sea.
