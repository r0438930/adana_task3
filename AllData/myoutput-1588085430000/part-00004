The crime is still unsolved and remains an open investigation with the Boulder Police Department.\n\nThe police initially suspected that the ransom note had been written by JonBen\u00e9t's mother, and that the note and appearance of the child's body had been staged by her parents in order to cover up the crime.

In October 2013, unsealed court documents revealed that a 1999 [[grand jury]] had recommended filing charges against JonBen\u00e9t's parents for permitting the child to be in a threatening situation.
