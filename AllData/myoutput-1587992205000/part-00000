In 2008, he had the highest earnings by a pacer in a single season of $2,448,003.\n\nHe was sired by Mach Three, out of Wheres The Beach, a [[Beach Towel (horse)|Beach Towel]] mare.  The colt was purchased as a yearling for $40,000 and was owned by Schooner Stables of [[Truro, Nova Scotia]].\n\n==2-Year-Old Campaign==\nHe began his racing career in 2007 in the Battle of Waterloo at Grand River Raceway, where he went off as a second favorite in the eliminations and won by three lengths.  In the $300,000 final of the event, he won as a 4-5 post time favorite.\n\nAfter proving his ability on the small track, he moved onto the Metro Pace Eliminations at [[Mohawk Racetrack]].  Somebeachsomewhere was drawn into the same elimination as Dali, the fastest two-year-old colt of the year, up to that point.  Somebeachsomewhere held off race favorite Dali and won by 3{{frac|1|2}} lengths in 1:52.1.

He was scheduled to make his first start of the season in the first Ontario Sires Stakes Gold Elimination on 17 May.  However, an injury resulted in him being scratched from the race.  Two weeks later, when he made his 2008 debut, there was some skepticism about his well-being, but he won his division of the Burlington Stakes over Cb flight.\n.\n\nFollowing the Burlington, Somebeachsomewhere began preparing for the $1.5 million [[North America Cup]], Canada's richest harness race.  Trainer Brent MacGrath was advised not to train the horse in the week leading up to his elimination, yet he won handily in 1:49.0.  Over the next week, trainers and drivers of other horses in the final stated that it was simply a race for second place.
