The Muwekma Ohlone Tribe has members from around the San Francisco Bay Area, and is composed of descendants of the Ohlones/Costanoans from the San Jose, Santa Clara, and San Francisco missions. The Ohlone/Costanoan Esselen Nation, consisting of descendants of intermarried [[Rumsen tribe|Rumsen]] Costanoan and [[Esselen]] speakers of Mission San Carlos Borromeo, are centered at Monterey. The Amah-Mutsun Tribe are descendants of [[Mutsun tribe|Mutsun]] Costanoan speakers of Mission San Juan Bautista, inland from Monterey Bay. Most members of another group of Rumsien language, descendants from Mission San Carlos, the Costanoan Rumsien Carmel Tribe of Pomona/Chino, now live in southern California.

The Ohlone people lived in Northern California from the northern tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] down to northern region of [[Big Sur]], and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the [[Diablo Range]] in the east. Their vast region included the San Francisco Peninsula, [[Santa Clara Valley]], [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay area]], as well as present-day [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] and the [[Salinas Valley]]. Prior to Spanish contact, the Ohlone formed a complex association of approximately 50&nbsp;different \"nations or tribes\" with about 50 to 500 members each, with an average of 200. Over 50&nbsp;distinct Ohlone tribes and villages have been recorded. The Ohlone villages interacted through trade, intermarriage and ceremonial events, as well as some [[wiktionary:internecine|internecine]] conflict. Cultural arts included [[basket-weaving]] skills, seasonal ceremonial dancing events, female [[tattoo]]s, ear and nose piercings, and other ornamentation.<ref>For habitation region, Kroeber, 1925:462.

In hills where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the [[sweat lodge]] was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush. They built [[Balsa (ship)|boats]] of [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule]] to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.<ref>Tule rush houses, redwood houses and sweat lodges, Teixeira, 1997:2.

In cold weather, they might don animal skin capes or feather capes. Women commonly wore deerskin aprons, [[tule]] skirts, or shredded bark skirts. On cool days, they also wore animal skin capes.

The Ohlone probably practiced ''[[Kuksu (religion)|Kuksu]]'', a form of [[shamanism]] shared by many Central and Northern California tribes. Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty [[rites of passage]], intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]] and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.<ref>Bear Shamanism, Kroeber, 1925:472. Observation that Kuksu may have been learned at missions, Kroeber, 1925:470.

However Kroeber observed less \"specialized [[cosmogony]]\" in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\", in comparison to the [[Maidu]] and groups in the [[Sacramento Valley]]; he noted \"if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.\"<ref>Kroeber, 1925:445.</ref>\n\nThe conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]], while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and \"external\".<ref>Costo & Costo, 1987, develop the argument for forced conversion; Sandos, 2004, emphasizes conversion through the attractions of modern technology and music; Milliken, 1995:67, discusses first baptisms and conversions to Catholicism at Mission San Francisco; Bean, 1994:279\u2013281 discusses first-generation conversions to Catholicism as incomplete and external.</ref>\n[[File:Coiffures_du_danse_Choris.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of traditional Ohlone headdresses by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\nIt is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe.

These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing. Men and women would gather in the sweat lodges to \"cleanse, purify, and empower themselves\" for a task like hunting and spirit dancing.<ref name=\"Teixiera 1991\" /> Today, there is a place located in Hollister called [[Indian Canyon, California|Indian Canyon]], where a traditional sweat lodge, or Tupentak, has been built for the same ceremonial purposes. Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\">{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Anne|title=In Breath So It Is in Spirit:The Story of Indian Canyon|date=1994|publisher=Ballena|pages=350\u2013355}}</ref> Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions.

Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\" />\n\n===Sacred narratives and mythology===\n\nThe storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Sadly, only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as \"professional consultants\" for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47\u201371|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref> The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California:Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nOhlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian [[culture hero]]es of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu).

The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|date=1991|publisher=Masters Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer [[Sebastian Vizca\u00edno]] reached and named the area that is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] in December of that year. Despite Vizca\u00edno's positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]]. This time, the [[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|military expedition]] was accompanied by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.<ref>For Spanish missionaries and colonization, Teixeira, 1997:3; Fink, 1972:29\u201330.

The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: [[Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo]] (founded in 1770), [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1776), [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1777), [[Mission Santa Cruz]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] (founded in 1797), and [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] (founded in 1797).

Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were [[baptism|baptized]] and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway \"Christians\" from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.<ref>For events of 1795\u20131796, Milliken, 1995:129\u2013134 (\"Mass Migration in Winter of 1794\u201395\").

Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.<ref name=\"Bean 1994\"/>\n\n====Land and property disputes====\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]: There were \"heated debates\" between \"the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies\" over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the \"Missions Indians\" owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the \"Indians' crops\" were being damaged by the San Jose settlers' livestock and also mentioned settlers \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.\"  They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: \"Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.\" \"By law\", the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.<ref>For \"heated debates\" between church and state, Milliken, 1995:2n. For petition of 1782, Indians vs. settlers of San Jose, with quotations, see Milliken, 1995:72\u201373 (quoting Murguia and Pena [1782] 1955:400).

At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]], but with the new r\u00e9gime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and ''vaqueros'' (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.<ref>Fink, 1972:64: \"Land grants were scarce; In 1830 only 50 private ranches were held in Alta California, of which 7 were in the Monterey region.\" For number of land grants, see Cowan 1956:139\u2013140.

Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at ''Alisal Rancheria'' in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], and ''El Molino'' in [[Niles, California|Niles]]. Communities of mission survivors also formed in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], Monterey and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.<ref>Teixeira, 1997:3\u20134, \"Historical Overview\".</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864\u20131,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually extinct, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]]. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.<ref>For population estimates, Cook, 1976a:183, 236\u2013245.

See also Blevins 2004.</ref>\n\n==Burial practices==\n\n===Sacred sites and importance===\nThe arrival of the Spanish in the 1776 decelerated the culture, sovereignty, religion, and language of the Ohlone. Before the Spanish invasion, the Muwekma Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as \"middens,\" or \"kitchen midden\" meaning an accumulation of refuse.\n\nOne theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartier|first=Robert|title=Santa Cruz County History - Spanish Period & Earlier.}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation's largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=Unacknowledged Tribes, Dangerous Knowledge: The Muwekma Ohlone and How Indian Identities Are \"Known\".|date=2003}}</ref> The [[Emeryville Shellmound]] is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heizer|first=Robert|title=The California Indians; a Source Book|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaindia00heiz|url-access=registration|date=1971|location=Berkeley: University of California.}}</ref>\n\n===Present day burial and sacred sites===\n\n'''Glen Cove'''\n\nOhlone tribes have protested in Vallejo, California and insist that Glen Cove, a sacred site for many Natives, is one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that has escaped urban development. Ohlone feel that the public land should remain undisturbed. The City of Vallejo plans to build a family park at the site.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laverty|first=Phillip|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> Local tribes consider the proposed idea to be an offensive desecration of the sacred land.

Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court.  Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolin|first=Malcolm|title=The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area.|url=https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Heyday|location=Berkeley}}</ref>\n\n'''Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site'''\n\nThe Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay. Key to their success is in their involvement in unearthing and analyzing their ancestral remains in ancient burial sites, which allows them to \"recapture their history and to reconstruct the present and future of their people\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=\"What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> Due to Spanish colonization in the 1700s so much cultural history, knowledge, and identity was lost due to death and forced assimilation of so many natives. Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769\u20131833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports.<ref name=\"Field 2003\">{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate, is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500-2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with \"braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\nAlthough the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was utilizing known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as \"moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,\" animals were \"dream helpers,\" or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of \"sacred deity-like figures\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\n===Indian People Organizing for Change===\nIndian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its members, including Ohlone tribal members and conservation activists, work together in order to accomplish social and environmental justice within the Bay Area American Indian community. Current projects include the preservation of Bay Area shellmounds, which are the sacred burial sites of the Ohlone Nation, whose homeland is the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, IPOC has spread awareness throughout the community through shellmounds walks and has advocated for the preservation of sacred burial sites in the Emeryville Mall, Glen Cove Site, Hunters Point in San Francisco, just to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gould|first=Corrina|title=\"Indian People Organizing for Change.\" Indian People Organizing for Change.|url=http://ipocshellmoundwalk.homestead.com/}}</ref>\n\n==== Sogorea Te Land Trust ====\n{{Main|Sogorea Te Land Trust}}\nThe Sogorea Te Land Trust is a [[land trust]] founded by members of IPOC in 2012 with the goals of returning traditionally [[Chochenyo]] and [[Karkin]] lands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] stewardship and cultivating more active, reciprocal relationships with the land.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Indigenous-women-lead-effort-to-reclaim-ancestral-12384730.php|title=Indigenous women lead effort to reclaim ancestral lands|last=Kost|first=Ryan|date=28 November 2017|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> It has also started a project called the Shuumi Land Tax, which asks that non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on.<ref name=\":0\" /> The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or [[Internal Revenue Service]], but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions [[donation]]s) as it asserts indigenous [[sovereignty]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalw.org/post/native-americans-ask-east-bay-residents-pay-tax-land#stream/0|title=Native Americans ask East Bay residents to pay 'tax' on land|last=Dalmas|first=Jeremy|date=16 April 2018|website=KALW Local Public Radio 91.7 San Francisco|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nCostanoan is an externally applied name ([[exonym]]). The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the ''Coste\u00f1os'' (the \"coastal people\") circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later [[Anglicized]] the word ''Coste\u00f1os'' into the name of ''Costanoans.'' (The suffix \"-an\" is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.<ref name=\"Teix-pg4\">Teixeira, 1997:4, \"The Term 'Costanoan/Ohlone'\".</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name ''Costanoan.'' ''Ohlone'' might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called ''Oljon'', and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] Creek. The name ''Ohlone'' was traced by Teixeira through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft's ''Native Races'', and Frederick Beechey's Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826\u201327. ''Oljone'', ''Olchones'' and ''Alchones'' are spelling variations of ''Ohlone'' found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the ''Muwekma''. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: \"A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.\" Milliken states the name came from: \"A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast\".<!--CITATIONS:--><ref>Opinions and quotations, Teixeira 1997:4; Milliken, 1995:249.</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n{{See also|List of Ohlone villages}}\nLinguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:<ref>Levy, 1978:485\u2013486; Teixeira, 1997:37\u201338, \"Linguistics\"; and Milliken, 1995:24\u201326, \"Linguistic Landscape\".

Note the number of 26,000 includes Salinans</ref> Historians differ widely in their estimates, as they do with the entire [[population of Native California]]. However, modern researchers{{who|date=April 2014}} believe that American anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]'s projection of 7,000&nbsp;Ohlone \"Costanoans\" was much too low. Later researchers such as [[Richard L. Levy|Richard Levy]] estimated \"10,000 or more\" Ohlone.<ref name=\"Levy, 1978:486\"/>\n\nThe highest estimate comes from [[Sherburne F. Cook]], who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the \"Northern Mission Area\". Per Cook, the \"Northern Mission Area\" means \"the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.\" In this model, the Ohlone people's territory was one half of the \"Northern Mission Area\". It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: \"The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.\" We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of \"Northern Mission Area\"), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.<ref>For definition of 'Northern Mission area\", Cook, 1976b:20. For density of populations, Cook, 1976a:187.</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, ''The Population of the California Indians, 1769\u20131970.'' Cook states in part: \"Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"  The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.<ref>For quotation, see Cook, 1976b:200. For population in 1848, see Cook, 1976a:105.</ref>\n\nThe population stabilized after 1900, and as of 2005 there were at least 1,400 on tribal membership rolls.<ref>For tribal membership rolls, Muwekma Ohlone Tribe homepage, 397 members; Amah-Mutsun Band homepage, over 500 members; and Ohlone/Costanoan\u2014Esselen Nation homepage, approximately 500 members.</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{details|Ohlone languages}}\nThe Ohlone language family is commonly called \"Costanoan\", sometimes \"Ohlone\". Ohlone is classified with Miwok under the label [[Utian languages|Utian]]. The controversial [[Penutian languages|Penutian]] language phylum groups the Utian languages with other languages spoken in California, Oregon, and Washington. The most recent work suggests that Ohlone, Miwok, and Yokuts may all be sub-families within a single [[Yok-Utian languages|Yok-Utian]] language family.<ref>Utian and Penutian classification: Levy, 1978:485\u2013486 (citing Kroeber), Callaghan 1997, Golla 2007. Yok-Utian as a taxonomic category: Callaghan 1997, 2001; Golla 2007:76.</ref>\n\nEight dialects or languages of Ohlone have been recorded: [[Awaswas language|Awaswas]], [[Chalon language|Chalon]], [[Chochenyo language|Chochenyo]] (aka Choche\u00f1o), [[Karkin language|Karkin]], [[Mutsun language|Mutsun]], [[Ramaytush language|Ramaytush]], [[Rumsen language|Rumsen]], and [[Tamyen language|Tamyen]].\n\n==Salvaging records==\nThe [[chroniclers]], [[ethnohistorian]]s, and [[ethnolinguist|linguist]]s of the Ohlone population began with: [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by [[John Peabody Harrington|John P. Harrington]] who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and [[Sherburne F. Cook]], to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to [[chronicle]] and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.<ref>Historians and research years, Teixeira, 1997, biographical articles; notably page 34: \"John Peabody Harrington\". Variances in data and interpretation can be noted in main published references Kroeber, Merriam, Harrington, Cook.</ref>\n\nThere was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the ''Editor's Introduction'' to ''Merriam (1979)'', Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam's work) states \"both men disliked A. L. Kroeber.\"  Harrington, independently working for the Smithsonian Institution cornered most of the Ohlone research as his own specialty, was \"not willing to share his findings with Kroeber&nbsp;... Kroeber and his students neglected the Chumash and Costanoans, but this was done because Harrington made it quite clear that he would resent Kroeber's 'muscling in.{{'\"}}<ref>Quotation \"both men disliked Kroeber\" said by Heizer, in \"Editor's Intro\" of Merriam (1979).

These groups, and others with smaller memberships (see groups listed under the heading ''Present Day'' below) are separately petitioning the federal government for [[Federally recognized tribes|tribal recognition]].\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Choris Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone people painted by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\n=== Pre-Contact Lifestyle ===\nThe Ohlone inhabited fixed village locations, moving temporarily to gather seasonal foodstuffs like [[acorn]]s and berries. The Ohlone people lived in Northern California from the northern tip of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] down to northern region of [[Big Sur]], and from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the [[Diablo Range]] in the east. Their vast region included the San Francisco Peninsula, [[Santa Clara Valley]], [[Santa Cruz Mountains]], [[Monterey Bay|Monterey Bay area]], as well as present-day [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]], [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] and the [[Salinas Valley]]. Prior to Spanish contact, the Ohlone formed a complex association of approximately 50&nbsp;different \"nations or tribes\" with about 50 to 500 members each, with an average of 200. Over 50&nbsp;distinct Ohlone tribes and villages have been recorded. The Ohlone villages interacted through trade, intermarriage and ceremonial events, as well as some [[wiktionary:internecine|internecine]] conflict. Cultural arts included [[basket-weaving]] skills, seasonal ceremonial dancing events, female [[tattoo]]s, ear and nose piercings, and other ornamentation.<ref>For habitation region, Kroeber, 1925:462.

These food sources were abundant in earlier times and maintained by careful work, and through active management of all the natural resources at hand.<ref>Controlled burning as harvesting, Brown 1973:3,4,25; Levy 1978:491; Stanger, 1969:94; Bean and Lawton, 1973:11,30,39 (Lewis).

Waterfowl were the most important birds in the people's diet, which were captured with nets and decoys. The Chochenyo traditional narratives refer to ducks as food, and [[Juan Cresp\u00ed]] observed in his journal that geese were stuffed and dried \"to use as decoys in hunting others\".<ref>All the animals, except waterfowl and quail, Teixeira, 1997:2.

In hills where [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] trees were accessible, they built conical houses from redwood bark attached to a frame of wood. Residents of Monterey recall Redwood houses. One of the main village buildings, the [[sweat lodge]] was low into the ground, its walls made of earth and roof of earth and brush. They built [[Balsa (ship)|boats]] of [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tule]] to navigate on the bays propelled by double-bladed paddles.<ref>Tule rush houses, redwood houses and sweat lodges, Teixeira, 1997:2.

In cold weather, they might don animal skin capes or feather capes. Women commonly wore deerskin aprons, [[tule]] skirts, or shredded bark skirts. On cool days, they also wore animal skin capes. Both wore ornamentation of necklaces, shell beads and abalone pendants, and bone wood earrings with shells and beads. The ornamentation often indicated status within their community.<ref>Clothing and ornamentation, Teixeira, 1997:2.</ref>\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nA full list of their [[ethnobotany]] can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/50/ (430 documented plant uses) and http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/51/ (6 documented plant uses).[[File:Ohlone.jpg|thumb|Ohlone dancers drawn by [[Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau]]]]\n\n===Kuksu Religion===\n\nResearchers are sensitive to limitations in historical knowledge, and careful not to place the spiritual and religious beliefs of all Ohlone people into a single unified worldview.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Scolari|first=P.|title=Photographs Link Ohlone Past and Present|journal=News from Native California|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=20\u201321}}</ref> Due to the displacement of Indian people in the Missions between 1769\u20131833, cultural groups are working as ethnographers to discover for themselves their ancestral history, and what that information tells about them as a cultural group.

The Ohlone probably practiced ''[[Kuksu (religion)|Kuksu]]'', a form of [[shamanism]] shared by many Central and Northern California tribes. Although, it is also possible that the Ohlone people learned Kuksu from other tribes while at the missions. Kuksu included elaborate acting and dancing ceremonies in traditional costume, an annual mourning ceremony, puberty [[rites of passage]], intervention with the [[Spirit|spirit world]] and an all-male society that met in subterranean dance rooms.<ref>Bear Shamanism, Kroeber, 1925:472. Observation that Kuksu may have been learned at missions, Kroeber, 1925:470.

However Kroeber observed less \"specialized [[cosmogony]]\" in the Ohlone, which he termed one of the \"southern Kuksu-dancing groups\", in comparison to the [[Maidu]] and groups in the [[Sacramento Valley]]; he noted \"if, as seems probable, the southerly Kuksu tribes (the Miwok, Costanoans, Esselen, and northernmost Yokuts) had no real society in connection with their Kuksu ceremonies.\"<ref>Kroeber, 1925:445.</ref>\n\nThe conditions upon which the Ohlone joined the Spanish missions are subject to debate. Some have argued that they were forced to convert to [[Catholicism]], while others have insisted that forced baptism was not recognized by the Catholic Church. All who have looked into the matter agree, however, that baptized Indians who tried to leave mission communities were forced to return. The first conversions to Catholicism were at Mission San Carlos Borromeo, alias Carmel, in 1771. In the San Francisco Bay area the first baptisms occurred at Mission San Francisco in 1777. Many first-generation Mission Era conversions to Catholicism were debatably incomplete and \"external\".<ref>Costo & Costo, 1987, develop the argument for forced conversion; Sandos, 2004, emphasizes conversion through the attractions of modern technology and music; Milliken, 1995:67, discusses first baptisms and conversions to Catholicism at Mission San Francisco; Bean, 1994:279\u2013281 discusses first-generation conversions to Catholicism as incomplete and external.</ref>\n[[File:Coiffures_du_danse_Choris.jpg|thumb|Watercolor of traditional Ohlone headdresses by [[Louis Choris]]]]\n\nIt is apparent that the pre-contact Ohlone had distinguished medicine persons among their tribe.

These lodges were built near stream banks because water was believed to be capable of great healing. Men and women would gather in the sweat lodges to \"cleanse, purify, and empower themselves\" for a task like hunting and spirit dancing.<ref name=\"Teixiera 1991\" /> Today, there is a place located in Hollister called [[Indian Canyon, California|Indian Canyon]], where a traditional sweat lodge, or Tupentak, has been built for the same ceremonial purposes. Along with the development of the sweat lodge in the early 1990s, the construction of an upen- tah-ruk, or round house/assembly house, was underway as well. These areas are meant to provide a gathering place for tribal meetings, traditional dances and ceremonies, and education activities.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\">{{cite book|last=Sayers|first=Anne|title=In Breath So It Is in Spirit:The Story of Indian Canyon|date=1994|publisher=Ballena|pages=350\u2013355}}</ref> Indian Canyon is an important place because it is open to all Native American groups in the United States and around the world as a place to hold traditional native practices without federal restrictions.

Indian Canyon allows Natives to reclaim their heritage and implement their ancestral beliefs and practices into their lives.<ref name=\"Sayers 1994 350\u2013355\" />\n\n===Sacred narratives and mythology===\n\nThe storytelling of sacred narratives has been an important component of Ohlone indigenous culture for thousands of years, and continues to be of importance today. The narratives often teach specific moral or spiritual lessons, and are illustrative of the cultural, spiritual, and religious beliefs of the tribe. Because not all the Ohlone bands shared a unified identity, and therefore have varying religious and spiritual beliefs, the stories are unique to the tribe. Today, sacred narratives are still an important part of the Ohlone culture. Sadly, only a minimal number of sacred stories have survived Spanish colonization during the 1700s and 1800s due to ethnographic efforts in the Missions. Many Ohlone bands refer to anthropologic records to reconstruct their sacred narratives because some Ohlone people living in the missions acted as \"professional consultants\" for anthropologic research, and therefore told their past stories.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California: Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=47\u201371|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref> The problem with this type of recording is that the stories are not always complete due to translation differences where meaning can be easily misunderstood.\n\nTherefore, many Ohlone bands today feel responsible for re-adopting these narratives and discussing them with cultural representatives and other Ohlone people to decide what their meanings are. This process is important because the Ohlone can further piece together a cultural identity of their past ancestors, and ultimately for themselves as well. Additionally, through knowing sacred narratives and sharing them with the public through live performances or storytelling, the Ohlone people are able to create an awareness that their cultural group is not extinct, but actually surviving and wanting recognition.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ramirez|first=Louise|title=The Ohlone/Costanoan-Esselen Nation of Monterey, California:Dispossession, Federal Neglect, and the Bitter Irony of the Federal Acknowledgment Process|journal=Wicazo Sa Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1353/wic.2003.0015|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nOhlone folklore and legend centered around the Californian [[culture hero]]es of the [[Coyote (mythology)|Coyote]] trickster spirit, as well as Eagle and Hummingbird (and in the Chochenyo region, a falcon-like being named Kaknu).

The Ohlone territory consisted of the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula down to Big Sur in the south. There were more than fifty Ohlone landholding groups prior to the arrival of the Spanish Missionaries. The Ohlone were able to thrive in this area by hunting, fishing, and gathering, in the typical pattern found in California coastal tribes. Each of the Ohlone villages interacted with each other through trade, intermarriage, and ceremonial events, as well as through occasional conflict.<ref>{{cite book|last=Teixeira|first=Lauren|title=Access to information on the Costanoan/Ohlone Indians of the San Francisco and Monterey Bay area: a descriptive guide to research.|date=1991|publisher=Masters Thesis}}</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone culture was relatively stable until the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double-purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans by building a series of [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and of expanding Spanish territorial claims. The Rumsien were the first Ohlone people to be encountered and documented in Spanish records when, in 1602, explorer [[Sebastian Vizca\u00edno]] reached and named the area that is now [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] in December of that year. Despite Vizca\u00edno's positive reports, nothing further happened for more than 160 years. It was not until 1769 that the next Spanish expedition arrived in Monterey, led by [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]]. This time, the [[Spanish missions in California#Military districts|military expedition]] was accompanied by [[Franciscan]] missionaries, whose purpose was to establish a chain of missions to bring Christianity to the native people. Under the leadership of Father [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], the missions introduced Spanish religion and culture to the Ohlone.<ref>For Spanish missionaries and colonization, Teixeira, 1997:3; Fink, 1972:29\u201330.

Under Father Serra's leadership, the Spanish Franciscans erected seven missions inside the Ohlone region and brought most of the Ohlone into these missions to live and work. The missions erected within the Ohlone region were: [[Mission San Carlos Borrom\u00e9o de Carmelo]] (founded in 1770), [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1776), [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] (founded in 1777), [[Mission Santa Cruz]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad]] (founded in 1791), [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] (founded in 1797), and [[Mission San Juan Bautista]] (founded in 1797). The Ohlone who went to live at the missions were called [[Mission Indians]], and also ''[[:wikt:neophyte|neophytes]].'' They were blended with other Native American ethnicities such as the [[Coast Miwok]] transported from the North Bay into the Mission San Francisco and Mission San Jos\u00e9.<ref>Mission name list only; dates from Wikipedia related article.

The Spanish soldiers traditionally escorted the Franciscans on missionary outreach daytrips but declined to camp overnight. For the first twenty years, the missions accepted a few converts at a time, slowly gaining population. Between November 1794 and May 1795, a large wave of Bay Area Native Americans were [[baptism|baptized]] and moved into Mission Santa Clara and Mission San Francisco, including 360 people to Mission Santa Clara and the entire Huichun village populations of the East Bay to Mission San Francisco. In March 1795, this migration was followed almost immediately by the worst-seen epidemic, as well as food shortages, resulting in alarming statistics of death and escapes from the missions. In pursuing the runaways, the Franciscans sent neophytes first and (as a last resort) soldiers to go round up the runaway \"Christians\" from their relatives, and bring them back to the missions. By running to tribes outside of the missions, escapees and those sent to bring them back to the mission spread illness outside of the missions.<ref>For events of 1795\u20131796, Milliken, 1995:129\u2013134 (\"Mass Migration in Winter of 1794\u201395\").

Other causes were a drastic diet change from hunter and gatherer fare to a diet high in carbohydrates and low in vegetables and animal protein, harsh lifestyle changes, and unsanitary living conditions.<ref name=\"Bean 1994\"/>\n\n====Land and property disputes====\n\nUnder Spanish rule, the intent for the future of the mission properties is difficult to ascertain. Property disputes arose over who owned the mission (and adjacent) lands, between the Spanish crown, the Catholic Church, the Natives and the Spanish settlers of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]: There were \"heated debates\" between \"the Spanish State and ecclesiastical bureaucracies\" over the government authority of the missions. Setting the precedent in an interesting petition to the Governor in 1782, the Franciscan priests claimed the \"Missions Indians\" owned both land and cattle, and they represented the Natives in a petition against the San Jose settlers. The fathers mentioned the \"Indians' crops\" were being damaged by the San Jose settlers' livestock and also mentioned settlers \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission.\"  They also stated the Mission Indians had property and rights to defend it: \"Indians are at liberty to slaughter such (San Jose pueblo) livestock as trespass unto their lands.\" \"By law\", the mission property was to pass to the Mission Indians after a period of about ten years, when they would become Spanish citizens. In the interim period, the Franciscans were mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Natives.<ref>For \"heated debates\" between church and state, Milliken, 1995:2n. For petition of 1782, Indians vs. settlers of San Jose, with quotations, see Milliken, 1995:72\u201373 (quoting Murguia and Pena [1782] 1955:400).

At this point, the Ohlone were supposed to receive land grants and property rights, but few did and most of the mission lands went to the secular administrators. In the end, even attempts by mission leaders to restore native lands were in vain. Before this time, 73 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]], but with the new r\u00e9gime most lands were turned into Mexican-owned rancherias. The Ohlone became the laborers and ''vaqueros'' (cowboys) of Mexican-owned rancherias.<ref>Fink, 1972:64: \"Land grants were scarce; In 1830 only 50 private ranches were held in Alta California, of which 7 were in the Monterey region.\" For number of land grants, see Cowan 1956:139\u2013140. For Mission secularizarion to rancherias, Teixeira, 1997:3; Bean, 1994:234; Fink, 1972:63.</ref>\n\n===Survival===\n[[File:Isabel Meadows.jpg|thumb|[[Isabel Meadows]], considered the last fluent speaker of an Ohlone language]]\nThe Ohlone eventually regathered in multi-ethnic rancherias, along with other Mission Indians from families that spoke the [[Coast Miwok]], [[Bay Miwok]], [[Plains Miwok]], [[Patwin]], [[Yokuts]], and [[Esselen]] languages. Many of the Ohlone that had survived the experience at Mission San Jose went to work at ''Alisal Rancheria'' in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], and ''El Molino'' in [[Niles, California|Niles]]. Communities of mission survivors also formed in [[Sunol, California|Sunol]], Monterey and [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]. In the 1840s a wave of United States settlers encroached into the area, and California became annexed to the United States. The new settlers brought in new diseases to the Ohlone.<ref>Teixeira, 1997:3\u20134, \"Historical Overview\".</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone lost the vast majority of their population between 1780 and 1850, because of an abysmal birth rate, high infant mortality rate, diseases and social upheaval associated with European immigration into California. By all estimates, the Ohlone were reduced to less than ten percent of their original pre-mission era population. By 1852 the Ohlone population had shrunk to about 864\u20131,000, and was continuing to decline. By the early 1880s, the northern Ohlone were virtually extinct, and the southern Ohlone people were severely impacted and largely displaced from their communal land grant in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]]. To call attention to the plight of the California Indians, Indian Agent, reformer, and popular novelist [[Helen Hunt Jackson]] published accounts of her travels among the Mission Indians of California in 1883.<ref>For population estimates, Cook, 1976a:183, 236\u2013245.

Before the Spanish invasion, the Muwekma Ohlone had an estimated 500 shellmounds lining the sea and shores of the San Francisco Bay. Shellmounds are essentially Ohlone habitation sites where peopled lived and died and often buried. The mounds consist predominately of molluscan shells, with lesser amounts mammal and fish bone, vegetal materials and other organic material deposited by the Ohlone for thousands of years. These shellmounds are the direct result of village life. Archaeologists have examined the mounds and often refer to them as \"middens,\" or \"kitchen midden\" meaning an accumulation of refuse. \n\nOne theory is that the massive amount of shellfish remains represent Ohlone ritual behavior, whereas they would spend months mourning their dead and feasting on large amounts of shellfish which were disposed of ever growing the girth and height of the mound.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartier|first=Robert|title=Santa Cruz County History - Spanish Period & Earlier.}}</ref>{{fact|date=May 2019}} Shellmounds were once found all over the San Francisco Bay area near marshlands, creeks, wetlands, and rivers. San Bruno Mountain is home to the nation's largest intact shellmound. These mounds are also thought to have served a practical purpose as well, since these shellmounds were usually near waterways or the ocean, they protected the village from high tide as well as to provide high ground for line of sight navigation for watercraft on San Francisco Bay.<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=Unacknowledged Tribes, Dangerous Knowledge: The Muwekma Ohlone and How Indian Identities Are \"Known\".|date=2003}}</ref> The [[Emeryville Shellmound]] is a site standing at over 60 feet (18 m) tall and 350 feet (105 m) in diameter, and was believed to be occupied between 400 and 2800 years ago.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe Ohlone burial practices changed over time with cremation being preferred before the arrival of the Spanish. Once the cremation was complete the loved ones and friends would place ornaments as well as other valuables as an offering to the dead. Ohlone believed that this would give them good fortune in the afterlife. Many of these artifacts have been found in and around the shellmounds. They often include a wide variety of shell beads and ornaments as well as frequently used everyday items such as stone and bone tools. These burials also showcase genealogies and territorial rights. The mounds were seen as a cultural statement because the villages on top were clearly visible and their sacred aura was very dominant.<ref>{{cite book|last=Heizer|first=Robert|title=The California Indians; a Source Book|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaindia00heiz|url-access=registration|date=1971|location=Berkeley: University of California.}}</ref>\n\n===Present day burial and sacred sites===\n\n'''Glen Cove'''\n\nOhlone tribes have protested in Vallejo, California and insist that Glen Cove, a sacred site for many Natives, is one of the last native village sites in the San Francisco Bay that has escaped urban development.

Natives today are engaging in extensive cultural research to bring back knowledge, narratives, beliefs, and practices of the post-contact days with the Spanish. The Spanish eradicated and stripped the Ohlones of their cultural heritage by causing the death of ninety percent of the population, and forcing cultural assimilation with military fortification and Catholic reform. After the arrival of the Americans, many land grants were contested in court.  Preserving their burial sites is a way to gain acknowledgment as a cultural group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Margolin|first=Malcolm|title=The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area.|url=https://archive.org/details/ohlonewayindianl00marg_0|url-access=registration|date=1978|publisher=Heyday|location=Berkeley}}</ref>\n\n'''Site CA-SCL-732- Kaphan Umux or Three Wolves Site'''\n\nThe Muwekma Ohlone tribe are active participants in the revival of Ohlone people across the East and South Bay. Key to their success is in their involvement in unearthing and analyzing their ancestral remains in ancient burial sites, which allows them to \"recapture their history and to reconstruct the present and future of their people\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=\"What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> Due to Spanish colonization in the 1700s so much cultural history, knowledge, and identity was lost due to death and forced assimilation of so many natives. Only some sacred cultural narratives survive through the recording of stories told from various Ohlone elders living in the missions between 1769\u20131833. This makes analyzing pre-contact Ohlone sites so difficult because so much of the symbolism and ritual are unknown. Therefore, the Muwekma see their participation in archeological projects as a way to bring tribal members together as a unified community, and as a way to reestablish the link between the Ohlone people today and their pre-contact ancestors through their ability to analyze remains and be coauthors in the archeological reports.<ref name=\"Field 2003\">{{cite book|last=Field|first=Les|title=What Must It Have Been Like!\": Critical Considerations of Precontact Ohlone Cosmology as Interpreted through Central California Ethnohistory.|date=2003|publisher=Wicazo Sa Review}}</ref> One major archeological site the Muwekma tribe actively helped excavate, is the burial site CA-SCL-732 in San Jose, dating between 1500-2700 BCE. In this burial site, excavated in 1992, the remains of three ritually buried wolves were found among human remains.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> In other grave site, the skeletal remains of two more wolves were found with \"braided, uncured yucca or soap root fiber cordage around their necks\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/> There were many other fragments of remains of animals like deer, squirrel, mountain lion, grizzly bear, fox, badger, blue goose, and elk found as well. From the excavations it is clear that the animals were ritually buried, along with beads and other ornamentations.<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\nAlthough the truth may not be known about exactly what these findings mean, the Muwekma and the archeological team analyzed the ritual burial of the animal remains as a way to learn what they may tell about the Ohlone cosmology and cultural system before pre-contact influence. One way the team did this was utilizing known narratives of the Ohlone, as ascribed by previous ethnographers who recorded the sacred narratives of various Ohlone elders in the missions across the Bay, well as the narratives telling of other central California cosmologies to make references about what the meaning of the possible kinship between the animals and the Ohlone in these burials were. Together the archeological team made three hypotheses: animals served as \"moieties, clans, lineages, families, and so on,\" animals were \"dream helpers,\" or personal spirit allies for individuals, and lastly, the animals were representations of \"sacred deity-like figures\".<ref name=\"Field 2003\"/>\n\n===Indian People Organizing for Change===\nIndian People Organizing for Change (IPOC) is a community-based organization in the San Francisco Bay Area. Its members, including Ohlone tribal members and conservation activists, work together in order to accomplish social and environmental justice within the Bay Area American Indian community. Current projects include the preservation of Bay Area shellmounds, which are the sacred burial sites of the Ohlone Nation, whose homeland is the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, IPOC has spread awareness throughout the community through shellmounds walks and has advocated for the preservation of sacred burial sites in the Emeryville Mall, Glen Cove Site, Hunters Point in San Francisco, just to name a few.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gould|first=Corrina|title=\"Indian People Organizing for Change.\" Indian People Organizing for Change.|url=http://ipocshellmoundwalk.homestead.com/}}</ref>\n\n==== Sogorea Te Land Trust ====\n{{Main|Sogorea Te Land Trust}}\nThe Sogorea Te Land Trust is a [[land trust]] founded by members of IPOC in 2012 with the goals of returning traditionally [[Chochenyo]] and [[Karkin]] lands in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] stewardship and cultivating more active, reciprocal relationships with the land.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Indigenous-women-lead-effort-to-reclaim-ancestral-12384730.php|title=Indigenous women lead effort to reclaim ancestral lands|last=Kost|first=Ryan|date=28 November 2017|work=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref> It has also started a project called the Shuumi Land Tax, which asks that non-indigenous people living on Ohlone land to pay dues for the land that they live on.<ref name=\":0\" /> The tax has no legal ramifications and no connection with the United States government or [[Internal Revenue Service]], but the organization prefers this term (as opposed to merely calling contributions [[Donation|donations]]) as it asserts indigenous [[sovereignty]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.kalw.org/post/native-americans-ask-east-bay-residents-pay-tax-land#stream/0|title=Native Americans ask East Bay residents to pay 'tax' on land|last=Dalmas|first=Jeremy|date=16 April 2018|website=KALW Local Public Radio 91.7 San Francisco|access-date=30 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nCostanoan is an externally applied name ([[exonym]]). The Spanish explorers and settlers referred to the native groups of this region collectively as the ''Coste\u00f1os'' (the \"coastal people\") circa 1769. Over time, the English-speaking settlers arriving later [[Anglicized]] the word ''Coste\u00f1os'' into the name of ''Costanoans.'' (The suffix \"-an\" is English). For many years, the people were called the Costanoans in English language and records.<ref name=\"Teix-pg4\">Teixeira, 1997:4, \"The Term 'Costanoan/Ohlone'\".</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s, the name of Ohlone has been used by some of the members and the popular media to replace the name ''Costanoan.'' ''Ohlone'' might have originally derived from a Spanish rancho called ''Oljon'', and referred to a single band who inhabited the Pacific Coast near [[Pescadero, California|Pescadero]] Creek. The name ''Ohlone'' was traced by Teixeira through the mission records of Mission San Francisco, Bancroft's ''Native Races'', and Frederick Beechey's Journal regarding a visit to the Bay Area in 1826\u201327. ''Oljone'', ''Olchones'' and ''Alchones'' are spelling variations of ''Ohlone'' found in Mission San Francisco records. However, because of its tribal origin, Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people, and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the ''Muwekma''. Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960, which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek. Teixeira states in part: \"A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast.\" Milliken states the name came from: \"A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast\".<!--CITATIONS:--><ref>Opinions and quotations, Teixeira 1997:4; Milliken, 1995:249.</ref>\n\n==Divisions==\n{{See also|List of Ohlone villages}}\nLinguists identified eight regional, linguistic divisions or subgroups of the Ohlone, listed below from north to south:<ref>Levy, 1978:485\u2013486; Teixeira, 1997:37\u201338, \"Linguistics\"; and Milliken, 1995:24\u201326, \"Linguistic Landscape\".

However, modern researchers{{who|date=April 2014}} believe that American anthropologist [[Alfred L. Kroeber]]'s projection of 7,000&nbsp;Ohlone \"Costanoans\" was much too low. Later researchers such as [[Richard L. Levy|Richard Levy]] estimated \"10,000 or more\" Ohlone.<ref name=\"Levy, 1978:486\"/>\n\nThe highest estimate comes from [[Sherburne F. Cook]], who in later life concluded there were 26,000 Ohlone and Salinans in the \"Northern Mission Area\". Per Cook, the \"Northern Mission Area\" means \"the region inhabited by the Costanoans and Salinans between San Francisco Bay and the headwaters of the Salinas River. To this may be added for convenience the local area under the jurisdiction of the San Luis Obispo even though there is an infringement of the Chumash.\" In this model, the Ohlone people's territory was one half of the \"Northern Mission Area\". It was however known to be more densely populated than the southern Salinan territory, per Cook: \"The Costanoan density was nearly 1.8 persons per square mile with the maximum in the Bay region. The Esselen was approximately 1.3, the Salinan must have been still lower.\" We can estimate that Cook meant about 18,200 Ohlone based on his own statements (70% of \"Northern Mission Area\"), plus or minus a few thousand margin for error, but he does not give an exact number.<ref>For definition of 'Northern Mission area\", Cook, 1976b:20. For density of populations, Cook, 1976a:187.</ref>\n\nThe Ohlone population after contact in 1769 with the Spaniards spiralled downwards. Cook describes rapidly declining indigenous populations in California between 1769 and 1900, in his posthumously published book, ''The Population of the California Indians, 1769\u20131970.'' Cook states in part: \"Not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"  The population had dropped to about 10% of its original numbers by 1848.<ref>For quotation, see Cook, 1976b:200. For population in 1848, see Cook, 1976a:105.</ref>\n\nThe population stabilized after 1900, and as of 2005 there were at least 1,400 on tribal membership rolls.<ref>For tribal membership rolls, Muwekma Ohlone Tribe homepage, 397 members; Amah-Mutsun Band homepage, over 500 members; and Ohlone/Costanoan\u2014Esselen Nation homepage, approximately 500 members.</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{details|Ohlone languages}}\nThe Ohlone language family is commonly called \"Costanoan\", sometimes \"Ohlone\".

Kroeber]] who researched the California natives and authored a few publications on the Ohlone from 1904 to 1910, and [[Clinton Hart Merriam|C. Hart Merriam]] who researched the Ohlone in detail from 1902 to 1929. This was followed by [[John Peabody Harrington|John P. Harrington]] who researched the Ohlone languages from 1921 to 1939, and other aspects of Ohlone culture, leaving volumes of field notes at his death. Other research was added by Robert Cartier, Madison S. Beeler, and [[Sherburne F. Cook]], to name a few. In many cases, the Ohlone names they used vary in spelling, translation and tribal boundaries, depending on the source. Each tried to [[chronicle]] and interpret this complex society and language(s) before the pieces vanished.<ref>Historians and research years, Teixeira, 1997, biographical articles; notably page 34: \"John Peabody Harrington\". Variances in data and interpretation can be noted in main published references Kroeber, Merriam, Harrington, Cook.</ref>\n\nThere was noticeable competition and some disagreement between the first scholars: Both Merriam and Harrington produced much in-depth Ohlone research in the shadow of the highly published Kroeber and competed in print with him. In the ''Editor's Introduction'' to ''Merriam (1979)'', Robert F. Heizer (as the protege of Kroeber and also the curator of Merriam's work) states \"both men disliked A. L.
