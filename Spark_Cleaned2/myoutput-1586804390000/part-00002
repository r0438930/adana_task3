Having perfected and tested the formula, he sends out messenger bats to summon all monsters to the Isle of Evil in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The Baron intends to inform them of his discovery and also to reveal his imminent retirement as head of the \"Worldwide Organization of Monsters\". Besides [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster]] (sometimes referred to as \"Fang\") and the [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|Monster's more intelligent mate]] (voiced by [[Phyllis Diller]]) who live in the isle's castle with Boris, the invites also include [[Count Dracula]], the [[Mummy (undead)|Mummy]], [[Quasimodo]] (referred to as \"[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]\"), the [[Werewolf]], [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|The Invisible Man]], [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and the [[Gill-man|Creature from the Black Lagoon]] (referred to as just \"The Creature\").\n\nThe Baron's beautiful assistant Francesca (voiced by [[Gale Garnett]]) enters the lab to confirm that all invitations have been delivered and inquires about one of the addressees named Felix Flanken (voiced by [[Allen Swift]] impersonating [[James Stewart]]). Frankenstein explains that Flanken is his nephew and successor in the monster business. This displeases Francesca, who covets the role for herself. Francesca even asks why there was not an invitation for \"It\". Boris replies that \"It\" was not invited since \"It\" can be a crushing bore, explaining that \"It\" even crushed the island's [[wild boar]]s in his bare hands the last time \"It\" was invited.\n\nFrankenstein has his zombie butler, Yetch (Swift impersonating [[Peter Lorre]]), Chef Mafia Machiavelli, and the zombie bellhops and servants make preparations for the upcoming party while having some zombies patrol the Isle of Evil to make sure that \"It\" does not show up uninvited. The monsters begin to arrive on the freighter that Felix is also traveling on.\n\nHowever, when Felix proves to be an incompetent, asthmatic (and unsuitably kind-hearted) human, the monsters plot to eliminate him and gain control of the secret formula. Over time, Francesca develops feelings for Felix after he unknowingly saves her multiple times. As Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Monster's Mate descend upon Francesca, she sends out a letter (via messenger bat) to an unknown recipient. When the monsters corner Felix upon capturing Francesca, they are frightened at the arrival of \"It\" (revealed to be a giant [[gorilla]] and a take-off of [[King Kong]]) who proceeds to go on a rampage since he was not invited. \"It\" snatches up the monsters and Francesca (on whom \"It\" develops a crush).\n\nFelix rushes off to tell his Uncle Boris what happened and is instructed to head to the boat. Boris leads the zombies in rescuing Francesca from \"It\" using biplanes. Boris convinces \"It\" to let Francesca go and to take him instead. \"It\" complies, releasing Francesca. Felix and Francesca manage to get off the island as Boris and the remainder of the monsters remain in the clutches of \"It\". Displeased that the monsters tried to steal the secret of total destruction for themselves and attempted to kill Felix as well as having to put up with \"It\", Boris sacrifices his life by dropping the vial containing the formula, destroying the Isle of Evil and everything on it.\n\nThe destruction is witnessed offshore by Felix and Francesca. Francesca tearfully admits to Felix that she is not human, but is in fact a robot creation of Boris von Frankenstein. Felix answers that \"none of us are perfect\" where he then mechanically repeats the words \"are perfect\", indicating that he has also been a robot creation of his uncle the entire time.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Victor Frankenstein|Baron Boris von Frankenstein]]\n* [[Allen Swift|Alan Swift]] as Felix Flanken\n** Swift also provided the voice of primary characters: [[Count Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein's Monster \"Fang\"]], [[Werewolf]], [[Quasimodo|Hunchback of Notre-Dame]], [[Griffin (The Invisible Man)|Invisible Man]], [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and [[King Kong|\"It\"]], in addition to supporting characters: Yetch, Skeleton, Chef Mafia Machiavelli, Mr. Kronkite, Freighter Captain, First Mate, and the Mailman.\n* [[Gale Garnett]] as Francesca\n* [[Phyllis Diller]] as [[Bride of Frankenstein (character)|the Monster's mate / Bride of Frankenstein]]\n* [[Ethel Ennis]] as Title Song Singer\n\n==Crew==\n* Directed by [[Jules Bass]]\n* Produced by [[Arthur Rankin Jr.]]\n* Executive Producer: [[Joseph E.

The process involved photographing figurines a frame at a time, then re-positioning them, exposing another frame, and so forth.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In addition to Mochinaga, along with assistant director Kizo Nagashima, many other \"Animagic\" technicians of MOM (re-established as Video Tokyo Production after Mochinaga left for China) including puppet makers Ichiro Komuro and Kyoko Kita, and assistant animators Hiroshi Tabata and Fumiko Magari{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} also worked on the film for Rankin/Bass, but are uncredited.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Known as stop-motion animation, it was the same approach used in [[RKO Pictures|RKO]]'s ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', [[Art Clokey]]'s ''[[Gumby]]'' and ''[[Davey and Goliath]]'', and many other films, commercials and TV specials. In partnership with MOM and [[Dentsu]], Rankin/Bass had created several \"Animagic\" productions, including the syndicated television series ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', the enormously successful Christmas television special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' and their first full-length film ''[[Willy McBean and his Magic Machine]]''. Classic monster films were enjoying a resurgence in popularity in the late 1960s, along with more comedy-centered examples, ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]'' and ''[[The Munsters]]''. This [[camp (style)|campy]] film is a spoof of horror themes, complete with [[musical film|musical numbers]] and [[in-joke|inside jokes]].\n\n''[[Mad Magazine]]'' creator [[Harvey Kurtzman]] penned the script (with writer Len Korobkin) and ''Mad'' artist [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] designed many of the characters. Davis was a natural for the job, being famous both for his humor work and his monster stories in the pages of [[EC Comics]]. It has long been rumored that [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] had a hand in the script, but while the dialogue is rife with ''[[Famous Monsters of Filmland]]''-like puns, Ackerman's involvement has never been confirmed and his name never appeared in the on-screen credits or in original promotion for the film at the time of its release. In fact, Rankin/Bass historian Rick Goldschmidt, in liner notes accompanying the Anchor Bay DVD release, denied Ackerman was ever involved, at the same time as the DVD packaging promoted Ackerman's name. Goldschmidt repeated his claims on this in a 2006 blog entry, based on his interviews with Korobkin, who claimed to have written the original screenplay, which then was revised by Kurtzman, but never worked with Ackerman.<ref>Rick Goldschmidt's Blogspot site.

Retrieved December 11, 2008.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the famous monsters seen in the film, ''Mad Monster Party?'' also features several celebrity likenesses. Karloff and Diller's characters are both designed to look like the actors portraying them, while Baron Frankenstein's lackey, Yetch, is a physical and vocal caricature of [[Peter Lorre]]. Swift also performs impersonations when voicing his characters, such as [[James Stewart]] when voicing Felix, [[Sydney Greenstreet]] as the Invisible Man and [[Charles Laughton]] as the Freighter Captain.\n\n''Mad Monster Party?'' was one of several family-friendly projects Karloff lent his voice to in his final years (including the [[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|1966 television adaptation]] of ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]''). It was his final involvement in a production connected to the Frankenstein mythos that had propelled him to stardom some three decades earlier.\n\n==Music==\n[[Image:Mad Monster Party cd cover.jpg|thumb|right|175px|CD cover]]\nAlthough the opening credits identify [[Ethel Ennis]] as singing the opening theme song and, in the same frame, a soundtrack being available on [[RCA Victor]], a commercially released soundtrack was never produced in any format. In September 1998, Percepto released a CD of the soundtrack for the film. \"The Mummy\" is allegedly performed by [[Dyke and the Blazers]].

Currently, [[Lionsgate]] distributes the film on video under license from StudioCanal.\n\nBefore Lionsgate's current video release of ''Mad Monster Party?'', almost all video releases have been from 16&nbsp;mm film and were of very poor color quality. The original film negative was water-damaged some years ago, but  [[Sony Pictures Television]] (which now holds the television rights) eventually unearthed an original 35&nbsp;mm pristine print. This print was digitally remastered, and is the source for the current DVD issue and all subsequent television showings. Anchor Bay released the previous DVD on August 19, 2003, then re-released it on August 23, 2005 with additional features. On September 8, 2009, it was released as a \"Special Edition\" DVD by Lionsgate. The special features include a documentary including interviews with Rick Goldschmidt, Arthur Rankin Jr., voice artist Allen Swift, storyboard artist Don Duga, musical director Maury Laws and others. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 4, 2012.\n\n===Comic book adaptation===\n* [[Dell Comics|Dell]] Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party'' (September 1967)<ref>{{gcdb series|id=74202|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party''}}</ref><ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=231995|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party''}}</ref>\n\n==Related film==\nRankin/Bass produced a \"[[prequel]] of sorts\": a TV special called ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters|Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters]]'' from ''[[The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie]]'' series, which aired on September 23, 1972. This Halloween special featured many of the same monster characters. [[Bob McFadden]] did his imitation of Karloff when voicing Baron Henry von Frankenstein (who resembles Baron Boris von Frankenstein). The animation for the special is provided by [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s [[Mushi Production]] with supervision by Steve Nakagawa, who was also known for his work with [[Iwao Takamoto]] at [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Studios]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Boris Karloff filmography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0061931}}\n* {{bcdb title|20506}}\n* {{allrovi movie|30662}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|mad_monster_party}}\n* [http://www.madmonsterparty.com ''Mad Monster Party'' unofficial site]\n* [http://www.rankinbass.com/mmphome.html Rankin-Bass ''Mad Monster Party'' site]\n\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{Rankin-Bass}}\n{{Dracula}}\n{{Frankenstein}}\n{{The Wolf Man}}\n{{The Mummy}}\n{{The Invisible Man}}\n{{Gill-man}}\n{{Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde}}\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n{{KingKong}}\n{{Universal Monsters}}\n{{Harvey Kurtzman navbox}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mad Monster Party}}\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1967 animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Crossover films]]\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Films set on islands]]\n[[Category:Frankenstein films]]\n[[Category:1960s monster movies]]\n[[Category:Mummy films]]\n[[Category:1960s stop-motion animated films]]\n[[Category:Werewolves in film]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Maury Laws]]\n[[Category:Television programs directed by Jules Bass]]\n[[Category:Rankin/Bass Productions films]]\n[[Category:American musical films]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n[[Category:Vampires in animated film]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1967 film}}\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Mad Monster Party?\n| image          = POSTER - MAD MONSTER PARTY.jpg\n| alt            = \n| caption        = Theatrical release poster by [[Frank Frazetta]]\n| director       = [[Jules Bass]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/473649/Mad-Monster-Party/credits|title=Mad Monster Party (1968)|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}</ref>\n| producer       = [[Arthur Rankin Jr.]]\n| screenplay     = {{plainlist|\n* Len Korobkin\n* [[Harvey Kurtzman]]\n}}\n| story          = Arthur Rankin Jr.\n| starring       = {{plainlist|<!--Per poster billing-->\n* [[Boris Karloff]]\n* [[Phyllis Diller]]\n* [[Ethel Ennis]]\n* [[Gale Garnett]]\n}}\n| music          = {{plainlist|\n* [[Maury Laws]]\n* Jules Bass\n}}\n| cinematography = [[Tadahito Mochinaga]]\n| studio         = [[Rankin/Bass Productions]]<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=980DEFDC1E30EE3BBC4053DFB5668382679EDE|title=Mad Monster Party (1968)|last=Thompson|first=Howard|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 9, 1969|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}</ref>\n| distributor    = [[Embassy Pictures]]\n| released       = {{Film date|1967|3|8|United States}}\n| runtime        = 95 minutes\n| country        = United States<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/473649/Mad-Monster-Party/overview|title=Mad Monster Party (1968)|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 24, 2015}}</ref>\n| language       = English\n}}\n'''''Mad Monster Party?''''' is a 1967 American [[stop motion|stop-motion]] [[Animation|animated]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film]] produced by [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] for [[Embassy Pictures]].<ref name=\"karloff\">Stephen Jacobs, ''Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster'', Tomohawk Press 2011 p 474-475</ref> The film stars [[Boris Karloff]], [[Allen Swift]], [[Gale Garnett]], and [[Phyllis Diller]].

Tracks without performer credits are instrumentals and contain no dialogue.\n\n# \"The Baron\"\n# \"Mad Monster Party\"&nbsp;\u2013 [[Ethel Ennis]]\n# \"Waltz for a Witch\"\n# \"Cocktails\"\n# \"The Bash\"\n# \"You're Different\"&nbsp;\u2013 The Monster's Mate (Phyllis Diller)\n# \"Jungle Madness\"\n# \"Our Time to Shine\"&nbsp;\u2013 Francesca (Gale Garnett)\n# \"Mad Monster Party\"\n# \"The Mummy\"&nbsp;\u2013 Little Tibia and the Fibias\n# \"One Step Ahead\"&nbsp;\u2013 Baron von Frankenstein and Company (Boris Karloff and Company)\n# \"The Baron Into Battle/Transylvania, All Hail/Pursuit/Requiem for a Loser\"\n# \"Never Was a Love Like Mine\"&nbsp;\u2013 Francesca (Gale Garnett)\n# \"Finale\"\n\n==Reception==\nThe film holds a 70% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on ten reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mad_monster_party/ |title=Mad Monster Party (1967) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref> Howard Thompson of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that \"this party should make everybody chuckle\".<ref name=nyt/>\n\n==Home media==\nThe film has been available on video for years, first on original distributor [[Embassy Pictures]]' home entertainment unit, and then on other independent labels before [[StudioCanal]] acquired some rights to the film. Currently, [[Lionsgate]] distributes the film on video under license from StudioCanal.\n\nBefore Lionsgate's current video release of ''Mad Monster Party?'', almost all video releases have been from 16&nbsp;mm film and were of very poor color quality. The original film negative was water-damaged some years ago, but  [[Sony Pictures Television]] (which now holds the television rights) eventually unearthed an original 35&nbsp;mm pristine print. This print was digitally remastered, and is the source for the current DVD issue and all subsequent television showings. Anchor Bay released the previous DVD on August 19, 2003, then re-released it on August 23, 2005 with additional features. On September 8, 2009, it was released as a \"Special Edition\" DVD by Lionsgate. The special features include a documentary including interviews with Rick Goldschmidt, Arthur Rankin Jr., voice artist Allen Swift, storyboard artist Don Duga, musical director Maury Laws and others. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 4, 2012.\n\n===Comic book adaptation===\n* [[Dell Comics|Dell]] Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party'' (September 1967)<ref>{{gcdb series|id=74202|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party''}}</ref><ref>{{comicbookdb|type=issue|id=231995|title=Dell Movie Classic: ''Mad Monster Party''}}</ref>\n\n==Related film==\nRankin/Bass produced a \"[[prequel]] of sorts\": a TV special called ''[[Mad Mad Mad Monsters|Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters]]'' from ''[[The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie]]'' series, which aired on September 23, 1972. This Halloween special featured many of the same monster characters. [[Bob McFadden]] did his imitation of Karloff when voicing Baron Henry von Frankenstein (who resembles Baron Boris von Frankenstein). The animation for the special is provided by [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s [[Mushi Production]] with supervision by Steve Nakagawa, who was also known for his work with [[Iwao Takamoto]] at [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Studios]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Boris Karloff filmography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0061931}}\n* {{bcdb title|20506}}\n* {{allrovi movie|30662}}\n* {{rotten-tomatoes|mad_monster_party}}\n* [http://www.madmonsterparty.com ''Mad Monster Party'' unofficial site]\n* [http://www.rankinbass.com/mmphome.html Rankin-Bass ''Mad Monster Party'' site]\n\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{Rankin-Bass}}\n{{Dracula}}\n{{Frankenstein}}\n{{The Wolf Man}}\n{{The Mummy}}\n{{The Invisible Man}}\n{{Gill-man}}\n{{Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde}}\n{{The Hunchback of Notre Dame}}\n{{KingKong}}\n{{Universal Monsters}}\n{{Harvey Kurtzman navbox}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mad Monster Party}}\n[[Category:1967 films]]\n[[Category:1967 animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1960s musical comedy films]]\n[[Category:1960s science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American animated fantasy films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Crossover films]]\n[[Category:Dracula films]]\n[[Category:Films set in the Caribbean]]\n[[Category:Films set on islands]]\n[[Category:Frankenstein films]]\n[[Category:1960s monster movies]]\n[[Category:Mummy films]]\n[[Category:1960s stop-motion animated films]]\n[[Category:Werewolves in film]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Maury Laws]]\n[[Category:Television programs directed by Jules Bass]]\n[[Category:Rankin/Bass Productions films]]\n[[Category:American musical films]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Vampire comedy films]]\n[[Category:Vampires in animated film]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Monster_Party%3F"}
