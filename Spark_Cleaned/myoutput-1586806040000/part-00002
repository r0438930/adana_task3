He is currently the [[head coach]] of [[Sporting Kansas City]] in [[Major League Soccer]]. As of 2018, Vermes is currently the longest tenured head coach in MLS and has won four major trophies as a manager, the second most of all active coaches in [[MLS]].\n\nAs a player, Vermes spent several seasons playing in Hungary, the Netherlands, before establishing himself as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] in [[Major League Soccer]], playing for [[MetroStars]], [[Colorado Rapids]] and the [[Kansas City Wizards]].\nVermes was also a regular member of the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] throughout the 1990s, and represented his country at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]], the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].\n\nOn April 4, 2013, Vermes was elected to the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite news|title=Delran native Peter Vermes elected to U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/soccer/Delran_native_Peter_Vermes_elected_to_US_Soccer_Hall_of_Fame.html|accessdate=April 4, 2013|newspaper=The Inquirer|date=April 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===High school and college===\nVermes was born in [[Willingboro Township, New Jersey|Willingboro, New Jersey]]. He grew up in [[Delran Township, New Jersey]] and played high school soccer at [[Delran High School]].  He graduated in 1984, having scored 109 goals. In 1999, he was named by ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s.<ref>Jandoli, Ron. [https://web.archive.org/web/20030110132039/http://nj.com/hssports/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fhssports%2Fcentury%2Fstories%2Fbsoccerdecades.html \"The Century's Best \u2013 Boys Soccer: Top 10 Players of each decade\"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', November 7, 1999, backed up by the [[Internet Archive]] as of January 10, 2003. Accessed September 11, 2008.</ref>\n\nVermes played his first year in college on the [[Loyola Greyhounds men's soccer|men's soccer team]] at [[Loyola College in Maryland]] under head coach Bill Sento. Vermes then transferred and played three years of [[college soccer]] at [[Rutgers University]], from 1985 to 1987.  In his final season, Vermes scored 21 goals and 10 assists for the team, finishing a first team [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|All-American]], as well as runner-up for the National Player of the Year Award.  During that season, Vermes led Rutgers to their first victory in the NCAA Tournament in 26 years, scoring the winning goal in a contest against [[Seton Hall University]].\n\n===Professional===\nAfter graduating, Vermes would go to Europe, where he played with [[Gy\u0151ri ETO FC|R\u00e1ba ETO FC]] of Hungary in 1989 and [[FC Volendam|Volendam]] of the Dutch [[Eredivisie]] in 1990.  In May 1991, Vermes returned to the United States and played three games, scoring a single goal against with the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u20131993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] of the [[American Professional Soccer League]].  He then moved to Spain where he played for [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|Second Division]] club [[UE Figueres|Figueres]] from 1991\u20131995.\n\nLike many American players, Vermes returned to the United States to join the recently founded domestic league [[Major League Soccer]]. In January 1995, he signed with the new league that would not begin league play until 1996.  Therefore, MLS loaned Vermes to the [[New York Centaurs|New York Fever]] of the [[USL Second Division|USISL]] where he played 25 games, scoring 16 goals in the 1995 season.  In 1996, Vermes was drafted by the [[MetroStars|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]] in the third round of the [[MLS Inaugural Draft]] (29th overall) and captained the team in its first season.  Although he played the most minutes of any MetroStar that year, the MetroStars traded Vermes on February 3, 1997 to the [[Colorado Rapids]] for [[Kerry Zavagnin]].  Vermes would play three years for the Rapids before being traded again, this time to the [[Kansas City Wizards]] with [[Matt McKeon]] for Scott Vermillion and a player [[allocation (MLS)|allocation]].\n\nWith the Wizards, Vermes helped the Wizards finish the season first in the league with a 16\u20137\u20139 record, having allowed only 29 goals in 32 games, and eventually winning the [[MLS Cup]].  Vermes was recognized as the [[MLS Defender of the Year Award|MLS Defender of the Year]], while his teammate [[Tony Meola]] won both the [[MLS Goalkeeper of the Year]] and [[MLS MVP]] awards.  Vermes played two more seasons with the Wizards, struggling with injuries but playing every game he was healthy for, before announcing his retirement at the end of the 2002 season.\n\n===International===\nVermes received his first cap May 14, 1988 against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], and would in all receive 66 caps for the team, playing in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. In the 1990 World Cup, he nearly bagged a goal against Italy with a shot against Italian goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]]. After seeing his playing time wane with the team in late 1993 and early 1994, Vermes was one of the final cuts from the 1994 U.S. World Cup team.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-28/sports/sp-51473_1_peter-vermes \"Vermes Cut by U.S. Team,\" Los Angeles Times, April 28, 1994.]</ref> He later said he thought that his outspoken comments had doomed him politically.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-11/sports/sp-56307_1_world-cup \"Stunned Armstrong Released by U.S. Team : World Cup: Veteran defender thought he was competing for a starting job before being cut with three others,\" Los Angeles Times, May 11, 1994.]</ref>  A forward early in his career, his performance in defense in MLS led to his comeback to the National team in that position after years of absence, but he was cut again from the U.S. roster in January 1998.<ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-01-17/sports/9801180639_1_world-cup-players-cup-team \"U.S. Team Makes First Cuts,\" Orlando Sentinel, January 17, 1998.]</ref>\n\nVermes was named the 1988 [[U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year]] and U.S. Olympic Player of the Year.\n\nIn 1989, he scored six goals for the U.S. [[Futsal]] team, which took third place, at the [[FIFA Futsal World Championship]] in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

He grew up in [[Delran Township, New Jersey]] and played high school soccer at [[Delran High School]].  He graduated in 1984, having scored 109 goals. In 1999, he was named by ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s.<ref>Jandoli, Ron. [https://web.archive.org/web/20030110132039/http://nj.com/hssports/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fhssports%2Fcentury%2Fstories%2Fbsoccerdecades.html \"The Century's Best \u2013 Boys Soccer: Top 10 Players of each decade\"], ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', November 7, 1999, backed up by the [[Internet Archive]] as of January 10, 2003. Accessed September 11, 2008.</ref>\n\nVermes played his first year in college on the [[Loyola Greyhounds men's soccer|men's soccer team]] at [[Loyola College in Maryland]] under head coach Bill Sento. Vermes then transferred and played three years of [[college soccer]] at [[Rutgers University]], from 1985 to 1987.  In his final season, Vermes scored 21 goals and 10 assists for the team, finishing a first team [[Division I First-Team All-American (soccer)|All-American]], as well as runner-up for the National Player of the Year Award.  During that season, Vermes led Rutgers to their first victory in the NCAA Tournament in 26 years, scoring the winning goal in a contest against [[Seton Hall University]].\n\n===Professional===\nAfter graduating, Vermes would go to Europe, where he played with [[Gy\u0151ri ETO FC|R\u00e1ba ETO FC]] of Hungary in 1989 and [[FC Volendam|Volendam]] of the Dutch [[Eredivisie]] in 1990.  In May 1991, Vermes returned to the United States and played three games, scoring a single goal against with the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975\u20131993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] of the [[American Professional Soccer League]].  He then moved to Spain where he played for [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n|Second Division]] club [[UE Figueres|Figueres]] from 1991\u20131995.\n\nLike many American players, Vermes returned to the United States to join the recently founded domestic league [[Major League Soccer]]. In January 1995, he signed with the new league that would not begin league play until 1996.  Therefore, MLS loaned Vermes to the [[New York Centaurs|New York Fever]] of the [[USL Second Division|USISL]] where he played 25 games, scoring 16 goals in the 1995 season.  In 1996, Vermes was drafted by the [[MetroStars|New York/New Jersey MetroStars]] in the third round of the [[MLS Inaugural Draft]] (29th overall) and captained the team in its first season.  Although he played the most minutes of any MetroStar that year, the MetroStars traded Vermes on February 3, 1997 to the [[Colorado Rapids]] for [[Kerry Zavagnin]].  Vermes would play three years for the Rapids before being traded again, this time to the [[Kansas City Wizards]] with [[Matt McKeon]] for Scott Vermillion and a player [[allocation (MLS)|allocation]].\n\nWith the Wizards, Vermes helped the Wizards finish the season first in the league with a 16\u20137\u20139 record, having allowed only 29 goals in 32 games, and eventually winning the [[MLS Cup]].  Vermes was recognized as the [[MLS Defender of the Year Award|MLS Defender of the Year]], while his teammate [[Tony Meola]] won both the [[MLS Goalkeeper of the Year]] and [[MLS MVP]] awards.  Vermes played two more seasons with the Wizards, struggling with injuries but playing every game he was healthy for, before announcing his retirement at the end of the 2002 season.\n\n===International===\nVermes received his first cap May 14, 1988 against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], and would in all receive 66 caps for the team, playing in the [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]], the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] and the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]]. In the 1990 World Cup, he nearly bagged a goal against Italy with a shot against Italian goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]]. After seeing his playing time wane with the team in late 1993 and early 1994, Vermes was one of the final cuts from the 1994 U.S. World Cup team.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-28/sports/sp-51473_1_peter-vermes \"Vermes Cut by U.S. Team,\" Los Angeles Times, April 28, 1994.]</ref> He later said he thought that his outspoken comments had doomed him politically.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-05-11/sports/sp-56307_1_world-cup \"Stunned Armstrong Released by U.S. Team : World Cup: Veteran defender thought he was competing for a starting job before being cut with three others,\" Los Angeles Times, May 11, 1994.]</ref>  A forward early in his career, his performance in defense in MLS led to his comeback to the National team in that position after years of absence, but he was cut again from the U.S. roster in January 1998.<ref>[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-01-17/sports/9801180639_1_world-cup-players-cup-team \"U.S. Team Makes First Cuts,\" Orlando Sentinel, January 17, 1998.]</ref>\n\nVermes was named the 1988 [[U.S. Soccer Athlete of the Year]] and U.S. Olympic Player of the Year.\n\nIn 1989, he scored six goals for the U.S. [[Futsal]] team, which took third place, at the [[FIFA Futsal World Championship]] in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.
