{"title_page": "Food rotation system", "text_new": "{{Merge to|Stock rotation|discuss=Talk:Stock rotation#Proposed merge with Food rotation system|date=June 2019}}\nA '''food rotation system''' is a front-loading shelving unit that organizes and rotates food cans on a first-in first-out basis (FIFO). An effective food rotation system is essential for storing food to prepare for [[wikt:catastrophe|catastrophe]]s, preventing [[foodborne illness]] and controlling commercial kitchen costs. When used correctly, the first-in first-out food rotation method ensures serving safe food and eliminates spoiled food waste.\n\nBesides the shelving units used for food rotation, other systems exist with the same idea. These systems are especially present in the [[food and beverage]] type industries such as restaurants, cafes, bakeries, etc. where food is being produced or being removed from their original package and put into other containers. In order to keep the food safety standard intact with the rotation system, [[adhesive label]]s are used to keep track of the date at which it was repackaged and or transferred, as well as the date it must be used by. The labels focus people\u2019s attention toward it, so that they are aware to keep maintenance whenever possible. Many factors must be considered when using adhesive labels for a rotation system; such as type of material it is made of, size, shape, training involved and addition information that the label may include. The labels provide a visual aid in assisting employees and managers to rotate containers and maintain a high quality product with minimal waste. Not only does this benefit the consumer, but the owners as well.\n\nFood rotation systems help establishments run more smoothly and efficiently, which is a standard that should be strived for. Other standards, such as the [https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodCode/ucm374275.htm FDA food code] are also met when implementing a food rotation system.  The system, if done correctly and maintained regularly, one can extract information (for example, length of storage), that may be useful in preventing food borne [[pathogen]]s from growing and causing sickness.\n \nA benefit, besides following the regulations set out by the [https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/RetailFoodProtection/FoodCode/default.htm FDA], is that it organizes stock and inventory. If the sequences at which items are received are used in the same manner, it will reduce the cost to owners. This cost would otherwise be used to replenish goods and maintain a solid business. Lastly, the food rotation system allows businesses to build their reputation and have confidence in what they are selling to everyday customers.\n\n<ref>McGinnis, P. (2008).
