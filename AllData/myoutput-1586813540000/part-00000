Older stems have bark that is shed in strips or small flakes and younger stems are covered with fine hairs. The leaves are broadly egg-shaped to lance-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, mostly {{cvt|5-10|mm}} long and {{cvt|2.5-4|mm}} wide but sometimes longer. The flowers are white and are borne singly or in pairs on short side branches, and are less than {{cvt|10|mm}} in diameter.
