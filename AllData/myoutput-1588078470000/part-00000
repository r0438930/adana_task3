Chorlton''' (27 December, 1913 &ndash; 25 October, 1951) was an English [[film editor]] and, occasionally, director. He was born in [[Disley]], [[Cheshire]]. He particularly worked with [[Powell and Pressburger]], including editing ''[[The Silver Fleet]]'' and the motorcycle sequences for ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]''\n\nOther films he edited include ''[[Juggernaut (1936 film)|Juggernaut]]'', ''[[Love on the Dole (film)|Love on the Dole]]'', ''[[The Volunteer (1944 film)|The Volunteer]]'', the [[Charters and Caldicott]] vehicle ''[[Crook's Tour]]'' and ''[[The Day Will Dawn]]''.\n\nChorlton died in a plane crash near [[Shottesbrooke]], [[Berkshire]] in his own plane on 25 October 1951.  He was on a flight from the [[West London Aero Club]], [[White Waltham]] with a local man.<ref>(26 October 1951). \"Four killed in air crashes\". The Times.</ref>\n\nLittle is available on his other career as a racing driver in the very early days of the motorsport which would later be known as F1. He was the perfect candidate for the latter because of a lifelong passion for motorsport. This was a moment when his expertise in film and a love of adventure combined.\n\nBriefly, his parallel lives merged.\n\nLittle is known about when and how he started his other career in racing, although it probably began in 1934 when he became a member of the iconic \u2018Junior Car Club\u2019 (JCC) at the famous Brooklands track, shortly after leaving university.\n\nTo live the 1930s and 1940s auto and racing industry in Britain was to witness the very origins of motorsport. In one small fragment of time, a young man passionate about cars and racing committed his spare time to becoming a driver, using his engineering skills to innovate and invent mechanical improvements to further his career.\n\nFor Michael, 1947 was the year when he could really indulge this other life. WWII was over, the boys were home and so too were motor sports. Race tracks that had become airfields were race tracks again. New airfields offered possibilities for racing and auto engineering. Life in the Motorsport business gained a new lease of life.\n\nIt was in 1947 that he formalised his racing career with his own company \u2018Michael C. Chorlton, Racing Car Specialist\u2019, registered at 16 Irving Street, London, W.C.2. \n\nThis was his entrance into the Grand Prix establishment and led him to his first, if somewhat aged, 8 cylinder 1933 Bugatti 51A racing car.\n\nRecords show that Michael was a \u2018Bugatti Owner\u2019s club\u2019 member in May 1948, registered as a competitor at the \u2018Prescott-Speed Hill Climb\u2019 race meeting.\n\nIn 1949 he teamed up with \u2018Centaur developments Ltd\u2019, a London company, the principal owners of which were James Boothby (himself a Bugatti race driver), Michael Chorlton and Charles Brookes. \n\noldracingcars.com mentions this collaboration in the May 26th 1949\u00a0 '''''\u201811<sup>th</sup> International British Empire Trophy Race\u2019''''' at Douglas, Isle of Man: \n\n'''''\u201c'''CDL (Michael Chorlton)''':''' The CDL was built for the 1949 F1 season by Centaur Developments Ltd, a London firm led by James Boothby, designer Michael Chorlton and Charles Brookes. The car is believed to have been built using one of Chorlton's Bugatti 51 chassis and engines, but the Bugatti expert Hugh Conway was unable to resolve this to his satisfaction. The Bugatti bits of the CDL were later removed by Martin Dean to build up a Bugatti which is now accepted by the Bugatti Owners Club as 51126. The rest of the CDL was sold in 1994 and rebuilt around a replica Bugatti chassis and a 2.5-litre Alta engine. It is now known as the Chorlton Special.\u201d'' \n\nHis car, a 1933 51A, can be traced from an entry in a Bugatti book as follows:\n\n''\u201cThis car was imported to England by Jack Lemon Burton in 1937 and raced by him. It was then a 51A. Later he sold it to M. Chorlton and the car became the Chorlton Special. The \u2018Autocar\u2019 of April 8<sup>th</sup> 1949 describes the car which was stated to be produced by Centaur Developments Ltd., Chorlton being the designer. The car was entered as a C.D.L. in the 1949 Jersey Race but failed to qualify. Chorlton was killed in an air crash in 1951. Later the car passed through the hands of T.E. Lloyd and was broken up. Precise whereabouts of the pieces unknown.\u201d''\n\nDuring his short racing career, Michael participated regularly in races in the UK and on Continental Europe. Back in those days he was surrounded by the well-known racing figures and car marques who were the originators of today\u2019s F1: \n\nL. Giron (Bugatti), R.E. Ansell (Maserati), R. Sommer (Maserati), G. Abercassis (E.R.A. and Bugatti), Guy Gale (Talbot-Darracq), G.B. Davis (Frazer-Nash), D. Hampshire (E.R.A.), Prince Bira (Maserati), Roy Salvadori (Maserati) and Reg Parnell.\n\nRetirements and mechanical failures were common and it was not unusual for more than half the entries for any race to \u2018retire\u2019 before the start, let alone to finish. More often than not they simply didn\u2019t \u2018arrive\u2019. \n\nSuch was the infancy of the sport that it was being invented as it happened or \u2018on the job\u2019.\u00a0 Among the more colourful mechanical failures noted next to the press reports of the finishing or lap times were: \u201cfuel tank, piston, engine, engine (stopping or simply not starting), oil pipe, cross-member, supercharger, connecting-rod, dropped valve, broken goggles, broken blow-off valve, broken throttle, lost gear lever, rod appears through the side of the engine, fuel carburation, seized camshaft.\u201d\n\nHis constant companion my mum Anna Walford was ever present and by his side at most (if not all) race meetings, taking on roles and responsibilities including Public Relations, office manager, biographer, photographer and occasional pit crew. Her own notes on all race meetings shed interesting insights into the processes, the mechanical failures and perils of a high-speed motorsport in its infancy, as well as the unique lifestyle of a racing driver.\n\nDuring his life Michael C. Chorlton (as well as my mum and Michael\u2019s mother) experienced truly \u2018on-edge\u2019 experiences. They included an emergency airplane landing in a ploughed field due to bad weather. On that very day two other unfortunate people perished in an identical accident caused by the same weather front. \n\nChorlton also survived a near fatal accident when he was cut from the overturned Bugatti #22 at the 1947 \u2018BRDC 9th International British Empire Trophy Race\u2019, Douglas, Isle of Man. He also escaped other potentially lethal mechanical failures, including a piston rod bursting through the engine.\n\nEverything he did was pushed to the limits, as the number of fines issued by the Metropolitan Police for speeding in London will testify.\n\nIf Michael C. Cholrton could be described in a few lines it might be the following:\n\nThere are those who embrace life despite the risks that could push them closer to the ending of it.\n\nThat\u2019s what life is for - living.\n\n\n''One cannot talk about racing in the 1940/1950s without mentioning the art of the photography, more specifically the art of shooting moving objects.
