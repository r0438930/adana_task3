After Blight's resignation in 1994 (following Geelong's Grand Final defeat to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]]), Ayres was appointed senior coach for the 1995 AFL season. In his first year, the Cats lost to Carlton in the Grand Final (their fourth Grand Final defeat in seven seasons) by 61 points. In 1999, at the end of a disappointing season (Geelong finished 11th) and following the Geelong board's refusal to offer him a contract extension beyond the 2000 AFL season, Ayres quit as Geelong coach to take the coaching position at [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] where Malcolm Blight had, again, just resigned.\n\nAyres coached Adelaide from 2000 until 2004. When told he would not continue as coach for the 2005 season, Ayres quit midseason. Though he had been given the opportunity to stay for the rest of season 2004, he told the Adelaide board that if he could not coach the following year, he would leave immediately. He then walked out of the club's office without shaking hands or responding to media enquiries.{{cn|date=August 2018}} He left Adelaide with a 55\u201352 win-loss ratio. He was replaced by [[Neil Craig]], who coached for the remainder of season 2004 and was eventually employed full-time.\n\nIn 2006 he returned to coaching as [[assistant coach]] at the [[Essendon Football Club]], alongside veteran [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]]. When [[Matthew Knights]] was appointed as senior coach of Essendon at the end of the 2007 season, Knights vowed to modernise the club's support staff, Ayres subsequently lost his position as assistant coach.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22527600-11088,00.html Herald Sun: Knights cleans out assistants Gary Ayres, Dean Wallis]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Ayres was appointed senior coach of the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]]. Ayres has coached at Port Melbourne continuously since then, with his current contract set to expire at the end of 2017, and he is the longest-serving coach in the club's history. Ayres has coached Port Melbourne to two premierships and three minor premierships, which included the club's perfect [[2011 VFL season|2011 season]], in which the club won all 21 of its premiership matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portmelbournefc.com.au/gary-ayres-extends-coaching-contract/|author=Sam Wharton|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=21 March 2016|publisher=Port Melbourne Football Club|title=Gary Ayres Extends Coaching Contract}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 October 2000, Ayres was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for contribution to Australian Football.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary James Ayres|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=978364&search_type=advanced&showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|accessdate=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Media career===\nIn 2005 Ayres spent the year in the media on [[Fox Footy Channel]].

After Blight's resignation in 1994 (following Geelong's Grand Final defeat to the [[West Coast Eagles|Eagles]]), Ayres was appointed senior coach for the 1995 AFL season. In his first year, the Cats lost to Carlton in the Grand Final (their fourth Grand Final defeat in seven seasons) by 61 points. In 1999, at the end of a disappointing season (Geelong finished 11th) and following the Geelong board's refusal to offer him a contract extension beyond the 2000 AFL season, Ayres quit as Geelong coach to take the coaching position at [[Adelaide Football Club|Adelaide]] where Malcolm Blight had, again, just resigned.\n\nAyres coached Adelaide from 2000 until 2004. When told he would not continue as coach for the 2005 season, Ayres quit midseason. Though he had been given the opportunity to stay for the rest of season 2004, he told the Adelaide board that if he could not coach the following year, he would leave immediately. He then walked out of the club's office without shaking hands or responding to media enquiries.{{cn|date=August 2018}} He left Adelaide with a 55\u201352 win-loss ratio. He was replaced by [[Neil Craig]], who coached for the remainder of season 2004 and was eventually employed full-time.\n\nIn 2006 he returned to coaching as [[assistant coach]] at the [[Essendon Football Club]], alongside veteran [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]]. When [[Matthew Knights]] was appointed as senior coach of Essendon at the end of the 2007 season, Knights vowed to modernise the club's support staff, Ayres subsequently lost his position as assistant coach.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22527600-11088,00.html Herald Sun: Knights cleans out assistants Gary Ayres, Dean Wallis]</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Ayres was appointed senior coach of the [[Port Melbourne Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]]. Ayres has coached at Port Melbourne continuously since then, with his current contract set to expire at the end of 2017, and he is the longest-serving coach in the club's history. Ayres has coached Port Melbourne to two premierships and three minor premierships, which included the club's perfect [[2011 VFL season|2011 season]], in which the club won all 21 of its premiership matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portmelbournefc.com.au/gary-ayres-extends-coaching-contract/|author=Sam Wharton|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=21 March 2016|publisher=Port Melbourne Football Club|title=Gary Ayres Extends Coaching Contract}}</ref>\n\nOn 24 October 2000, Ayres was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for contribution to Australian Football.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary James Ayres|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=978364&search_type=advanced&showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|accessdate=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Media career===\nIn 2005 Ayres spent the year in the media on [[Fox Footy Channel]].
