In addition, there were sing-along sequences with simpler imagery complementing the full lyrics of particular songs. The songs were taken from all the albums up to 'Revolver' as well as non-album singles up to 'Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane', the song 'Bad Boy', the German language song 'Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand', and the 'Long Tall Sally' EP.\n\nThe series depicted the band in their early \"moptop-and-suit\" look as depicted in the live action film, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', even though the band moved beyond it during the series' run.  The producers did attempt to acknowledge the band members' contemporary appearances with photographs of them in the series' [[title sequence]]s during its production run.\n\nThe band members themselves had nothing to do with the series' production beyond the use of their music recordings. American actor [[Paul Frees]] did the voices of [[John Lennon|John]] and [[George Harrison|George]] while [[Lance Percival]] (of the [[Carry On films|''Carry On'']] series) did the voices of [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]]. Frees had been the voice of [[Boris Badenov]] in the ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' series. The female voices were provided by [[Julie Bennett]] and [[Carol Corbett]]. At first, the Beatles disliked the series.<ref>Axelrod, Mitchell. ''Beatletoons: The Real Story Behind The Cartoon Beatles''. Wynn, 1999,</ref> It is reported, however, that the band members enjoyed the cartoons in later years.<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\">Axelrod 1999.</ref> Their views of the cartoon series discouraged them from participating significantly in the later [[animated feature film]], ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Only when the band saw and were impressed by the ''Yellow Submarine''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s finished footage did they realize the film was a more ambitious creation. As a result, they agreed to appear in a short live action epilogue for it. In fact, ''Yellow Submarine'' producer [[Al Brodax]] and director [[George Dunning]] were involved in the production both of the animated series and of ''Yellow Submarine''.\n\nInitially, the opening credits theme was a guitar riff from \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\" segueing into \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", over a cartoon sequence of the group running down a fire escape, echoing a scene in ''A Hard Day's Night''. The second season's opening theme was \"[[Help! (song)|Help!]]\", while the third season's theme was \"[[And Your Bird Can Sing]]\", over a different cartoon sequence.\n\nAlthough uncredited, [[Dennis Marks (screenwriter)|Dennis Marks]], along with [[Jack Mendelsohn]], [[Heywood Kling]] and Bruce Howard, wrote all 39 episodes of ''The Beatles'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/beatles.htm| title=The Beatles (cartoon Series): Cartoon adventures of the world's most famously successful group. | work=televisionheaven.co.uk | author=Marcus, Laurence | date=14 February 2004| accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost of the episodes of the series were produced by Artransa Park Studios in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia<ref>[http://www.thebeatleshk.com/Cartoons/Background.html The background of The Beatles cartoon television series.]</ref> and George Dunning's company TVC Animation in London,<ref name=\"womack\"/> with a handful of episodes made in Hollywood,<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\"/> with a crew supervised by veteran cartoon writer [[John W. Dunn (animator)|John W. Dunn]].<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\"/>\n\n==Depiction of the Beatles==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Beatcart652.jpg|thumb|The Beatles stand before cartoon images of themselves from the ABC TV series, 1965.]]\nEach Beatles figure was a loose, rough, exaggerated description of them with [[John Lennon|John]] and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] wearing a blue collar-less suit and tie while [[George Harrison|George]] and [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] wore navy blue shirts and light blue blazer jackets, all of them wearing matching blue drainpipe trousers and [[Beatle Boots]].\n\n===John Lennon===\n[[John Lennon|John]] is described as being the leader. His mop-top is slightly shorter than that of the rest of the band. He has his chin up, looking down his nose, feet apart and hands on hips, and points and poses with his hands with a \"showbiz\" expression with a mocking gesture, especially when giving orders (showing John does not take his job as leader seriously), and is often malicious, especially towards George and Ringo. He slouches rather than sits. He will often pull funny faces and immediately wipe them off. John's movements are described as being short and slightly aggressive. His chin is rather large, chubby and rounded and his eyes are rather small. Whenever he looks to the front he uses a sideways look to talk to somebody and looks away after giving an order. John's right eyebrow is connected to his nose and gives him a look suitable to his \"real life\" appearance.\n\nHe tends to use sarcastic, dry humor. He is also extremely lazy and overly laid-back. And yet, despite all that, he truly cares about the band members and will do anything for them.\n\n===Paul McCartney===\n[[Paul McCartney|Paul]] is shown as second-in-command of the band. Paul is the most poised and stylish of the cartoon Beatles, and his mop-top is the neatest of the four of them.\n\nHe uses his hands, with his fingers spread apart, to express himself when talking. He is the one to get excited whenever John suggests something. He always looks straight at whomever he's talking to. His face is very fine, with his eyebrows wide and far apart and his eyes partly closed in an almost mockingly sad expression and they will only open fully when he is excited or frightened. His moptop takes on a messier look and his eyes open wide when he is terrified. Paul sits like he's about to jump out and get on with whatever is happening. He does not really walk, he skips. When he is making his own suggestions or comments, especially when suggesting mischief, he covers up by assuming a mockingly innocent look; eyes wide and head tilted to one side. Whenever he gets especially excited, he will put his hand in his mouth.\n\nAlso like John, Paul uses a dry and sarcastic humour and is happy-go-lucky and rather laid-back. In spite of this, he will always help somebody when needed. Paul, along with Ringo, are the only Beatles who sound closest to their real-life counterparts.\nHis character is the only left-hander, while in real life both he and Ringo use their left hands.\n\n===George Harrison===\n[[George Harrison|George]]'s character has a more angular, wry figure, especially when he walks, his legs are long and thin (emphasis on the knees keeps his angular appearance). His mop-top is rather longer in the back compared to the other members of the band. He always leans against something, shoulders hunched, hands in pocket, legs crossed. He is also the same height as Paul. His shoulders are hunched when he is in a standing or a leaning pose, which can indicate direction and his head tilted forward. He has a crooked smile and is almost always giving the impression of frowning due to his characters eyebrows becoming thicker as they reach his nose. His chin is long and thin, with sunken cheeks, and his nose is tall and thin. He never looks at who he's speaking to and will close his eyes for short periods when talking. Notice the distance between his nose and his mouth; his mouth is lopsided.\n\nHe often uses dry, witty humour and succumbs to peer pressure. George is the only Beatle with a diverse accent that does not really fit with any accent in particular, but it sounds slightly Scottish/Irish. George has been shown to be fascinated with various cultures and is occasionally superstitious. He and Ringo are almost always made to do the work for John and Paul, such as in the episode \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", they were the only ones carrying in the bands' extensive luggage into their vacation cottage. He cares a lot about the group members and will help them when they need him.\n\n===Ringo Starr===\n[[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] is the most sympathetic Beatle. His mop-top is the longest and shaggiest (sometimes almost completely covering his eyes) of the four of them. He is the more calm, gentle, least aggressive, innocent, and more lovable Beatle. Ringo's nose and sad, goofy, expressive eyes are among his most prominent features along with his trademark, rather deep, goofy laugh, which is highly exaggerated. His face usually has a sad or goofy expression with his upper lip protruding in a wavy line. He does smile a lot, but when he does not he has a look of curiosity or sadness on his face. Ringo's expressions and humour are usually deadpan, but when expression is required, his eye position (eyes arched) are used to make a goofy expression whenever he laughs. Whenever he laughs, having made a funny remark, he squints.\n\nAlthough being the eldest Beatle (three months before John), he is the smallest Beatle with a disjointed [[Groucho Marx]]-like figure. His neck is thin and gets smaller as it reaches the base of his neck, with his small chin sticking out a little, which is evidence of his disjointed figure. When he walks, his feet, legs, knees, arms and hands move loosely. Being responsible for the show's light-hearted humorous, or slapstick comical relief, after having bodily harm of any kind, his figure is crooked, bent or twisted into an, sometimes, unusual position. His clothes also often look a bit too big, especially his Beatle Boots and Blue Blazer Jacket.\n\nDuring the song portions of the episodes (not the sing-along segments), he often shakes his head and mop-top around with a goofy expression when drumming. He gets along best with George, and he, like George, shows interest in various cultures.  He often makes bad puns and jokes (usually he's the only one laughing). During the introductions to the Sing-Along segments he substitutes for the prop-man (who is either on vacation, out sick or just not there) and sets the stage, literally, to John, Paul, or George's description, and more often than not, to their surprise or chagrin.\n\nHe is often the butt of the joke, victim of a prank, or just simply has bad luck. Ringo's character tends to have bad luck, often because of his naivety, curiosity and being unaware of the danger, mistake or threat. In the episode \"Good Day Sunshine\", he becomes depressed and upset, thinking he is a [[jinx]] for misfortunes, such as that it rained at Carny Island on the Beatles' weekends, (i.e. it rained at the piers fair every time Ringo arrived) and was described in that episode as being a \"sourpuss\". He felt better after John, Paul, and George sang \"[[Good Day Sunshine]]\" for him, and showed him how to have fun again.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Money\" that Ringo's mother dropped him as a baby (\"Me mother dropped me once\").\n\nRingo, like Paul, is also left-handed, although in \"I'll Be Back\" Ringo plays a guitar right-handed.\n\n===Brian Epstein===\n[[Brian Epstein]] acts as the Beatles' manager. He is rarely seen or mentioned but he was mostly mentioned in the episode \"Please Mr. Postman\" when the Beatles ran out of money. Ringo had purchased 15 rings, which were later snapped by autograph collectors, and they needed to contact Epstein for money. Epstein finally makes his appearance in the episode \"Thank You Girl\" in the beginning of the episode, but only his arm is seen, again voiced by [[Paul Frees]] as he grounds the Beatles for gaining so much weight after dining on the French cooking. Epstein, himself, along with the other real-life Beatles, appear in a lost deleted scene featuring the production of the animated Beatles cartoons at the end.\n\nHis fictionalized animated version of his appearance and habit of smoking is a homage and based on the animated series' creator, [[Al Brodax]].\n\n\n\n==List of episodes and Sing Alongs==\n:: *Songs in episodes with no Sing Along counterparts<ref name=bcdb>[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Other_Studios/K/King_Features_Syndicate/The_Beatles/index.html The Big Cartoon Database.]</ref>\n:: **Songs in Sing Alongs with no episode counterparts<ref name=bcdb />\n\n===Season 1 (1965\u201366)===\n'''''1.

The series was sponsored by the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]], the [[Quaker Oats Company]] and the [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars Candy Company]].<ref name=\"TV.com\"/> For the third season in 1967, the series was moved to Saturdays at noon.\n\nOriginally, the Beatles disliked the cartoon; however, as time went on they grew to like it. In 1972, Lennon commented, \"I still get a blast out of watching the Beatles cartoons on TV.\" In 1999, Harrison said, \"I always kind of liked [the cartoons]. They were so bad or silly that they were good, if you know what I mean, and I think the passage of time might make them more fun now.\"<ref name=\"womack\">{{cite book |title=Long and Winding Roads: The Evolving Artistry of The Beatles |last=Womack |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Continuum Books |location=New York |isbn= |page=101 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}} Womack quotes the interviews with Lennon (1972) and Harrison (1999) via a reference to {{cite book |title=Beatletoons: The Real Story Behind the Cartoon Beatles |last=Axelrod |first=Mitchell |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=Wynn |location=Pickens |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe series was syndicated worldwide on television and cable after the original run ended in 1969. In 1986 and 1987, new generations were introduced to the series when it was rebroadcast in syndication by MTV and also by the Disney Channel. On MTV, the series was shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings at 10 AM ET or 7 AM PT. On The Disney Channel, the series was shown on Fridays at 5 PM beginning in 1989. [[Mark Hamill]] was a guest host of the MTV run of the series in 1987.\n\n==Legacy==\n\nWhile the series remained popular in syndication worldwide, the internet has allowed for even more exposure due to its [[so bad it's good]] nature. Due to the nature of the show and the Beatles' enduring popularity as a band, the series has recently gained a [[cult following]] online. The series was available on YouTube and on online websites, but most episodes have since been removed due to copyright infringement. In December 2004, [[McFarlane Toys]] released a line of figures based on the cartoon series featuring all four band members with instruments. In 2005, they released a boxed set featuring cartoon figures of all four band members with instruments, plus an alligator figure, speakers, and a radio. [[Apple Corps|Apple Corps Ltd.]] purchased the rights to the series in the early 1990s. There has been popular demand for the [[remastered]] release of the series on [[DVD]] by Apple.<ref name=\"Animators\"/> On 30 January 2019, convenience store chain [[Speedway LLC|Speedway]] used an image from the series on [[social media]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the band's rooftop concert during the [[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Get Back sessions]].<ref>https://www.facebook.com/189194787875143/posts/1845427148918557/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* DenniLu Company.

In addition, there were sing along sequences with simpler imagery complementing the full lyrics of particular songs. The songs were taken from all the albums up to 'Revolver' as well as non-album singles up to 'Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane', the song 'Bad Boy', the German language song 'Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand', and the 'Long Tall Sally' EP.\n\nThe series depicted the band in their early \"moptop-and-suit\" look as depicted in the live action film, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', even though the band moved beyond it during the series' run.  The producers did attempt to acknowledge the band members' contemporary appearances with photographs of them in the series' [[title sequence]]s during its production run.\n\nThe band members themselves had nothing to do with the series' production beyond the use of their music recordings. American actor [[Paul Frees]] did the voices of [[John Lennon|John]] and [[George Harrison|George]] while [[Lance Percival]] (of the [[Carry On films|''Carry On'']] series) did the voices of [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]]. Frees had been the voice of [[Boris Badenov]] in the ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' series. The female voices were provided by [[Julie Bennett]] and [[Carol Corbett]]. At first, the Beatles disliked the series.<ref>Axelrod, Mitchell. ''Beatletoons: The Real Story Behind The Cartoon Beatles''. Wynn, 1999,</ref> It is reported, however, that the band members enjoyed the cartoons in later years.<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\">Axelrod 1999.</ref> Their views of the cartoon series discouraged them from participating significantly in the later [[animated feature film]], ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]''. Only when the band saw and were impressed by the ''Yellow Submarine''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s finished footage did they realize the film was a more ambitious creation. As a result, they agreed to appear in a short live action epilogue for it. In fact, ''Yellow Submarine'' producer [[Al Brodax]] and director [[George Dunning]] were involved in the production both of the animated series and of ''Yellow Submarine''.\n\nInitially, the opening credits theme was a guitar riff from \"[[A Hard Day's Night (song)|A Hard Day's Night]]\" segueing into \"[[Can't Buy Me Love]]\", over a cartoon sequence of the group running down a fire escape, echoing a scene in ''A Hard Day's Night''. The second season's opening theme was \"[[Help! (song)|Help!]]\", while the third season's theme was \"[[And Your Bird Can Sing]]\", over a different cartoon sequence.\n\nAlthough uncredited, [[Dennis Marks (screenwriter)|Dennis Marks]], along with [[Jack Mendelsohn]], [[Heywood Kling]] and Bruce Howard, wrote all 39 episodes of ''The Beatles'' series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.televisionheaven.co.uk/beatles.htm| title=The Beatles (cartoon Series): Cartoon adventures of the world's most famously successful group. | work=televisionheaven.co.uk | author=Marcus, Laurence | date=14 February 2004| accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost of the episodes of the series were produced by Artransa Park Studios in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia<ref>[http://www.thebeatleshk.com/Cartoons/Background.html The background of The Beatles cartoon television series.]</ref> and George Dunning's company TVC Animation in London,<ref name=\"womack\"/> with a handful of episodes made in Hollywood,<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\"/> with a crew supervised by veteran cartoon writer [[John W. Dunn (animator)|John W. Dunn]].<ref name=\"Axelrod 1999\"/>\n\n==Depiction of the Beatles==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Beatcart652.jpg|thumb|The Beatles stand before cartoon images of themselves from the ABC TV series, 1965.]]\nEach Beatles figure was a loose, rough, exaggerated description of them with [[John Lennon|John]] and [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] wearing a blue collar-less suit and tie while [[George Harrison|George]] and [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] wore navy blue shirts and light blue blazer jackets, all of them wearing matching blue drainpipe trousers and [[Beatle Boots]].\n\n===John Lennon===\n[[John Lennon|John]] is described as being the leader. His mop-top is slightly shorter than that of the rest of the band. He has his chin up, looking down his nose, feet apart and hands on hips, and points and poses with his hands with a \"showbiz\" expression with a mocking gesture, especially when giving orders (showing John does not take his job as leader seriously), and is often malicious, especially towards George and Ringo. He slouches rather than sits. He will often pull funny faces and immediately wipe them off. John's movements are described as being short and slightly aggressive. His chin is rather large, chubby and rounded and his eyes are rather small. Whenever he looks to the front he uses a sideways look to talk to somebody and looks away after giving an order. John's right eyebrow is connected to his nose and gives him a look suitable to his \"real life\" appearance.\n\nHe tends to use sarcastic, dry humor. He is also extremely lazy and overly laid-back. And yet, despite all that, he truly cares about the band members and will do anything for them.\n\n===Paul McCartney===\n[[Paul McCartney|Paul]] is shown as second-in-command of the band. Paul is the most poised and stylish of the cartoon Beatles, and his mop-top is the neatest of the four of them.\n\nHe uses his hands, with his fingers spread apart, to express himself when talking. He is the one to get excited whenever John suggests something. He always looks straight at whomever he's talking to. His face is very fine, with his eyebrows wide and far apart and his eyes partly closed in an almost mockingly sad expression and they will only open fully when he is excited or frightened. His moptop takes on a messier look and his eyes open wide when he is terrified. Paul sits like he's about to jump out and get on with whatever is happening. He does not really walk, he skips. When he is making his own suggestions or comments, especially when suggesting mischief, he covers up by assuming a mockingly innocent look; eyes wide and head tilted to one side. Whenever he gets especially excited, he will put his hand in his mouth.\n\nAlso like John, Paul uses a dry and sarcastic humour and is happy-go-lucky and rather laid-back. In spite of this, he will always help somebody when needed. Paul, along with Ringo, are the only Beatles who sound closest to their real-life counterparts.\nHis character is the only left-hander, while in real life both he and Ringo use their left hands.\n\n===George Harrison===\n[[George Harrison|George]]'s character has a more angular, wry figure, especially when he walks, his legs are long and thin (emphasis on the knees keeps his angular appearance). His mop-top is rather longer in the back compared to the other members of the band. He always leans against something, shoulders hunched, hands in pocket, legs crossed. He is also the same height as Paul. His shoulders are hunched when he is in a standing or a leaning pose, which can indicate direction and his head tilted forward. He has a crooked smile and is almost always giving the impression of frowning due to his characters eyebrows becoming thicker as they reach his nose. His chin is long and thin, with sunken cheeks, and his nose is tall and thin. He never looks at who he's speaking to and will close his eyes for short periods when talking. Notice the distance between his nose and his mouth; his mouth is lopsided.\n\nHe often uses dry, witty humour and succumbs to peer pressure. George is the only Beatle with a diverse accent that does not really fit with any accent in particular, but it sounds slightly Scottish/Irish. George has been shown to be fascinated with various cultures and is occasionally superstitious. He and Ringo are almost always made to do the work for John and Paul, such as in the episode \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", they were the only ones carrying in the bands' extensive luggage into their vacation cottage. He cares a lot about the group members and will help them when they need him.\n\n===Ringo Starr===\n[[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] is the most sympathetic Beatle. His mop-top is the longest and shaggiest (sometimes almost completely covering his eyes) of the four of them. He is the more calm, gentle, least aggressive, innocent, and more lovable Beatle. Ringo's nose and sad, goofy, expressive eyes are among his most prominent features along with his trademark, rather deep, goofy laugh, which is highly exaggerated. His face usually has a sad or goofy expression with his upper lip protruding in a wavy line. He does smile a lot, but when he does not he has a look of curiosity or sadness on his face. Ringo's expressions and humour are usually deadpan, but when expression is required, his eye position (eyes arched) are used to make a goofy expression whenever he laughs. Whenever he laughs, having made a funny remark, he squints.\n\nAlthough being the eldest Beatle (three months before John), he is the smallest Beatle with a disjointed [[Groucho Marx]]-like figure. His neck is thin and gets smaller as it reaches the base of his neck, with his small chin sticking out a little, which is evidence of his disjointed figure. When he walks, his feet, legs, knees, arms and hands move loosely. Being responsible for the show's light-hearted humorous, or slapstick comical relief, after having bodily harm of any kind, his figure is crooked, bent or twisted into an, sometimes, unusual position. His clothes also often look a bit too big, especially his Beatle Boots and Blue Blazer Jacket.\n\nDuring the song portions of the episodes (not the sing-along segments), he often shakes his head and mop-top around with a goofy expression when drumming. He gets along best with George, and he, like George, shows interest in various cultures.  He often makes bad puns and jokes (usually he's the only one laughing). During the introductions to the Sing-Along segments he substitutes for the prop-man (who is either on vacation, out sick or just not there) and sets the stage, literally, to John, Paul, or George's description, and more often than not, to their surprise or chagrin.\n\nHe is often the butt of the joke, victim of a prank, or just simply has bad luck. Ringo's character tends to have bad luck, often because of his naivety, curiosity and being unaware of the danger, mistake or threat. In the episode \"Good Day Sunshine\", he becomes depressed and upset, thinking he is a [[jinx]] for misfortunes, such as that it rained at Carny Island on the Beatles' weekends, (i.e. it rained at the piers fair every time Ringo arrived) and was described in that episode as being a \"sourpuss\". He felt better after John, Paul, and George sang \"[[Good Day Sunshine]]\" for him, and showed him how to have fun again.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Money\" that Ringo's mother dropped him as a baby (\"Me mother dropped me once\").\n\nRingo, like Paul, is also left-handed, although in \"I'll Be Back\" Ringo plays a guitar right-handed.\n\n===Brian Epstein===\n[[Brian Epstein]] acts as the Beatles' manager. He is rarely seen or mentioned but he was mostly mentioned in the episode \"Please Mr. Postman\" when the Beatles ran out of money. Ringo had purchased 15 rings, which were later snapped by autograph collectors, and they needed to contact Epstein for money. Epstein finally makes his appearance in the episode \"Thank You Girl\" in the beginning of the episode, but only his arm is seen, again voiced by [[Paul Frees]] as he grounds the Beatles for gaining so much weight after dining on the French cooking. Epstein, himself, along with the other real-life Beatles, appear in a lost deleted scene featuring the production of the animated Beatles cartoons at the end.\n\nHis fictionalized animated version of his appearance and habit of smoking is a homage and based on the animated series' creator, [[Al Brodax]].\n\n\n\n==List of episodes and Sing Alongs==\n:: *Songs in episodes with no Sing Along counterparts<ref name=bcdb>[http://www.bcdb.com/cartoons/Other_Studios/K/King_Features_Syndicate/The_Beatles/index.html The Big Cartoon Database.]</ref>\n:: **Songs in Sing Alongs with no episode counterparts<ref name=bcdb />\n\n===Season 1 (1965\u201366)===\n'''''1.
