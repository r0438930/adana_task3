The season officially runs from November 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones were officially monitored by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS), Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] (BOM) and New Zealand's [[MetService]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> also monirors the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. The FMS attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. The FMS, BoM and MetService all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate wind speeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi. In mid March, Gretel entered the basin. It dissipated shortly afterwards. In early April, Harold also entered the basin from the Australian region. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 Severe tropical cyclone as it impacted [[Vanuatu]].\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

All [[COVID-19]] preparedness activities were suspended to facilitate preparations and evacuations for Harold. Harold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale to strike Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in [[2014\u201315 South Pacific cyclone season|2015]], bringing gusts above 275 km/h (170 mph), 250\u2013450 mm (10\u201318 in) of rain, and a storm surge of 0.8 m (2.6 ft) causing catastrophic damage, torrential flooding and communication disruptions and plunging Vanuatu into a blackout.\n\n[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) granted 50,000 [[Swiss franc|CHF]] from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to the Vanuatu Red Cross Society to help better position staff and aid resources prior to the storm's arrival, mobilizing over a thousand volunteers. Preparing for the storm in [[Luganville]], hundreds of people were sent into evacuation centres before the storm. The Torba provincial headquarters in [[Sola, Vanuatu|Sola]] served as a shelter for families. Development organisation [[Oxfam Australia]] coordinated with Vanuatuan agencies to develop a response plan for Harold. The Australian [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] also devised a support package for both the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\n\nIn [[Fiji]], heavy rain alerts were issued for the western half of [[Viti Levu]], [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]], and the [[Mamanuca Islands|Mamanuca]] and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa]] islands on April 6. Storm warnings were later put in effect for the areas under a heavy rain alert, in addition to the [[Lomaiviti Islands]]. The highest warning, a hurricane warning, was issued for Kadavu and [[Ono-i-Lau]] on April 7. The Fiji National Disaster Management Office (FDNMO) activated their Emergency Operations Centre to streamline preparations and evacuations. A total of eighty-five shelters were opened, with at least two in each of Fiji's four districts. All village headmen and community leaders were directed to. All COVID-19-related activities were also cancelled in order to prepare for the impact of Harold. Early on April 7, the storm began affecting the nation with gusty winds, moderate coastal flooding, and storm surge. These conditioners worsened as the storm approached. In contrast to the forecasts, the passed only to the south of Fiji and thus, the northern islands received little damage.

the [[South Pacific Ocean]] to the east of 160\u00b0E. The season officially runs from November 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones will be  officially monitored by the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) in [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Nadi, Fiji]] and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers in [[Bureau of Meteorology|Brisbane, Australia]] and [[Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited|Wellington, New Zealand]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and TCWC Brisbane all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi. In mid March, Gretel entered the basin. It dissipated shortly afterwards. In early April, Harold also entered the basin from the Australian region. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 Severe tropical cyclone as it impacted [[Vanuatu]].\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

All [[COVID-19]] preparedness activities were suspended to facilitate preparations and evacuations for Harold. Harold was the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale to strike Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in [[2014\u201315 South Pacific cyclone season|2015]], bringing gusts above 275 km/h (170 mph), 250\u2013450 mm (10\u201318 in) of rain, and a storm surge of 0.8 m (2.6 ft) causing catastrophic damage, torrential flooding and communication disruptions and plunging Vanuatu into a blackout.\n\n[[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] (IFRC) granted 50,000 [[Swiss franc|CHF]] from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to the Vanuatu Red Cross Society to help better position staff and aid resources prior to the storm's arrival, mobilizing over a thousand volunteers. Preparing for the storm in [[Luganville]], hundreds of people were sent into evacuation centres before the storm. The Torba provincial headquarters in [[Sola, Vanuatu|Sola]] served as a shelter for families. Development organisation [[Oxfam Australia]] coordinated with Vanuatuan agencies to develop a response plan for Harold. The Australian [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] also devised a support package for both the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.\n\nIn [[Fiji]], heavy rain alerts were issued for the western half of [[Viti Levu]], [[Kadavu Island|Kadavu]], and the [[Mamanuca Islands|Mamanuca]] and [[Yasawa Islands|Yasawa]] islands on April 6. Storm warnings were later put in effect for the areas under a heavy rain alert, in addition to the [[Lomaiviti Islands]]. The highest warning, a hurricane warning, was issued for Kadavu and [[Ono-i-Lau]] on April 7. The Fiji National Disaster Management Office (FDNMO) activated their Emergency Operations Centre to streamline preparations and evacuations. A total of eighty-five shelters were opened, with at least two in each of Fiji's four districts. All village headmen and community leaders were directed to. All COVID-19-related activities were also cancelled in order to prepare for the impact of Harold. Early on April 7, the storm began affecting the nation with gusty winds, moderate coastal flooding, and storm surge. These conditioners worsened as the storm approached.
