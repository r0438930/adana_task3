The district has an area of 5,165&nbsp;km\u00b2, and a population of 1,648,997 (2011 census). The town of [[Balangir]] is the district headquarters. The composition of the land is predominantly rural. Other important big & small towns in '''Balangir district''' are [[Titlagarh]], [[Patnagarh]], [[Kantabanji]], [[Loisinga|Loisingha]], [[Saintala]], Belpada, Tushra, [[Agalpur]], Deogaon, Chudapali, [[Biripali]], Bhalumunda, Bangomunda, Sindhekela, Turekela.\n\n== History ==\nThe district of Balangir is named after the headquarters towns of Balangir. This town was also the headquarters of the feudatory state of [[Patna (princely state)|Patna]] since the 1880s. The district of Balangir is flanked in the northwest by the Gandhamardan hills. Many hill streams traverse it. It is the land of [[Tantra|Tantrik]] culture. It is also notable for having experimented in the [[republic]]an form of Government that was overthrown by Ramai Deo.\n\n===Etymology===\n[[Image:Balangir palace.jpg|thumb|250px|''Royal Palace of [[Balangir]]]]\nBalaram Deo, the 19th Raja of [[Patna (princely state)]], founded a town called Balramgarh and shifted the capital of Patna state from [[Patnagarh]] to Balramgarh in the early 16th century. Subsequently, the town was renamed as Balangir from Balramgarh. After around 8 years of rule in Patna state, he was awarded the land from river Ang till the boundary of Bamra kingdom by his mother. Subsequently, he founded a kingdom named [[Sambalpur]], which went on to become a strong kingdom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Orissa District Gazetteers: Balangir, Printed by the Superintendent, Orissa Government Press, 1966</ref>\n\n===Ancient History===\n[[Image:Indralath Temple.jpg|thumb|250px|''8th Century AD Indralath Temple at Ranipur-Jharial''.]]\nThe territory comprising the present district of Balangir was in ancient times a part of the [[South Kosala]] {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. According to tradition, the origin of South Kosala dates back to the time of [[Rama]] and scholars like Pargiter believe that Rama's long stay in that region gave rise to the name of South Kosala after his original homeland Kosala. According to Padmapurana, the kingdom of Kosala, after Rama, was divided between '''Lava''' and '''Kusa''', his two son. Later Kusa founded the city of '''Kusasthalipura''' and ruled over the southern half of Kosala (that included modern day [[Western Odisha]] and [[Chhattisgarh]] State){{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.\n\nDuring the time of Grammarian [[P\u0101\u1e47ini|Panini]] (5th Century B.C), a territory named Taitila [[Janapada]] flourished to the west of Kalinga and that territory has been associated by historians with the modern town of [[Titlagarh]] in Balangir district. Taitala Janapada was famous for trade in some commodities described by the Grammarian as \"Kadru\" the meaning of which may be either horse or cotton fabrics.<ref>Panini's Ashtadyayi VI. 2. 42</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chetiya Jataka]], the capital of the [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]] country was '''Sothivatinagara''' which is the same as '''Suktimatipuri''' of [[Harivamsa]] and '''Suktisahvaya''' of the [[Mahabharata]] (Vana Parva). The epic (''Adi Parva'') also states that the capital of the Chedis was situated on the bank of river Suktimati which is the Sukhtel river of Balangir district<ref>D. C. Sircar Ancient Geography of India Pg.55</ref>\n\nThus the ancestors of King of Kalinga [[Kharavela]] were from the Balangir district as they were ruling over the territory drained by the Sukhtel river in Balangir, wherefrom they advanced towards the east and became the master of Kalinga by the 1st Century B.C. In the [[Hathigumpha inscription]], Kharavela refers to one Rajashri Vasu as his ancestor, who is probably the same as Vasu, the son of Abhichandra, the founder of Chedi Kingdom. This Vasu may also be identified with Uparichara Vasu of the Mahabharata (Adi Parva) where hs is described as the King of the Chedis who were ruling in the modern district of Balangir and Subarnapur.<ref>D. C. Sircar Ancient Geography of India</ref>\n\nBalangir region continued to be under the rule of Chedis during the 1st Century AD but in the 2nd century it came under the possession of the Satavahanas, whose king was Gautamiputra Satakarni. He is said to have built a magnificent vihara for his philosopher friend Nagarjuna on the ''Po Lo Mo Lo Ki Li'' or Parimalagir identified with the modern Gandharmardan hills.\n\n===Early history===\n[[Image:Chousatjogini.jpg|thumb|250px|''8th Century AD Chousath Jogini Temple, One out of the four such temple in India''.]]\nThe earliest noted history of Balangir district dates back to the third century BC. The earliest introduction and spread of Aryan religious practice in [[Dakshin Kosal|Dakhin Kosala]] came with the initial incursion of the Jain religion. According to [[Bhagavati Sutra]] and [[Harivamshapurana|Harivamsha Purana]], Mahavir started his earliest preaching of ''Dharma'' at Nalanda, Rajgriha, Paniya Bhumi and Siddharthagrama. According to some scholars, (D. C. Sircar) Punita Bhumi is a synonym of Paniya Bhumi as per ''Odra-Magadhi'' language. It is the same as Paniya Bhumi or Nagoloka, the present Nagpur, and it is further identified as Bhogapura, the modern Bastar, region of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Koraput]], [[Kalahandi]] and Balangir district of [[Odisha]].<ref>D. C. Sircar, Inscription of Orissa, Pg. 263</ref>\n\nIn some of the insctiptions found in Balangir and Sonepur district, it has been mentioned that this part of the land was known as Attavika during Ashoka's invasion of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] in 261 B.C.\n\nThe Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited ''Po Lo Mo Lo Ki Li'' monastery at modern Paikmal in the 7th Century AD. It was then having cloisters and lofty halls and those halls were arranged in five tiers each with four courts with temples containing life-size gold images of [[Buddha]]<ref>Yuan Chawng 'Journey of the West'</ref>\n\n[[Utkal University]] Archaeology Prof. Dr. Sadasiva Pradhan excavated the Gumagad site under Gudvela block near the Tel river valley in Balangir district, where he found that a strategic military hub existed in the 1st century BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kddf.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gumagod.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819082133/http://kddf.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gumagod.png |archivedate=2011-08-19 }}</ref> It was set up by a king contemporary to king Kharavela. Four copper plates were also found at Terssingha village which speaks of the Tel valley civilisation. Those plates had information regarding the two capitals \u2013 Udayapur and Parbatadwaraka \u2013 which were under the rule of Rashtrakutas and local chieftains belonging to different clans. The Udayapur area, the capital of Rashtrakuta kings, who ruled in the valley, still does have standing structures and also the ruins. These are mostly found at Amathgad. Ruins of a medieval fort is also found there.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101209/jsp/orissa/story_13275920.jsp | location=Calcutta, India | work=The Telegraph | title=Riverside kingdom traced in copper plates | date=December 9, 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026021832/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101209/jsp/orissa/story_13275920.jsp | archivedate=October 26, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to eminent historian and epigraphist Sadananda Agrawal, copper plates were recently found in Kapsila village near Balangir. The found materials were three copper plates tied together by a circular ring and issued by a king named Khadgasimha.

According to historians this area was known for its Tantra-Vidya throughout India. Somavanshi kings of Dakhin Koshal had built many temples here that can be dated back to the 8th-9th centuries AD. It is said that there were at least 200 temples covering an area of about half a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in width. The largest stone temple is '''Someswar Siva''', which was constructed by a Mattamayura Shaivacharya Gagana Siva whose inscription can be found on the lintel of the temple.\n\nRanipur-Jharial houses one among the five existing rare monuments of Hypaethral temples (temples without roofs) dedicated to 64 yoginis in India. The other three are at Hirapur near Bhubaneswar, Khajurao & Bheraghat near Jabalpur, and Dudhai near Lalitpur. The images at Ranipur-Jharial are made of sandstone. The temple of 64 yoginis of Ranipur-Jharial is famous not only for its architecture, but also for its religious significance. Three-faced Natraj Shiva idol stands at the centre of the temple encircled by 64 sculptures of the Yogini goddesses in various positions. Unfortunately with the curse of time, and also due to lack of care only 48 Yoginis are left by now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kosal.org/|title=kosal.org|website=www.kosal.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007103548/http://kosal.org/|archivedate=7 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Chouhan Rule===\n[[Image:FLAG patna.jpeg|thumb|250px|''Official flag of the Royal Family of [[Balangir]]]]\nRamai Deo founded the kingdom of Patna in 1360 AD, and within a short span of its aggressive career become the head of the cluster of eighteen Garhs.

Ex-[[Patna (princely state)|Patna State]] was one of the earliest states in India to have started industries as early as the end of the 17th Century.\n\nBelow is the list of industries existed during the pre-merger period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n* Koshal Transport and Trading Co.

They together form the district of Balangir. [[Sonepur District|Sonepur]] was carved out as a separate district on April 1, 1993. The last ruler of Patna, Rajendra Narayan Singh Deo successfully made the transition to democratic politics. He became the [[List of Chief Ministers of Odisha|Chief Minister of Odisha]] from 1967 until 1971.\n\n===Recent developments===\nCurrently people of this district along with the nine other districts of western [[Odisha]] are demanding for a separate state called Koshal. According to unofficial sources around 20,000 people are migrating from Balangir every year to other states in search of work. More than 90% population in this district are staying below poverty line.\n\nThere is an Ordnance Factory of the [[Ordnance Factories Board]] which manufactures products for the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nOverall this western district of Odisha needs quick improvement to catch up with the other parts of the state and country. The government needs to take care of special responsibility towards the development like construction of roads, buildings, education to the people, developments like railway and air connectivity. For instance the nearest airport from any part of the district is Bhubaneswar, Raipur or Visakhapatnam which are minimum 7 hours journey from Balangir. Also the standard of living of the people needs to be improved by providing the minimum requirements to the people by providing jobs to them so that migration of the people from this part to other parts of the country could be avoided. At the same time, social menaces like dowry killing, and unsocial activities like theft, burglary and murder could be kept in control.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, Annual Credit Plan for the year 2010-2011 was launched with a projected plan outlay of Rs. 309.97 crores. Special programmes are envisaged to arrest the flow of labour to other states in search of work, popularly known as ''Dadan Shramik''.\n\n==Geography==\nThe district of Balangir is flanked in the north-west by the Gandhamardan hills, a name of the Ramayana Fame, and in the north-east by the rock-infested Mahanadi. It is traversed by many hill streams and is interspersed with the evergreen woodlands, the shelter of Bison and Sambar. The main forest area stretches along the western boundary bordering the [[Nuapada]], [[Kalahandi district]] and then turns to the east running parallel to the Gandhamardan range. This forest track is broken by occasional clearings and small settlements, but it mostly consists of thick vegetation in which bamboo of excellent quality grows and Sal, Sahaj, Piasal, Dhaura and Ebony form the principal timber.

The district has an area of 5,165&nbsp;km\u00b2, and a population of 1,648,997 (2011 census). The town of [[Balangir]] is the district headquarters. The composition of the land is predominantly rural. Other important big & small towns in '''Balangir district''' are [[Titlagarh]], [[Patnagarh]], [[Kantabanji]], [[Loisinga|Loisingha]], [[Saintala]], Belpada, Tushra, [[Agalpur]], Deogaon, Chudapali, [[Biripali]], Bhalumunda, Bangomunda, Sindhekela, Turekela.\n\n== History ==\nThe district of Balangir is named after the headquarters towns of Balangir. This town was also the headquarters of the feudatory state of [[Patna (princely state)|Patna]] since the 1880s. The district of Balangir is flanked in the northwest by the Gandhamardan hills. Many hill streams traverse it. It is the land of [[Tantra|Tantrik]] culture. It is also notable for having experimented in the [[republic]]an form of Government that was overthrown by Ramai Deo.\n\n===Etymology===\n[[Image:Balangir palace.jpg|thumb|250px|''Royal Palace of [[Balangir]]]]\nBalaram Deo, the 19th Raja of [[Patna (princely state)]], founded a town called Balramgarh and shifted the capital of Patna state from [[Patnagarh]] to Balramgarh in the early 16th century. Subsequently, the town was renamed as Balangir from Balramgarh. After around 8 years of rule in Patna state, he was awarded the land from river Ang till the boundary of Bamra kingdom by his mother. Subsequently, he founded a kingdom named [[Sambalpur]], which went on to become a strong kingdom.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Orissa District Gazetteers: Balangir, Printed by the Superintendent, Orissa Government Press, 1966</ref>\n\n===Ancient History===\n[[Image:Indralath Temple.jpg|thumb|250px|''8th Century AD Indralath Temple at Ranipur-Jharial''.]]\nThe territory comprising the present district of Balangir was in ancient times a part of the [[South Kosala]] {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}. According to tradition, the origin of South Kosala dates back to the time of [[Rama]] and scholars like Pargiter believe that Rama's long stay in that region gave rise to the name of South Kosala after his original homeland Kosala. According to Padmapurana, the kingdom of Kosala, after Rama, was divided between '''Lava''' and '''Kusa''', his two son. Later Kusa founded the city of '''Kusasthalipura''' and ruled over the southern half of Kosala (that included modern day [[Western Odisha]] and [[Chhattisgarh]] State){{citation needed|date=October 2017}}.\n\nDuring the time of Grammarian [[P\u0101\u1e47ini|Panini]] (5th Century B.C), a territory named Taitila [[Janapada]] flourished to the west of Kalinga and that territory has been associated by historians with the modern town of [[Titlagarh]] in Balangir district. Taitala Janapada was famous for trade in some commodities described by the Grammarian as \"Kadru\" the meaning of which may be either horse or cotton fabrics.<ref>Panini's Ashtadyayi VI. 2. 42</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chetiya Jataka]], the capital of the [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]] country was '''Sothivatinagara''' which is the same as '''Suktimatipuri''' of [[Harivamsa]] and '''Suktisahvaya''' of the [[Mahabharata]] (Vana Parva). The epic (''Adi Parva'') also states that the capital of the Chedis was situated on the bank of river Suktimati which is the Sukhtel river of Balangir district<ref>D. C. Sircar Ancient Geography of India Pg.55</ref>\n\nThus the ancestors of King of Kalinga [[Kharavela]] were from the Balangir district as they were ruling over the territory drained by the Sukhtel river in Balangir, wherefrom they advanced towards the east and became the master of Kalinga by the 1st Century B.C. In the [[Hathigumpha inscription]], Kharavela refers to one Rajashri Vasu as his ancestor, who is probably the same as Vasu, the son of Abhichandra, the founder of Chedi Kingdom. This Vasu may also be identified with Uparichara Vasu of the Mahabharata (Adi Parva) where hs is described as the King of the Chedis who were ruling in the modern district of Balangir and Subarnapur.<ref>D. C. Sircar Ancient Geography of India</ref>\n\nBalangir region continued to be under the rule of Chedis during the 1st Century AD but in the 2nd century it came under the possession of the Satavahanas, whose king was Gautamiputra Satakarni. He is said to have built a magnificent vihara for his philosopher friend Nagarjuna on the ''Po Lo Mo Lo Ki Li'' or Parimalagir identified with the modern Gandharmardan hills.\n\n===Early history===\n[[Image:Chousatjogini.jpg|thumb|250px|''8th Century AD Chousath Jogini Temple, One out of the four such temple in India''.]]\nThe earliest noted history of Balangir district dates back to the third century BC. The earliest introduction and spread of Aryan religious practice in [[Dakshin Kosal|Dakhin Kosala]] came with the initial incursion of the Jain religion. According to [[Bhagavati Sutra]] and [[Harivamshapurana|Harivamsha Purana]], Mahavir started his earliest preaching of ''Dharma'' at Nalanda, Rajgriha, Paniya Bhumi and Siddharthagrama. According to some scholars, (D. C. Sircar) Punita Bhumi is a synonym of Paniya Bhumi as per ''Odra-Magadhi'' language. It is the same as Paniya Bhumi or Nagoloka, the present Nagpur, and it is further identified as Bhogapura, the modern Bastar, region of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Koraput]], [[Kalahandi]] and Balangir district of [[Odisha]].<ref>D. C. Sircar, Inscription of Orissa, Pg. 263</ref>\n\nIn some of the insctiptions found in Balangir and Sonepur district, it has been mentioned that this part of the land was known as Attavika during Ashoka\u2019s invasion of [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]] in 261 B.C.\n\nThe Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] visited ''Po Lo Mo Lo Ki Li'' monastery at modern Paikmal in the 7th Century AD. It was then having cloisters and lofty halls and those halls were arranged in five tiers each with four courts with temples containing life-size gold images of [[Buddha]]<ref>Yuan Chawng 'Journey of the West'</ref>\n\n[[Utkal University]] Archaeology Prof. Dr. Sadasiva Pradhan excavated the Gumagad site under Gudvela block near the Tel river valley in Balangir district, where he found that a strategic military hub existed in the 1st century BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kddf.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gumagod.png |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819082133/http://kddf.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/gumagod.png |archivedate=2011-08-19 }}</ref> It was set up by a king contemporary to king Kharavela.

According to historians this area was known for its Tantra-Vidya throughout India. Somavanshi kings of Dakhin Koshal had built many temples here that can be dated back to the 8th-9th centuries AD. It is said that there were at least 200 temples covering an area of about half a mile in length and a quarter of a mile in width. The largest stone temple is '''Someswar Siva''', which was constructed by a Mattamayura Shaivacharya Gagana Siva whose inscription can be found on the lintel of the temple.\n\nRanipur-Jharial houses one among the five existing rare monuments of Hypaethral temples (temples without roofs) dedicated to 64 yoginis in India. The other three are at Hirapur near Bhubaneswar, Khajurao & Bheraghat near Jabalpur, and Dudhai near Lalitpur. The images at Ranipur-Jharial are made of sandstone. The temple of 64 yoginis of Ranipur-Jharial is famous not only for its architecture, but also for its religious significance. Three-faced Natraj Shiva idol stands at the centre of the temple encircled by 64 sculptures of the Yogini goddesses in various positions. Unfortunately with the curse of time, and also due to lack of care only 48 Yoginis are left by now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kosal.org/|title=kosal.org|website=www.kosal.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007103548/http://kosal.org/|archivedate=7 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Chouhan Rule===\n[[Image:FLAG patna.jpeg|thumb|250px|''Official flag of the Royal Family of [[Balangir]]]]\nRamai Deo founded the kingdom of Patna in 1360 AD, and within a short span of its aggressive career become the head of the cluster of eighteen Garhs.

They together form the district of Balangir. [[Sonepur District|Sonepur]] was carved out as a separate district on April 1, 1993. The last ruler of Patna, Rajendra Narayan Singh Deo successfully made the transition to democratic politics. He became the [[List of Chief Ministers of Odisha|Chief Minister of Odisha]] from 1967 until 1971.\n\n===Recent developments===\nCurrently people of this district along with the nine other districts of western [[Odisha]] are demanding for a separate state called Koshal. According to unofficial sources around 20,000 people are migrating from Balangir every year to other states in search of work. More than 90% population in this district are staying below poverty line.\n\nThere is an Ordnance Factory of the [[Ordnance Factories Board]] which manufactures products for the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nOverall this western district of Odisha needs quick improvement to catch up with the other parts of the state and country. The government needs to take care of special responsibility towards the development like construction of roads, buildings, education to the people, developments like railway and air connectivity. For instance the nearest airport from any part of the district is Bhubaneswar, Raipur or Visakhapatnam which are minimum 7 hours journey from Balangir. Also the standard of living of the people needs to be improved by providing the minimum requirements to the people by providing jobs to them so that migration of the people from this part to other parts of the country could be avoided. At the same time, social menaces like dowry killing, and unsocial activities like theft, burglary and murder could be kept in control.\n\nOn May 13, 2010, Annual Credit Plan for the year 2010-2011 was launched with a projected plan outlay of Rs. 309.97 crores. Special programmes are envisaged to arrest the flow of labour to other states in search of work, popularly known as ''Dadan Shramik''.\n\n==Geography==\nThe district of Balangir is flanked in the north-west by the Gandhamardan hills, a name of the Ramayana Fame, and in the north-east by the rock-infested Mahanadi. It is traversed by many hill streams and is interspersed with the evergreen woodlands, the shelter of Bison and Sambar. The main forest area stretches along the western boundary bordering the [[Nuapada]], [[Kalahandi district]] and then turns to the east running parallel to the Gandhamardan range. This forest track is broken by occasional clearings and small settlements, but it mostly consists of thick vegetation in which bamboo of excellent quality grows and Sal, Sahaj, Piasal, Dhaura and Ebony form the principal timber. The crest of the range of Gandhamardan hills is fine platue, some ten miles long, with an average height of 3000 feet. For most part of this district lies on the north-west bank of river Tel, which form the boundary between his district and the district of [[Kalahandi]], [[Sonepur district|Sonepur]], [[Boudh district|Boudh]] and [[Kandhamal]].\n\n===Main rivers and tributaries===\n* [[Mahanadi]]\n* Tel\n* Undar, Lanth, Sungadh and Sukhtel (Tributaries of the Tel)\n* Ang\n* Jira\n* Saleshing\n\n===Hill System===\n[[Image:Matkhai.jpg|thumb|250px|''Mathkhai, The Sacred Hill on the outskirt of Balangir City also a Landmark of the District''.]]\n* Gandhamardan (3,296&nbsp;ft)\n* Butel (2,670&nbsp;ft)\n* Chahdli (2,630&nbsp;ft)\n* Thuta (2,056&nbsp;ft)\n* Bender (1,920&nbsp;ft)\n* Patpani\n* Chhatardandi\n* Matkhai (2,591)\n\n==Economy==\nIn 2006 the [[Ministry of Panchayati Raj]] named Balangir one of the country's 250 [[Poverty in India|most backward districts]] (out of a total of [[Districts of India|640]]).<ref name=brgf/> It is one of the 19 districts in [[Odisha]] currently receiving funds from the [[Backward Regions Grant Fund|Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme]] (BRGF).<ref name=brgf>{{cite web|author=Ministry of Panchayati Raj |date=September 8, 2009 |title=A Note on the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme |publisher=National Institute of Rural Development |url=http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |accessdate=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405033402/http://www.nird.org.in/brgf/doc/brgf_BackgroundNote.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Administrative setup==\nBolangir District has been divided into 3 Sub-Divisions and 14 Blocks.
