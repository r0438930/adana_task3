One day, Hannah saw a bird feeding its young while sitting in the shade of a tree, which awakened her desire to have children of her own. She prayed for a child and eventually conceived; her husband, [[Joachim#In Islam|Imran]], died before the child was born.

The oldest and most influential source for these is the apocryphal ''[[Gospel of James]]'', first written in [[Koine Greek]] around the middle of the second century AD.

This moment stood for the conception of Mary, and the feast was celebrated on the same day as the [[Immaculate Conception]]. Art works representing the Golden Gate and the events leading up to it were influenced by the narrative in the widely read ''Golden Legend'' of Jacobus de Voragine. The [[Nativity of Mary|Birth of Mary]], the [[Presentation of Mary]] and the [[Marriage of the Virgin]] were usual components of cycles of the Life of the Virgin in which Anne is normally shown here.\n\nHer emblem is a door.<ref name=crawley/> She is often portrayed wearing red and green, representing love and life.<ref name=\"Fongemie\" />\n\nAnne is never shown as present at the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]], but is frequently shown with the infant Christ in various subjects. She is sometimes believed to be depicted in scenes of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] and the [[Circumcision of Christ]], but in the former case, this likely reflects a misidentification through confusion with [[Anna the Prophetess]]. There was a tradition that Anne went (separately) to Egypt and rejoined the [[Holy Family]] after their [[Flight to Egypt]]. Anne is not seen with the adult Christ, so was regarded as having died during the youth of Jesus.<ref>Some writers gave her age at death, as part of a general family chronology, but no generally accepted tradition developed on this point, even during the Middle Ages.</ref> Anne is also shown as the matriarch of the [[Holy Kinship]], the extended family of Jesus, a popular subject in late medieval Germany; some versions of these pictorial and sculptural depictions include [[Emerentia]] who was reputed in the 15th Century to be Anne's mother. In modern devotions, Anne and her husband are invoked for protection for the unborn.\n\n===Virgin and Child with Saint Anne===\nThe role of the Messiah's grandparents in salvation history was commonly depicted in early medieval devotional art in a vertical double-Madonna arrangement known as the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]].

This moment stood for the conception of Mary, and the feast was celebrated on the same day as the [[Immaculate Conception]]. Art works representing the Golden Gate and the events leading up to it were influenced by the narrative in the widely read ''Golden Legend'' of Jacobus de Voragine. The [[Nativity of Mary|Birth of Mary]], the [[Presentation of Mary]] and the [[Marriage of the Virgin]] were usual components of cycles of the Life of the Virgin in which Anne is normally shown here.\n\nHer emblem is a door.<ref name=crawley/> She is often portrayed wearing red and green, representing love and life.<ref name=\"Fongemie\" />\n\nAnne is never shown as present at the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]], but is frequently shown with the infant Christ in various subjects. She is sometimes believed to be depicted in scenes of the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] and the [[Circumcision of Christ]], but in the former case, this likely reflects a misidentification through confusion with [[Anna the Prophetess]]. There was a tradition that Anne went (separately) to Egypt and rejoined the [[Holy Family]] after their [[Flight to Egypt]]. Anne is not seen with the adult Christ, so was regarded as having died during the youth of Jesus.<ref>Some writers gave her age at death, as part of a general family chronology, but no generally accepted tradition developed on this point, even during the Middle Ages.</ref> Anne is also shown as the matriarch of the [[Holy Kinship]], the extended family of Jesus, a popular subject in late medieval Germany; some versions of these pictorial and sculptural depictions include [[Emerentia]] who was reputed in the 15th Century to be Anne's mother. In modern devotions, Anne and her husband are invoked for protection for the unborn.\n\n===Virgin and Child with Saint Anne===\nThe role of the Messiah's grandparents in salvation history was commonly depicted in early medieval devotional art in a vertical double-Madonna arrangement known as the [[Virgin and Child with Saint Anne]].
