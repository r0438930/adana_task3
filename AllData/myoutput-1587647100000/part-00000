He is a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]], section mechanical and computer sciences<ref>{{cite web|title=Acad\u00e9mie des sciences|url=https://www.academie-sciences.fr/fr/Liste-des-membres-de-l-Academie-des-sciences-/-D/robert-dautray.html|date=}}</ref>, and of the [[French Academy of Technologies|French Academy of Technology]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Acad\u00e9mie des technologies|url=https://www.academie-technologies.fr/fr/members/299-robert-dautray|date=}}</ref>.\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in France, to a [[Belarus|Belarusian]] father who came to France in 1905 and a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] mother who came to France in 1902, he escaped the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].\n\nAfter the war, he prepared as a free candidate for the entrance exam to the [[\u00c9cole Nationale des Arts et M\u00e9tiers|\u00c9cole nationale des arts et m\u00e9tiers]]. He was awarded the top promotion in the promotion that entered Paris in 1945 (Pa45 promotion). On the advice of his professors, he passed the [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique|\u00c9cole polytechnique]] exam in 1949, where he graduated as a major, then joined the CEA/Saclay in the mathematical physics department headed by Jacques Yvon, Jules Horowitz, Albert Messiah, Anatole Abragam, Claude Bloch, Trocheris, etc...\n\nScientific Director of the CEA, he contributes to the development of atomic applications after scientific work on isotopic regulation and the construction of [[Experimental reactor|experimental reactors]] ([[Grenoble]] high flux reactor). He is working on the process of separating [[Isotopes of uranium|uranium isotopes]]. He is the director of the Ph\u00e9bus large laser program. Robert Dautray was High Commissioner for Atomic Energy from 1993 to 1998.\n\nRobert Dautray recounted his memories, especially his difficult youth, in his book of Memoirs, published in 2007<ref>Robert Dautray, M\u00e9moires, du Vel d'Hiv \u00e0 la bombe H, Paris, Odile Jacob, 2007</ref>. Chairman of the Scientific Programs Committee of the National Space Center (CNES).\n\nHe also addressed the problems of climate change (radiative transfer: [[greenhouse effect]])<ref>Robert Dautray et Jacques Lesourne, L'humanit\u00e9 face au changement climatique, Paris, Odile Jacob, 2009</ref>\n\n== Scientific work ==\nAlmost all of Robert Dautray's professional activity has been devoted to the [[Physical Sciences|physical sciences]] contributing to [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]], both in reactor physics (reactor control and command, breeder reactor physics, Pegasus research reactors, high-flow reactors from the Von Laue Langevin Institute, etc.) and in the physics of reactors.) and upstream of the fuel cycle (control command of the uranium isotope separation plant) as well as downstream of this cycle (formation and physics of [[plutonium]] and other [[Actinide|actinides]] isotopes, descendants of fission products, activated structure nuclei, etc.).\n\nIn addition, Robert Dautray participated in the establishment of the basic physical sciences for the sciences of high densities and powers of materials and electromagnetic radiation (state equations, opacity, radiative transfer, discontinuities of high velocity flows, interface instabilities, laser implosions, [[Thermonuclear reaction|thermonuclear reactions]], non-linear neutronics of high velocity media of nuclei making the neutron transport and plasma physics equations non-linear, etc.).\n\nRobert Dautray has contributed to the development of the mathematical methods necessary to model these phenomena. Robert Dautray co-chaired with the [[\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France|EDF]] Studies and Research Department the CEA/EDF digital analysis summer schools.\n\nThere was a controversy over the attribution to R. Dautray of the paternity of the French [[H-bomb]]. Experts dispute it, highlighting Michel Carayol's work (see for example [[Pierre Billaud]], La v\u00e9ridique histoire de la bombe H fran\u00e7aise, La Pens\u00e9e universelle, 1994 and the website <nowiki>http://www.bombehlaverite.com</nowiki>[archive]).
