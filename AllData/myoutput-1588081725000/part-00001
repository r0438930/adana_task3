It was the second of three Disney animated features (the others being ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]'') produced primarily at the Florida animation studio located at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (known as \"Disney-MGM Studios\" during production) in [[Walt Disney World]] near [[Orlando, Florida]].<ref name=\"DisneyWar-Lilo\">{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=James B. |title=DisneyWar |date=2005 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780743283908 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0/page/472 472]\u2013473 |language=en |quote=Weeks later, on January 12, Disney announced that it was shutting down its Orlando animation unit, where ''Lilo & Stitch'' had been created.|url=https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0|url-access=registration }}</ref> It was released on June 21, 2002, to positive reviews and was nominated for the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. That Academy Award was won by [[Studio Ghibli]]'s 2001 film ''[[Spirited Away]]'', which was also distributed in the United States by Walt Disney Pictures, and also starred Chase and Stiers in the English version.\n\nThe film's story revolves around two [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] and [[mischief|mischievous]] individuals: a young Hawaiian girl named [[Lilo Pelekai]], who is raised by her older sister Nani after their parents died in a car accident, and a blue [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial animal-like creature]] named Experiment 626, who gets adopted by Lilo as her \"dog\" and is given the name \"Stitch\". Stitch, who is genetically engineered by his scientist creator to cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid being captured by an intergalactic federation, but the two individuals develop a close bond through the Hawaiian concept of ''{{okina}}[[ohana]]'', or [[extended family]]. This bond causes Stitch to reconsider, and later defy, his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his family together.\n\nThe success of the film spawned a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|franchise]]. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' was released on August 26, 2003. This was followed by a television series, ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', which ran from September 20, 2003, to July 29, 2006. A second direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', was released on August 30, 2005. A third sequel, a [[television film]] titled ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', was released on June 23, 2006, as the conclusion to the TV series. An [[anime]] series that succeeded the original television series called ''[[Stitch!]]'' ran in Japan from October 8, 2008, to June 19, 2011, with [[Television special|TV specials]] broadcast in 2012 and 2015. A [[Chinese animated series]] succeeding the ''Stitch!'' anime, ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'', ran from March 27 to April 6, 2017.\n\nOther animation studios produced the sequel films and series: ''Stitch! The Movie'', ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'', and ''Leroy & Stitch'' were all produced by [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]]; ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' was produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]]; ''Stitch!'' was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and then [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season (and two post-series specials); and ''Stitch & Ai'' was produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media.\n\nA [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action remake]] of the film entered development on February 2020, and will be released on [[Disney+]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:MOSFILM, plot summaries should be in the range of 400-700 words. Please do not add more detail, but adjust what is already present. -->\nOn [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i, Hawaii]], a young woman named Nani Pelekai works as a waitress. One day, a social worker named Cobra Bubbles expresses increasing concern whether Nani is able to take adequate care of her rambunctious, disobedient, and lonely younger sister, Lilo. Since Lilo has been ostracized by her hula classmates, Nani decides to let her adopt a dog. At an [[animal shelter]], Lilo immediately takes a keen interest in \"Experiment 626\", a small blue sentient alien with unparalleled intelligence and strength, but also a propensity to cause chaos, who is impersonating a dog. In spite of Nani's doubts, Lilo calls 626 \"[[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]]\", and shows him around the island.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Jumba Jookiba, an extraterrestrial [[mad scientist]] who was arrested and put on trial by the Galactic Federation for illegal genetic experimentation, as evidenced by Stitch, and Agent Pleakley, the Council's Earth expert, got sent by their boss, the Grand Councilwoman, to capture Stitch. That evening, at the restaurant where Nani works, They try, but fail every time, to capture him. The indescribable chaos is blamed on Stitch, which results in Nani getting fired. The next day, Cobra warns her that unless she finds another job, he will have to place Lilo with a foster family. However, Stitch's antics, which occur in the course of his evasion of his two pursuers, persistently ruin Nani's chances of finding work.\n\nNani's friend David invites her, Lilo, and Stitch to enjoy a day of surfing. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch ride a huge wave, Jumba makes one final effort to capture Stitch from underwater, causing Stitch to unintentionally pull Lilo underwater. They survive, but Cobra witnesses this event and tells Nani that, although she means well, Lilo has to be taken away unless Nani finds another job. Seeing how much trouble he has caused, Stitch runs off into the night.\n\nThe next morning, the Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley from their assignment and gives it to the galaxy's oversized militant captain, Captain Gantu (incidentally freeing Jumba to pursue Stitch using less covert methods). Meanwhile, David informs Nani of a job opportunity, which she excitedly rushes off to pursue. Stitch, hiding in the nearby woods, encounters Jumba, who chases him back to Nani's house. A fight ensues which destroys the house; Cobra arrives to collect Lilo and take her away.\n\nAs Nani and Cobra argue, Lilo runs away into the woods and finds Stitch, who reveals his alien identity just before they are captured by Gantu. Stitch manages to escape from Gantu's ship and is confronted by Nani. Before he can explain, Jumba and Pleakley capture Stitch themselves. Nani demands that they help her rescue Lilo, but Jumba insists they only came for Stitch. When Nani breaks down, Stitch reminds her about {{okina}}[[ohana]], a term for \"family\" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue Lilo. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani all board Jumba's personal spaceship and chase after Gantu, rescuing Lilo.\n\nBack on the shore, the Grand Councilwoman arrives on Earth preparing to take Stitch into custody and is forced to retire Gantu for putting Lilo in danger and blames Jumba for the mess. However, Lilo insists that because Stitch is her pet under local law, he cannot be taken away. The Grand Councilwoman is so impressed with Stitch's newfound civility and empathy that she goes against the prior decision of the Federation and decrees that Stitch will live in a peaceful exile on Earth. He will be entrusted to the care of Lilo and Nani, and the Councilwoman asks Cobra, who is revealed to be a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent that she previously met in 1973, to watch over them.\n\nLilo, Nani, and their newfound friends rebuild their house, and Jumba and Pleakley become members of Nani, Lilo, and Stitch's family, and they all build a new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Lilo & Stitch characters}}\n* [[Chris Sanders]] as [[Stitch (Disney)|Experiment 626/Stitch]], a blue [[koala]]-like illegal [[genetic engineering|genetic experiment]] with the ability to create untold chaos.

[[Chris Sanders]], a head [[storyboard artist]] at Disney Feature Animation, was approached to pitch an idea. Sanders had created the character of Stitch in 1985 for an unsuccessful children's book pitch, and had to now develop a concept that featured the character in an animated film.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The story line required a remote, non-urban location, so the movie was originally intended to take place in [[Kansas]].<ref name=\"DavisHanaHou\">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.hanahou.com/pages/magazine.asp?Action=DrawArticle&ArticleID=389&MagazineID=24 |title=Disney Goes Hawaiian |first=Pat |last=Davis |journal=[[Hana Hou!]] |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=April\u2013May 2002}}</ref> Sanders's decision to change the film's setting to the Hawaiian island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] was an important choice in defining the plot more clearly. No other animated feature had ever taken place on any of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian islands]] before.<ref name=\"DavisHanaHou\"/> In Sanders's words:\n\n{{quote|Animation has been set so much in ancient, medieval Europe&nbsp;\u2014 so many [[fairy tale]]s find their roots there, that to place it in Hawai{{okina}}i was kind of a big leap. But that choice went to color the entire movie, and rewrite the story for us.}}\n\n===Writing===\n[[Dean DeBlois]], who had co-written ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' (1998) with Chris Sanders, was brought on to co-write and co-direct ''Lilo & Stitch'', while Disney executive Clark Spencer was assigned to produce. Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions, the film's pre-production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production.<ref name=\"RM\">{{Cite news|last=Moore |first=Roger |coauthors= |title=Lilo & Stitch, Disney Feature Animation Florida's finest hour--remembered (originally published as \"For Disney's Orlando animators, it's show time!\" on 2002-06-16) |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |location=[[Orlando, Florida]] |pages= |publisher=[[Tribune Media]] |date=2009-04-01 |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |accessdate= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024025330/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |archivedate=2012-10-24}}</ref> The character and set designs were based upon Sanders's personal artistic style.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nWhile the animation team visited [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] to research the locale, their tour guide explained the meaning of ''[[ohana|{{okina}}ohana]]'' as it applies to [[Extended family|extended families]]. This concept of {{okina}}ohana became an important part of the movie. DeBlois recalls:\n\n{{quote|No matter where we went, our tour guide seemed to know somebody. He was really the one who explained to us the Hawaiian concept of {{okina}}ohana, a sense of family that extends far beyond your immediate relatives. That idea so influenced the story that it became the foundation theme, the thing that causes Stitch to evolve despite what he was created to do, which is destroy.}}\n\nThe island of Kaua{{okina}}i had also been featured in such films as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', and those from the [[Jurassic Park (franchise)|''Jurassic Park'' trilogy]]. The Disney animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film's plot, which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then-recent [[Recession|economic downturn]], with the island's serene beauty. The actors voicing the film's young adults, Nani and David, were [[Tia Carrere]], a local of [[Honolulu]], and [[Jason Scott Lee]], who is of Hawaiian descent and was raised in Hawaii. The voice actors assisted with rewriting the Hawaiian characters' dialogue in the proper [[Colloquialism|colloquial dialect]], and also with the task of adding Hawaiian slang terms.\n\nOne innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters: Lilo and Nani. Making the relationship between sisters into a major plot element is very rare in [[American animation|American animated films]].<ref name=\"Solomon\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Charles|title=The Art of Frozen|year=2013|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-4521-1716-4}}</ref>{{rp|13}}\n\n===Design and animation===\nIn a deviation from several decades' worth of Disney features, Sanders and DeBlois chose to use watercolor painted backgrounds for ''Lilo & Stitch'', as opposed to the traditional [[gouache]] technique.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> While watercolors had been used for the early Disney animated shorts, as well as the early Disney features ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), the technique had been largely abandoned by the mid-1940s in favor of less complicated media such as [[gouache]]. Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for ''Lilo & Stitch'' to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of ''Dumbo'', requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The character designs were based around Sanders's personal drawing style, eschewing the traditional Disney house style.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The film's extraterrestrial elements, such as the spaceships, were designed to resemble marine life, such as whales and crabs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elemental Magic: The Art of Special Effects Animation |first1=Joseph |last1=Gilland |year=2009 |publisher=Focal Press (Elsevier, Inc.) |isbn=978-0-240-81163-5 |page=256 }}</ref>\n\n===Marketing===\nTeaser [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for the film parody trailers for other [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films|Disney films]] (three of which Sanders previously worked on) from the [[Disney Renaissance]]: ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''  and ''[[The Lion King]]''. These are called \"Inter-Stitch-als\" and are featured on Disney's official site as well as on the film's respective DVD release. The original actors were brought back to reprise their roles and were shocked when asked to act negatively towards Stitch. The trailers also include the [[AC/DC]] song track \"[[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]].\" In the United Kingdom, ''Lilo & Stitch'' trailers and TV ads featured a cover of Elvis' song \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", performed by [[Gareth Gates]], who became famous on the UK TV program ''[[Pop Idol]]''. In the US, \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" was used for both theatrical and TV trailers. The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of \"Disney Family [[Black sheep|Black Sheep]]\". As a promotional campaign, comics of ''Lilo & Stitch'' were run in ''[[Disney Adventures]] ''prior to the film's release. The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters, including the creation and escape of Stitch. These events were later contradicted by the sequel ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'' rendering the comics non-canonical, but is notable to the series as introducing Experiment 625, [[Reuben (Lilo & Stitch)|Reuben]], who was made a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series. The comic series has been released as a collective volume titled ''Comic Zone Volume 1: Lilo & Stitch''.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nSeveral major elements of the film changed during production. Originally, [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]] was the leader of an intergalactic gang, and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> Test audience response to early versions of the film resulted in the change of Stitch and Jumba's relationship to that of creation and creator, respectively.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nThe biggest change came to the film's third act, which had Stitch, Nani, Jumba and Pleakley hijacking a [[Boeing 747]] jet from [[Lihue Airport]] and flying it through downtown [[Honolulu]] to save Lilo. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], this sequence was revised so that Stitch instead flew a spaceship through the mountains of Kaua{{okina}}i. This revision was done primarily by replacing the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model of the 747 with that of Jumba's spaceship, with only a few shots in the sequence fully re-animated.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nAnother scene that was deleted was one of Lilo's attempts to make Stitch into a model citizen by notifying tourists on the beach about the [[tsunami]] warning sirens, which she knows are being tested that day. The original version of Jumba attacking Stitch in Lilo's home was found to be too violent by test audiences, and was revised to make it more comedic. There was also a scene in which Lilo introduces Stitch to Pudge the fish, which ultimately leads to the fish's death. Lilo then takes Pudge's body to the same graveyard where her parents were buried, and thus Stitch learns the consequences of his actions and gains a better understanding of mortality.\n\nA scene was removed where Nani brings Lilo pizza and then Lilo tells herself a bedtime story about a friendly and stinky bear named Toaster. It was replaced with the scene where Lilo and Nani talk about being family because test audiences had mistaken Nani for Lilo's mother. The trial scene originally had Stitch as the defendant, and Jumba is not present. This was changed because of the film directors thought the Intergalactic Council had to blame him for creating Stitch.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' opened in second place with $35.3 million in its first weekend, less than $500,000 behind the film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]''. In its second week it fell to third, again behind the [[Steven Spielberg]] film coming in second. The film earned $145.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million globally.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=Lilo & Stitch|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lilostitch.htm|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> [[Box Office Mojo]] estimates that the film sold over 25 million tickets during its original run.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' received largely positive reception. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that the film has an 86% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating based on 145 reviews, with an average score of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Edgier than traditional Disney fare, Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lilo_and_stitch/|title=Lilo & Stitch (2002)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The film has also earned a score of 73 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lilo-stitch|title=Lilo & Stitch|work=Metacritic|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and wrote \"It's one of the most charming feature-length cartoons of recent years\u2014funny, sassy, startling, original and with six songs by Elvis\".<ref>http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lilo-and-stitch-2002</ref> The film's success spawned a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]], with three sequel films and three television series.\n\nPeter M. Nichols states that through the character of [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and her struggles, the film appeals to older children better than such attempts by the studio to do so as ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', and ''[[Treasure Planet]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies|first1=Peter M.|last1=Nichols|year=2003|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7198-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/childrensmoviesc00nich/page/152 152\u2013154]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/childrensmoviesc00nich/page/152}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on December 3, 2002.

A 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of Lilo & Stitch was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on August 22, 2005, along with the UK release of ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'' (2005), but a release in the US was affected by many delays. On March 24, 2009, Disney finally released the special edition DVD, which is called a 2-Disc \"Big Wave Edition\".

The Movie]]'', which served as the pilot to a television series titled ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. This series ran for 65 episodes between September 20, 2003 and July 29, 2006. The series carried on where the film left off and charted Lilo and Stitch's efforts to capture and rehabilitate Jumba's remaining experiments. The series, as well as the original parts of the franchise that focused on Lilo Pelekai and were set in Hawaii, ended with the television film ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', which aired on June 23, 2006.\n\nOn August 30, 2005, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', another direct-to-video sequel to the film, was released. In this film ([[Sequel#Interquel|set between]] ''Lilo & Stitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''), Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is contrary to an alternate opening, \"Stitch's trial\", which was seen on the DVD release of ''Lilo & Stitch''). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have outbursts. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as his glitch causes more problems for her and ruins her chances of winning the competition. She thinks Stitch is not cooperating properly, until she finds out that Stitch is dying. The ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch'' DVD also contained a short film, ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', that served as a bridge between ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''.\n\nIn March 2008, Disney announced an [[anime]] based on the ''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise aimed at the Japanese market titled ''[[Stitch!]]''. The anime, which ran as a series from October 2008 to March 2011, features a Japanese girl named Yuna Kamihara in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in [[Okinawa Prefecture]] instead of Hawaii. This series was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season and two post-series specials in 2012 and 2015.\n\nIn March 2017, a third animated television series based on the franchise titled ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'' debuted in China. Like with the ''Stitch!'' anime, it features a local girl named Wang Ai Ling instead of Lilo, and is set in the [[Huangshan]] mountains. Unlike ''Stitch!'', however, this series was originally produced in English in co-operation with American animators (including those who worked on ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'') and then dubbed into its local language. ''Stitch & Ai'' is produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media.\n\n==Live-action adaptation==\nIn October 2018, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Walt Disney Pictures]] is developing a live-action remake of ''Lilo & Stitch''. It was also announced that the film will be produced by ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'' producers [[Dan Lin]] and Jonathan Eirich and written by Mike Van Waes.<ref name=\"live-action-thr\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811?|title='Lilo & Stitch' Live-Action Remake in the Works at Disney (Exclusive)|last=Kit|first=Borys|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=2018-10-03|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> On February 4, 2020, it was reported that the remake will be released on Disney's streaming service, [[Disney+]],<ref name=\"Disney+\">{{Cite news|url=https://thedisinsider.com/2020/02/04/exclusive-lilo-stitch-disney/|title=Exclusive: Disney\u2019s Live-Action \u2018Lilo & Stitch\u2019 Will Head To Disney+|last=Shuler|first=Skyler|work=The DisInsider|date=February 4, 2020|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and that [[Chris Sanders]] will reprise his role as the voice of Stitch.

Stitch is also a summonable character in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III|III]]'', and appears along with his homeworld in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. Lilo and Stitch both appear in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Disney Magical World]]'' and [[Disney Magical World 2|its sequel]]. Stitch is also a playable character in the [[Disney Infinity (series)|''Disney Infinity'' series]] in the second game, ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]'', and the series' third and final game, ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''. He was also a meet and greet character in ''[[Kinect: Disneyland Adventures]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Disney|Film|Animation|Cartoon}}\n* [[List of films featuring extraterrestrials]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{Official website|http://movies.disney.com/lilo-stitch}}<!--Older official site: http://disney.go.com/disneyvideos/animatedfilms/liloandstitch/index.html , archived at the wayback machine -->\n* {{Amg movie|262609}}\n* {{bcdb|23323-Lilo_amp_Stitch}}\n* {{IMDb title|0275847}}\n* {{mojo title|lilostitch}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|lilo_and_stitch}}\n\n{{Lilo & Stitch}}\n{{Chris Sanders}}\n{{Dean DeBlois}}\n{{Disney theatrical animated features}}\n{{Walt Disney Animation Studios}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lilo and Stitch}}\n[[Category:Lilo & Stitch| ]]\n[[Category:2002 animated films]]\n[[Category:2002 science fiction films]]\n[[Category:2002 films]]\n[[Category:2000s American animated films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:2000s comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:2000s science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:American animated science fiction films]]\n[[Category:American buddy films]]\n[[Category:American children's animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:American comedy-drama films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction comedy films]]\n[[Category:Animated buddy films]]\n[[Category:Animated comedy films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about orphans]]\n[[Category:Animated films about extraterrestrial life]]\n[[Category:Annie Award winners]]\n[[Category:Films about children]]\n[[Category:Films about dysfunctional families]]\n[[Category:Films about families]]\n[[Category:Films about sisters]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into television programs]]\n[[Category:Films adapted into video games]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Chris Sanders]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Dean DeBlois]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Alan Silvestri]]\n[[Category:Films set in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Chris Sanders]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Dean DeBlois]]\n[[Category:Impact of the September 11 attacks on cinema]]\n[[Category:Surfing films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Animation Studios films]]\n[[Category:Walt Disney Pictures films]]\n[[Category:2000s children's animated films]]\n[[Category:2002 directorial debut films]]\n[[Category:Animated films about friendship]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the animated film|the TV series|Lilo & Stitch: The Series|the franchise|Lilo & Stitch (franchise)}}\n{{short description|2002 Disney animated science fiction comedy-drama film written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois}}\n{{use mdy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Lilo & Stitch\n| image          = LiloandStitchmovieposter.jpg\n| caption        = Theatrical release poster\n| director       = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Chris Sanders]]\n* [[Dean DeBlois]]\n}}\n| producer       = [[Clark Spencer]]\n| screenplay     = {{Plainlist|\n* Chris Sanders\n* Dean DeBlois\n}}\n| story          = Chris Sanders\n| starring       = {{Plainlist|\n* Chris Sanders\n* [[Daveigh Chase]]\n* [[Tia Carrere]]\n* [[Ving Rhames]]\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]]\n* [[Kevin McDonald]]\n* [[Jason Scott Lee]]\n* [[Zoe Caldwell]]\n* [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]\n* Kunewa Mook\n}}\n| music          = [[Alan Silvestri]]\n| editing        = [[Darren T.

It was the second of three Disney animated features (the others being ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'' and ''[[Brother Bear]]'') produced primarily at the Florida animation studio located at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (known as \"Disney-MGM Studios\" during production) in [[Walt Disney World]] near [[Orlando, Florida]].<ref name=\"DisneyWar-Lilo\">{{cite book |last1=Stewart |first1=James B. |title=DisneyWar |date=2005 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9780743283908 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0/page/472 472]\u2013473 |language=en |quote=Weeks later, on January 12, Disney announced that it was shutting down its Orlando animation unit, where ''Lilo & Stitch'' had been created.|url=https://archive.org/details/disneywar00jame_0|url-access=registration }}</ref> It was released on June 21, 2002, to positive reviews and was nominated for the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. That Academy Award was won by [[Studio Ghibli]]'s 2001 film ''[[Spirited Away]]'', which was also distributed in the United States by Walt Disney Pictures, and also starred Chase and Stiers in the English version.\n\nThe film's story revolves around two [[eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] and [[mischief|mischievous]] individuals: a young Hawaiian girl named [[Lilo Pelekai]], who is raised by her older sister Nani after their parents died in a car accident, and a blue [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial animal-like creature]] named Experiment 626, who gets adopted by Lilo as her \"dog\" and is given the name \"Stitch\". Stitch, who is genetically engineered by his scientist creator to cause chaos and destruction, initially uses Lilo to avoid being captured by an intergalactic federation, but the two individuals develop a close bond through the Hawaiian concept of ''{{okina}}[[ohana]]'', or [[extended family]]. This bond causes Stitch to reconsider, and later defy, his intended destructive purpose in order to keep his family together.\n\nThe success of the film spawned a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|franchise]]. A [[direct-to-video]] sequel called ''[[Stitch! The Movie]]'' was released on August 26, 2003. This was followed by a television series, ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'', which ran from September 20, 2003, to July 29, 2006. A second direct-to-video sequel, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', was released on August 30, 2005. A third sequel, a [[television film]] titled ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', was released on June 23, 2006, as the conclusion to the TV series. An [[anime]] series that succeeded the original television series called ''[[Stitch!]]'' ran in Japan from October 8, 2008, to June 19, 2011, with [[Television special|TV specials]] broadcast in 2012 and 2015. A [[Chinese animated series]] succeeding the ''Stitch!'' anime, ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'', ran from March 27 to April 6, 2017.\n\nOther animation studios produced the sequel films and series: ''Stitch! The Movie'', ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'', and ''Leroy & Stitch'' were all produced by [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]]; ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' was produced by [[Disneytoon Studios]]; ''Stitch!'' was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and then [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season (and two post-series specials); and ''Stitch & Ai'' was produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media.\n\nA [[List of Disney live-action remakes of animated films|live-action remake]] of the film entered development on February 2020, and will be released on [[Disney+]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:MOSFILM, plot summaries should be in the range of 400-700 words. Please do not add more detail, but adjust what is already present. -->\nOn [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i, Hawaii]], a young woman named Nani Pelekai works as a waitress. One day, a social worker named Cobra Bubbles expresses increasing concern whether Nani is able to take adequate care of her rambunctious, disobedient, and lonely younger sister, Lilo. Since Lilo has been ostracized by her hula classmates, Nani decides to let her adopt a dog. At an [[animal shelter]], Lilo immediately takes a keen interest in \"Experiment 626\", a small blue sentient alien with unparalleled intelligence and strength, but also a propensity to cause chaos, who is impersonating a dog. In spite of Nani's doubts, Lilo calls 626 \"[[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]]\", and shows him around the island.\n\nMeanwhile, Dr. Jumba Jookiba, an extraterrestrial [[mad scientist]] who was arrested and put on trial by the Galactic Federation for illegal genetic experimentation, as evidenced by Stitch, and Agent Pleakley, the Council's Earth expert, got sent by their boss, the Grand Councilwoman, to capture Stitch. That evening, at the restaurant where Nani works, They try, but fail every time, to capture him. The indescribable chaos is blamed on Stitch, which results in Nani getting fired. The next day, Cobra warns her that unless she finds another job, he will have to place Lilo with a foster family. However, Stitch's antics, which occur in the course of his evasion of his two pursuers, persistently ruin Nani's chances of finding work.\n\nNani's friend David invites her, Lilo, and Stitch to enjoy a day of surfing. While Nani, Lilo, and Stitch ride a huge wave, Jumba makes one final effort to capture Stitch from underwater, causing Stitch to unintentionally pull Lilo underwater. They survive, but Cobra witnesses this event and tells Nani that, although she means well, Lilo has to be taken away unless Nani finds another job. Seeing how much trouble he has caused, Stitch runs off into the night.\n\nThe next morning, the Councilwoman fires Jumba and Pleakley from their assignment and gives it to the galaxy's oversized militant captain, Captain Gantu (incidentally freeing Jumba to pursue Stitch using less covert methods). Meanwhile, David informs Nani of a job opportunity, which she excitedly rushes off to pursue. Stitch, hiding in the nearby woods, encounters Jumba, who chases him back to Nani's house. A fight ensues which destroys the house; Cobra arrives to collect Lilo and take her away.\n\nAs Nani and Cobra argue, Lilo runs away into the woods and finds Stitch, who reveals his alien identity just before they are captured by Gantu. Stitch manages to escape from Gantu's ship and is confronted by Nani. Before he can explain, Jumba and Pleakley capture Stitch themselves. Nani demands that they help her rescue Lilo, but Jumba insists they only came for Stitch. When Nani breaks down, Stitch reminds her about {{okina}}[[ohana]], a term for \"family\" he learned from Lilo, and convinces Jumba to help rescue Lilo. Jumba, Pleakley, Stitch, and Nani all board Jumba's personal spaceship and chase after Gantu, rescuing Lilo.\n\nBack on the shore, the Grand Councilwoman arrives on Earth preparing to take Stitch into custody and is forced to retire Gantu for putting Lilo in danger and blames Jumba for the mess. However, Lilo insists that because Stitch is her pet under local law, he cannot be taken away. The Grand Councilwoman is so impressed with Stitch's newfound civility and empathy that she goes against the prior decision of the Federation and decrees that Stitch will live in a peaceful exile on Earth. He will be entrusted to the care of Lilo and Nani, and the Councilwoman asks Cobra, who is revealed to be a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent that she previously met in 1973, to watch over them.\n\nLilo, Nani, and their newfound friends rebuild their house, and Jumba and Pleakley become members of Nani, Lilo, and Stitch's family, and they all build a new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{Main|List of Lilo & Stitch characters}}\n* [[Chris Sanders]] as [[Stitch (Disney)|Experiment 626/Stitch]], a blue [[koala]]-like illegal [[genetic engineering|genetic experiment]] with the ability to create untold chaos.

[[Chris Sanders]], a head [[storyboard artist]] at Disney Feature Animation, was approached to pitch an idea.

Unlike several previous and concurrent Disney Feature Animation productions, the film's pre-production team remained relatively small and isolated from upper management until the film went into full production.<ref name=\"RM\">{{Cite news|last=Moore |first=Roger |coauthors= |title=Lilo & Stitch, Disney Feature Animation Florida's finest hour--remembered (originally published as \"For Disney's Orlando animators, it's show time!\" on 2002-06-16) |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |location=[[Orlando, Florida]] |pages= |publisher=[[Tribune Media]] |date=2009-04-01 |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |accessdate= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024025330/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_movies_blog/2009/04/lilo-stitch-disney-feature-animation-floridas-finest-hourremembered.html |archivedate=2012-10-24}}</ref> The character and set designs were based upon Sanders's personal artistic style.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nWhile the animation team visited [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] to research the locale, their tour guide explained the meaning of ''[[ohana|{{okina}}ohana]]'' as it applies to [[Extended family|extended families]]. This concept of {{okina}}ohana became an important part of the movie. DeBlois recalls:\n\n{{quote|No matter where we went, our tour guide seemed to know somebody. He was really the one who explained to us the Hawaiian concept of {{okina}}ohana, a sense of family that extends far beyond your immediate relatives. That idea so influenced the story that it became the foundation theme, the thing that causes Stitch to evolve despite what he was created to do, which is destroy.}}\n\nThe island of Kaua{{okina}}i had also been featured in such films as ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', and those from the [[Jurassic Park (franchise)|''Jurassic Park'' trilogy]]. The Disney animators faced the daunting task of meshing the film's plot, which showed the impoverished and dysfunctional life that many Hawaiians lived during the then-recent [[Recession|economic downturn]], with the island's serene beauty. The actors voicing the film's young adults, Nani and David, were [[Tia Carrere]], a local of [[Honolulu]], and [[Jason Scott Lee]], who is of Hawaiian descent and was raised in Hawaii. The voice actors assisted with rewriting the Hawaiian characters' dialogue in the proper [[Colloquialism|colloquial dialect]], and also with the task of adding Hawaiian slang terms.\n\nOne innovative and unique aspect of the film is its strong focus on the relationship between two sisters: Lilo and Nani. Making the relationship between sisters into a major plot element is very rare in [[American animation|American animated films]].<ref name=\"Solomon\">{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Charles|title=The Art of Frozen|year=2013|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-4521-1716-4}}</ref>{{rp|13}}\n\n===Design and animation===\nIn a deviation from several decades' worth of Disney features, Sanders and DeBlois chose to use watercolor painted backgrounds for ''Lilo & Stitch'', as opposed to the traditional [[gouache]] technique.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> While watercolors had been used for the early Disney animated shorts, as well as the early Disney features ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' (1937), ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), and ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941), the technique had been largely abandoned by the mid-1940s in favor of less complicated media such as [[gouache]]. Sanders preferred that watercolors be used for ''Lilo & Stitch'' to evoke both the bright look of a storybook and the art direction of ''Dumbo'', requiring the background artists to be trained in working with the medium.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The character designs were based around Sanders's personal drawing style, eschewing the traditional Disney house style.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The film's extraterrestrial elements, such as the spaceships, were designed to resemble marine life, such as whales and crabs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Elemental Magic: The Art of Special Effects Animation |first1=Joseph |last1=Gilland |year=2009 |publisher=Focal Press (Elsevier, Inc.) |isbn=978-0-240-81163-5 |page=256 }}</ref>\n\n===Marketing===\nTeaser [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for the film parody trailers for other [[List of Walt Disney Pictures films|Disney films]] (three of which Sanders previously worked on) from the [[Disney Renaissance]]: ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]''  and ''[[The Lion King]]''. These are called \"Inter-Stitch-als\" and are featured on Disney's official site as well as on the film's respective DVD release. The original actors were brought back to reprise their roles and were shocked when asked to act negatively towards Stitch. The trailers also include the [[AC/DC]] song track \"[[Back in Black (song)|Back in Black]].\" In the United Kingdom, ''Lilo & Stitch'' trailers and TV ads featured a cover of Elvis' song \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", performed by [[Gareth Gates]], who became famous on the UK TV program ''[[Pop Idol]]''. In the US, \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" was used for both theatrical and TV trailers. The marketing campaign presented Stitch as the sort of \"Disney Family [[Black sheep|Black Sheep]]\". As a promotional campaign, comics of ''Lilo & Stitch'' were run in ''[[Disney Adventures]] ''prior to the film's release. The comics detailed events leading up to the film for both title characters, including the creation and escape of Stitch. These events were later contradicted by the sequel ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'' rendering the comics non-canonical, but is notable to the series as introducing Experiment 625, [[Reuben (Lilo & Stitch)|Reuben]], who was made a main character in the subsequent movies and TV series. The comic series has been released as a collective volume titled ''Comic Zone Volume 1: Lilo & Stitch''.\n\n===Deleted scenes===\nSeveral major elements of the film changed during production. Originally, [[Stitch (Disney)|Stitch]] was the leader of an intergalactic gang, and [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] was one of his former cronies summoned by the Intergalactic Council to capture Stitch.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> Test audience response to early versions of the film resulted in the change of Stitch and Jumba's relationship to that of creation and creator, respectively.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nThe biggest change came to the film's third act, which had Stitch, Nani, Jumba and Pleakley hijacking a [[Boeing 747]] jet from [[Lihue Airport]] and flying it through downtown [[Honolulu]] to save Lilo. Following the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], this sequence was revised so that Stitch instead flew a spaceship through the mountains of Kaua{{okina}}i. This revision was done primarily by replacing the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] model of the 747 with that of Jumba's spaceship, with only a few shots in the sequence fully re-animated.<ref name=\"BTS\" />\n\nAnother scene that was deleted was one of Lilo's attempts to make Stitch into a model citizen by notifying tourists on the beach about the [[tsunami]] warning sirens, which she knows are being tested that day. The original version of Jumba attacking Stitch in Lilo's home was found to be too violent by test audiences, and was revised to make it more comedic. There was also a scene in which Lilo introduces Stitch to Pudge the fish, which ultimately leads to the fish's death. Lilo then takes Pudge's body to the same graveyard where her parents were buried, and thus Stitch learns the consequences of his actions and gains a better understanding of mortality.\n\nA scene was removed where Nani brings Lilo pizza and then Lilo tells herself a bedtime story about a friendly and stinky bear named Toaster. It was replaced with the scene where Lilo and Nani talk about being family because test audiences had mistaken Nani for Lilo's mother. The trial scene originally had Stitch as the defendant, and Jumba is not present. This was changed because of the film directors thought the Intergalactic Council had to blame him for creating Stitch.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' opened in second place with $35.3 million in its first weekend, less than $500,000 behind the film ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]''. In its second week it fell to third, again behind the [[Steven Spielberg]] film coming in second. The film earned $145.8 million in the United States and Canada, and $127.3 million internationally, totaling $273.1 million globally.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|title=Lilo & Stitch|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lilostitch.htm|accessdate=January 5, 2012}}</ref> [[Box Office Mojo]] estimates that the film sold over 25 million tickets during its original run.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical reception===\n''Lilo & Stitch'' received largely positive reception. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported that the film has an 86% \"Certified Fresh\" approval rating based on 145 reviews, with an average score of 7.3/10. The site's consensus reads, \"Edgier than traditional Disney fare, Lilo and Stitch explores issues of family while providing a fun and charming story.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lilo_and_stitch/|title=Lilo & Stitch (2002)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=July 12, 2009}}</ref> The film has also earned a score of 73 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lilo-stitch|title=Lilo & Stitch|work=Metacritic|accessdate=January 7, 2012}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and wrote \"It's one of the most charming feature-length cartoons of recent years\u2014funny, sassy, startling, original and with six songs by Elvis\".<ref>http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lilo-and-stitch-2002</ref> The film's success spawned a [[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise]], with three sequel films and three television series.\n\nPeter M. Nichols states that through the character of [[Nani Pelekai|Nani]] and her struggles, the film appeals to older children better than such attempts by the studio to do so as ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'', ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', and ''[[Treasure Planet]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New York Times Essential Library: Children's Movies|first1=Peter M.|last1=Nichols|year=2003|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|isbn=0-8050-7198-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/childrensmoviesc00nich/page/152 152\u2013154]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/childrensmoviesc00nich/page/152}}</ref>\n\n===Home media===\nThe film was released on VHS and DVD on December 3, 2002. In 2003, a 2-disc [[DVD]] version was announced to come out along with ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951) and ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995), which were released in 2004 and 2005. A 2-Disc Special Edition DVD of Lilo & Stitch was released in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on August 22, 2005, along with the UK release of ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'' (2005), but a release in the US was affected by many delays. On March 24, 2009, Disney finally released the special edition DVD, which is called a 2-Disc \"Big Wave Edition\". This new DVD has everything that the original DVD had and adds an audio commentary, a 2-hour documentary, more deleted scenes, a number of behind-the-scenes featurettes, and some games.\n\n====Altered scene====\nA scene was modified for the UK home video release.<ref>{{cite web|author=\"Bravia\"|url=https://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=4868\\|title=Lilo & Stitch (Comparison: BBFC U - US DVD)|website=Movie-Censorship.com|accessdate=2020-03-26|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the original, Lilo hid in a clothes dryer, which was changed to a commode to avoid influencing children to hide in dryers.<ref name=\"CinemaBlend edited scene\">{{cite web|last=Holmes|first=Adam|title=Yes, Disney Apparently Edited A Lilo And Stitch Scene, And Fans Are Freaking|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2493332/yes-disney-apparently-edited-a-lilo-and-stitch-scene-and-fans-are-freaking|website=CinemaBlend|accessdate=2020-03-26|date=2020-03-25|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The UK edit was later used for the film's [[Disney+]] release.<ref name=\"CinemaBlend edited scene\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Lilo & Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n<!-- Commented out: | cover      = Lilo & Stitch Soundtrack.jpg -->\n| caption    = {{deletable image-caption|Friday, 15 February 2019|PROD}}\n| alt        =\n| released   = June 11, 2002\n| recorded   = 2001-2002\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Rock music|Rock]], [[country rock]], [[Pop music|pop]]\n| length     = 34:47\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   = Chris Montan <small>(executive)</small>\n| chronology = ''[[Lilo & Stitch (franchise)|Lilo & Stitch]]'' music\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title = [[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch#Soundtrack|Lilo & Stitch 2: Island Favorites]]\n| next_year  = 2005\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Walt Disney Records discography|Walt Disney Animation Studios]]\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[Atlantis: The Lost Empire (soundtrack)|Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]\n | prev_year  = 2001\n | title      = Lilo & Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n | year       = 2002\n | next_title = [[Treasure Planet]]\n | next_year  = 2002\n}}{{Singles\n | name        = Lilo & Stitch\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[Can't Help Falling in Love#A-Teens version|Can't Help Falling in Love]]\n | single1date = October 29, 2002\n}}\n}}\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r592478}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''''Lilo & Stitch: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack''''' is the soundtrack to [[Disney]]'s 2002 animated feature ''Lilo & Stitch''.

The Movie]]'', which served as the pilot to a television series titled ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]''. This series ran for 65 episodes between September 20, 2003 and July 29, 2006. The series carried on where the film left off and charted Lilo and Stitch's efforts to capture and rehabilitate Jumba's remaining experiments. The series, as well as the original parts of the franchise that focused on Lilo Pelekai and were set in Hawaii, ended with the television film ''[[Leroy & Stitch]]'', which aired on June 23, 2006.\n\nOn August 30, 2005, ''[[Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch]]'', another direct-to-video sequel to the film, was released. In this film ([[Sequel#Interquel|set between]] ''Lilo & Stitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''), Stitch has a glitch because his molecules were never fully charged (this is contrary to an alternate opening, \"Stitch's trial\", which was seen on the DVD release of ''Lilo & Stitch''). Lilo wants to win the May Day hula contest like her mother did in the 1970s, but Stitch continues to have outbursts. Lilo gets increasingly mad at Stitch as his glitch causes more problems for her and ruins her chances of winning the competition. She thinks Stitch is not cooperating properly, until she finds out that Stitch is dying. The ''Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch'' DVD also contained a short film, ''[[The Origin of Stitch]]'', that served as a bridge between ''Stitch Has a Glitch'' and ''Stitch! The Movie''.\n\nIn March 2008, Disney announced an [[anime]] based on the ''Lilo & Stitch'' franchise aimed at the Japanese market titled ''[[Stitch!]]''. The anime, which ran as a series from October 2008 to March 2011, features a Japanese girl named Yuna Kamihara in place of Lilo, and is set on a fictional island in [[Okinawa Prefecture]] instead of Hawaii. This series was produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] for its first two seasons, and [[Shin-Ei Animation]] for its third season and two post-series specials in 2012 and 2015.\n\nIn March 2017, a third animated television series based on the franchise titled ''[[Stitch & Ai]]'' debuted in China. Like with the ''Stitch!'' anime, it features a local girl named Wang Ai Ling instead of Lilo, and is set in the [[Huangshan]] mountains. Unlike ''Stitch!'', however, this series was originally produced in English in co-operation with American animators (including those who worked on ''Lilo & Stitch: The Series'') and then dubbed into its local language. ''Stitch & Ai'' is produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media.\n\n==Live-action adaptation==\nIn October 2018, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that [[Walt Disney Pictures]] is developing a live-action remake of ''Lilo & Stitch''.

Stitch is also a summonable character in ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III|III]]'', and appears along with his homeworld in ''[[Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep]]'' for the [[PlayStation Portable]]. Lilo and Stitch both appear in the [[Nintendo 3DS]] game ''[[Disney Magical World]]'' and [[Disney Magical World 2|its sequel]]. Stitch is also a playable character in the [[Disney Infinity (series)|''Disney Infinity'' series]] in the second game, ''[[Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes]]'', and the series' third and final game, ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]''.
