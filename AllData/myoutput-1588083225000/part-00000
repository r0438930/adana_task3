It was called National College of Business (NCB) and was located in a downtown Rapid City building. In 1960, Jacobson had the building that now houses administration for the Rapid City campus constructed at 321 Kansas City Street and moved National College to that location.\n\nIn 1962, NCB was acquired by Harold D. Buckingham and members of his family.

Senior college accreditation was granted in 1970.\n\nThe 1970s brought growth, with the addition of several branch locations in the Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions. This trend toward reaching out to other communities resumed in the 90s with the addition of more campuses nationwide. \n\nIn 1985, NCB earned [[School accreditation|accreditation]] by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (now called the [[Higher Learning Commission]]).\n\nThe university began offering online classes in 1996.\n\nIn 1997 National College of Business became National American University.\n\nIn 2009, National American University became part of National American University Holdings, a publicly traded corporation. \n\nIn 2012, the main Rapid City location was moved to Mount Rushmore Rd., south of Rapid City, which also houses the university's central administration offices.\n\n===Recent Changes===\n\nIn 2017, National American University purchased Henley-Putnam School of Strategic Security. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/22/1444247/0/en/National-American-University-Holdings-Inc-Announces-Closing-of-the-Henley-Putnam-University-Transaction-Provides-Update-on-Operational-Consolidations.html |title=National American University Holdings, Inc.
