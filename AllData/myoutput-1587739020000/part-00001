An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].\n\n{{As of|2020|01}}, IMDb has approximately {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum:6,534,894 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> titles (including episodes) and {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum: 10,378,806 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> personalities in its database,<ref name=\"stats\"/> as well as 83 million registered users.\n\nIMDb began as a movie database on the [[Usenet]] group \"rec.arts.movies\" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.\n\n==Features==\nThe movie and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all internet users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.\n\nMost data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting factual data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.\n\nAll registered users choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a ''profile page'' which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, \"badges\" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb ''page'', then that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in IMDbPRO.<ref>{{cite web |title=Submission guide for users |series=Help Center |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=2&file=contact_information&ref_=hlp_sr_1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages.\n\nUsers are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]]-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter [[ballot-stuffing]].\n\nIn January 2019, IMDb launched a free movie streaming platform called Freedive, an [[ad-supported]] service offering Hollywood movie titles and TV shows. Many Freedive titles are licensed from [[Sony Pictures]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Mehta |first=Ivan |url=https://thenextweb.com/world/2019/01/11/amazons-new-imdb-freedive-service-streams-ad-supported-movies-and-tv-shows-in-the-us/ |title=Amazon's new IMDb Freedive service streams ad-supported movies and TV shows in the US |work=[[The Next Web]] |date=2019-01-11 |accessdate=2019-01-11 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===History before website===\nIMDb originated with a [[Usenet]] posting entitled \"Those Eyes\", by the British film fan and computer programmer [[Col Needham]],<ref>{{cite newsgroup\n | title = Re: Frequently Asked Questions List (2/28/90)\n | author = Jeff Dalton\n | date = 1 March 1990 \n | newsgroup = rec.arts.movies\n | message-id = 1892@skye.ed.ac.uk\n | url = https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.arts.movies/_3XDw1YOp6A/11SgWWh24wsJ\n | access-date = 13 August 2019\n }}</ref> about actresses with beautiful eyes. Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List\", while Dave Knight began a \"[[film director|Directors]] List\", and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List\". Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors/Actresses List\". Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\n\nBy late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000&nbsp;movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of [[Unix]] [[shell script]]s that could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chmielewski |first=Dawn C. |date=January 19, 2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/business/la-fi-himi-needham-20130120 |title=Col Needham created IMDb |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> At the time, it was known as the \"rec.arts.movies movie database\".\n\n===On the web===\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, in 1993, it moved onto the fledgling [[World Wide Web]] under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |title=Historical Internet Movie Database Site |publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science & Informatics |access-date=March 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324121844/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in Wales. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[Web mirror|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB History |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===As an independent company===\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. founder Col&nbsp;Needham became the primary owner.

On January 15, 2002, it added a subscription service known as IMDbPro, aimed at entertainment professionals. IMDbPro was announced and launched at the 2002 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It provides a variety of services including film production and box office details, a company directory, and the ability of subscribers to add personal information pages with details at variance.\n\nAs an additional incentive for users, {{as of|2003|lc=y}}, users identified as one of \"the top 100&nbsp;contributors\" of hard data received complimentary free access to IMDbPro for the following calendar year; for 2006 this was increased to the top&nbsp;150 contributors, and for 2010 to the top&nbsp;250.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/updates/guide/top_contributors#top2010 |series=IMD; announcement |title=Top&nbsp;250 contributors for 2010 |access-date=August 25, 2011 |first=Col |last=Needham |date=January 1, 2011 |website=IMDb}}</ref> In 2008, IMDb launched their first official foreign-language version with the German IMDb.de.

IMDbPro can be accessed by anyone willing to pay the fee, which is US$19.99&nbsp;per month, or if paid annually, US$149.99. Membership enables a user to access the rank order of each industry personality, as well as agent contact information for any actor, producer, director etc. that has an IMDb page. Enrolling in IMDbPro enables members who are industry personnel to upload a head shot to open their page, as well as to upload hundreds of photos to accompany their page. Anyone can register as an IMDb user and contribute to the site as well as view its content; however those users enrolled in IMDbPro have greater access and privileges.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://secure.imdb.com/signup/index.html |title=IMDbPro signup |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n==Characters' filmography==\nOn October 2, 2007,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} the characters' filmography was added. Character entries are created from character listings in the main filmography database, and as such do not need any additional verification by IMDb staff. They have already been verified when they are added to the main filmography.\n\n==IMDb TV==\nOn January 10, 2019, IMDb launched Freedive, a [[streaming service]] that offers certain films free with [[advertisements]]. Due to international licensing restrictions, the service currently is only available in the [[United States]] as of 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazons-imdb-launches-freedive-free-movie-tv-streaming-service-ads/|title=Amazon's IMDb launches Freedive, a free movie and TV streaming service \u2014 with ads|date=2019-01-10|website=GeekWire|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\nFreedive was the company's second attempt at a streaming service.

Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like  [[Discogs]], or [[OpenStreetMap]], or [[Wikipedia]], in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/interfaces#plain |title=The plain text data files |series=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: \"We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an 'edit page.'

Since 2007, IMDb has been experimenting with wiki-programmed sections for complete film synopses, parental guides, and FAQs about titles as determined by (and answered by) individual contributors.\n\n===Data format and access===\nIMDb does not provide an [[Web API|API]] for automated queries. However, most of the data can be downloaded as [[data compression|compressed]] plain text files and the information can be extracted using the [[command-line interface]] tools provided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/interfaces |title=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb |access-date=January 15, 2007}}</ref> There is also a Java-based [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information.<ref name=\"jmdb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.de/ |title=Java Movie Database (JMDB) |website=Jmdb.de |access-date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb.

The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb's [[English language]] sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and USA to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).\n\n==Ancillary features==\n===User ratings of films===\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a [[rating scale]] that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten. It has been alleged that the rating system is flawed, for several reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/imdbs-top-250-discussion/|title=Why IMDb's Top&nbsp;250 matters ... and why it doesn't |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=April 13, 2010 |access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a [[weighted mean]] that is displayed for each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used to avoid [[ballot stuffing]]; the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.\n\n====Rankings====\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. {{As of|2019|10|21}}, ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' is #1 on the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/top |title=Top&nbsp;250 movies as voted by our users |publisher=IMDb |access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The \"Top&nbsp;250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top&nbsp;250 list they \"''deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter''\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=1&file=notintop250 |title=The user votes average on film or show ''X'' is 9.4, so it should appear in your Top&nbsp;250 Movies or TV list, yet it doesn't. Why? |website=IMDb}}</ref> In addition to other weightings, the Top&nbsp;250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in [[actuarial science]] as a ''credibility formula''.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |title=Encyclopedia of Actuarial Science |last=Norberg |first=Ragnar |doi=10.1002/9780470012505.tac068 |chapter=Credibility Theory |year=2006 |isbn=0470846763|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515175331/http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf|archive-date=May 15, 2004}}</ref> This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB's statement on their voting calculation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4Ze0vwNLI |website=imdb.com |access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB Vote FAQ |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<math display=\"block\">W = \\frac{\\ R \\cdot v + C \\cdot m\\ }{v + m} </math>\nwhere:\n*<math>W\\ </math> = weighted rating\n*<math>R\\ </math> = average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)\n*<math>v\\ </math> = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\n*<math>m\\ </math> = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25,000)\n*<math>C\\ </math> = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)\n\nThe <math>W\\ </math> in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (''see [[Bayesian statistics]]'').\n\nThe IMDb also has a Bottom&nbsp;100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 1500&nbsp;votes must be received to qualify for the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom |title=Bottom&nbsp;100 |publisher=IMDb |access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Top&nbsp;250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV&nbsp;episodes are not currently included.\n\nSince 2015, there has been a Top&nbsp;250 list devoted to ranking television shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/ |title=Top&nbsp;250 TV |website=IMDb |access-date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Message boards===\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, TV episodes<ref>Each TV episode uses the same message board for the whole series</ref>) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. In order to post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company [[Amazon.com]].

An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].\n\n{{As of|2020|01}}, IMDb has approximately {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum:6,534,894 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> titles (including episodes) and {{Formatnum: {{#expr: {{Formatnum: 10,378,806 |R}} / 1e6 round 1}}}} million<!--Condensed values per MOS:LARGENUM--> personalities in its database,<ref name=\"stats\"/> as well as 83 million registered users.\n\nIMDb began as a movie database on the [[Usenet]] group \"rec.arts.movies\" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.\n\n==Features==\nThe movie and talent pages of IMDb are accessible to all internet users, but a registration process is necessary to contribute information to the site.\n\nMost data in the database is provided by volunteer contributors. The site enables registered users to submit new material and edits to existing entries. Users with a proven track record of submitting factual data are given instant approval for additions or corrections to cast, credits, and other demographics of media product and personalities. However, image, name, character name, plot summaries, and title changes are supposedly screened before publication, and usually take between 24 and 72 hours to appear.\n\nAll registered users choose their own site name, and most operate anonymously. They have a ''profile page'' which shows how long a registered user has been a member, as well as personal movie ratings (should the user decide to display them) and, since 2015, \"badges\" are added representing how many contributions a particular registered user has submitted. These badges range from total contributions made to independent categories such as photos, trivia, bios, etc. If a registered user or visitor is in the entertainment industry and has an IMDb ''page'', then that user/visitor can add photos to that page by enrolling in IMDbPRO.<ref>{{cite web |title=Submission guide for users |series=Help Center |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=2&file=contact_information&ref_=hlp_sr_1 |website=IMDb}}</ref> There is no single index of contributors, no index on each profile page of the items contributed, and (except for plot synopses and biographies) no identification of contributors to each product's or person's data pages.\n\nUsers are also invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|weighted mean]]-rating that is displayed beside each title, with online filters employed to deter [[ballot-stuffing]].\n\nIn January 2019, IMDb launched a free movie streaming platform called Freedive, an [[ad-supported]] service offering Hollywood movie titles and TV shows.

Others with similar interests soon responded with additions or different lists of their own. Needham subsequently started an \"Actors List\", while Dave Knight began a \"[[film director|Directors]] List\", and Andy Krieg took over \"THE LIST\" from Hank Driskill, which would later be renamed the \"Actress List\". Both lists had been restricted to people who were alive and working, but soon retired people were added, so Needham started what was then (but did not remain) a separate \"Dead Actors/Actresses List\". Steve Hammond started collecting and merging character names for both the actors and actresses lists. When these achieved popularity, they were merged back into the lists themselves. The goal of the participants now was to make the lists as inclusive as possible.\n\nBy late 1990, the lists included almost 10,000&nbsp;movies and television series correlated with actors and actresses appearing therein. On October 17, 1990, Needham developed and posted a collection of [[Unix]] [[shell script]]s that could be used to search the four lists, and thus the database that would become the IMDb was born.<ref>{{cite news |last=Chmielewski |first=Dawn C. |date=January 19, 2013 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/19/business/la-fi-himi-needham-20130120 |title=Col Needham created IMDb |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> At the time, it was known as the \"rec.arts.movies movie database\".\n\n===On the web===\nThe database had been expanded to include additional categories of filmmakers and other demographic material as well as trivia, biographies, and plot summaries. The movie ratings had been properly integrated with the list data, and a centralized email interface for querying the database had been created by Alan Jay. Later, in 1993, it moved onto the fledgling [[World Wide Web]] under the name of ''Cardiff Internet Movie Database''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |title=Historical Internet Movie Database Site |publisher=Cardiff School of Computer Science & Informatics |access-date=March 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324121844/http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/movies/ |archivedate=March 24, 2013}}</ref> The database resided on the servers of the computer science department of [[Cardiff University]] in Wales. [[Rob Hartill]] was the original web interface author. In 1994, the email interface was revised to accept the submission of all information, which enabled people to email the specific list maintainer with their updates. However, the structure remained so that information received on a single film was divided among multiple section managers, the sections being defined and determined by categories of film personnel and the individual filmographies contained therein. Over the next few years, the database was run on a network of [[Web mirror|mirrors]] across the world with donated bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB History |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?history |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\n===As an independent company===\nIn 1996 IMDb was incorporated in the United Kingdom, becoming the Internet Movie Database Ltd. founder Col&nbsp;Needham became the primary owner.

Conversely, a credited text entry, such as a plot summary, may be corrected for content, grammar, sentence structure, perceived omission or error, by other contributors without having to add their names as co-authors. Due to the time required for processing submitted data or text before it is displayed, IMDb is different from user-contributed projects like  [[Discogs]], or [[OpenStreetMap]], or [[Wikipedia]], in that contributors cannot add, delete, or modify the data or text on impulse, and the manipulation of data is controlled by IMDb technology and salaried staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/interfaces#plain |title=The plain text data files |series=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIMDb has been subject to deliberate additions of false information; in 2012 a spokesperson said: \"We make it easy for users and professionals to update much of our content, which is why we have an 'edit page.'

However, most of the data can be downloaded as [[data compression|compressed]] plain text files and the information can be extracted using the [[command-line interface]] tools provided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://imdb.com/interfaces |title=Alternate Interfaces |website=IMDb |access-date=January 15, 2007}}</ref> There is also a Java-based [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) application available that is able to process the compressed plain text files, which allows a search and a display of the information.<ref name=\"jmdb\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jmdb.de/ |title=Java Movie Database (JMDB) |website=Jmdb.de |access-date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> This GUI application supports different languages, but the movie related data are in English, as made available by IMDb.

The non-English language sites display film titles in the specified language. Originally, IMDb's [[English language]] sites displayed titles according to their original country-of-origin language, however, in 2010 IMDb began allowing individual users in the UK and USA to choose primary title display by either the original-language titles, or the US or UK release title (normally, in English).\n\n==Ancillary features==\n===User ratings of films===\nAs one adjunct to data, the IMDb offers a [[rating scale]] that allows users to rate films on a scale of one to ten. It has been alleged that the rating system is flawed, for several reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/imdbs-top-250-discussion/|title=Why IMDb's Top&nbsp;250 matters ... and why it doesn't |publisher=Screenrant.com |date=April 13, 2010 |access-date=February 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIMDb indicates that submitted ratings are filtered and weighted in various ways in order to produce a [[weighted mean]] that is displayed for each film, series, and so on. It states that filters are used to avoid [[ballot stuffing]]; the method is not described in detail to avoid attempts to circumvent it. In fact, it sometimes produces an extreme difference between the weighted average and the arithmetic mean.\n\n====Rankings====\nThe IMDb Top 250 is a list of the top rated 250 films, based on ratings by the registered users of the website using the methods described. {{As of|2019|10|21}}, ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'' is #1 on the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/top |title=Top&nbsp;250 movies as voted by our users |publisher=IMDb |access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The \"Top&nbsp;250\" rating is based on only the ratings of \"regular voters\". The number of votes a registered user would have to make to be considered as a user who votes regularly has been kept secret. IMDb has stated that to maintain the effectiveness of the Top&nbsp;250 list they \"''deliberately do not disclose the criteria used for a person to be counted as a regular voter''\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/search?domain=helpdesk_faq&index=1&file=notintop250 |title=The user votes average on film or show ''X'' is 9.4, so it should appear in your Top&nbsp;250 Movies or TV list, yet it doesn't. Why? |website=IMDb}}</ref> In addition to other weightings, the Top&nbsp;250 films are also based on a weighted rating formula referred to in [[actuarial science]] as a ''credibility formula''.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf |title=Encyclopedia of Actuarial Science |last=Norberg |first=Ragnar |doi=10.1002/9780470012505.tac068 |chapter=Credibility Theory |year=2006 |isbn=0470846763|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040515175331/http://stats.lse.ac.uk/norberg/links/papers/CRED-eas.pdf|archive-date=May 15, 2004}}</ref> This label arises because a statistic is taken to be more credible the greater the number of individual pieces of information; in this case from eligible users who submit ratings. Although the current formula is not disclosed, IMDb originally used the following formula to calculate their weighted rating:<ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB's statement on their voting calculation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE4Ze0vwNLI |website=imdb.com |access-date=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=IMDB Vote FAQ |url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?votestopfaq |website=IMDb.com |accessdate=February 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n<math display=\"block\">W = \\frac{\\ R \\cdot v + C \\cdot m\\ }{v + m} </math>\nwhere:\n*<math>W\\ </math> = weighted rating\n*<math>R\\ </math> = average for the movie as a number from 1 to 10 (mean) = (Rating)\n*<math>v\\ </math> = number of votes for the movie = (votes)\n*<math>m\\ </math> = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 25,000)\n*<math>C\\ </math> = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 7.0)\n\nThe <math>W\\ </math> in this formula is equivalent to a Bayesian posterior mean (''see [[Bayesian statistics]]'').\n\nThe IMDb also has a Bottom&nbsp;100 feature which is assembled through a similar process although only 1500&nbsp;votes must be received to qualify for the list.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom |title=Bottom&nbsp;100 |publisher=IMDb |access-date=March 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Top&nbsp;250 list comprises a wide range of feature films, including major releases, cult films, independent films, critically acclaimed films, silent films, and non-English-language films. Documentaries, short films and TV&nbsp;episodes are not currently included.\n\nSince 2015, there has been a Top&nbsp;250 list devoted to ranking television shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv/ |title=Top&nbsp;250 TV |website=IMDb |access-date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Message boards===\nBeginning in 2001, the Internet Movie Database also maintained message boards for every title (excepting, {{as of|2013|lc=y}}, TV episodes<ref>Each TV episode uses the same message board for the whole series</ref>) and name entry, along with over 140 main boards. In order to post on the message boards a user needed to \"authenticate\" their account via cell phone, credit card, or by having been a recent customer of the parent company [[Amazon.com]]. Message boards expanded in recent years. The Soapbox started in 1999 as a general message board meant for debates on any subjects.
