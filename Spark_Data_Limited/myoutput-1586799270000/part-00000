He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.\n\nA [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 [[winning percentage]] in 1957, going 16\u20136, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and was moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10\u201310. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.\n\nDonovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.\n\n==Early life==\nDonovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until his senior year, when he switched positions and became a [[pitcher]]. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an [[exhibition game]]. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching attracted the attention of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher\u201d he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school.

However, he failed to make the team out of spring training this time, and the Braves tried to send him to their new AAA affiliate, the [[Toledo Mud Hens]].

He batted left-handed and threw right-handed, stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in}} tall and weighed {{convert|190|lb}}.\n\nA [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] native, Donovan graduated from [[North Quincy High School]] and served in the [[United States Navy]] during and after [[World War II]]. Signed by the hometown Braves, he reached the major leagues in 1950 but was used sporadically over the next several years. While pitching for the minor league [[Atlanta Crackers]], he learned how to throw a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and this helped him claim a spot in the White Sox' rotation in 1955. He was an [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] in his first major league season, winning 15 games with only nine losses. In 1956, he led the [[American League]] (AL) with a 1.155 [[walks plus hits per innings pitched]]. He led the AL with a .727 [[winning percentage]] in 1957, going 16\u20136, and he won 15 games for the White Sox in 1958. He pitched in the [[1959 World Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], losing Game 3 but earning the [[Save (baseball)|save]] in Game 5. Donovan struggled in 1960 and was moved to the [[bullpen]], then got selected in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft|expansion draft]] by the Senators after the season. He had his best year with the new club in 1961, leading the AL with a 2.40 [[earned run average]] (ERA), though his won-loss record was just 10\u201310. Traded to the Indians for [[Jimmy Piersall]] after the season, he won 20 games his first year with Cleveland. Donovan pitched three more years for the Indians after that before getting released midway through 1965. Following his baseball career, he sold insurance and held other jobs in the [[Quincy, Massachusetts]] area before dying of cancer in 1997.\n\nDonovan was unusually good at hitting for a pitcher, homering 15 times in his big-league career.\n\n==Early life==\nDonovan was the youngest of five children of Jeremiah and Gertrude Donovan. He grew up in Boston and attended [[North Quincy High School]], where he played [[shortstop]] until his senior year, when he switched positions and became a [[pitcher]]. Donovan also pitched for the [[Catholic Youth Organization]]. [[Ken Coleman]], broadcaster for the [[Cleveland Indians]], told the story that once, Donovan was invited to pitch for the [[American Legion]] All-Star team in an [[exhibition game]]. Upon arriving at the park, he was told that he would merely be used in the [[bullpen]]. Protesting that he had been promised more, Donovan left the field and went home. \"To me, this incident typified the makeup of Dick. He still has the determination to do what he thinks is right, and has the wonderful ability to see the humor in a situation,\" Coleman said.<ref name=\"SABR\">{{cite web|last=Wancho|first=Joseph|url=https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/af5aebda|title=Dick Donovan|work=SABR|accessdate=March 26, 2020}}</ref> Donovan's pitching attracted the attention of [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]' scout Jeff Jones, who signed him after his senior year and proclaimed him \"the fire-ballingest pitcher\u201d he had seen since spotting [[Bob Feller]] pitching in high school. Donovan graduated during [[World War II]], though, and he served three years in the [[United States Navy]] before beginning his professional career in 1947.<ref name=\"SABR\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nDonovan's career started far south of his home, with the [[Fort Lauderdale Braves]] of the [[Class C (baseball)|Class C]] [[Florida International League]]. He had a 7\u201315 [[Win-loss record (pitching)|record]] and a 4.17 [[earned run average]] (ERA) in his first professional season but still got promoted to the [[Class B (baseball)|Class B]] [[Evansville Braves]] of the [[Illinois-Indiana-Iowa League]].
