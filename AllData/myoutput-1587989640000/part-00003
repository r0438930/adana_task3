At or near the Roman settlement of '''Pontibus''', it became '''Stanes''' and then '''Staines'''. The town lies within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county boundaries]] of [[Middlesex]], being transferred to Surrey in 1965.\n\nThe town is inside the [[M25 motorway]], {{convert|17|miles|km}} south-west of [[Charing Cross]]. It is within the [[London Commuter Belt]] and the [[Greater London Urban Area]], and adjoins part of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt|Green Belt]]. Passing along the edge of the town and crossing [[Staines Bridge]] is the [[Thames Path National Trail]].\n\nThe larger Staines-upon-Thames [[post town]] includes the villages of [[Stanwell]], [[Laleham]] and [[Wraysbury]]. Owing to the long association of Staines Bridge with a medieval causeway ([[levee]]) on the opposite bank of the river, the post town also includes part of [[Egham Hythe]], which contains a significant business area within the county, and some of the town's oldest [[listed building]]s.\n\nThe long-standing parish boundaries are those of a [[strip parish]] that ranges from {{convert|12|to|17|m|0}} above sea level.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The low is by the [[River Thames|Thames]] furthest south, to in the north meadows east of the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]].}} Staines-upon-Thames has many parks, leisure centres, a football club and several multinational research/technology company offices.

Pontibus, Latin for \"at the bridges\" in the early 3rd-century [[Antonine Itinerary]], has long been guessed to refer to Staines, but that may be wrong since the Itinerary's mileages actually point some distance away (possibly to the south end of Virginia Water Lake).

The stadium was also used for greyhound racing, as well as 'novelty' events such as cheetah racing.\n\nStaines Stadium was famous from 1955 to 1960 during the early days of [[Stock car racing in the United Kingdom|stock car racing in England]], and featured in the 1955 feature film ''Stock Car'' among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petermarsh.freeuk.com/stockcar/staines.html |last=Marsh |first=Peter |title=Racing at Staines |work=Pete's Stoch Car Pages |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nOther sports formerly held in Staines include: boxing (there were weekly programmes off the High Street in the 1930s, and local hearsay suggests bare-knuckle events were held at the Crooked Billet earlier in the 20th century); wrestling (bouts were included in boxing programmes of the 1930s); motorcycle football (a club existed in the 1960s; and American football (a short-lived team called Staines Removers entered the Budweiser League in 1988, but failed to start the season, although they did play some friendly matches at their base on The Lammas).\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Staines station north building.JPG|thumb|[[Staines railway station]] main building, seen from the north]]\n[[Staines railway station]] is a stop on all services between [[London Waterloo station]] and {{rws|Weybridge}} (for the [[South West Main Line]]), {{rws|Reading}} (for the [[Great Western Main Line]]) and {{rws|Windsor & Eton Riverside}}.

The bus station is a five-minute walk from the railway station, with services in all directions including to [[Thorpe Park]] and [[Royal Holloway College]]. Staines-upon-Thames is also a short distance south of [[Heathrow Airport]].\n\n===Rail infrastructure projects===\nThere were proposals to build a new railway line, [[Heathrow Airtrack|Airtrack]], connecting the [[South West Main Line]] and/or London Gatwick to Heathrow Airport's [[Heathrow Terminal 5 station|Terminal 5 station]]. As part of these proposals, the former [[Staines High Street railway station]] was to be rebuilt by Two Rivers Shopping Centre and the High Street in the direction of [[Wraysbury railway station]], using a generally unused arc from north to south in the town centre, towards [[Weybridge]] on the [[South West Main Line]]. In 2011 the [[Department for Transport]] announced it had decided that this would not proceed because extra trains would delay road traffic using the level crossing at Egham. The existing Staines station would have an additional platform built instead on the relevant arc.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Demography and housing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n|+ '''2011 Census Homes'''\n|-\n!Output area !!Detached !!Semi-detached!!Terraced!!Flats and apartments!!Caravans/temporary/mobile homes!!shared between households<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n|Staines (ward)||387\t||\t844\t||\t843\t||\t1,439\t||\t2\t||\t13\n|-\n|Staines South (ward)||197\t||\t1,505\t||\t702\t||\t492\t||\t1\t||\t2\n|-\n|Spelthorne 009B (riverside north)||174\t||225\t||93||365||0||5\n|-\n|Spelthorne 009C (riverside south)||369\t||96\t||109||148\t||1||0\n|}\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n|+ '''2011 Census Key Statistics'''\n|-\n!Output area !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n|Staines (ward)||7,861\t||3,528\t||24.0%||33.8%\t||550\n|-\n|Staines South (ward)||7,123\t||2,899\t||29.9%||37.7%\t||131\n|-\n|Spelthorne 009B (riverside north)||1,818\t||862\t||37.6%||37.5%\t||35\n|-\n|Spelthorne 009C (riverside south)||1,662\t||723\t||51.5%||39.1%\t||70\n|}\nThe proportion of households in the town who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%.

Elaborate Georgian shophouses line Clarence Street (named after [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William, Duke of Clarence]], who became King William IV).<ref name=sp>{{cite web |url=http://www.spelthorne.gov.uk/planning |publisher=Spelthorne Borough Council |title=Planning |accessdate= }}</ref> Church Street and Lammas Lane house the oldest properties clustered around the parish church of [[St Mary's, Staines|St Mary]].\n<ref name=os>{{cite web |url=http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&gazName=g&gazString=TQ048812 |title=OS Maps Online |publisher=[[Ordnance survey]] |accessdate= }}</ref> Most neighbourhoods have green spaces such as ([[Staines Moor]], Shortwood Common, Knowle Green, Leacroft, the Lammas and the sports fields and farms on the borders of Laleham. The last two are riverside parks with picnic areas and playgrounds. Many of the parks belonged to former grand houses: see [[Laleham]] for [[Richard Bingham, 2nd Earl of Lucan|Lord Lucan]]'s 'Laleham House' which became a Roman Catholic abbey for a century. Since the late 20th century, listed luxury apartments in the [[post town]] have been created there and at [[Duncroft School for Girls|Duncroft Manor]].\n\n==Education==\nThe town has the following schools:\n*Our Lady Of the Rosary, a Catholic school, opened in 1893\n*Staines Preparatory School, an independent, ages 3\u201311 school, opened in 1935\n*[[Matthew Arnold School (Staines)|Matthew Arnold School]], properly opened in 1954, though partially completed premises were also in emergency use during the Second World War\n*Riverbridge Primary School,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riverbridge.surrey.sch.uk/ |title=Riverbridge Primary School |publisher=Riverbridge Primary School |date= |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> formed in September 2011 from the merger of three local schools: Kingscroft, Knowle Park and Shortwood, each of which retained its original site; however, the Shortwood site has now closed\n*[[The Magna Carta School]], a technology college with over 1200 students. It was opened in 1957, and is in Egham Hythe, but it has a Staines postal address.\n*The Buckland primary school.\n\nSeveral other schools have previously existed in the town, including:\n*British School (Staines's first school opened in 1808; date of closure unknown)\n*National Girls' School (1818\u2013c.1825, 1844\u20131874, 1885\u2013?)\n*National Boys' School (c.1823\u2013c.1830 and 1848\u20131874)\n*British School of Industry for Girls (pre-1831\u2013?)\n*British Infant School (1833\u20131874 and 1885\u2013?)\n*Margaret Pope School, a merger and relocation of three previous schools (1874\u2013?)\n*Church of England Infants' School, Stanwell New Road (from 1890, renamed Shortwood in 1900)\n*Shortwood County Infant School (renamed from C. of E.

[[Royal Holloway University of London|Royal Holloway, University of London]] is 3 miles west of the town centre, off the A30 between [[Egham]] and [[Englefield Green]].\n\n==Sport==\n[[File:DovervStaines.jpg|thumb|Football match between [[Staines Town F.C.|Staines Town]] (yellow shirts) and [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]] in 2009]]\nTwo affiliated senior association football clubs bear the name of Staines, namely [[Staines Town F.C.]] (senior status), and [[Staines Lammas F.C.]] (intermediate status). Staines Town plays at the newly rebuilt [[Wheatsheaf Park]] ground and is a member of [[Isthmian League]] Premier Division. Staines Town has a strong rivalry with [[Hampton & Richmond Borough F.C.]]. Staines Lammas was champion of the [[Combined Counties League]] Division One in the 2007\u201308 season.the club runs various age group teams. Staines also has several successful junior football clubs: Staines Town, Staines Lammas and Staines Albion, as well as girls' clubs Kempton Girls FC \u2014 Colne Valley and the U11, one of the best girls' junior clubs in Surrey.\n\n[[Staines Rugby Football Club]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stainesrugby.co.uk |title=Welcome to Staines Rugby |publisher=Staines Rugby Club |date= |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> used to play at the Lammas (a recreation ground in the town also known as the Ashby Recreation Ground). The club moved to The Reeves (on Snakey Lane, Hanworth) in the 1960s but kept its name. It has teams named Swans, Cobs and Mucky Ducks. The Club is in [[Herts/Middlesex 1]] league and has mini and youth sections.\n\n[[Staines Boat Club]] is immediately across the bridge in Egham Hythe and competes at a national level.\n\nStaines Swimming Club<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stainesswimming.org |title=Staines Swimming Club |publisher=Staines Swimming Club |date= |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> founded in the early 1900s and affiliated to the [[Amateur Swimming Association]] is based at Spelthorne Leisure Centre and provides competitive swimming from inter-club level up to national level.\n\nSpelthorne Volleyball Club, also based at Spelthorne Leisure Centre, provides volleyball to a wide range of abilities and age groups.\n\nClubs in the borough cater to sailing, cricket, hockey, running, rambling, martial arts (jujitsu), rifle & pistol shooting, bowls, chess, bridge, snooker, darts, pool, poker, and a district table tennis league.\n\nThe town is also home to TS ''Thamesis'', Staines and Egham Sea Cadet Corps. This is a uniformed youth organisation for young people aged between 10 and 18 years old. It meets at The Lammas.\n\n===Historic sports===\n[[Motorcycle speedway]] racing was staged at a stadium in Wraysbury Road. Events in 1938 and 1939 are well-known, but it is possible that a venue was active from at least 1931, for a team named Staines raced at Caxton Speedway (near Cambridge, 1931 \u2013 1933 inclusive). The stadium was also used for greyhound racing, as well as 'novelty' events such as cheetah racing.\n\nStaines Stadium was famous from 1955 to 1960 during the early days of [[Stock car racing in the United Kingdom|stock car racing in England]], and featured in the 1955 feature film ''Stock Car'' among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petermarsh.freeuk.com/stockcar/staines.html |last=Marsh |first=Peter |title=Racing at Staines |work=Pete's Stoch Car Pages |date=14 May 2008 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nOther sports formerly held in Staines include: boxing (there were weekly programmes off the High Street in the 1930s, and local hearsay suggests bare-knuckle events were held at the Crooked Billet earlier in the 20th century); wrestling (bouts were included in boxing programmes of the 1930s); motorcycle football (a club existed in the 1960s; and American football (a short-lived team called Staines Removers entered the Budweiser League in 1988, but failed to start the season, although they did play some friendly matches at their base on The Lammas).\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Staines station north building.JPG|thumb|[[Staines railway station]] main building, seen from the north]]\n[[Staines railway station]] is a stop on all services between [[London Waterloo station]] and {{rws|Weybridge}} (for the [[South West Main Line]]), {{rws|Reading}} (for the [[Great Western Main Line]]) and {{rws|Windsor & Eton Riverside}}. Semi-fast services serve the [[Waterloo to Reading Line]], being the operator's secondary main line. Taxis are available from the station. The bus station is a five-minute walk from the railway station, with services in all directions including to [[Thorpe Park]] and [[Royal Holloway College]]. Staines-upon-Thames is also a short distance south of [[Heathrow Airport]].\n\n===Rail infrastructure projects===\nThere were proposals to build a new railway line, [[Heathrow Airtrack|Airtrack]], connecting the [[South West Main Line]] and/or London Gatwick to Heathrow Airport's [[Heathrow Terminal 5 station|Terminal 5 station]]. As part of these proposals, the former [[Staines High Street railway station]] was to be rebuilt by Two Rivers Shopping Centre and the High Street in the direction of [[Wraysbury railway station]], using a generally unused arc from north to south in the town centre, towards [[Weybridge]] on the [[South West Main Line]]. In 2011 the [[Department for Transport]] announced it had decided that this would not proceed because extra trains would delay road traffic using the level crossing at Egham. The existing Staines station would have an additional platform built instead on the relevant arc.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Demography and housing==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n|+ '''2011 Census Homes'''\n|-\n!Output area !!Detached !!Semi-detached!!Terraced!!Flats and apartments!!Caravans/temporary/mobile homes!!shared between households<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n|Staines (ward)||387\t||\t844\t||\t843\t||\t1,439\t||\t2\t||\t13\n|-\n|Staines South (ward)||197\t||\t1,505\t||\t702\t||\t492\t||\t1\t||\t2\n|-\n|Spelthorne 009B (riverside north)||174\t||225\t||93||365||0||5\n|-\n|Spelthorne 009C (riverside south)||369\t||96\t||109||148\t||1||0\n|}\nThe average level of accommodation in the region composed of detached houses was 28%, the average that was apartments was 22.6%.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n|+ '''2011 Census Key Statistics'''\n|-\n!Output area !!Population !!Households !!% Owned outright !!% Owned with a loan!!hectares<ref name=ons/>\n|-\n|Staines (ward)||7,861\t||3,528\t||24.0%||33.8%\t||550\n|-\n|Staines South (ward)||7,123\t||2,899\t||29.9%||37.7%\t||131\n|-\n|Spelthorne 009B (riverside north)||1,818\t||862\t||37.6%||37.5%\t||35\n|-\n|Spelthorne 009C (riverside south)||1,662\t||723\t||51.5%||39.1%\t||70\n|}\nThe proportion of households in the town who owned their home outright compares to the regional average of 35.1%.
