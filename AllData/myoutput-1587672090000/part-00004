But her sister is a smart and talented girl. Many families came to see Tuku but each time she was rejected. She has an ongoing affair with Pablo, a rock star who is not willing to commit fully yet. Her rebellious sister is also in a relationship with a boy called Akash and regularly gets gifts from him, but refuses to let him know that she is interested in him so that he would chase her. One day a family comes to see Tuku. But before the marriage her would be mother-in-law places a condition on her that she has to be an expert in knitting. Eventually she goes to her aunt's house to learn this art. There she meets Shamyo, a violin player. Inspite of being a cancer patient, his optimism towards life inspires Tuku a lot and transforms her into a confident and new person. On the other hand, though Akash is invited to her home, he refuses to marry her sister as he had realised that Tuku's sister had only used him for a give and take relationship. When Tuku returns to her home, she refuses her marriage proposal and pays back Pablo as well for the cutlets he used to feed her for two years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/bengali/a-sweater-would-change-ishaa-thought-of-simple-life-1905847|title=\u098f\u0995 \u099d\u09be\u0981\u0995 \u09b8\u09cd\u09ac\u09aa\u09cd\u09a8\u09c7\u09b0 \u09b8\u09a8\u09cd\u09a7\u09be\u09a8\u09c7 \u09b8\u09cb\u09af\u09bc\u09c7\u099f\u09be\u09b0 \u09ac\u09c1\u09a8\u09ac\u09c7 \u098f\u09ac\u09be\u09b0 \u0988\u09b6\u09be|website=ndtv.com|language=Bengali|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxofficeindia.co.in/sweater-be-ishaa-saha%E2%80%99s-next|title=Sweater to be Ishaa Saha\u2019s next|date=27 August 2018|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandabazar.com/entertainment/watch-the-official-trailer-of-upcoming-bengali-film-sweater-dgtl-1.958782|title=\u09ac\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7\u09b0 \u09ac\u09be\u099c\u09be\u09b0\u09c7 \u09aa\u09bf\u099b\u09bf\u09af\u09bc\u09c7 \u09aa\u09a1\u09bc\u09be \u2018\u099f\u09c1\u0995\u09c1\u2019\u09b0 \u0997\u09b2\u09cd\u09aa \u09ac\u09c1\u09a8\u09c7\u099b\u09c7 \u2018\u09b8\u09cb\u09af\u09bc\u09c7\u099f\u09be\u09b0\u2019|language=Bengali|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* Ishaa Saha as Tuku\n* [[June Maliah]] as Mother in law of Tuku\n* [[Sreelekha Mitra]]\n* [[Kharaj Mukherjee]]\n* [[Saurav Das]]\n* Anuradha Mukherjee as Sree, sister of Tuku\n* Riju Biswas as Akash\n* Farhan Imroze\n* Sidhu Ray\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Mukherjee Dar Bou]]'', 2019 Bengali film\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{imdbtitle|tt10080924}}\n\n[[Category:2019 films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Bengali-language films]]\n[[Category:Indian drama films]]\n[[Category:2010s Bengali-language films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Italics title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Sweater\n| image          = File:Sweater film poster.jpg\n| image_size = 220px\n| caption        = \n| director       = Shieladitya Moulik\n| producer       = PSS Entertainments P&P Entertainment and Pramod Films\n| based on       = ''Wool Kanta''<br>by Joeeta Sengupta\n| writer         = Joeeta Sengupta\n| starring       = Ishaa Saha<br>[[June Maliah]]<br>[[Sreelekha Mitra]]<br>[[Kharaj Mukherjee]]\n| music          = [[Ranojay Bhattacharjee]]\n| studio         = \n| distributor    = \n| released       = {{Film date|df=y|2019|03|29|India}}\n| runtime        = 118 min\n| country        = [[India]]\n| language       = [[Bengali language|Bengali]]\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n| film_name      = \n}}\n'''''Sweater''''' is a [[Bengali language|Bengali]] family [[Drama Film|drama film]] directed by Shieladitya Moulik<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/sweater-june-malia-has-a-peculiar-condition-for-ishaa-saha/articleshow/65764382.cms|title=Sweater\u2019: June Malia has a peculiar condition for Ishaa Saha|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref> and produced by PSS Entertainments P&P Entertainment and Pramod Films.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movie-details/sweater/movieshow/68060517.cms|title=Sweater|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=19 September 2019}}</ref> This film was released on 29 March 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/sweater-first-look-introducing-ishaa-saha-as-tuku/articleshow/68034967.cms|title=Sweater\u2019 first-look: Introducing Ishaa Saha as Tuku!|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref> [[Anindya Chattopadhyay]] and Ranajoy Bhattacharjee are the music directors of the movie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/the-emotionally-drenched-trailer-of-sweater-will-surely-win-your-hearts/articleshow/68183270.cms|title=The emotionally drenched trailer of \u2018Sweater\u2019 will surely win your hearts|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|access-date=25 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film revolves around ''Tuku'', a simple girl whose parents are worried because she doesn't have any qualities and not getting married.
