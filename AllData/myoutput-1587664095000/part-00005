Additionally, all uniforms are treated with the chemical [[permethrin]] to help protect soldiers from insect-borne diseases like malaria. Some U.S. Army soldiers during the latter stages of the [[Iraq War]] also wore the OEF patterned ACU; some were seen wearing them as late as December 2011, when the United States withdrew its military forces from the country at the end of the war.{{Cn|date=August 2019}} The MultiCam-patterned ACUs were retired in 2019 with the UCP-patterned ones.\n\n===Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP)===\n{{Main article|Operational Camouflage Pattern}}\nIn May 2014, the Army unofficially announced that the [[Operational Camouflage Pattern]] (OCP) would replace UCP on the ACU. The original \"Scorpion\" pattern was developed at [[United States Army Soldier Systems Center]] by Crye Precision in 2002 for the Objective Force Warrior program. Crye later modified and trademarked their version of the pattern as MultiCam, which was selected for use by U.S. soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan in 2010 as the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern. After talks to officially adopt MultiCam broke down over costs in late 2013, the Army began experimenting with the original Scorpion pattern, creating a variant code named \"Scorpion W2\", noting that while a pattern can be copyrighted, a color palette cannot and that beyond 50 meters the actual pattern is \"not that relevant.\" The pattern resembles MultiCam with muted greens, light beige, and dark brown colors, but uses fewer beige and brown patches and no vertical twig and branch elements.<ref>[http://www.armytimes.com/article/20140523/NEWS04/305230076/Army-selects-new-camo-pattern Army selects new camo pattern] - Armytimes.com, 23 May 2014</ref> On 31 July 2014, the Army formally announced that the pattern would begin being issued in uniforms in summer 2015.

Originally only pin-on skill badges were authorized for wear on the ACU, with no more than 5 at any one time.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, regulations were changed to allow for wearing of sew-on embroidered skill badges. The 5-badge limit remained in effect, and there could be no mixing of sew-on and pin-on badges. At the same time, the branch tape, name tapes, and rank insignia could be sewn-on at the wearers preference.<ref>[http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/Uniform/docs/Army%20Combat%20Uniform%20(ACU)%20Ensemble.pdf Army Combat Uniform Ensemble], paragraph 5L.</ref> Skill tabs, such as the [[President's Hundred Tab]], [[Special Forces Tab|Special Forces]], [[Ranger Tab|Ranger]], and [[Sapper Tab|Sapper]] are worn on the left sleeve pocket flap, and are subject to a 3-tab-only rule.<ref name=\"Ensemble\">Paragraph 5S.</ref> A tab that is an integral part of a unit patch, such as the \"Mountain\" or \"Airborne\" tab, is not counted against the rule.

Permanent IR [[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF]] squares are sewn to each shoulder to help identify friendly personnel when [[night vision device]]s are used, and are protected by Velcro tabs in [[garrison]] or when not in use.\n\nThree U.S. flag insignia are authorized for wear with the ACU: full-color, full-color infrared, and subdued infrared. The U.S. flag insignia is worn on the right shoulder pocket flap of the ACU coat. The subdued version is only worn as directed under tactical or field conditions in the Army, while the Air Force only authorizes the subdued flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/uniform/docs/ALARACT%20Message%20164%206%20Sep%2006.pdf|title=ALARACT 164/2006|publisher=}}</ref> Subdued [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder sleeve insignia]] are worn.\n\nThe jacket's [[Mandarin collar]] was intended to be worn up in combat to fit with the [[Improved Outer Tactical Vest]] (IOTV) body armor, and worn in the down position otherwise. With the change of pattern to OCP, the Velcro tab that closed the Mandarin collar was removed, along with other Velcro closures.<ref name=\"Summary\">[https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/396739.pdf Army Combat Uniform Summary of Changes] Accessed 14 May 2017</ref>\n\nThe front closure is zippered and reinforced with Velcro, designed for use with OTV. The tilted chest pockets, cuffs, and elbow pad insert pockets also utilize hook-and-loop closure. There is a three slot pen pocket on the left arm of the jacket, and blouse bellows for increased mobility. The jacket is worn so that its bottom is between the bottom of the pocket and the top of the cargo pocket.\n\nIn the field, the jacket may be replaced by the flame resistant [[Army Combat Shirt]] when worn directly under the IOTV.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/05/04/2995-peo-soldier-to-unveil-new-army-combat-shirt/|title=PEO Soldier to Unveil New Army Combat Shirt|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Trousers===\nThe ACU trousers (or ACU pants) are worn with a two-inch nylon web belt, and feature Velcro pouches for knee pad inserts, two forward-tilted thigh storage pockets with elastic drawstring and Velcro for closure during movement, and two calf storage pockets one on each pant leg with a Velcro closure. ACU trousers with flame resistant materials are being issued for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe updates to the ACU trousers in late 2010 included removal of Velcro fasteners from forward-tilted thigh cargo pocket flaps which were replaced with 3 buttons. This change was introduced gradually from 2009 onward and is now in full effect. Two buttons are standard (same function as on BDU trouser cargo pockets), while the third button located at the very end of the pocket can be used to allow for more load and extra volume in cargo pockets. On the small calf pockets the 3-piece Velcro (2 square hook on pocket and one rectangular loop patch on the flap) have been replaced with a single button in 2012. Buttons were re-introduced and replaced Velcro on pockets after numerous complaints from soldiers in the field.\n\nThe belt loops are of new design. The width has doubled, and there are now 8 of them compared to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs at the bottom of the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.<ref name=\"Summary\"/>\n\nTo be able to differentiate the FRACU{{clarify|date=February 2020}} from ACU at a distance, a small square inch tan patch is affixed to the left sleeve cuff on the jacket and the middle of the left cargo pocket flap on the trousers.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Soldier iraq.jpg|thumb|276px|A U.S. Army soldier in March 2007 wears a helmet with a UCP camouflage cover during the [[Iraq War]]]]\nTypically, the ACU is worn with the [[Advanced Combat Helmet]], a [[patrol cap]], or a [[boonie hat]] and/or fleece cap as appropriate in winter months.

Additionally, all uniforms are treated with the chemical [[permethrin]] to help protect soldiers from insect-borne diseases like malaria.

The original \"Scorpion\" pattern was developed at [[United States Army Soldier Systems Center]] by Crye Precision in 2002 for the Objective Force Warrior program. Crye later modified and trademarked their version of the pattern as MultiCam, which was selected for use by U.S. soldiers and airmen in Afghanistan in 2010 as the Operation Enduring Freedom Pattern. After talks to officially adopt MultiCam broke down over costs in late 2013, the Army began experimenting with the original Scorpion pattern, creating a variant code named \"Scorpion W2\", noting that while a pattern can be copyrighted, a color palette cannot and that beyond 50 meters the actual pattern is \"not that relevant.\" The pattern resembles MultiCam with muted greens, light beige, and dark brown colors, but uses fewer beige and brown patches and no vertical twig and branch elements.<ref>[http://www.armytimes.com/article/20140523/NEWS04/305230076/Army-selects-new-camo-pattern Army selects new camo pattern] - Armytimes.com, 23 May 2014</ref> On 31 July 2014, the Army formally announced that the pattern would begin being issued in uniforms in summer 2015.

Originally only pin-on skill badges were authorized for wear on the ACU, with no more than 5 at any one time.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, regulations were changed to allow for wearing of sew-on embroidered skill badges. The 5-badge limit remained in effect, and there could be no mixing of sew-on and pin-on badges. At the same time, the branch tape, name tapes, and rank insignia could be sewn-on at the wearers preference.<ref>[http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/Uniform/docs/Army%20Combat%20Uniform%20(ACU)%20Ensemble.pdf Army Combat Uniform Ensemble], paragraph 5L.</ref> Skill tabs, such as the [[President's Hundred Tab]], [[Special Forces Tab|Special Forces]], [[Ranger Tab|Ranger]], and [[Sapper Tab|Sapper]] are worn on the left sleeve pocket flap, and are subject to a 3-tab-only rule.<ref name=\"Ensemble\">Paragraph 5S.</ref> A tab that is an integral part of a unit patch, such as the \"Mountain\" or \"Airborne\" tab, is not counted against the rule.

Permanent IR [[Identification Friend or Foe|IFF]] squares are sewn to each shoulder to help identify friendly personnel when [[night vision device]]s are used, and are protected by Velcro tabs in [[garrison]] or when not in use.\n\nThree U.S. flag insignia are authorized for wear with the ACU: full-color, full-color infrared, and subdued infrared. The U.S. flag insignia is worn on the right shoulder pocket flap of the ACU coat. The subdued version is only worn as directed under tactical or field conditions in the Army, while the Air Force only authorizes the subdued flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armyg1.army.mil/hr/uniform/docs/ALARACT%20Message%20164%206%20Sep%2006.pdf|title=ALARACT 164/2006|publisher=}}</ref> Subdued [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder sleeve insignia]] are worn.\n\nThe jacket's [[Mandarin collar]] was intended to be worn up in combat to fit with the [[Improved Outer Tactical Vest]] (IOTV) body armor, and worn in the down position otherwise. With the change of pattern to OCP, the Velcro tab that closed the Mandarin collar was removed, along with other Velcro closures.<ref name=\"Summary\">[https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/396739.pdf Army Combat Uniform Summary of Changes] Accessed 14 May 2017</ref>\n\nThe front closure is zippered and reinforced with Velcro, designed for use with OTV. The tilted chest pockets, cuffs, and elbow pad insert pockets also utilize hook-and-loop closure. There is a three slot pen pocket on the left arm of the jacket, and blouse bellows for increased mobility. The jacket is worn so that its bottom is between the bottom of the pocket and the top of the cargo pocket.\n\nIn the field, the jacket may be replaced by the flame resistant [[Army Combat Shirt]] when worn directly under the IOTV.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2007/05/04/2995-peo-soldier-to-unveil-new-army-combat-shirt/|title=PEO Soldier to Unveil New Army Combat Shirt|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Trousers===\nThe ACU trousers (or ACU pants) are worn with a two-inch nylon web belt, and feature Velcro pouches for knee pad inserts, two forward-tilted thigh storage pockets with elastic drawstring and Velcro for closure during movement, and two calf storage pockets one on each pant leg with a Velcro closure. ACU trousers with flame resistant materials are being issued for use in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nThe updates to the ACU trousers in late 2010 included removal of Velcro fasteners from forward-tilted thigh cargo pocket flaps which were replaced with 3 buttons. This change was introduced gradually from 2009 onward and is now in full effect. Two buttons are standard (same function as on BDU trouser cargo pockets), while the third button located at the very end of the pocket can be used to allow for more load and extra volume in cargo pockets. On the small calf pockets the 3-piece Velcro (2 square hook on pocket and one rectangular loop patch on the flap) have been replaced with a single button in 2012. Buttons were re-introduced and replaced Velcro on pockets after numerous complaints from soldiers in the field.\n\nThe belt loops are of new design. The width has doubled, and there are now 8 of them compared to 7 in the past. The waist adjustment cord has been removed and replaced by the Velcro waistband fine-adjusters, one at each hip. Instead of a knee pocket which could only accommodate soft knee inserts in the past, the knee area now features multi-layered comprehensive design which allows external hard-type knee pads to be inserted and secured. Back of the knee area has Velcro hook and loop patches to further secure knee inserts around the knee area. Cuffs at the bottom of the trousers do not use drawstrings anymore for blousing; those have been again replaced by the Velcro cuff adjusters. Further changes as part of the transition to OCP removed the pockets for insertable knee pads altogether, along with the replacement of more Velcro with buttons.<ref name=\"Summary\"/>\n\nTo be able to differentiate the FRACU{{clarify|date=February 2020}} from ACU at a distance, a small square inch tan patch is affixed to the left sleeve cuff on the jacket and the middle of the left cargo pocket flap on the trousers.\n\n===Headgear===\n[[File:Soldier iraq.jpg|thumb|276px|A U.S. Army soldier in March 2007 wears a helmet with a UCP camouflage cover during the [[Iraq War]]]]\nTypically, the ACU is worn with the [[Advanced Combat Helmet]], a [[patrol cap]], or a [[boonie hat]] and/or fleece cap as appropriate in winter months.
