{"title_page": "Sixth generation of video game consoles", "text_new": "{{short description|Video game generation including Game Cube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2016}}\n{{VG history|expandmenu=2}}\nIn the [[history of video games]], the '''sixth-generation era''' (sometimes called the '''128-bit era'''; see [[#Bits and system power|\"bits and system power\"]] below) refers to the [[personal computer game|computer]] and video games, [[video game console]]s, and [[handheld game console|handheld gaming devices]] available at the turn of the 21st century, starting on November 27, 1998. ''[[Video game terminology|Platforms]]'' in the sixth generation include consoles from four companies: the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]] (DC), [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2), [[Nintendo]] [[GameCube]] (GC), and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. This era began on November 27, 1998, with the Japanese release of the Dreamcast, which was joined by the PlayStation 2 on March 4, 2000, and the GameCube and Xbox on November 15, 2001. In April 2001, the Dreamcast was the first to be discontinued. The GameCube was next, in 2007, the Xbox on March 2, 2009, and the PlayStation 2 on January 4, 2013. Meanwhile, the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation of consoles]] started on November 22, 2005 with the launch of the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/04/playstation-2-manufacture-ends-years|title=PlayStation 2 manufacture ends after 12 years|date=January 4, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe major innovation of this generation was of full utilization of the [[internet]] to allow a fully online gaming experience.  While the prior generation had some systems with internet connectivity, such as the [[Apple Pippin]], these had little market penetration and thus had limited success in the area. Services such as Microsoft's [[Xbox Live]] became industry standard in this, and future, generations.  Another innovation of the Xbox was the first system to utilize an internal [[hard disk drive]] to store game data.  This caused many improvements to the gaming experience, including the ability to store program data (rather than just save game data) that allowed for faster load times, as well as the ability to download games directly from the internet rather than to purchase physical media such as a disk or cartridge.  Soon after its release other systems, like the Sony PlayStation 2, produced peripheral storage devices to allow similar capabilities, and by the next generation internal storage became industry standard.\n\n[[Sixth generation of video game consoles#Bits and system power|Bit ratings]] (i.e. \"64-bit\" or \"32-bit\" for the previous generation) for most consoles largely fell by the wayside during this era, with the notable exceptions being promotions for the Dreamcast<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT1Tbc_PD2k|title=Sega Dreamcast UK advert|first=|last=kesavva|date=June 22, 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> and PS2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/ects-the-truth-about-the-dreamcast/|title=ECTS: The Truth About the Dreamcast...|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> that advertised \"128-bit graphics\" at the start of the generation. The number of \"bits\" cited in this way in console names refers to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Word (computer architecture)|word size]], and had been used by hardware marketing departments as a \"show of power\" for many years. However, there is little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 or 64&nbsp;bits because, once this level is reached, performance depends on more varied factors, such as processor [[clock speed]], [[CPU bandwidth|bandwidth]], and [[Computer memory|memory size]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe '''sixth generation of handhelds''' began with the release of the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] by [[SNK]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. The Game Boy Advance was discontinued around in early 2010. The next generation of handheld consoles began in November 2004, with the North American introduction of the [[Nintendo DS]].\n\nThe last [[Dreamcast homebrew|''official'' Dreamcast games]] were released in 2002 (North America and Europe) and 2007 (Japan). The last GameCube games were released in 2006 (Japan) and 2007 (North America and Europe). The last Xbox games were released in 2007 (Japan) and 2008 (Europe and North America).

With the announcements of the Xbox and GameCube in late 2000, Sega's console was considered by some to be outdated only two years after its release.

Its arsenal of franchises and history in the industry, though earning it a loyal fan base, failed to give it an advantage against the Xbox and PlayStation 2 which captured audiences seeking '[[Entertainment Software Rating Board|Mature]]' titles of which Nintendo had fewer. Nintendo also made little headway into online gaming (releasing a small handful of online-capable games, the most popular of which was ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', which was, in fact, a port of the Dreamcast game), instead emphasizing [[Game Boy Advance]] connectivity. As a result, the Nintendo GameCube failed to match the sales of its predecessor, the [[Nintendo 64]], but the console wasn't a financial failure. Nintendo did however rejuvenate its relationship with many developers,<ref name=\"Mark Reese\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/11/feature_remembering_the_gamecube|date=19 Nov 2011|title=Feature: Remembering the GameCube|last=Reese|first=Mark|website=www.nintendolife.com|access-date=11 Feb 2018}}</ref> often working in close collaboration with them to produce games based upon its franchises, in contrast to the past where it was frequently seen as bullying developers in the late 1980s, back when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was out on the market.

However, the Xbox attracted a large fanbase and strong third-party support in the United States and Europe and became a recognizable brand amongst the mainstream. The [[Xbox Live]] online service with its centralized model proved particularly successful, prompting Sony to boost the online capabilities of the PlayStation 2. Xbox Live also gave the Xbox an edge over the GameCube, which had a near-total lack of online games. The flagship of Xbox Live was the game ''[[Halo 2]]'', which was the best selling Xbox game with over 8 million copies sold worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/09/technology/e3_microsoft/index.htm|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 24, 2007|author=Chris Morris|title=Grand Theft Auto, Halo 3 headed to Xbox 360|date=May 9, 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"Asher Moses\">{{cite news| author=Asher Moses|date=August 30, 2007|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/prepare-for-allout-war/2007/08/30/1188067256196.html|title=Prepare for all-out war|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=November 24, 2007}}</ref> However, the Xbox failed to gain a following in Japan due to the fact that it didn't have as big of a stronghold as its rivals as well as the lack of commitment of Japanese games for the system.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yin-Poole |first1=Wesley |title=Why Xbox failed in Japan |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-12-13-why-xbox-failed-in-japan |website=EuroGamer |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Technical comparison<ref name=\"angelfire.com\"/>\n|-\n!style=\"width: 8%\" | Name\n!style=\"width: 23%;\" | [[Dreamcast]]\n!style=\"width: 23%;\" | [[PlayStation 2]]\n!style=\"width: 23%;\" | [[GameCube]]\n!style=\"width: 23%;\" | [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

These, however, are less notable, never saw a worldwide release, and/or have sold particularly poorly, and are therefore listed as 'Other'.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Nuon-N2000-wController-L.jpg|link=File:Nuon-N2000-wController-L.jpg|The [[Nuon (DVD technology)|Nuon]] was a hybrid DVD player/gaming system released in 2000, that had a very small game library.\nFile:AtariFlashback.jpg|The [[Atari Flashback]], the \"plug and play\" version of the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 7800|7800]] Released in 2004.\nFile:V-Smile_Top.JPG|The [[V.Smile]] was a gaming system for education, created by [[VTech]]. Released in 2004\nFile:XaviX-XaviXPORT-Console-FL.jpg|The [[XaviX]] is the video gaming base console for the XaviX Interactive System, released by SSD COMPANY LIMITED in 2004.\n</gallery>\n\n==Bits and system power==\nBit ratings for consoles largely fell by the wayside after the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation]] (32/64-bit) era. The number of \"bits\" cited in console names referred to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Word (data type)|word]] size, but there was little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 bits; performance depended on other factors, such as [[central processing unit]] speed, [[graphics processing unit]] speed, [[channel capacity]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]] size, and memory speed, [[memory latency|latency]], and size.\n\nThe importance of the number of [[bit]]s in the modern console gaming market has thus decreased due to the use of components that process data in varying word sizes. Previously, console manufacturers advertised the \"''n''-bit talk\" to over-emphasize the hardware capabilities of their system. The Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2 were the last systems to use the term \"128-bit\" in their marketing to describe their capability.\n\nIt is not easy to compare the relative \"power\" of the different systems. Having a larger CPU word size does not necessarily make one console more powerful than another. Likewise, the operating frequency (clock rate, measured in terms of [[Hertz]]) of a system's CPU is not an accurate measure of performance either, except between systems of the same or similar architecture.\n\nThe Microsoft [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] uses a 32-bit (general purpose) [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] x86 architecture CPU, with an instruction set equal to that of the Coppermine core Mobile [[Celeron]], though it has less cache (128&nbsp;kB) than the PC equivalent. It has 64&nbsp;MB RAM (shared) and runs at 733&nbsp;MHz. Because the Pentium 3 introduced [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], the Xbox also had 128-bit SIMD capabilities. Its ''NV2A'' [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], which is very similar to the [[GeForce 3 Series]] of desktop GPUs, makes it the only console in its time with traditional vertex and pixel [[shader]]s.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/853/14 AnandTech.com: Hardware Behind the Consoles \u2013 Microsoft's Xbox vs. Sony PlayStation 2], November 21, 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[Nintendo GameCube]]'s [[IBM]] [[Gekko (microprocessor)|Gekko]] [[PowerPC]] CPU runs at 485&nbsp;MHz, while its \"Flipper\" graphics processor is comparable to the original [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] [[Radeon R100|Radeon]], and it has 43&nbsp;MB of non-unified memory (24&nbsp;MB of 1T-SRAM, 3&nbsp;MB embedded 1T-SRAM, and 16&nbsp;MB DRAM). The GameCube supports [[Dolby Pro Logic]] II.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/858/13 AnandTech.com: Hardware Behind the Consoles \u2013 Nintendo GameCube vs. Sony PlayStation 2 vs. Microsoft Xbox], December 7, 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[PlayStation 2]]'s CPU (known as the \"128-bit [[Emotion Engine]]\") has a 64-bit core with a 32-bit FPU\ncoupled to two 128 bit Vector Units, The hybrid R5900 CPU is based on [[MIPS architecture]]. The PS2 also has an internal 10 Channel DMA Bus which is fully 128 bits wide. Paths between the Emotion Engine, RAM and the Graphics synthesizer (GS) are also 128 bits wide. The PS2's unique hardware arrangement with no less than 10 processing units were difficult to come to grips with. Many developers struggled initially with programming the hardware. The PS2's Graphics Synthesizer (GS) has fast dedicated video memory, though it is limited in the amount of data it can hold, The 10 Channel 128 bit wide DMA bus could pump data to GS Memory as fast as the screen could update. Consequently, with the main memory being limited to 32MB, many of the PS2's games have reduced textures compared with versions for other consoles. It also does not have a hardware dedicated [[Transform, clipping, and lighting|transform and lighting]] unit like the ones found in the Xbox and GameCube GPUs.\n\nHowever the PS2's design allows a remarkable degree of flexibility and choice. For example, Program control and general arithmetic could be handled by the CPU, while the Vector Units 0 and 1, could provide parallel processing of physics, clipping and transform and lighting to the scene. The Vector units were noted to be so versatile that [[Shadow of the Colossus|Shadow of The Colossus]] used one of the vector units to do full Pixel shading for the fur of the Collossi.\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]] has a [[64-bit]] [[Double precision|double-precision]] [[superscalar]] [[SuperH]]-4 [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[Central processing unit]] core with a [[32-bit]] [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] unit using [[16-bit]] fixed-length instructions, a 64-bit data bus allowing a variable width of either 8, 16, 32 or 64-bits, and a 128-bit floating-point bus.<ref>[http://www.segatech.com/technical/cpu/index.html Technology Partner \u2013 Design Solutions from Hitachi Semiconductor (America) Inc.: SH7750 (SH-4 Series) MPU] (November/December 1997)</ref> The [[PowerVR]] 2DC CLX2 chipset uses a unique method of rendering a 3D scene called [[Tiled rendering|Tile]] Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR): while storing polygons in [[triangle strip]] format in memory, the display is split into tiles associated with a list of visibly overlapping triangles onto which, using a process similar to [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], rays are cast and a pixel is rendered from the triangle closest to the camera. After calculating the depths associated with each polygon for one tile row in 1 cycle, the whole tile is flushed to video memory before passing on to render the next tile. Once all information has been collated for the current [[Film frame|frame]], the tiles are rendered in turn to produce the final image.\n\n==Handheld systems==\n{{See also|Comparison of handheld game consoles}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Purple-FL.jpg|thumb|The [[Game Boy Advance]] was the best-selling handheld system.]]\nDuring the sixth generation era, the [[handheld game console]] market expanded with the introduction of new devices from many different manufacturers. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. Two redesigns of this system followed, the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] in 2003 and the [[Game Boy Micro]] in 2005. Also introduced were the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] by [[SNK]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. South Korean company [[Game Park]] introduced its [[GP32]] handheld in 2001, and with it came the dawn of [[Open-source software|open source]] handheld consoles. The Game Boy Advance line of handhelds has sold 81.51 million units worldwide as of September 30, 2010.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\nA major new addition to the market was the trend for corporations to include a large number of \"non-gaming\" features into their handheld consoles, including [[mobile phone|cell phones]], [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], portable movie players, and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like features. The handheld that started this trend was [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]], which was released in 2003 and doubled primarily as a mobile phone. It went through a redesign in 2004 and was renamed the [[N-Gage QD]]. A second handheld, the [[Tapwave Zodiac|Zodiac]] from Tapwave, was released in 2004; based on the [[Palm OS]], it offered specialized gaming-oriented video and sound capabilities, but it had an unwieldy development kit due to the underlying Palm OS foundation.\n\nA fairly uncommon handheld of the 6th generation was the vtech V.SMILE Pocket. A handheld version of their V.SMILE home console.\n\nWith more and more PDAs arriving during the previous generation, the difference between consumer electronics and traditional computing began to blur and cheap console technology grew as a result. It was said of PDAs that they were \"the computers of handheld gaming\" because of their multi-purpose capabilities and the increasingly powerful computer hardware that resided within them. This capability existed to move gaming beyond the last generation's 16-bit limitations; however, PDAs were still geared towards the typical businessman, and lacked new, affordable software franchises to compete with dedicated handheld gaming consoles.\n\n===Handheld comparison===\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5%\"| Name\n!style=\"width: 25%;\" |

The sixth generation was the first to help console and computer software grow closer together as well as outperform the arcade market in features, graphics and business.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The Dreamcast, which had an official Windows CE Development Kit to help porting games from PCs to Dreamcast, and the Xbox, which was made from off-the-shelf PC parts and hosted many PC ports, factored into this also.\n\n===Controversial games===\n{{main|Video game controversy}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}\nWhile the sixth generation was not the first to have its share of controversial games, this generation was noted to have extensive criticism by public figures of \"objectionable\" content in gaming such as sex, crime, violence, profanity, drug use, and social propaganda as well as topics of debate such as religion, politics and economics.\n\nThe sixth generation was also notable because it saw the continuation of lawmakers taking actions against the video game industry. The most famous were [[Rockstar Games]]' [[Manhunt (video game)|''Manhunt'']] and [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' games]] (''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'') facing lawsuits over alleged racial slurs and influencing minors to commit crimes, while ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' was briefly given an adult rating and removed from most stores over the availability of an abandoned sex mini-game using the [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy|Hot Coffee mod]].\n\nThe sixth generation also coincided with the [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City and [[the Pentagon]], which had a huge impact on the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]], including the [[video game industry]]; in the subsequent market climate, multiple games were edited in response to the sensitivity surrounding the event. Prior to its release, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' depicted [[Arsenal Gear|a submersible mobile fortress hijacked by terrorists]] destroying a good portion of [[Manhattan]] in view of the twin towers (this can be found in the \"Document of Metal Gear Solid 2\" making-of feature). Similarly, several undisclosed modifications were made in ''Grand Theft Auto III'', such as a change to the police cars' color scheme (the old scheme resembled that of [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s older blue and white design) and altered cover art (the European release featured the original artwork); Rockstar Games estimates that the changes amounted to 1% in changed content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/19981/grand-theft-auto-iii-your-questions-answered-part-two-911-the-gh.html|title=Rockstar Games|website=Rockstar Games|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref> The [[Dreamcast]] game ''[[Propeller Arena]]'' was never officially released, possibly due to a certain level which was visually very similar to the September 11 attacks.\n\n===Emulation and retro gaming===\n{{see also|Console emulator}}\nBecause of the increased computing power of video game consoles and the widespread usage of [[emulator]]s, the sixth generation saw the rise of console emulation and retro gaming on a vast scale. Many games for older systems were updated with superior graphics or sound and re-released for current consoles. Commonly emulated games included those released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (the PS2 can play PS1 games natively), and the [[Nintendo 64]].\n\nAlso during this generation, the computing power of handheld consoles became capable of supporting games made for some of the earliest gaming consoles and several companies released remakes of classic games for the handhelds. Nintendo introduced a line of NES and SNES games for its Game Boy Advance handheld, including remakes such as ''[[Final Fantasy I and II (compilations)|Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]''. Also, an increasing number of [[Types of Video-Game Development Parties|third-party developers]], including [[Midway Games]], [[Capcom]], [[Namco]], [[Atari]], and [[Sega]], released [[anthology]] collections of some of their old games. Additionally, many video games and video game series that were originally confined to Japan were released in North America and Europe for the first time.\n\n===Rise of online gaming===\n{{See also|SegaNet|Dreamarena|PS2 Online|Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter|Xbox Live}}\n[[Online game|Online gaming]], which in previous generations had been almost an exclusive domain of PC games, became more prominent in video game consoles during this generation. The [[Dreamcast]] initiated this change with its built in [[modem]], internet browsing software, and ability to play certain games online. The [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] also offered online gaming, though their approaches and commitment to it varied greatly. The Xbox offered an integrated service called [[Xbox Live]] that cost $50 per year and was only compatible with a [[Broadband|broadband internet connection]]. Its ability to connect gamers for online multi-player matches was a considerable factor in allowing the Xbox to gain a foothold in the western market, especially in the first-person shooter genre. The PlayStation 2 left its online gaming service up to each individual game publisher, and though it was free to use, it was not always an ideal experience, especially with games published by small developers. The ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs|SOCOM]]'' series was one of the most popular online competitive games for the PS2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://community.us.playstation.com/thread/4699021?tstart=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601223409/http://community.us.playstation.com/thread/4699021?tstart=0 |archivedate=2012-06-01 }}</ref> The GameCube did not offer online play for any of its first-party titles, with only Sega's ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' series and ''[[Homeland (video game)|Homeland]]'' making official use of the console's online capabilities. In addition, online capability was not out-of-the-box; an adapter was needed to hook the GameCube to the internet.\n\n===Mergers===\nMany game publishing companies with a long established history merged with their competitors: [[Microsoft]] bought second-party developer [[Rare (company)|Rare]] in 2002; [[Square (video game company)|Square]] merged with [[Enix]] to form [[Square Enix]] in 2003 and then later bought [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]; [[Sega]] merged with Sammy to form [[Sega Sammy Holdings]] in 2004; [[Konami]] bought a majority share of [[Hudson Soft]]; [[Namco]] merged with [[Bandai]] to form [[Bandai Namco Holdings]] in 2006.\n\n==Software==\n{{main|List of video game franchises}}\n\n===Milestone titles===\n* ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (PS2) by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] (now Square Enix) refined many elements found in its predecessors, adding a completely different battle system.

Likewise, ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]'' (GC) proved to be another important title in the series released this generation. The title is perhaps best remembered for the excitement caused by its announcement trailer at E3 2004. It was released to widespread critical acclaim with an average of 96% on Metacritic.

''[[Video game terminology|Platforms]]'' in the sixth generation include consoles from four companies: the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]] (DC), [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] (PS2), [[Nintendo]] [[GameCube]] (GC), and [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. This era began on November 27, 1998, with the Japanese release of the Dreamcast, which was joined by the PlayStation 2 on March 4, 2000, and the GameCube and Xbox on November 15, 2001. In April 2001, the Dreamcast was the first to be discontinued. The GameCube was next, in 2007, the Xbox on March 2, 2009, and the PlayStation 2 on January 4, 2013. Meanwhile, the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation of consoles]] started on November 22, 2005 with the launch of the [[Xbox 360]].<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jan/04/playstation-2-manufacture-ends-years|title=PlayStation 2 manufacture ends after 12 years|date=January 4, 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe major innovation of this generation was of full utilization of the [[internet]] to allow a fully online gaming experience.  While the prior generation had some systems with internet connectivity, such as the [[Apple Pippin]], these had little market penetration and thus had limited success in the area. Services such as Microsoft's [[XBox Live]] became industry standard in this, and future, generations.  Another innovation of the Xbox was the first system to utilize an internal [[hard disk drive]] to store game data.  This caused many improvements to the gaming experience, including the ability to store program data (rather than just save game data) that allowed for faster load times, as well as the ability to download games directly from the internet rather than to purchase physical media such as a disk or cartridge.  Soon after its release other systems, like the Sony PlayStation 2, produced peripheral storage devices to allow similar capabilities, and by the next generation internal storage became industry standard.\n\n[[Sixth generation of video game consoles#Bits and system power|Bit ratings]] (i.e. \"64-bit\" or \"32-bit\" for the previous generation) for most consoles largely fell by the wayside during this era, with the notable exceptions being promotions for the Dreamcast<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT1Tbc_PD2k|title=Sega Dreamcast UK advert|first=|last=kesavva|date=June 22, 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> and PS2<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/ects-the-truth-about-the-dreamcast/|title=ECTS: The Truth About the Dreamcast...|work=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> that advertised \"128-bit graphics\" at the start of the generation. The number of \"bits\" cited in this way in console names refers to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Word (computer architecture)|word size]], and had been used by hardware marketing departments as a \"show of power\" for many years. However, there is little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 or 64&nbsp;bits because, once this level is reached, performance depends on more varied factors, such as processor [[clock speed]], [[CPU bandwidth|bandwidth]], and [[Computer memory|memory size]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe '''sixth generation of handhelds''' began with the release of the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] by [[SNK]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. The Game Boy Advance was discontinued around in early 2010. The next generation of handheld consoles began in November 2004, with the North American introduction of the [[Nintendo DS]].\n\nThe last [[Dreamcast homebrew|''official'' Dreamcast games]] were released in 2002 (North America and Europe) and 2007 (Japan).

With the announcements of the Xbox and GameCube in late 2000, Sega's console was considered by some to be outdated only two years after its release.

Its arsenal of franchises and history in the industry, though earning it a loyal fan base, failed to give it an advantage against the Xbox and PlayStation 2 which captured audiences seeking '[[Entertainment Software Rating Board|Mature]]' titles of which Nintendo had fewer. Nintendo also made little headway into online gaming (releasing a small handful of online-capable games, the most popular of which was ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'', which was, in fact, a port of the Dreamcast game), instead emphasizing [[Game Boy Advance]] connectivity. As a result, the Nintendo GameCube failed to match the sales of its predecessor, the [[Nintendo 64]], but the console wasn't a financial failure. Nintendo did however rejuvenate its relationship with many developers,<ref name=\"Mark Reese\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2011/11/feature_remembering_the_gamecube|date=19 Nov 2011|title=Feature: Remembering the GameCube|last=Reese|first=Mark|website=www.nintendolife.com|access-date=11 Feb 2018}}</ref> often working in close collaboration with them to produce games based upon its franchises, in contrast to the past where it was frequently seen as bullying developers in the late 1980s, back when the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] was out on the market.

However, the Xbox attracted a large fanbase and strong third-party support in the United States and Europe and became a recognizable brand amongst the mainstream. The [[Xbox Live]] online service with its centralized model proved particularly successful, prompting Sony to boost the online capabilities of the PlayStation 2. Xbox Live also gave the Xbox an edge over the GameCube, which had a near-total lack of online games.

These, however, are less notable, never saw a worldwide release, and/or have sold particularly poorly, and are therefore listed as 'Other'.\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Nuon-N2000-wController-L.jpg|link=File:Nuon-N2000-wController-L.jpg|The [[Nuon (DVD technology)|Nuon]] was a hybrid DVD player/gaming system released in 2000, that had a very small game library.\nFile:AtariFlashback.jpg|The [[Atari Flashback]], the \"plug and play\" version of the [[Atari 2600]] and [[Atari 7800|7800]] Released in 2004.\nFile:V-Smile_Top.JPG|The [[V.Smile]] was a gaming system for education, created by [[VTech]]. Released in 2004\nFile:XaviX-XaviXPORT-Console-FL.jpg|The [[XaviX]] is the video gaming base console for the XaviX Interactive System, released by SSD COMPANY LIMITED in 2004.\n</gallery>\n\n==Bits and system power==\nBit ratings for consoles largely fell by the wayside after the [[History of video game consoles (fifth generation)|fifth generation]] (32/64-bit) era. The number of \"bits\" cited in console names referred to the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] [[Word (data type)|word]] size, but there was little to be gained from increasing the word size much beyond 32 bits; performance depended on other factors, such as [[central processing unit]] speed, [[graphics processing unit]] speed, [[channel capacity]], [[Computer data storage|data storage]] size, and memory speed, [[memory latency|latency]], and size.\n\nThe importance of the number of [[bit]]s in the modern console gaming market has thus decreased due to the use of components that process data in varying word sizes. Previously, console manufacturers advertised the \"''n''-bit talk\" to over-emphasize the hardware capabilities of their system. The Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2 were the last systems to use the term \"128-bit\" in their marketing to describe their capability.\n\nIt is not easy to compare the relative \"power\" of the different systems. Having a larger CPU word size does not necessarily make one console more powerful than another. Likewise, the operating frequency (clock rate, measured in terms of [[Hertz]]) of a system's CPU is not an accurate measure of performance either, except between systems of the same or similar architecture.\n\nThe Microsoft [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] uses a 32-bit (general purpose) [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] x86 architecture CPU, with an instruction set equal to that of the Coppermine core Mobile [[Celeron]], though it has less cache (128&nbsp;kB) than the PC equivalent. It has 64&nbsp;MB RAM (shared) and runs at 733&nbsp;MHz. Because the Pentium 3 introduced [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]], the Xbox also had 128-bit SIMD capabilities. Its ''NV2A'' [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]], which is very similar to the [[GeForce 3 Series]] of desktop GPUs, makes it the only console in its time with traditional vertex and pixel [[shader]]s.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/853/14 AnandTech.com: Hardware Behind the Consoles \u2013 Microsoft's Xbox vs. Sony PlayStation 2], November 21, 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[Nintendo GameCube]]'s [[IBM]] [[Gekko (microprocessor)|Gekko]] [[PowerPC]] CPU runs at 485&nbsp;MHz, while its \"Flipper\" graphics processor is comparable to the original [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] [[Radeon R100|Radeon]], and it has 43&nbsp;MB of non-unified memory (24&nbsp;MB of 1T-SRAM, 3&nbsp;MB embedded 1T-SRAM, and 16&nbsp;MB DRAM). The GameCube supports [[Dolby Pro Logic]] II.<ref>[http://www.anandtech.com/show/858/13 AnandTech.com: Hardware Behind the Consoles \u2013 Nintendo GameCube vs. Sony PlayStation 2 vs. Microsoft Xbox], December 7, 2001</ref>\n\nThe [[PlayStation 2]]'s CPU (known as the \"128-bit [[Emotion Engine]]\") has a 64-bit core with a 32-bit FPU\ncoupled to two 128 bit Vector Units, The hybrid R5900 CPU is based on [[MIPS architecture]]. The PS2 also has an internal 10 Channel DMA Bus which is fully 128 bits wide. Paths between the Emotion Engine, RAM and the Graphics synthesizer (GS) are also 128 bits wide. The PS2's unique hardware arrangement with no less than 10 processing units were difficult to come to grips with. Many developers struggled initially with programming the hardware. The PS2's Graphics Synthesizer (GS) has fast dedicated video memory, though it is limited in the amount of data it can hold, The 10 Channel 128 bit wide DMA bus could pump data to GS Memory as fast as the screen could update. Consequently, with the main memory being limited to 32MB, many of the PS2's games have reduced textures compared with versions for other consoles. It also does not have a hardware dedicated [[Transform, clipping, and lighting|transform and lighting]] unit like the ones found in the Xbox and GameCube GPUs.\n\nHowever the PS2's design allows a remarkable degree of flexibility and choice. For example, Program control and general arithmetic could be handled by the CPU, while the Vector Units 0 and 1, could provide parallel processing of physics, clipping and transform and lighting to the scene. The Vector units were noted to be so versatile that [[Shadow of the Colossus|Shadow of The Colossus]] used one of the vector units to do full Pixel shading for the fur of the Collossi.\n\nThe [[Dreamcast]] has a [[64-bit]] [[Double precision|double-precision]] [[superscalar]] [[SuperH]]-4 [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] [[Central processing unit]] core with a [[32-bit]] [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] unit using [[16-bit]] fixed-length instructions, a 64-bit data bus allowing a variable width of either 8, 16, 32 or 64-bits, and a 128-bit floating-point bus.<ref>[http://www.segatech.com/technical/cpu/index.html Technology Partner \u2013 Design Solutions from Hitachi Semiconductor (America) Inc.: SH7750 (SH-4 Series) MPU] (November/December 1997)</ref> The [[PowerVR]] 2DC CLX2 chipset uses a unique method of rendering a 3D scene called [[Tiled rendering|Tile]] Based Deferred Rendering (TBDR): while storing polygons in [[triangle strip]] format in memory, the display is split into tiles associated with a list of visibly overlapping triangles onto which, using a process similar to [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], rays are cast and a pixel is rendered from the triangle closest to the camera. After calculating the depths associated with each polygon for one tile row in 1 cycle, the whole tile is flushed to video memory before passing on to render the next tile. Once all information has been collated for the current [[Film frame|frame]], the tiles are rendered in turn to produce the final image.\n\n==Handheld systems==\n{{See also|Comparison of handheld game consoles}}\n[[File:Nintendo-Game-Boy-Advance-Purple-FL.jpg|thumb|The [[Game Boy Advance]] was the best-selling handheld system.]]\nDuring the sixth generation era, the [[handheld game console]] market expanded with the introduction of new devices from many different manufacturers. Nintendo maintained its dominant share of the handheld market with the release in 2001 of the [[Game Boy Advance]], which featured many upgrades and new features over the [[Game Boy]]. Two redesigns of this system followed, the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] in 2003 and the [[Game Boy Micro]] in 2005. Also introduced were the [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]] by [[SNK]] in 1998 and [[Bandai]]'s [[WonderSwan Color]], launched in Japan in 1999. South Korean company [[Game Park]] introduced its [[GP32]] handheld in 2001, and with it came the dawn of [[Open-source software|open source]] handheld consoles. The Game Boy Advance line of handhelds has sold 81.51 million units worldwide as of September 30, 2010.<ref name=\"nintendosales\"/>\n\nA major new addition to the market was the trend for corporations to include a large number of \"non-gaming\" features into their handheld consoles, including [[mobile phone|cell phones]], [[Digital audio player|MP3 players]], portable movie players, and [[personal digital assistant|PDA]]-like features. The handheld that started this trend was [[Nokia]]'s [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]], which was released in 2003 and doubled primarily as a mobile phone. It went through a redesign in 2004 and was renamed the [[N-Gage QD]]. A second handheld, the [[Tapwave Zodiac|Zodiac]] from Tapwave, was released in 2004; based on the [[Palm OS]], it offered specialized gaming-oriented video and sound capabilities, but it had an unwieldy development kit due to the underlying Palm OS foundation.\n\nA fairly uncommon handheld of the 6th generation was the vtech V.SMILE Pocket. A handheld version of their V.SMILE home console.\n\nWith more and more PDAs arriving during the previous generation, the difference between consumer electronics and traditional computing began to blur and cheap console technology grew as a result. It was said of PDAs that they were \"the computers of handheld gaming\" because of their multi-purpose capabilities and the increasingly powerful computer hardware that resided within them. This capability existed to move gaming beyond the last generation's 16-bit limitations; however, PDAs were still geared towards the typical businessman, and lacked new, affordable software franchises to compete with dedicated handheld gaming consoles.\n\n===Handheld comparison===\n<div style=\"font-size: 90%\">\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width: 5%\"| Name\n!style=\"width: 25%;\" |

The sixth generation was the first to help console and computer software grow closer together as well as outperform the arcade market in features, graphics and business.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} The Dreamcast, which had an official Windows CE Development Kit to help porting games from PCs to Dreamcast, and the Xbox, which was made from off-the-shelf PC parts and hosted many PC ports, factored into this also.\n\n===Controversial games===\n{{main|Video game controversy}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2007}}\nWhile the sixth generation was not the first to have its share of controversial games, this generation was noted to have extensive criticism by public figures of \"objectionable\" content in gaming such as sex, crime, violence, profanity, drug use, and social propaganda as well as topics of debate such as religion, politics and economics.\n\nThe sixth generation was also notable because it saw the continuation of lawmakers taking actions against the video game industry. The most famous were [[Rockstar Games]]' [[Manhunt (video game)|''Manhunt'']] and [[Grand Theft Auto|''Grand Theft Auto'' games]] (''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' and ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'') facing lawsuits over alleged racial slurs and influencing minors to commit crimes, while ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' was briefly given an adult rating and removed from most stores over the availability of an abandoned sex mini-game using the [[Hot Coffee minigame controversy|Hot Coffee mod]].\n\nThe sixth generation also coincided with the [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City and [[the Pentagon]], which had a huge impact on the [[List of entertainment industry topics|entertainment industry]], including the [[video game industry]]; in the subsequent market climate, multiple games were edited in response to the sensitivity surrounding the event. Prior to its release, ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' depicted [[Arsenal Gear|a submersible mobile fortress hijacked by terrorists]] destroying a good portion of [[Manhattan]] in view of the twin towers (this can be found in the \"Document of Metal Gear Solid 2\" making-of feature). Similarly, several undisclosed modifications were made in ''Grand Theft Auto III'', such as a change to the police cars' color scheme (the old scheme resembled that of [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]]'s older blue and white design) and altered cover art (the European release featured the original artwork); Rockstar Games estimates that the changes amounted to 1% in changed content.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/19981/grand-theft-auto-iii-your-questions-answered-part-two-911-the-gh.html|title=Rockstar Games|website=Rockstar Games|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-12}}</ref> The [[Dreamcast]] game ''[[Propeller Arena]]'' was never officially released, possibly due to a certain level which was visually very similar to the September 11 attacks.\n\n===Emulation and retro gaming===\n{{see also|Console emulator}}\nBecause of the increased computing power of video game consoles and the widespread usage of [[emulator]]s, the sixth generation saw the rise of console emulation and retro gaming on a vast scale. Many games for older systems were updated with superior graphics or sound and re-released for current consoles. Commonly emulated games included those released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], the [[Mega Drive|Mega Drive/Genesis]], the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (the PS2 can play PS1 games natively), and the [[Nintendo 64]].\n\nAlso during this generation, the computing power of handheld consoles became capable of supporting games made for some of the earliest gaming consoles and several companies released remakes of classic games for the handhelds. Nintendo introduced a line of NES and SNES games for its Game Boy Advance handheld, including remakes such as ''[[Final Fantasy I and II (compilations)|Final Fantasy I & II: Dawn of Souls]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Metroid: Zero Mission]]''. Also, an increasing number of [[Types of Video-Game Development Parties|third-party developers]], including [[Midway Games]], [[Capcom]], [[Namco]], [[Atari]], and [[Sega]], released [[anthology]] collections of some of their old games. Additionally, many video games and video game series that were originally confined to Japan were released in North America and Europe for the first time.\n\n===Rise of online gaming===\n{{See also|SegaNet|Dreamarena|PS2 Online|Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter|Xbox Live}}\n[[Online game|Online gaming]], which in previous generations had been almost an exclusive domain of PC games, became more prominent in video game consoles during this generation. The [[Dreamcast]] initiated this change with its built in [[modem]], internet browsing software, and ability to play certain games online. The [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] also offered online gaming, though their approaches and commitment to it varied greatly. The Xbox offered an integrated service called [[Xbox Live]] that cost $50 per year and was only compatible with a [[Broadband|broadband internet connection]]. Its ability to connect gamers for online multi-player matches was a considerable factor in allowing the Xbox to gain a foothold in the western market, especially in the first-person shooter genre. The PlayStation 2 left its online gaming service up to each individual game publisher, and though it was free to use, it was not always an ideal experience, especially with games published by small developers. The ''[[SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs|SOCOM]]'' series was one of the most popular online competitive games for the PS2.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://community.us.playstation.com/thread/4699021?tstart=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601223409/http://community.us.playstation.com/thread/4699021?tstart=0 |archivedate=2012-06-01 }}</ref> The GameCube did not offer online play for any of its first-party titles, with only Sega's ''[[Phantasy Star Online]]'' series and ''[[Homeland (video game)|Homeland]]'' making official use of the console's online capabilities. In addition, online capability was not out-of-the-box; an adapter was needed to hook the GameCube to the internet.\n\n===Mergers===\nMany game publishing companies with a long established history merged with their competitors: [[Microsoft]] bought second-party developer [[Rare (company)|Rare]] in 2002; [[Square (video game company)|Square]] merged with [[Enix]] to form [[Square Enix]] in 2003 and then later bought [[Taito Corporation|Taito]]; [[Sega]] merged with Sammy to form [[Sega Sammy Holdings]] in 2004; [[Konami]] bought a majority share of [[Hudson Soft]]; [[Namco]] merged with [[Bandai]] to form [[Bandai Namco Holdings]] in 2006.\n\n==Software==\n{{main|List of video game franchises}}\n\n===Milestone titles===\n* ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (PS2) by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] (now Square Enix) refined many elements found in its predecessors, adding a completely different battle system.

The title is perhaps best remembered for the excitement caused by its announcement trailer at E3 2004. It was released to widespread critical acclaim with an average of 96% on Metacritic.
