For parents with deaf children who do not use amplification (hearing aids or cochlear implants), joint attention (an important component to language development) can be problematic. Hearing children can watch their environment and listen to an adult comment on it. However, children who do not hear have to switch their visual attention back and forth between stimuli.\n\nStrategies for nonverbal communication include using facial expressions and body language to show emotion and reinforce the child's attention to their caregiver. To attract and direct a deaf child's attention, caregivers can break his line of gaze using hand and body movements, touch, and pointing to allow language input. In order to make language salient,{{clarify|reason=salient language?|date=February 2018}} parents should use short, simple sentences so that the child's attention doesn\u2019t have to be divided for too long. Finally, to reduce the need for divided attention, a caregiver can position themselves and objects within the child's visual field so that language and the object can be seen at the same time.\n\n=== Speech and oral methods ===\n\nFor deaf children who: receive cochlear implants early in life, are born to parents who use spoken language in the home, and pursue spoken language proficiency, research demonstrates that L1 language and reading skills are consistently higher for those children who have not been exposed to a signed language as an L1 or L2, and have instead focused exclusively on listening and spoken language development.<ref name=\"Communication Outcomes for Groups o\">{{cite journal|first1=Shani Joy|last1=Dettman|title=Communication Outcomes for Groups of Children Using Cochlear Implants Enrolled in Auditory-Verbal, Aural-Oral, and Bilingual-Bicultural Early Intervention Programs|journal=Otology & Neurotology|date=2013|volume=34|issue=3|doi=10.1097/mao.0b013e3182839650|pmid=23442569|pages=451\u20139}}</ref> In fact, \"Over 70% of children without sign language exposure achieved age-appropriate spoken language compared with only 39% of those exposed for 3 or more years.\" <ref name=\"Early Sign Language Exposure and Co\">{{cite journal|first1=Ann|last1=Geers|title=Early Sign Language Exposure and Cochlear Implantation Benefits|journal=Pediatrics|date=2017|volume=140|issue=1|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-3489|pmid=28759398|pmc=5495521|page=e20163489}}</ref> Children who focused primarily on spoken language also demonstrated greater social well-being when they did not use manual communication as a supplement.<ref name=\"Percy-Smith-2008\" />\n\nFor deaf children who are born to parents who use spoken language in the home, who receive cochlear implants early in life, and who pursue spoken language proficiency, research demonstrates that L1 language and reading skills are consistently higher for those children who have not been exposed to a signed language as an L1 or L2, and have instead focused exclusively on listening and spoken language development.<ref name=\"Communication Outcomes for Groups o\"/> In fact, \"Over 70% of children without sign language exposure achieved age-appropriate spoken language compared with only 39% of those exposed for 3 or more years.\" <ref name=\"Early Sign Language Exposure and Co\"/> Children who focused primarily on spoken language also demonstrated greater social well-being when they did not use manual communication as a supplement.<ref name=\"Percy-Smith-2008\" />\n\n=== Signing and manual methods ===\nSign languages appear naturally among deaf groups even if no formal sign language has been taught.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal|last=CORMIER|first=KEARSY|date=2006-10-13|title=Wendy Sandler & Diane Lillo-Martin, Sign language and linguistic universals.

The influence of French sign language is apparent in other signed languages, including American sign language.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n==== Manually coded English ====\n\n[[Manually coded English]] is any one of a number of different representations of the English language that uses manual signs to encode English words visually. Although MCE uses signs, it is not a language like ASL; it is an [[encoding]] of English that uses hand gestures to make English visible in a visual mode. Most types of MCE use signs borrowed or adapted from American Sign Language, but use English sentence order and grammatical construction.\n\nNumerous systems of manually encoded English have been proposed and used with greater or lesser success. Methods such as [[Signed English]], [[Signing Exact English]],<ref name=\"Kong-2008\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kong | first1 = W. W. | last2 = Ranganath | first2 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Signing exact english (see): Modeling and recognition | url = | journal = Pattern Recognition | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 1638\u20131652 | doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2007.10.016}}</ref> [[Linguistics of Visual English]], and others use signs borrowed from ASL along with various grammatical marker signs, to indicate whole words, or meaning-bearing [[morphemes]] like ''-ed'' or ''-ing''.\n\nBecause MCE systems are encodings of English which follow English word order and sentence structure, it is possible to sign MCE and speak English at the same time. This is a technique that is used in order to teach deaf children the structure of the English language not only through the sound and lip-reading patterns of spoken English, but also through manual patterns of signed English. Because of the close connection between the two, it is easier for hearing people to learn MCE than ASL.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==== Cued speech ====\n\n[[Cued speech]] is a hybrid, oral/manual system of communication used by some deaf or hard-of-hearing people. It is a technique that uses handshapes near the mouth (\"cues\") to represent phonemes that can be challenging for some deaf or hard-of-hearing people to distinguish from one another through speechreading (\"lipreading\") alone. It is designed to help receptive communicators to observe and fully understand the speaker.\n\nCued speech is not a signed language, and it does not have any signs in common with ASL. It is a kind of augmented speechreading, making speechreading much more accurate and accessible to deaf people. The handshapes by themselves have no meaning; they only have meaning as a cue in combination with a mouth shape, so that the mouth shape 'two lips together' plus one handshape might mean an 'M' sound, the same shape with a different cue might represent a 'B' sound, and with a third cue might represent a 'P' sound.\n\nSome research shows a link between lack of phonological awareness and reading disorders, and indicate that teaching cued speech may be an aid to phonological awareness and literacy.<ref name=Ostrander-1998>{{cite web |url=http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |url-status=dead |title=The Relationship Between Phonological Coding And Reading Achievement In Deaf Children: Is Cued Speech A Special Case? |first1=Carolyn |last1=Ostrander |date=1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113162758/http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2018-02-11 }}</ref>\n\n==== Fingerspelling ====\n\nAnother manual encoding system used by the deaf and which has been around for more than two centuries is [[fingerspelling]]. Fingerspelling is a system that encodes letters and not words or morphemes, so is not a manual encoding of English, but rather an encoding of the alphabet. As such, it is a method of spelling out words one letter at a time using 26 different handshapes. In the United States and many other countries, the letters are indicated on one hand<ref>Carmel, Simon (1982). ''International hand alphabet charts.'' [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)]]; 2nd edition. (June 1982). {{ISBN|0-9600886-2-8}}</ref> and go back to the deaf school of the [[Abbe de l'Epee]] in Paris. Since fingerspelling is connected to the alphabet and not to entire words, it can be used to spell out words in any language that uses the same alphabet. It is not tied to any one language in particular, and to that extent, it is analogous to other letter-encodings, such as [[Morse code]], or [[semaphore]].  The [[Rochester Method]] relies heavily on fingerspelling, but it is slow and has mostly fallen out of favor.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Hybrid methods ===\n\nHybrid methods use a mixture of aural/oral methods as well as some visible indicators such as hand shapes in order to communicate in the standard spoken language by making parts of it visible to those with hearing loss.\n\nOne example of this is sign supported English (SSE) which is used in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-sign.co.uk/what-is-british-sign-language/|title=What is British Sign Language? - Information about BSL|website=British Sign Language - Learn BSL Online|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> It is a type of sign language that is used mainly with children who are hard of hearing in schools. It is used alongside English and the signs are used in the same order as spoken English.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAnother hybrid method is called Total Communication. This method of communication allows and encourages the user to use all methods of communication.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/pdf/ODA/CommunicationOptionsDHOH_Child.pdf|title=COMMUNICATION OPTIONS FOR A CHILD WHO IS DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Social Services|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> These can include spoken language, signed language and lip reading.<ref name=\":7\" /> Like sign-supported English, signs are used in spoken English order.<ref name=\":7\" /> The use of hearing aids or implants is highly recommended for this form of communication. It is only recently that ASL has been an accepted form of communication to be used in the total communication method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rchsd.org/programs-services/cochlear-implant-program/communication-options/|title=Communication Options|website=www.rchsd.org|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Reading ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nAccording to Goldin-Meadow, reading requires two essential abilities: familiarity with a language and understanding the mapping between that language and the written word. However, reading is possible if deaf children learn ASL. Once they have acquired ASL, deaf children learn how to map between sign language and print so that they can learn English. Several techniques are used to help bridge the gap between ASL and spoken language or the \"translation process\" such as sandwiching and chaining.\n\nSandwiching consists of alternating between saying the word and signing it. Chaining consists of finger spelling a word, pointing to the spoken language version of the word and using pictorial support. Although chaining is not widely used, it creates an understanding between the visual spelling of a word and the sign language spelling of the word. This helps the child become bilingual in both ASL and spoken language.\n\nThe deaf child's social context is crucial for nurturing his or her capacity to read. Research shows that deaf children born to deaf parents are usually better readers than deaf children born to hearing parents.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is because deaf parents provide a strong social and emotional network and may immediately have access to the necessary resources for their child. Deaf parents already anticipate the needs of their child, having been through the same experience, as opposed to a hearing parent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Ethics and language acquisition==\n\nCochlear implants have been the subject of a heated debate between those who believe deaf children should receive the implants and those who do not. Certain deaf activists believe this is an important ethical problem, claiming that sign language is their first or native language, just as any other spoken language is for a hearing person. They do not see deafness as a deficiency in any way, but rather a normal human trait amongst a variety of different ones. One issue on the ethical perspective of implantation is the possible side effects that may present after surgery. However, complications from cochlear implant surgery are rare, with some centers showing less than a three percent failure rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239926.php|title=Cochlear Implant Failure Rate Generally Low|first=Grace|last= Rattue|date= January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Relationship between language acquisition and other domains of development ==\n\n=== Cognitive development ===\nEarly exposure and access to language facilitates healthy language acquisition, regardless of whether or not that language is native or non-native. in turn, strong language skills support the development of the child's cognitive skills, including executive functioning. Studies have shown that executive functioning skills are extremely important, as these are the skills that guide learning and behavior.<ref name=\":02\" /> Executive functioning skills are responsible for self-regulation, inhibition, emotional control, working memory, and planning and organization, which contribute to overall social, emotional and academic development for children.<ref name=\":02\" /> Early access to a language, whether signed or spoken, from birth supports the development of these cognitive skills and abilities in deaf and hard of hearing children, and supports their development in this area.\n\nHowever, late exposure to language and delayed language acquisition can inhibit or significantly delay the cognitive development of deaf and hard of hearing children, and impact these skills. Late exposure to language can be defined as language deprivation (see [[Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children]]). This experience is the result of a lack of exposure to natural human language, whether that be spoken or signed language, during the critical language period.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last1=Mayberry|first1=Rachel I.|last2=Lock|first2=Elizabeth|date=2003-12-01|title=Age constraints on first versus second language acquisition: Evidence for linguistic plasticity and epigenesis|journal=Brain and Language|volume=87|issue=3|pages=369\u2013384|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(03)00137-8|issn=0093-934X|pmid=14642540}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Matthew L.|last2=Hall|first2=Wyatte C.|last3=Caselli|first3=Naomi K.|date=2019-08-01|title=Deaf children need language, not (just) speech|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0142723719834102|journal=First Language|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=367\u2013395|doi=10.1177/0142723719834102|issn=0142-7237}}</ref> According to World Health Organization, approximately 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents; hearing parents that more often than not, and through no fault of their own, are not prepared to provide an accessible language to their children, therefore, some degree of language deprivation occurs in these children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wyatte C.|date=May 2017|title=What you don\u2019t know can hurt you: The risk of language deprivation by impairing sign language development in deaf children|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/|journal=Maternal and child health journal|volume=21|issue=5|pages=961\u2013965|doi=10.1007/s10995-017-2287-y|issn=1092-7875|pmc=5392137|pmid=28185206}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/westernpacific/health-topics/hearing-loss|title=Deafness and hearing loss|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref> Language Deprivation has been found to impair deaf children\u2019s cognitive development, specifically their executive functioning skills and working memory skills, causing deficits in critical executive functioning skills and overall cognitive development.

For parents with deaf children who do not use amplification (hearing aids or cochlear implants), joint attention (an important component to language development) can be problematic. Hearing children can watch their environment and listen to an adult comment on it. However, children who do not hear have to switch their visual attention back and forth between stimuli.\n\nStrategies for nonverbal communication include using facial expressions and body language to show emotion and reinforce the child's attention to their caregiver. To attract and direct a deaf child's attention, caregivers can break his line of gaze using hand and body movements, touch, and pointing to allow language input. In order to make language salient,{{clarify|reason=salient language?|date=February 2018}} parents should use short, simple sentences so that the child's attention doesn\u2019t have to be divided for too long. Finally, to reduce the need for divided attention, a caregiver can position themselves and objects within the child's visual field so that language and the object can be seen at the same time.\n\n=== Speech and oral methods ===\n\nFor deaf children who: receive cochlear implants early in life, are born to parents who use spoken language in the home, and pursue spoken language proficiency, research demonstrates that L1 language and reading skills are consistently higher for those children who have not been exposed to a signed language as an L1 or L2, and have instead focused exclusively on listening and spoken language development.<ref name=\"Communication Outcomes for Groups o\">{{cite journal|first1=Shani Joy|last1=Dettman|title=Communication Outcomes for Groups of Children Using Cochlear Implants Enrolled in Auditory-Verbal, Aural-Oral, and Bilingual-Bicultural Early Intervention Programs|journal=Otology & Neurotology|date=2013|volume=34|issue=3|doi=10.1097/mao.0b013e3182839650|pmid=23442569|pages=451\u20139}}</ref> In fact, \"Over 70% of children without sign language exposure achieved age-appropriate spoken language compared with only 39% of those exposed for 3 or more years.\" <ref name=\"Early Sign Language Exposure and Co\">{{cite journal|first1=Ann|last1=Geers|title=Early Sign Language Exposure and Cochlear Implantation Benefits|journal=Pediatrics|date=2017|volume=140|issue=1|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-3489|pmid=28759398|pmc=5495521|page=e20163489}}</ref> Children who focused primarily on spoken language also demonstrated greater social well-being when they did not use manual communication as a supplement.<ref name=\"Percy-Smith-2008\" />\n\nFor deaf children who are born to parents who use spoken language in the home, who receive cochlear implants early in life, and who pursue spoken language proficiency, research demonstrates that L1 language and reading skills are consistently higher for those children who have not been exposed to a signed language as an L1 or L2, and have instead focused exclusively on listening and spoken language development.<ref name=\"Communication Outcomes for Groups o\"/> In fact, \"Over 70% of children without sign language exposure achieved age-appropriate spoken language compared with only 39% of those exposed for 3 or more years.\" <ref name=\"Early Sign Language Exposure and Co\"/> Children who focused primarily on spoken language also demonstrated greater social well-being when they did not use manual communication as a supplement.<ref name=\"Percy-Smith-2008\" />\n\n=== Signing and manual methods ===\nSign languages appear naturally among deaf groups even if no formal sign language has been taught.<ref name=\":17\">{{Cite journal|last=CORMIER|first=KEARSY|date=2006-10-13|title=Wendy Sandler & Diane Lillo-Martin, Sign language and linguistic universals.

The influence of French sign language is apparent in other signed languages, including American sign language.<ref name=\":19\" />\n\n==== Manually coded English ====\n\n[[Manually coded English]] is any one of a number of different representations of the English language that uses manual signs to encode English words visually. Although MCE uses signs, it is not a language like ASL; it is an [[encoding]] of English that uses hand gestures to make English visible in a visual mode. Most types of MCE use signs borrowed or adapted from American Sign Language, but use English sentence order and grammatical construction.\n\nNumerous systems of manually encoded English have been proposed and used with greater or lesser success. Methods such as [[Signed English]], [[Signing Exact English]],<ref name=\"Kong-2008\">{{cite journal | last1 = Kong | first1 = W. W. | last2 = Ranganath | first2 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Signing exact english (see): Modeling and recognition | url = | journal = Pattern Recognition | volume = 41 | issue = 5| pages = 1638\u20131652 | doi=10.1016/j.patcog.2007.10.016}}</ref> [[Linguistics of Visual English]], and others use signs borrowed from ASL along with various grammatical marker signs, to indicate whole words, or meaning-bearing [[morphemes]] like ''-ed'' or ''-ing''.\n\nBecause MCE systems are encodings of English which follow English word order and sentence structure, it is possible to sign MCE and speak English at the same time. This is a technique that is used in order to teach deaf children the structure of the English language not only through the sound and lip-reading patterns of spoken English, but also through manual patterns of signed English. Because of the close connection between the two, it is easier for hearing people to learn MCE than ASL.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==== Cued speech ====\n\n[[Cued speech]] is a hybrid, oral/manual system of communication used by some deaf or hard-of-hearing people. It is a technique that uses handshapes near the mouth (\"cues\") to represent phonemes that can be challenging for some deaf or hard-of-hearing people to distinguish from one another through speechreading (\"lipreading\") alone. It is designed to help receptive communicators to observe and fully understand the speaker.\n\nCued speech is not a signed language, and it does not have any signs in common with ASL. It is a kind of augmented speechreading, making speechreading much more accurate and accessible to deaf people. The handshapes by themselves have no meaning; they only have meaning as a cue in combination with a mouth shape, so that the mouth shape 'two lips together' plus one handshape might mean an 'M' sound, the same shape with a different cue might represent a 'B' sound, and with a third cue might represent a 'P' sound.\n\nSome research shows a link between lack of phonological awareness and reading disorders, and indicate that teaching cued speech may be an aid to phonological awareness and literacy.<ref name=Ostrander-1998>{{cite web |url=http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |url-status=dead |title=The Relationship Between Phonological Coding And Reading Achievement In Deaf Children: Is Cued Speech A Special Case? |first1=Carolyn |last1=Ostrander |date=1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113162758/http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2018-02-11 }}</ref>\n\n==== Fingerspelling ====\n\nAnother manual encoding system used by the deaf and which has been around for more than two centuries is [[fingerspelling]]. Fingerspelling is a system that encodes letters and not words or morphemes, so is not a manual encoding of English, but rather an encoding of the alphabet. As such, it is a method of spelling out words one letter at a time using 26 different handshapes. In the United States and many other countries, the letters are indicated on one hand<ref>Carmel, Simon (1982). ''International hand alphabet charts.'' [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)]]; 2nd edition. (June 1982). {{ISBN|0-9600886-2-8}}</ref> and go back to the deaf school of the [[Abbe de l'Epee]] in Paris. Since fingerspelling is connected to the alphabet and not to entire words, it can be used to spell out words in any language that uses the same alphabet. It is not tied to any one language in particular, and to that extent, it is analogous to other letter-encodings, such as [[Morse code]], or [[semaphore]].  The [[Rochester Method]] relies heavily on fingerspelling, but it is slow and has mostly fallen out of favor.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n=== Hybrid methods ===\n\nHybrid methods use a mixture of aural/oral methods as well as some visible indicators such as hand shapes in order to communicate in the standard spoken language by making parts of it visible to those with hearing loss.\n\nOne example of this is sign supported English (SSE) which is used in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.british-sign.co.uk/what-is-british-sign-language/|title=What is British Sign Language? - Information about BSL|website=British Sign Language - Learn BSL Online|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> It is a type of sign language that is used mainly with children who are hard of hearing in schools. It is used alongside English and the signs are used in the same order as spoken English.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAnother hybrid method is called Total Communication. This method of communication allows and encourages the user to use all methods of communication.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdss.ca.gov/cdssweb/entres/pdf/ODA/CommunicationOptionsDHOH_Child.pdf|title=COMMUNICATION OPTIONS FOR A CHILD WHO IS DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Social Services|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> These can include spoken language, signed language and lip reading.<ref name=\":7\" /> Like sign-supported English, signs are used in spoken English order.<ref name=\":7\" /> The use of hearing aids or implants is highly recommended for this form of communication. It is only recently that ASL has been an accepted form of communication to be used in the total communication method.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rchsd.org/programs-services/cochlear-implant-program/communication-options/|title=Communication Options|website=www.rchsd.org|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Reading ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nAccording to Goldin-Meadow, reading requires two essential abilities: familiarity with a language and understanding the mapping between that language and the written word. However, reading is possible if deaf children learn ASL. Once they have acquired ASL, deaf children learn how to map between sign language and print so that they can learn English. Several techniques are used to help bridge the gap between ASL and spoken language or the \"translation process\" such as sandwiching and chaining.\n\nSandwiching consists of alternating between saying the word and signing it. Chaining consists of finger spelling a word, pointing to the spoken language version of the word and using pictorial support. Although chaining is not widely used, it creates an understanding between the visual spelling of a word and the sign language spelling of the word. This helps the child become bilingual in both ASL and spoken language.\n\nThe deaf child's social context is crucial for nurturing his or her capacity to read. Research shows that deaf children born to deaf parents are usually better readers than deaf children born to hearing parents.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is because deaf parents provide a strong social and emotional network and may immediately have access to the necessary resources for their child. Deaf parents already anticipate the needs of their child, having been through the same experience, as opposed to a hearing parent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n==Ethics and language acquisition==\n\nCochlear implants have been the subject of a heated debate between those who believe deaf children should receive the implants and those who do not. Certain deaf activists believe this is an important ethical problem, claiming that sign language is their first or native language, just as any other spoken language is for a hearing person. They do not see deafness as a deficiency in any way, but rather a normal human trait amongst a variety of different ones. One issue on the ethical perspective of implantation is the possible side effects that may present after surgery. However, complications from cochlear implant surgery are rare, with some centers showing less than a three percent failure rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239926.php|title=Cochlear Implant Failure Rate Generally Low|first=Grace|last= Rattue|date= January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Relationship between language acquisition and other domains of development ==\n\n=== Cognitive development ===\nEarly exposure and access to language facilitates healthy language acquisition, regardless of whether or not that language is native or non-native. in turn, strong language skills support the development of the child's cognitive skills, including executive functioning. Studies have shown that executive functioning skills are extremely important, as these are the skills that guide learning and behavior.<ref name=\":02\" /> Executive functioning skills are responsible for self-regulation, inhibition, emotional control, working memory, and planning and organization, which contribute to overall social, emotional and academic development for children.<ref name=\":02\" /> Early access to a language, whether signed or spoken, from birth supports the development of these cognitive skills and abilities in deaf and hard of hearing children, and supports their development in this area.\n\nHowever, late exposure to language and delayed language acquisition can inhibit or significantly delay the cognitive development of deaf and hard of hearing children, and impact these skills. Late exposure to language can be defined as language deprivation (see [[Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children]]). This experience is the result of a lack of exposure to natural human language, whether that be spoken or signed language, during the critical language period.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last1=Mayberry|first1=Rachel I.|last2=Lock|first2=Elizabeth|date=2003-12-01|title=Age constraints on first versus second language acquisition: Evidence for linguistic plasticity and epigenesis|journal=Brain and Language|volume=87|issue=3|pages=369\u2013384|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(03)00137-8|issn=0093-934X|pmid=14642540}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Matthew L.|last2=Hall|first2=Wyatte C.|last3=Caselli|first3=Naomi K.|date=2019-08-01|title=Deaf children need language, not (just) speech|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0142723719834102|journal=First Language|language=en|volume=39|issue=4|pages=367\u2013395|doi=10.1177/0142723719834102|issn=0142-7237}}</ref> According to World Health Organization, approximately 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents; hearing parents that more often than not, and through no fault of their own, are not prepared to provide an accessible language to their children, therefore, some degree of language deprivation occurs in these children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Wyatte C.|date=May 2017|title=What you don\u2019t know can hurt you: The risk of language deprivation by impairing sign language development in deaf children|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5392137/|journal=Maternal and child health journal|volume=21|issue=5|pages=961\u2013965|doi=10.1007/s10995-017-2287-y|issn=1092-7875|pmc=5392137|pmid=28185206}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/westernpacific/health-topics/hearing-loss|title=Deafness and hearing loss|website=www.who.int|language=en|access-date=2020-04-27}}</ref> Language Deprivation has been found to impair deaf children\u2019s cognitive development, specifically their executive functioning skills and working memory skills, causing deficits in critical executive functioning skills and overall cognitive development.

All of this can lead to struggles with age appropriate emotional development. It will be hard on a child who was not given a language early in life to try and express their emotions appropriately.
