He became active in local politics. Forbes first entered the House of Representatives in 1908 as a member of the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]], and when that party declined he became the leader of the newly created [[United Party (New Zealand)|United Party]] in 1928. His rise to power as Prime Minister was unexpected, and some believed him unsuited to the post; it was his misfortune to hold office during the very worst period of the [[Great Depression]].

He gained his education at [[Christchurch Boys' High School]] in Christchurch, and did not attend university.

He stood as an independent, having failed to gain the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] nomination. He lost the election. At the {{NZ election link|1908}}, however, he became the Liberal Party's official Hurunui candidate, and won the seat of Hurunui. He would hold this seat for thirty-five years.\n\nForbes remained a [[backbencher]] for some time, but became the Liberal Party's [[Senior Whip of the Liberal Party|Whip]] when party leader [[Thomas Mackenzie]] became Prime Minister in March 1912. He retained this position when his party went into [[Parliamentary Opposition|Opposition]] on 10 July 1912. However, he had considerably higher status within the party than his official responsibilities indicated, although few thought of him as a potential leader.\n\nBy the early 1920s, the Liberal Party faced a decision as to its political future. The [[Reform Party (New Zealand)|Reform Party]] government of [[William Massey]] dominated the political scene, having secured the conservative vote, while the growing [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] had started to undermine Liberal's progressive voter-base. Many members of the Liberal Party believed an alliance with the Reform Party inevitable, seeing such co-operation as necessary to counteract the \"radicalism\" of the Labour Party. When Massey died in 1925, Liberal leader [[Thomas Wilford]] decided to approach Massey's successor with a merger-proposal, suggesting that the new party could use the name \"the National Party\". The Liberal Party chose Forbes to represent them at a joint conference. The new Reform Party leader, [[Gordon Coates]], rejected the proposal, although Wilford declared that Liberal would adopt the name \"National\" regardless.\n\n==Party leader==\n[[File:George Forbes, 1914.jpg|thumb|Forbes in 1914]]\nShortly after the merger proposal was rejected, Wilford resigned as leader, and Forbes unexpectedly became party leader. In the [[1925 New Zealand general election|election later that year]], however, the party did very badly, gaining only eleven seats compared with Reform's fifty-five. To compound the injury, Forbes no longer even held the post of [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] \u2013 the Labour Party had won twelve seats, enabling its leader [[Harry Holland]] to claim seniority in Opposition, although with two independents sitting in opposition as well the position of Leader of the Opposition remained vacant until Labour won the [[1926 Eden by-election]].\n\nThe party's poor fortune did not last long, however. In 1927, Liberal Party politician [[Bill Veitch]] secured an alliance with [[Albert Davy]], a former Reform Party [[Party organizer|organiser]] who had become dissatisfied with what he saw as Reform's [[paternalism]] and intrusive governance. The former Liberal Party (still known as National) absorbed Davy's new \"United New Zealand Political Organization\", and adopted the name \"[[United Party (New Zealand)|the United Party]]\". Forbes and Veitch both vied as candidates for the leadership of the United Party, but the position eventually went to a former Liberal Party Prime Minister, [[Joseph Ward]]. Forbes  became one of two deputy leaders, having particular responsibility for the [[South Island]].\n\nUnder the United banner, bolstered by Reform Party dissidents, the remnants of the old Liberal Party once again gained traction. In the [[1928 New Zealand general election|1928 election]], United formed a government with backing from the Labour Party. Forbes gained the portfolios of Lands and Agriculture. Gradually, however, Ward's health declined to the state where he was unable to carry out his duties, and Forbes became leader in all but name. In 1930, Ward finally gave his official resignation, and Forbes became Prime Minister. He also made himself [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].\n\n==Prime Minister==\nAs Prime Minister, Forbes, described as \"apathetic and fatalistic\", reacted to events but showed little vision or purpose. Opponents also criticised him for relying too much on the advice of his friends. However, the depression years proved a difficult time for many governments around the world, and his defenders claim that he did the best job possible in the circumstances of the economic crisis. During his premiership, Forbes also served as the [[Department of Island Territories (New Zealand)#Minister of Island Territories|Minister of External Affairs]] between 1930 and 1935.<ref>''New Zealand Parliamentary Debates'', vol. 226-243 (1930-1935).</ref>\n\nThe Forbes government began to show signs of instability when the Labour Party withdrew its support. Labour expressed dissatisfaction with a number of the government's economic measures \u2013 Forbes intended them to reduce the government deficit and to stimulate the economy, but Labour claimed that they unnecessarily harmed the interests of poorer citizens. Forbes had perforce to continue with reluctant support from the Reform Party, which now feared Labour's growing popularity.\n\nIn late 1931, Forbes called for a \"grand coalition\" of United, Reform, and Labour to resolve the country's economic problems. Forbes told a joint conference that he would not implement the measures he deemed necessary without broad backing. Labour refused to join this coalition, but ex-PM Coates (prompted by the Reform Party's finance spokesperson, [[William Downie Stewart Jr]]) eventually agreed.\n\nIn the [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931 election]], the [[United-Reform Coalition]] performed well, winning a combined total of fifty-one seats. Forbes remained Prime Minister, but surrendered the finance role to William Stewart. Slowly, however, many people came to believe that Coates held significantly too much power, and that Forbes showed himself overwilling to give in to Coates' demands. This view became reinforced when Coates and Stewart argued over financial policy \u2013 although Forbes was known to prefer Stewart's policy, he publicly sided with Coates, and Stewart resigned.\n\nCoates replaced Stewart as Minister of Finance, and became even more dominant in the coalition. Stewart, noting this, complained that \"the Prime Minister is too passive and the Minister of Finance is too active\". Both Forbes and Coates, however, increasingly took the blame for the country's ongoing economic problems, and could not avoid public dissatisfaction. In the [[1935 New Zealand general election|election of 1935]] the Labour Party defeated the coalition government, gaining fifty-five votes to the coalition's nineteen.\n\nIn 1935, Forbes was awarded the [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]],<ref name=\"EP\">{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=EP19350506.2.12  | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 | work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] | accessdate=2 July 2013 | page=4 }}</ref> and in 1937, he was awarded the [[King George VI Coronation Medal]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Alister|last=Taylor| title=The New Zealand Roll of Honour| publisher=Alister Taylor| year=1998 | isbn=0-908578-58-X| pages=449}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nBy 1935 Forbes had become increasingly weary of politics, writing that he agreed with Stewart's description of the profession as \"slavery that is miscalled power\". Nevertheless, Forbes reluctantly allowed his colleagues to select him as Leader of the Opposition, and from May 1936 led the new [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] (created out of United and Reform) until October 1936 when [[Adam Hamilton]] became the party leader. Both party and leader agreed on Forbes's tenure as leader of the new National Party as a temporary measure, as Forbes had indicated his desire to withdraw from the limelight, and younger figures in the party saw his past tenure as a political liability.\n\nForbes retained his parliamentary seat until 1943, when he retired after 35 years as a Member of Parliament. He declined the offer of the customary knighthood, and four years after his retirement he died at Crystal Brook, his farm near [[Cheviot, New Zealand|Cheviot]].\n\nThe national memorial for Forbes, the George Forbes Memorial Library, forms part of [[Lincoln University, New Zealand|Lincoln University]] near Christchurch.<ref>See {{citation |title = Architectural competition |journal=Journal of the NZ Institute of Architects |volume = 23 |issue = 8 |page = 201 |year = 1956}}, and {{citation |first1 = M.

The new Reform Party leader, [[Gordon Coates]], rejected the proposal, although Wilford declared that Liberal would adopt the name \"National\" regardless.\n\n==Party leader==\n[[File:George Forbes, 1914.jpg|thumb|Forbes in 1914]]\nShortly after the merger proposal was rejected, Wilford resigned as leader, and Forbes unexpectedly became party leader. In the [[1925 New Zealand general election|election later that year]], however, the party did very badly, gaining only eleven seats compared with Reform's fifty-five. To compound the injury, Forbes no longer even held the post of [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] \u2013 the Labour Party had won twelve seats, enabling its leader [[Harry Holland]] to claim seniority in Opposition, although with two independents sitting in opposition as well the position of Leader of the Opposition remained vacant until Labour won the [[1926 Eden by-election]].\n\nThe party's poor fortune did not last long, however. In 1927, Liberal Party politician [[Bill Veitch]] secured an alliance with [[Albert Davy]], a former Reform Party [[Party organizer|organiser]] who had become dissatisfied with what he saw as Reform's [[paternalism]] and intrusive governance. The former Liberal Party (still known as National) absorbed Davy's new \"United New Zealand Political Organization\", and adopted the name \"[[United Party (New Zealand)|the United Party]]\". Forbes and Veitch both vied as candidates for the leadership of the United Party, but the position eventually went to a former Liberal Party Prime Minister, [[Joseph Ward]]. Forbes  became one of two deputy leaders, having particular responsibility for the [[South Island]].\n\nUnder the United banner, bolstered by Reform Party dissidents, the remnants of the old Liberal Party once again gained traction. In the [[1928 New Zealand general election|1928 election]], United formed a government with backing from the Labour Party. Forbes gained the portfolios of Lands and Agriculture. Gradually, however, Ward's health declined to the state where he was unable to carry out his duties, and Forbes became leader in all but name. In 1930, Ward finally gave his official resignation, and Forbes became Prime Minister. He also made himself [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]].\n\n==Prime Minister==\nAs Prime Minister, Forbes, described as \"apathetic and fatalistic\", reacted to events but showed little vision or purpose. Opponents also criticised him for relying too much on the advice of his friends. However, the depression years proved a difficult time for many governments around the world, and his defenders claim that he did the best job possible in the circumstances of the economic crisis. During his premiership, Forbes also served as the [[Department of Island Territories (New Zealand)#Minister of Island Territories|Minister of External Affairs]] between 1930 and 1935.<ref>''New Zealand Parliamentary Debates'', vol. 226-243 (1930-1935).</ref>\n\nThe Forbes government began to show signs of instability when the Labour Party withdrew its support. Labour expressed dissatisfaction with a number of the government's economic measures \u2013 Forbes intended them to reduce the government deficit and to stimulate the economy, but Labour claimed that they unnecessarily harmed the interests of poorer citizens. Forbes had perforce to continue with reluctant support from the Reform Party, which now feared Labour's growing popularity.\n\nIn late 1931, Forbes called for a \"grand coalition\" of United, Reform, and Labour to resolve the country's economic problems. Forbes told a joint conference that he would not implement the measures he deemed necessary without broad backing. Labour refused to join this coalition, but ex-PM Coates (prompted by the Reform Party's finance spokesperson, [[William Downie Stewart Jr]]) eventually agreed.\n\nIn the [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931 election]], the [[United-Reform Coalition]] performed well, winning a combined total of fifty-one seats. Forbes remained Prime Minister, but surrendered the finance role to William Stewart. Slowly, however, many people came to believe that Coates held significantly too much power, and that Forbes showed himself overwilling to give in to Coates' demands. This view became reinforced when Coates and Stewart argued over financial policy \u2013 although Forbes was known to prefer Stewart's policy, he publicly sided with Coates, and Stewart resigned.\n\nCoates replaced Stewart as Minister of Finance, and became even more dominant in the coalition. Stewart, noting this, complained that \"the Prime Minister is too passive and the Minister of Finance is too active\". Both Forbes and Coates, however, increasingly took the blame for the country's ongoing economic problems, and could not avoid public dissatisfaction. In the [[1935 New Zealand general election|election of 1935]] the Labour Party defeated the coalition government, gaining fifty-five votes to the coalition's nineteen.\n\nIn 1935, Forbes was awarded the [[King George V Silver Jubilee Medal]],<ref name=\"EP\">{{cite news | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=EP19350506.2.12  | title=Official jubilee medals | date=6 May 1935 | work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]] | accessdate=2 July 2013 | page=4 }}</ref> and in 1937, he was awarded the [[King George VI Coronation Medal]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Alister|last=Taylor| title=The New Zealand Roll of Honour| publisher=Alister Taylor| year=1998 | isbn=0-908578-58-X| pages=449}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nBy 1935 Forbes had become increasingly weary of politics, writing that he agreed with Stewart's description of the profession as \"slavery that is miscalled power\". Nevertheless, Forbes reluctantly allowed his colleagues to select him as Leader of the Opposition, and from May 1936 led the new [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] (created out of United and Reform) until October 1936 when [[Adam Hamilton]] became the party leader. Both party and leader agreed on Forbes's tenure as leader of the new National Party as a temporary measure, as Forbes had indicated his desire to withdraw from the limelight, and younger figures in the party saw his past tenure as a political liability.\n\nForbes retained his parliamentary seat until 1943, when he retired after 35 years as a Member of Parliament. He declined the offer of the customary knighthood, and four years after his retirement he died at Crystal Brook, his farm near [[Cheviot, New Zealand|Cheviot]].\n\nThe national memorial for Forbes, the George Forbes Memorial Library, forms part of [[Lincoln University, New Zealand|Lincoln University]] near Christchurch.<ref>See {{citation |title = Architectural competition |journal=Journal of the NZ Institute of Architects |volume = 23 |issue = 8 |page = 201 |year = 1956}}, and {{citation |first1 = M.
