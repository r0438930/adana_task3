It was held at the Heylshof Garden in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], then an [[Imperial Free City]] of the Empire. An imperial diet was a formal deliberative assembly of the whole Empire. This one is most memorable for the '''Edict of Worms''' (''Wormser Edikt''), which addressed [[Martin Luther]] and the effects of the [[Protestant Reformation]].\nIt was conducted from 28 January to 25 May 1521, with the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] presiding.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130102175338/http://www.worms.de/downloads/Chronik.pdf Chronik der Stadt Worms] Internet Archive</ref>\n\nOther imperial diets took place at Worms in the years 829, 926, 1076, 1122, [[Diet of Worms (1495)|1495]], and 1545, but unless plainly qualified, the term \"Diet of Worms\" usually refers to the assembly of 1521.\n\n== Background ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Summons for Luther to appear at the Diet of Worms.jpg|thumb|Summons for Luther to appear at the Diet of Worms, signed by Charles V. The text on the left was on the reverse side.]]\nIn June of the previous year, 1520, [[Pope Leo X]] issued the [[Papal bull]] ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' (\"Arise, O Lord\"), outlining forty-one purported errors found in [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Ninety-five Theses]] and other writings related to or written by him. Luther was summoned by the emperor. Prince [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]] obtained an agreement that if Luther appeared he would be promised safe passage to and from the meeting. This guarantee was essential after the treatment of [[Jan Hus]], who was tried and executed at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 despite a promise of safe conduct.\n\n[[Emperor Charles V]] commenced the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of Worms on 23 January 1521. Luther was summoned to renounce or reaffirm his views. When he appeared before the assembly on 16 April, Johann Eck<!-- Do not link to [[Johann Eck]]\u2014a different person by the same name-->, an assistant of the [[Archbishop of Trier]] ([[Richard von Greiffenklau zu Vollrads]] at that time), acted as spokesman for the emperor.\n\n==Martin Luther==\n[[File:Luther-in-Worms-auf-Rt.jpg|thumb|Luther in Worms, colorized woodcut, 1577]]\nThe main events of the Diet of Worms relating to Luther took place from 16 to 18 April 1521.\n\nOn 16 April, Luther arrived in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. Luther was told to appear before the Diet at 4 p.m. the following day. Dr Jeromee Schurff, Wittenberg professor in Canon Law, was to act as Luther's lawyer before the Diet.\n\nOn 17 April, the imperial marshal, Ulrich von Pappenheim, and the herald, Caspar Sturm, came for Luther.<ref>{{cite book |title=History of the Christian Church |last= Schaff|first= Philip|year=2015 |publisher=Arkrose Press |isbn= 1346209650 |page=145}}</ref> Pappenheim reminded Luther that he should speak only in answer to direct questions from the presiding officer, [[Johann Eck]]. Eck asked if a collection of books was Luther's and if he was ready to revoke their heresies. Dr Schurff said, \"Please have the titles read.\" There were 25 of them, probably including ''The 95 Theses'', ''Resolutions Concerning the 95 Theses'', ''On the Papacy at Rome'', ''Address to the Christian Nobility'', ''The Babylonian Captivity of the Church'', and ''On the Freedom of a Christian''. Luther requested more time for a proper answer, so he was given until the next day at 4 p.m. On 18 April, Luther, saying that he had prayed for long hours and consulted with friends and mediators, presented himself before the Diet. When the counselor put the same questions to him, Luther first apologized that he lacked the etiquette of the court. Then he answered, \"They are all mine, but as for the second question, they are not all of one sort.\" Luther went on to place the writings into three categories: (1) Works which were well received even by his enemies: those he would not reject. (2) Books which attacked the abuses, lies and desolation of the [[Christianity|Christian]] world and the papacy: those, Luther believed, could not safely be rejected without encouraging abuses to continue. To retract them would be to open the door to further oppression.<ref name=\"Oberman\">Oberman, Heiko, ''Luther: Man Between God and the Devil'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-300-10313-1}}.</ref> \"If I now recant these, then, I would be doing nothing but strengthening tyranny\".<ref name=\"Oberman\"/> (3) Attacks on individuals: he apologized for the harsh tone of these writings but did not reject the substance of what he taught in them; if he could be shown by [[Scripture]] that his writings were in error, Luther continued, he would reject them.  Luther concluded by saying:\n\n<blockquote>\nUnless I am convinced by the testimony of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since it is well known that they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God.

Through negotiations by his prince, [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick III]], Luther had been given a letter of safe conduct to and from the hearing. After his dismissal he departed for his home in [[Wittenberg]]. However, fearing for Luther's safety, Frederick III sent men to fake a highway attack and abduct Luther, hiding him away at [[Wartburg]] Castle.\n\n== Edict of Worms ==\n\nThe Edict of Worms was a decree issued on 25 May 1521 by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]], declaring:\n\n{{quote|For this reason we forbid anyone from this time forward to dare, either by words or by deeds, to receive, defend, sustain, or favour the said Martin Luther.

Those who will help in his capture will be rewarded generously for their good work.}}\n\nThe Papal [[nuncio]] at the diet, [[Girolamo Aleandro]], drew up and proposed the denunciations of Luther that were embodied in the Edict of Worms, promulgated on 26 May. The Edict declared Luther to be an obstinate heretic and banned the reading or possession of his writings.\n\nIt was the culmination of an ongoing struggle between Martin Luther and the [[Catholic Church]] over reform, especially concerning the practice of donations for [[indulgences]]. However, there were other deeper issues that revolved around both theological concerns:\n*On a theological level, Luther had challenged the absolute authority of the Pope over the Church by maintaining that the doctrine of [[indulgences]], as authorized and taught by the Pope, was wrong.<ref name=Noll>{{cite book|last=Noll|first=Mark A.|title=Turning Points: Decisive Moments in the History of Christianity|origyear=1997|year=2000|publisher=Baker Academic|location=Grand Rapids, MI|isbn=978-0-8010-1159-7 |page=160}}</ref> \n*Luther maintained that salvation was by faith alone (''[[sola fide]]'') without reference to good works, alms, penance, or the [[Catholic Church|Church's]] [[Catholic sacraments|sacraments]]. Luther maintained that the sacraments were a \"means of grace,\" meaning that while grace was imparted through the Sacraments, the credit for the action belonged to God and not to the individual.<ref>{{cite web|last=Graebner |first=Augustus Lawrence |title=Outlines of Doctrinal Theology |url=http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt |publisher=Saint Louis, MO: Concordia Publishing House. p. 161. |accessdate=15 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121113340/http://www.ctsfw.edu/etext/graebneral/soteriology.txt |archivedate=21 January 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n*He had also challenged the authority of the Church by maintaining that all doctrines and [[dogma]]ta of the Church not found in Scripture should be discarded (''[[sola scriptura]]'').\n\nTo protect the authority of the Pope and the Church, as well as to maintain the doctrine of indulgences, ecclesiastical officials convinced Charles V that Luther was a threat and persuaded him to authorize his condemnation by the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Luther escaped arrest and remained in seclusion at [[Wartburg castle]] for several months where he continued to write and [[Luther Bible|translate the New Testament into German]].\n\n== Other decisions==\nThe Diet of Worms was also the occasion for Charles V to reform the administration of the Empire. Given the vast domains of the House of Habsburg, the Emperor was often on the road and needed deputies (such as the [[Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands|Governors of the Netherlands]] and the [[Regent of Spain|Regents of Spain]]) for the times he was absent from his territories. Charles V elevated his younger brother [[Emperor Ferdinand I|Ferdinand]] to the status of [[Archduke]] as Imperial Lieutenant. As such, Ferdinand became regent and governor of the [[Austrian hereditary lands]] of Charles V as well as his representative in Germany. Ferdinand's role as chairman of the German [[Imperial government]] was never really implemented and ended in 1523 with the dissolution of the body. Ferdinand's rule of the Austrian lands in the name of the Emperor was confirmed with the secret ''Habsburg compact of Brussels'' (1522), according to which Charles also agreed to favor the election of Ferdinand as [[King of the Romans]] in Germany (which took place [[Imperial election, 1531|in 1531]]). Following the abdications of Charles V in 1556, Ferdinand succeeded Charles as Emperor and became [[suo jure]] Archduke of Austria.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=XsQeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=compact+of+brussels+1522&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6yISOgY3kAhVhw8QBHS55ANkQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=compact%20of%20brussels%201522&f=false]</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDespite the agreement that he could return home safely, it was privately understood that Luther would soon be arrested and punished. To protect him from this fate, [[Frederick III of Saxony|Prince Frederick]] seized him on his way home and hid him in [[Wartburg Castle]]. It was during his time in the Wartburg Castle that Luther began his German translation of the Bible. Martin Luther's powerful testimony of faith at the Diet of Worms in 1521 made an indelible impression upon the mind of [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], who turned his eyes to the new faith earlier than any other German prince or any other member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. Moreover, Luther entered into correspondence with him, discussing with him the most important problems of faith. The edict was temporarily suspended at the [[Diet of Speyer 1526]] but then [[Diet of Speyer 1529|reinstated in 1529]].\n\nWhen Luther eventually emerged from the Wartburg, the emperor, distracted with other matters, did not press for Luther's arrest. Ultimately, because of rising public support for Luther among the German people and the protection of certain German princes, the Edict of Worms was never enforced in Germany. However, in the Low Countries (comprising modern-day [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]]), the Edict was initially enforced against Luther's most active supporters. This could be done because these countries were under the direct rule of Emperor Charles V and his appointed regent, [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy]] (and Charles's aunt). In December 1521, Jacob Proost, prior of the [[Augustinian]] monastery in [[Antwerp]], was the first Luther-supporting cleric to be arrested and prosecuted under the terms of the Worms Edict. In February 1522, Proost was compelled to make public recantation and repudiation of Luther's teachings. Later that year, additional arrests were made among the Augustinians in Antwerp. Two monks, [[Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos]], refused to recant; on 1 July 1523, they were [[burned at the stake]] in Brussels.<ref>Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L.

Following the abdications of Charles V in 1556, Ferdinand succeeded Charles as Emperor and became [[suo jure]] Archduke of Austria.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=arSYDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36&dq=spanish+habsburg+branch+1521&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwij-5XLnMLlAhVBzqQKHQ2pBD4Q6AEIQjAD#v=onepage&q=spanish%20habsburg%20branch%201521&f=false]</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GwV_DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA50&dq=Ferdinand+archduke+of+austria+1521#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20archduke%20of%20austria%201521&f=false|title=History of the German speaking nations|date=2019|isbn=9781789017182|language=en|last1=Kanski|first1=Jack J.}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=XsQeBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&dq=compact+of+brussels+1522&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi6yISOgY3kAhVhw8QBHS55ANkQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=compact%20of%20brussels%201522&f=false]</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nDespite the agreement that he could return home safely, it was privately understood that Luther would soon be arrested and punished. To protect him from this fate, [[Frederick III of Saxony|Prince Frederick]] seized him on his way home and hid him in [[Wartburg Castle]]. It was during his time in the Wartburg Castle that Luther began his German translation of the Bible. Martin Luther's powerful testimony of faith at the Diet of Worms in 1521 made an indelible impression upon the mind of [[George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], who turned his eyes to the new faith earlier than any other German prince or any other member of the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. Moreover, Luther entered into correspondence with him, discussing with him the most important problems of faith. The edict was temporarily suspended at the [[Diet of Speyer 1526]] but then [[Diet of Speyer 1529|reinstated in 1529]].\n\nWhen Luther eventually emerged from the Wartburg, the emperor, distracted with other matters, did not press for Luther's arrest. Ultimately, because of rising public support for Luther among the German people and the protection of certain German princes, the Edict of Worms was never enforced in Germany. However, in the Low Countries (comprising modern-day [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]]), the Edict was initially enforced against Luther's most active supporters. This could be done because these countries were under the direct rule of Emperor Charles V and his appointed regent, [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy]] (and Charles's aunt). In December 1521, Jacob Proost, prior of the [[Augustinian]] monastery in [[Antwerp]], was the first Luther-supporting cleric to be arrested and prosecuted under the terms of the Worms Edict. In February 1522, Proost was compelled to make public recantation and repudiation of Luther's teachings. Later that year, additional arrests were made among the Augustinians in Antwerp. Two monks, [[Jan van Essen and Hendrik Vos]], refused to recant; on 1 July 1523, they were [[burned at the stake]] in Brussels.<ref>Brecht, Martin. Martin Luther. tr. James L.
