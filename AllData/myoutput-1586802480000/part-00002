The crisis began on June 28, 1914, when [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Bosnian Serb]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], [[heir presumptive]] to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] throne. A complex web of alliances, coupled with miscalculations by many leaders that war was in their best interests or that a general war would not occur, resulted in a general outbreak of hostilities among almost every major European nation in early August 1914; every major European nation was involved by May 1915.\n\nAustria-Hungary viewed the [[irredentist]] movements of [[South Slav]]s, as promoted by [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], to be a threat to the unity of the nation. Following the assassination, Austria sought to inflict a military blow on Serbia to demonstrate strength and so Serbia would be more cautious about supporting [[Yugoslav nationalism]]. However, it was wary of the reaction of the [[Russian Empire]], who were a major supporter of Serbia, so sought a guarantee from its ally [[German Empire|Germany]] that it would support Austria in any conflict. Germany guaranteed its support, but urged Austria to attack quickly, while world sympathy for Ferdinand was high, in order to localize the war and avoid drawing in Russia. Some German leaders believed that growing Russian economic power would change the balance of power between the two nations, that a war was inevitable, and that Germany would be better off if a war happened soon. However, rather than a quick attack with available military forces, Austrian leaders deliberated into mid-July before deciding that it would give Serbia a harsh ultimatum on 23 July and would not attack without a full mobilisation of its army that could not be accomplished before 25 July 1914.\n\nJust prior to the Serbian reply to the ultimatum, Russia decided that it would intervene in any Austro{{ndash}}Serbian war and ordered a partial mobilization of its armed forces. While Russian military leadership acknowledged that Russia was not yet strong enough for a general war, Russia believed the Austrian grievance against Serbia was a pretext orchestrated by Germany and that it needed to show strength by protecting its Serbian ally. This mobilization was the first major military action not by a direct participant in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia; it increased the willingness of Serbia to defy the threat of an Austrian attack and greatly increased the alarm in Germany about masses of Russian troops being assembled near its borders. Previously, the German military predicted that Russian mobilization would be slower than that of its French ally on Germany's opposite border; therefore, German military strategy in any conflict with Russia was to attack France through [[Belgium]] to avoid French fixed defenses and quickly defeat France in the west before turning to face Russia in the east. France was aware that it would have to act together with its Russian ally to defeat its German rival, so escalated its preparations as tensions along the Russian border increased, which in turn further alarmed Germany.\n\nWhile Great Britain was aligned with Russia and France, it also had relatively friendly diplomatic relations with Germany, and many British leaders saw no compelling reason to involve Britain in a Continental war. Britain repeatedly offered to mediate, using the Serbian reply as the basis of negotiation, and Germany made various promises in an attempt to ensure British neutrality. However, Britain decided that it had a moral obligation to defend Belgium and aid its formal allies, becoming the last major nation actively involved in the July Crisis to formally enter the conflict on 4 August. By early August, the ostensible reason for armed conflict, the dispute between Serbia and Austria-Hungary over the murdered heir, had already become a sidenote to a general European war.\n\n{{Events leading to World War I}}\n__TOC__\n\n== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian irredentists (28 June) ==\n{{Main article|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}\n[[File:DC-1914-27-d-Sarajevo-cropped.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the assassination in the Italian newspaper ''[[La Domenica del Corriere]]'', 12 July 1914]]\nAustria-Hungary had annexed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908. Sarajevo was the provincial capital. [[Oskar Potiorek]] was the military commander and governor of the province. [[Emperor Franz Joseph]] ordered [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], [[heir presumptive]] to the Austro-Hungarian throne, to attend military exercises due to be held in Bosnia. After the exercises, on 28 June 1914, Ferdinand toured Sarajevo with his wife, [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]]. Six armed [[irredentists]], five [[Serbs]] and one [[Bosnian Muslim]], coordinated by [[Danilo Ili\u0107]], lay in wait along Ferdinand's announced motorcade route.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nAt 10:10&nbsp;a.m., [[Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107]] threw a hand grenade at Ferdinand's motorcade.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=35}} Subsequently, [[Gavrilo Princip]] shot and killed Ferdinand and Sophie as they traveled to visit wounded in the hospital. \u010cabrinovi\u0107 and Princip took cyanide, but it only sickened them. Both were arrested.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=41}}  Within 45 minutes of the shooting, Princip began telling his story to interrogators.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=321}} The next day, based on the interrogations of the two assassins, Potiorek telegraphed to Vienna that Princip and \u010cabrinovi\u0107 had conspired in Belgrade with others to obtain bombs, revolvers, and money to kill Ferdinand. A police dragnet quickly caught most of the conspirators.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=43}}\n\n=== Investigation and accusations ===\n[[File:Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107-Apis, ca. 1900.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107]], leader of the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] and prominent member of the [[Serbian General Staff]].]]\nImmediately following the assassinations, Serbian envoy to France [[Milenko Vesni\u0107]] and Serbian envoy to Russia [[Miroslav Spalajkovi\u0107]] put out statements claiming that Serbia had warned Austria-Hungary of the impending assassination.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=100\u2013101}} Serbia soon thereafter denied making warnings and denied knowledge of the plot.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=99}} By 30 June, Austro-Hungarian and German diplomats were requesting investigations from their Serbian and Russian counterparts, but were rebuffed.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=273}}  On 5 July, based on interrogations of the accused assassins, Governor Potiorek telegraphed Vienna that Serbian Major [[Voja Tankosi\u0107]] had directed the assassins.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=44}} The next day, Austrian charg\u00e9 d'affaires [[Count Otto von Czernin]] proposed to Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]] that the instigators of the plot against Ferdinand needed to be investigated within Serbia, but he too was rebuffed.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=189\u201390}}\n\nAustria-Hungary immediately undertook a criminal investigation. [[Danilo Ili\u0107|Ili\u0107]] and five of the assassins were promptly arrested and interviewed by an investigating judge. The three assassins who had come from Serbia told almost all they knew: Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosi\u0107 had directly and indirectly given them six Vasic Model M12, Serbian Army issue hand grenades (produced at the Kragujevac Royal Serbian Arsenal), four, brand new, Browning 1910 semiautomatic pistols, training, money, suicide pills, a special map with the location of gendarmes marked, knowledge of an infiltration channel from Serbia to Sarajevo, and a card authorizing the use of that channel.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nWithin Serbia, there was popular rejoicing over the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=185}} Because Serbian elections were scheduled for 14 August, Prime Minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] was unwilling to court unpopularity by being seen to bow down to Austria.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=186}} If he had actually warned the Austrians in advance of the plot against Franz Ferdinand, Pa\u0161i\u0107 was probably concerned about his chances at the polls and perhaps his life being endangered if news of them leaked out.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=186}}\n\nL\u00e9on Descos, French Ambassador to Belgrade, on 1 July reported that a Serbian military party was involved in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, that Serbia was in the wrong, and that Russian Ambassador Hartwig was in constant conversations with Regent Alexander to guide Serbia through this crisis.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=67, 271}} The \"military party\" was a reference to Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, [[Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107]] and the officers he led in the [[May Coup (Serbia)|1903 murder of the King and Queen of Serbia]]. Their acts led to the installation of the dynasty ruled by King Peter and Regent Alexander. Serbia requested and France arranged the replacement of Descos with the more hawkish [[:fr:Auguste Boppe|Boppe]] who arrived on 25 July.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=272}}\n\n== Austria-Hungary edges towards war with Serbia (29 June \u2013 1 July) ==\n[[File:Serbien muss sterbien.jpg|thumb|Austrian propaganda after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand depicting an Austrian fist crushing an [[Untermensch|ape-like]] caricature of a Serbian holding a bomb and dropping a knife, and stating \"Serbia <u>must</u> die!\" (''Sterben'' purposefully misspelled as ''sterbien'' to make it [[rhyme]] with ''Serbien''.)]]\nWhile few mourned Franz Ferdinand himself, many ministers argued the assassination of the heir to the throne was a challenge to Austria that must be avenged.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bang!

On 1 July, Berchtold told Conrad that Emperor Franz Joseph would await the criminal inquiry results, that [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza]], [[Prime Minister of Hungary]], was opposed to war, and that [[Karl von St\u00fcrgkh]], Prime Minister of Austria, hoped that the criminal inquiry would provide a proper basis for action.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=124}} \n\nOpinion in Vienna was divided; Berchtold now agreed with Conrad and supported war, as did Franz Joseph, although he insisted German support was a prerequisite, while Tisza was opposed; he correctly predicted war with Serbia would trigger one with Russia and hence a general European war.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=52}} The pro-war party saw it as a reactionary means of re-invigorating the Habsburg monarchy, restoring it to the vigour and virility of an imagined past, and that Serbia must be dealt with before it became too powerful to defeat militarily.<ref name=\"Sked\">{{cite book |last=Sked |first=Alan |title=The Decline and Fall of the Habsburg Empire: 1815\u20131918 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqhnAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA254 |year=1989 |publisher=Addison-Wesley Longman |isbn=978-0-582-02530-1 |page=254}}</ref>\n\nConrad continued to push for war but worried what attitude Germany would take; Berchtold replied that he planned to inquire of Germany what its position was.{{cn|date=May 2018}} Berchtold used his memo of 14 June 1914, proposing Serbia's destruction, as the basis for the document that would be used to solicit German support.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=155}}\n\n== The German \"Blank Cheque\"  (1 July \u2013 6 July) ==\n=== German officials reassure Austria of its support ===\n[[File:Deutsche Kriegszeitung (1914) 01 01.png|thumb|upright|[[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II of Germany]] was known for his impetuous personality, described by one scholar as \"not lacking in intelligence, but he did lack stability, disguising his deep insecurities by swagger and tough talk.\"{{Sfn | Langer 1968 | p = 528}}]]\nOn 1 July, Viktor Naumann, a German journalist and friend of German Foreign Secretary [[Gottlieb von Jagow]], approached Berchtold's chief of cabinet, [[Alexander, Count of Hoyos]]. Naumann's advice was that it was time to annihilate Serbia and that Germany could be expected to stand by her ally.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=131-132}} The next day, German Ambassador [[Heinrich von Tschirschky]] spoke to Emperor Franz Joseph and stated that it was his estimate that [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] would support resolute, well-thought-out action by Austria-Hungary with regard to Serbia.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=131-132}}\n\nOn 2 July, the [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxon]] Ambassador in Berlin wrote back to his king that the German Army wanted Austria to attack Serbia as quickly as possible because the time was right for a general war since Germany was more prepared for war than either Russia or France.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=156}} On 3 July, the Saxon military attach\u00e9 in Berlin reported that the German General Staff \"would be pleased if war were to come about now\".{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=202}}\n\n[[Emperor Wilhelm II]] came to share the views of the German General Staff and declared on 4 July that he was entirely for \"settling accounts with Serbia\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=52}} He ordered the German ambassador in Vienna, Count [[Heinrich von Tschirschky]], to stop advising restraint, writing that \"Tschirschky will be so good to drop this nonsense.

Germany and the Ottoman Empire allied after the outbreak of war.]]\nIn order to ensure Germany's full support, the [[Chef de Cabinet]] of the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry [[Count Alexander von Hoyos]] visited Berlin on 5 July. On 24 June, Austria-Hungary had prepared a letter for its ally outlining the challenges in the Balkans and how to address them, but Franz Ferdinand was assassinated before it could be delivered.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|loc=Vol 1, pp. 534\u201339}} According to the letter, Romania was no longer a reliable ally especially since the Russo-Romanian summit meeting of 14 June in [[Constan\u021ba]]. Russia was working toward an alliance of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro against Austria-Hungary, dismemberment of Austria-Hungary, and the movement of borders from east to west.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} To break up this effort, Germany and Austria-Hungary should first ally with Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. To this letter was added a post-script on the Sarajevo Outrage and its impact. Finally, Emperor Franz Joseph added his own letter to Emperor Wilhelm II which closed with advocating the end of Serbia as a political power factor.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=133-134}} Hoyos was dispatched to Germany to present these letters. The letters were presented to Wilhelm II on 5 July. \n\nVon Hoyos provided Austro-Hungarian Ambassador Count [[Ladislaus de Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny-Marich]] with two documents, one of which was a memo by [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza|Tisza]], advising that Bulgaria should join the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], and another letter by [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] stating that the only way of preventing the disintegration of the Dual Monarchy was \"to eliminate Serbia\" as a state.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=53}} The letter by Franz Joseph was based closely upon [[Count Leopold Berchtold|Berchtold]]'s 14 June memo calling for the destruction of Serbia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=155}} Franz Josef's letter explicitly stated that the decision for war against Serbia had been made before the assassination of the Archduke, and that the events of Sarajevo only confirmed the already pre-existing need for a war against Serbia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=157}}\n\nAfter meeting with Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Germany Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny on 5 July, the German Emperor informed him that his state could \"count on Germany's full support\", even if \"grave European complications\" ensued, and that Austria-Hungary \"ought to march at once\" against Serbia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=156}}{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=53}} He added that \"in any case, as things stood today, Russia was not at all ready for war, and would certainly think long before appealing to arms\". Even if Russia were to act in defence of Serbia, Wilhelm promised that Germany would do everything in its power, including war, to support Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=53}} Wilhelm added that he needed to consult with Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], who he was quite sure would have a similar view.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=145-146}} \n\nAfter his meeting, Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny reported to Vienna that Wilhelm \"would regret it if we [Austria-Hungary] let this present chance, which was so favourable for us, go by without utilising it\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=54}}<ref>Original text at {{cite web|title=The 'Blank Check': Ladislaus Count von Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny-Marich (Berlin) to Leopold Count von Berchtold (July 5, 1914)|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=800 |website=German History in Documents and Images |publisher= German Historical Institute, Washington, DC |accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref> This so-called \"blank cheque\" of German support up to and including war was to be the main determining factor in Austrian policy in July 1914.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=54}} \n\nAt another meeting held on 5 July, this one at Potsdam palace, German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]], the Foreign Ministry's State Secretary [[Arthur Zimmermann]], the Minister of War [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], the head of the [[German Imperial Military Cabinet]] [[Moriz von Lyncker]], the [[Adjutant general]] [[Hans von Plessen]], Captain [[Hans Zenker]] of the Naval General Staff, and Admiral [[Eduard von Capelle]] of the Naval State Secretariat all endorsed Wilhelm's \"blank cheque\" as Germany's best policy.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=54}} On 6 July, Hoyos, Zimmerman, Bethmann-Hollweg, and Austro-Hungarian Ambassador Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny met and Germany gave its \"blank cheque\" commitment to Austria-Hungary of firm support.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=145-146}}\n\nOn 6 July, Bethmann-Hollweg and Zimmermann further repeated the promise of Wilhelm's \"blank cheque\" at a conference with Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=55}} Although Bethmann-Hollweg stated that the decision for war or peace was in Austria's hands, he strongly advised that Austria choose the former.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=55}} That same day, British Foreign Secretary [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]] was warned by the German Ambassador in London, [[Karl Max, Prince Lichnowsky|Prince Lichnowsky]], of the dangerous situation in the Balkans.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=183}} Grey felt that Anglo-German co-operation could resolve any Austro-Serbian dispute, and he \"believed that a peaceful solution would be reached\".{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=183}}\n\nWhen asked if Germany was ready for a war against Russia and France, [[Erich von Falkenhayn|Falkenhayn]] replied with a \"curt affirmative\". Later on 17 July, the Army's [[Quartermaster general]] Count Waldersee wrote to [[Gottlieb von Jagow]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]]: \"I can move at a moment's notice. We in the General Staff are ''ready'': there is nothing more for us to do at this juncture\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=54}}\n\nAs Wilhelm himself stated in private \"in order not to alarm world opinion\", the Kaiser left on his annual North Sea cruise.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=55}} Shortly after, Wilhelm's close friend [[Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach|Gustav Krupp von Bohlen]] wrote that the Emperor said that we would not waver in declaring war if Russia mobilized.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=55}}<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Fischer|1967|p=55}}: \"He [Wilhelm] would declare war at once, if Russia mobilized.

A Serbian defeat would also be a defeat for Russia and reduce her influence in the Balkans.\n\nThe benefits were clear but there were risks, namely that Russia would intervene and this would lead to a continental war. However, this was thought even more unlikely since the Russians had not yet finished their French-funded rearmament programme scheduled for completion in 1917. Moreover, they did not believe that Russia, as an absolute monarchy, would support regicides, and more broadly \"the mood across Europe was so anti-Serbian that even Russia would not intervene\".  Personal factors also weighed heavily and the German Kaiser was close to the murdered Franz Ferdinand and was affected by his death, to the extent that German counsels of restraint vis a vis Serbia in 1913 changed to an aggressive stance.{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=73}}\n\nOn the other hand, the military thought that if Russia did intervene then St Petersburg clearly desired war and now would be a better time to fight, when Germany had a guaranteed ally in Austria-Hungary, Russia was not ready and Europe was sympathetic to them. On balance, at this point in the crisis, the  Germans anticipated that their support would mean the war would be a localised affair between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. This would be particularly true if Austria moved quickly, \"while the other European powers were still disgusted over the assassinations and therefore likely to be sympathetic to any action Austria-Hungary took\".{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=74}}\n\n== Austria-Hungary considers an ultimatum ==\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|upright=2|A map of ethnic groups in Austria-Hungary in 1910.

It is worth stressing, since this is a cause of some confusion in general narratives of the war, that this was done prior to the Serbian rejection of the ultimatum, the Austrian declaration of war on 28 July or any military measures taken by Germany. As a diplomatic move this had limited value since the Russians did not make this mobilisation public until 28 July.\n\n==== Russian thinking ====\nThe arguments used to support this move in the Council of Ministers were:\n* The crisis was being used as a pretext by the Germans to increase their power.\n* Acceptance of the ultimatum would mean that Serbia would become a protectorate of Austria.\n* Russia had backed down in the past  \u2013 for example in the Liman von Sanders affair and the Bosnian Crisis \u2013 and this had encouraged the Germans rather than appeased them.\n* Russian arms had recovered sufficiently since the disasters of 1904\u201306.\n\nIn addition Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]] believed that war was inevitable and refused to acknowledge that Austria-Hungary had a right to counter measures in the face of Serbian irredentism. On the contrary, Sazonov had aligned himself with the irredentism, and expected the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Crucially, the French had provided their clear support for their Russian allies for a robust response in their recent state visit just days before. Also in the background was Russian anxiety of the future of the Turkish straits \u2013 \"where Russian control of the Balkans would place Saint Petersburg in a far better position to prevent unwanted intrusions on the Bosphorus\u201d {{sfn|Clark|2013|p=486}}\n\nChristopher Clark states, \"It would be difficult to overstate the historical importance of the meetings of 24 and 25 July\",{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=475}} as it emboldened Serbia and raised the stakes for Germany, which was still hoping for a conflict localized to the Balkans.<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Clark|2013|p=480}}: \"In taking these steps, [Russian Foreign Minister] Sazonov and his colleagues escalated the crisis and greatly increased the likelihood of a general European war. For one thing, Russian pre-mobilization altered the political chemistry in Serbia, making it unthinkable that the Belgrade government, which had originally given serious consideration to accepting the ultimatum, would back down in the face of Austrian pressure. It heightened the domestic pressure on the Russian administration&nbsp;... it sounded alarm bells in Austria-Hungary.

Jagow accepted the Franco-Russian offer as it offered the best chance to sever Britain from France and Russia.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=66}} In his talks with Prince Lichnowsky, Grey drew a sharp distinction between an Austro-Serbian war, which did not concern Britain, and an Austro-Russian war, which did.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=66}} Grey added that Britain was not working in concord with France and Russia, which heightened Jagow's hopes of severing Britain from the Triple Entente.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=66}} On the same day, Jagow sent another message to Vienna to encourage the Austrians to hurry up with declaring war on Serbia.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=69}}\n\nOn 26 July, [[Count Leopold Berchtold|Berchtold]] rejected Grey's mediation offer, and wrote that if a localization should not prove possible, then the Dual Monarchy was counting, \"with gratitude\", on Germany's support \"if a struggle against another adversary is forced on us\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=68}} That same day, [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|General von Moltke]] sent a message to Belgium demanding that German troops be allowed to pass through that kingdom \"in the event of an imminent war against France and Russia\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=68}} Bethmann Hollweg in a message to the German Ambassadors in London, Paris and St. Petersburg stated that the principal aim of German foreign policy now was to make it appear that Russia had forced Germany into a war, in order to keep Britain neutral and ensure that German public opinion would back the war effort.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|pp=72-73}} Bethmann Hollweg advised Wilhelm to send [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] a telegram, which he assured the Emperor was for public relations purposes only.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}} As [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg|Bethmann Hollweg]] put it, \"If war should come after all, such a telegram would make Russia's guilt glaringly plain\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}} Moltke visited the German Foreign Ministry to advise Jagow that Germany should start drafting an ultimatum to justify an invasion of Belgium.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|pp=210-211}} Later, Moltke met with Bethmann Hollweg, and told his wife later that same day that he had informed the Chancellor he was \"very dissatisfied\" that Germany had not yet attacked Russia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=211}}\n\nOn 26 July, in St. Petersburg, the German Ambassador von Pourtal\u00e8s told [[Sergey Sazonov|Sazonov]] to reject Grey's offer of a summit in London,{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=208}} stating that the proposed conference was \"too unwieldy\", and if Russia were serious about saving the peace, they would negotiate directly with the Austrians.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=208}} Sazonov replied that he was willing to see Serbia accept almost all of the Austrian demands, and following von Pourtal\u00e8s's advice, rejected Grey's conference proposal in favour of direct talks with the Austrians.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=208}} Von Pourtal\u00e8s reported to Germany that Sazonov was being \"more conciliatory\", seeking \"to find a bridge&nbsp;... to satisfy&nbsp;... Austrian demands\" and willing to do almost anything to save the peace.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=210}} At the same time, von Pourtal\u00e8s warned that changes in the Balkan balance of power would be regarded as a highly unfriendly act by Russia.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=69}} The following Austro-Russian talks were sabotaged by Austria's refusal to abandon any of the demands on Serbia{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=208}} As a preparatory move in case a war did break out, and Britain were to become involved, [[Winston Churchill]], First Lord of the British Admiralty, ordered the British fleet not to disperse as planned,{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}} arguing that news of the British move might serve as a deterrent to war, and thus help persuade Germany to put pressure on Austria to abandon some of the more outrageous demands in their ultimatum. Grey stated that a compromise solution could be worked out if Germany and Britain were to work together.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}} His approach generated opposition from British officials, who felt the Germans were dealing with the crisis in bad faith.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}} [[Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock|Nicolson]] warned Grey that in his opinion \"Berlin is playing with us\".{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}} Grey for his part, rejected Nicolson's assessment, and believed that Germany was interested in stopping a general war.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}}\n\n[[Philippe Berthelot]], the political director of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|Quai d'Orsay]], told [[Wilhelm von Schoen]], the German Ambassador in Paris that \"to my simple mind Germany\u2019s attitude was inexplicable if it did not aim at war\".{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}}\n\nIn Vienna, [[Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf|Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]] and [[Count Leopold Berchtold|Berchtold]] disagreed about when Austria should begin operations.

The Kaiser wants peace&nbsp;... He even wants to influence Austria and to stop continuing further.\"{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=219}} Bethmann Hollweg sabotaged Wilhelm's proposal by instructing [[Heinrich von Tschirschky|von Tschirschky]] to not restrain Austria.<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Fischer|1967|p=72}}: \"You must most carefully avoid giving any impression that we want ''to hold Austria back''.

[[Erich von Falkenhayn|General Falkenhayn]] told Wilhelm he \"no longer had control of the affair in his own hands\". Falkenhayn went on to imply that the military would stage a coup d'\u00e9tat, and depose Wilhelm in favour of the hawkish [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]] if he continued to work for peace.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=219}}\n\nBethmann Hollweg mentioned two favourable conditions for war in his telegram to Vienna: that Russia be made to appear the aggressor forcing a reluctant Germany into war, and that Britain be kept neutral.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=72}} The necessity of making Russia appear the aggressor was the greater concern to Bethmann-Hollweg because the German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] had denounced Austria for declaring war on Serbia and ordered street demonstrations to protest Germany's actions in supporting Austria.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=221}} However, Bethmann Hollweg put great faith in the private promises he received from SPD leaders that they would support the government if Germany was faced with a Russian attack.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=221}}\n\nOn 27 July, Wilhelm ended his cruise in the North Sea and returned to Germany.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=221}} Wilhelm landed at Cuxhaven (Kiel) departing on 25 July at 6 p.m. despite the objections of his chancellor.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|loc=Vol II pp. 428n, 434\u201335}} The next afternoon, the order to disperse the British Fleet and dismiss British reservists was rescinded, putting the British Navy on a war footing.<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Butler|2010|p=103}}: When Wilhelm arrived at the Potsdam station late in the evening of July 26, he was met by a pale, agitated, and somewhat fearful Chancellor. Bethmann-Hollweg's apprehension stemmed not from the dangers of the looming war, but rather from his fear of the Kaiser's wrath when the extent of his deceptions were revealed. The Kaiser's first words to him were suitably brusque: \"How did it all happen?\" Rather than attempt to explain, the Chancellor offered his resignation by way of apology. Wilhelm refused to accept it, muttering furiously, \"You've made this stew, Now you're going to eat it!\"</ref>\n\n=== Austria-Hungary makes final preparations for war (27 July) ===\nLater, on 27 July, Austria-Hungary started to complete the preparations for war.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=69}} That same day, [[Gottlieb von Jagow|Jagow]] informed [[Count Ladislaus von Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny-Marich|Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny]] that he was only pretending to take up the British offers of mediation in order to ensure British neutrality but had no intention of stopping the war.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=70}} [[Count Ladislaus von Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny-Marich|Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny]] reported \"in order to avoid a misunderstanding\" that Jagow had promised him that \"the German government assured Austria in the most binding fashion that it in no way identifies itself with the proposal [Grey's mediation offer], which may very shortly be brought to Your Excellency [Berchtold]'s notice by the German government: it is, on the contrary ''decidedly'' opposed to consideration of them and is only passing them on out of deference to the British request\" (emphasis in the original).{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=70}} Jagow went on to state he was \"absolutely against taking account of the British wish\",{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=70}} because \"the German government point of view was that it was at the moment of the highest importance to prevent Britain from making common cause with Russia and France.

We cannot therefore reject the role of mediator; we have to pass on the British proposal to Vienna for consideration, especially since London and Paris are continuously using their influence on St. Petersburg.\"</ref> In passing on Grey's message, Bethmann Hollweg deleted the last line, which read: \"Also, the whole world here is convinced, and I hear from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=71}} In his reply to London, Bethmann Hollweg pretended that: \"We have immediately initiated mediation in Vienna in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=71}} Jagow sent Grey's offer to [[Heinrich von Tschirschky|Tschirschky]], his ambassador in Vienna, but ordered him to not show it to any Austrian official in case they might accept it.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=214}} At the same time, Bethmann Hollweg sent a distorted account of Grey's offer to [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]].{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=71}}\n\nIn London, Grey told a meeting of the British Cabinet that they now had to decide whether to choose neutrality if war did come or to enter the conflict.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=214}} While the Cabinet was still undecided about what course to choose, [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] put the British fleet on alert.<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Fromkin|2004|p=215}}: His order read: \"Secret.

Moltke ended his assessment with: \"We shall never hit it again so well as we do now.\"{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=218}} Jagow backed up Moltke by sending a message to Vienna telling the Austrians they must attack Serbia at once because otherwise the British peace plan might be accepted.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=219}}\n\n==Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia (28 July) ==\n[[File:TelegramWW1.jpg|thumb|Austria-Hungary's telegram to the Kingdom of Serbia declaring war, 28 July 1914]]\nAt 11:00&nbsp;a.m. on 28 July, Austria declared war on Serbia.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}} Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm's \"Stop in Belgrade\" proposal until noon.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}} At 1:00 a.m. on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian [[river monitor|monitor]] [[Yugoslav monitor Sava|SMS ''Bodrog'']], which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Keys |first=David |date=27 July 2014|title=Church to mark centenary of the start of WWI |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/church-to-mark-the-real-centenary-of-the-start-of-first-world-war-9631887.html |work=[[The Independent]] |location= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908181627/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/church-to-mark-the-real-centenary-of-the-start-of-first-world-war-9631887.html |archive-date= 8 September 2017 |access-date=28 June 2015 }}</ref> In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=220}} Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=220}} Nicholas replied: \"Am glad you are back&nbsp;...

It is imperative that the responsibility for any extension of the conflict to the Powers not directly concerned should under all circumstances fall on Russia alone.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=74}} At the same time, the German Ambassador to Russia, Portal\u00e9s, reported that, based on a conversation with Sazonov, Russia was prepared to make \"astonishing\" concessions by promising to pressure Serbia to agree to most of the Austrian demands to avoid a war.

Moltke was overruled by Bethmann Hollweg in two meetings on 29 July, who argued that Germany should wait for Russia to begin a general mobilization.

On 28 July, Russia ordered partial mobilization in response to Austria's declaration of war on Serbia, Bethmann-Hollweg became alarmed and changed his attitude 180 degrees. Already on 28 July, two hours before becoming aware of the Austrian declaration of war, the Kaiser had suggested the \"Halt in Belgrade\" plan and instructed von Jagow that a cause for war no longer existed with the Serbian reply and he was ready to mediate with Serbia.<ref group=note>\"I propose that we say to Austria: Serbia has been forced to retreat in a very humiliating manner and we offer our congratulations.

From these contradictions I must conclude that the telegram disavowing Hoyos {who, on July 5/6 at Berlin, had spoken unofficially of Austria's partitioning of Serbia} was intended for the gallery, and that the Austrian Government is harboring plans which it sees fit to conceal from us, in order to assure itself in all events of German support and to avoid the refusal which might result from a frank statement.\"</ref>\n\nAfter receiving information from Rome that Serbia was now ready \"on condition of certain interpretations, to swallow even Articles 5 and 6, that is, the whole Austrian ultimatum\", Bethmann Hollweg forwarded this information to Vienna at 12:30&nbsp;a.m., 30 July, adding that Serbia's response to the Austrian ultimatum were a \"suitable basis for negotiation.\"<ref group=note>\"Please show this to Berchtold immediately and add that we regard such a yielding on Serbia's part as a suitable basis for negotiations along with an occupation of a part of Serbian territory as a pledge.\"</ref> Berchtold replied that though the acceptance of the Austrian Note would have been satisfactory before hostilities had begun, \"now after a state of war has begun, Austria's conditions must naturally take another tone.\" In response, Bethmann Hollweg, now aware of the Russian order for partial mobilization, fired off several telegrams in the early morning hours of 30 July. He telegraphed Vienna at 2:55&nbsp;a.m.<ref group=note>\"The refusal of every exchange of views with St. Petersburg would be a serious mistake, for it provokes Russia precisely to armed interference, which Austria is primarily concerned in avoiding.

In a series of letters exchanged with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] of Germany (the so-called \"[[Willy and Nicky]] correspondence\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against the Austrian border, in the hopes of preventing war with the [[German Empire]].

Jagow rejected the British ultimatum and Goschen demanded his passports and requested a private and personal meeting with Bethmann Hollweg, who invited Goschen to dine with him. During their highly emotional conversation Bethmann Hollweg, who had spent his career trying to improve relations, accused Britain of going to war for its own national agenda, which was unrelated to that of Belgium, who would have been compensated for the wrong done to it.

After the war began the propaganda reason given was that Britain was required to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the [[Treaty of London 1839]]. The German invasion of Belgium was, therefore, the ''casus belli'' and, importantly, legitimized and galvanized popular support for the war among the antiwar Liberal Party constituency.  However, the Treaty of London of 1839 had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium's neutrality. \n\nRather Britain's support for France was decisive.  [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] argued that the naval agreements with France (although they had not been approved by the Cabinet) created a moral obligation vis a vis Britain and France. British Foreign office mandarin Eyre Crowe stated: \"Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must happen. (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia. What will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and Russia win. What would be their attitude towards England? What about India and the Mediterranean?\" {{sfn|Clark|2013|p=544}}\n \nIn the event that Britain abandoned its Entente friends, Britain feared that if Germany won the war, or the Entente won without British support, then, either way, it would be left without any friends. This would have left both Britain and her Empire vulnerable to attack.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=544}} \n\nDomestically, the Liberal Cabinet was split and in the event that war was not declared the Government would fall as [[Prime Minister Asquith]], [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] and [[Winston Churchill]] made it clear they would resign. In that event, the existing Liberal government would lose control of Parliament. In that case the pro-war Conservatives would come to power.

The crisis began on June 28, 1914, when [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Bosnian Serb]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand|assassinated]] [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], [[heir presumptive]] to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] throne. A complex web of alliances, coupled with miscalculations by many leaders that war was in their best interests or that a general war would not occur, resulted in a general outbreak of hostilities among almost every major European nation in early August 1914; every major European nation was involved by May 1915.\n\nAustria-Hungary viewed the [[irredentist]] movements of [[South Slav]]s, as promoted by [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], to be a threat to the unity of the nation. Following the assassination, Austria sought to inflict a military blow on Serbia to demonstrate strength and so Serbia would be more cautious about supporting [[Yugoslav nationalism]]. However, it was wary of the reaction of the [[Russian Empire]], who were a major supporter of Serbia, so sought a guarantee from its ally [[German Empire|Germany]] that it would support Austria in any conflict. Germany guaranteed its support, but urged Austria to attack quickly, while world sympathy for Ferdinand was high, in order to localize the war and avoid drawing in Russia. Some German leaders believed that growing Russian economic power would change the balance of power between the two nations, that a war was inevitable, and that Germany would be better off if a war happened soon. However, rather than a quick attack with available military forces, Austrian leaders deliberated into mid-July before deciding that it would give Serbia a harsh ultimatum on 23 July and would not attack without a full mobilisation of its army that could not be accomplished before 25 July 1914.\n\nJust prior to the Serbian reply to the ultimatum, Russia decided that it would intervene in any Austro{{ndash}}Serbian war and ordered a partial mobilization of its armed forces. While Russian military leadership acknowledged that Russia was not yet strong enough for a general war, Russia believed the Austrian grievance against Serbia was a pretext orchestrated by Germany and that it needed to show strength by protecting its Serbian ally. This mobilization was the first major military action not by a direct participant in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia; it increased the willingness of Serbia to defy the threat of an Austrian attack and greatly increased the alarm in Germany about masses of Russian troops being assembled near its borders. Previously, the German military predicted that Russian mobilization would be slower than that of its French ally on Germany's opposite border; therefore, German military strategy in any conflict with Russia was to attack France through [[Belgium]] to avoid French fixed defenses and quickly defeat France in the west before turning to face Russia in the east. France was aware that it would have to act together with its Russian ally to defeat its German rival, so escalated its preparations as tensions along the Russian border increased, which in turn further alarmed Germany.\n\nWhile Great Britain was aligned with Russia and France, it also had relatively friendly diplomatic relations with Germany, and many British leaders saw no compelling reason to involve Britain in a Continental war. Britain repeatedly offered to mediate, using the Serbian reply as the basis of negotiation, and Germany made various promises in an attempt to ensure British neutrality. However, Britain decided that it had a moral obligation to defend Belgium and aid its formal allies, becoming the last major nation actively involved in the July Crisis to formally enter the conflict on 4 August. By early August, the ostensible reason for armed conflict, the dispute between Serbia and Austria-Hungary over the murdered heir, had already become a sidenote to a general European war.\n\n{{Events leading to World War I}}\n__TOC__\n\n== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by Serbian irredentists (28 June) ==\n{{Main article|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}\n[[File:DC-1914-27-d-Sarajevo-cropped.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the assassination in the Italian newspaper ''[[La Domenica del Corriere]]'', 12 July 1914]]\nAustria-Hungary had annexed [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908. Sarajevo was the provincial capital. [[Oskar Potiorek]] was the military commander and governor of the province. [[Emperor Franz Joseph]] ordered [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], [[heir presumptive]] to the Austro-Hungarian throne, to attend military exercises due to be held in Bosnia. After the exercises, on 28 June 1914, Ferdinand toured Sarajevo with his wife, [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]]. Six armed [[irredentists]], five [[Serbs]] and one [[Bosnian Muslim]], coordinated by [[Danilo Ili\u0107]], lay in wait along Ferdinand's announced motorcade route.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nAt 10:10&nbsp;a.m., [[Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107]] threw a hand grenade at Ferdinand's motorcade.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=35}} Subsequently, [[Gavrilo Princip]] shot and killed Ferdinand and Sophie as they traveled to visit wounded in the hospital. \u010cabrinovi\u0107 and Princip took cyanide, but it only sickened them. Both were arrested.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|p=41}}  Within 45 minutes of the shooting, Princip began telling his story to interrogators.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|p=321}} The next day, based on the interrogations of the two assassins, Potiorek telegraphed to Vienna that Princip and \u010cabrinovi\u0107 had conspired in Belgrade with others to obtain bombs, revolvers, and money to kill Ferdinand.

[[Danilo Ili\u0107|Ili\u0107]] and five of the assassins were promptly arrested and interviewed by an investigating judge. The three assassins who had come from Serbia told almost all they knew: Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosi\u0107 had directly and indirectly given them six Vasic Model M12, Serbian Army issue hand grenades (produced at the Kragujevac Royal Serbian Arsenal), four, brand new, Browning 1910 semiautomatic pistols, training, money, suicide pills, a special map with the location of gendarmes marked, knowledge of an infiltration channel from Serbia to Sarajevo, and a card authorizing the use of that channel.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nWithin Serbia, there was popular rejoicing over the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=185}} Because Serbian elections were scheduled for 14 August, Prime Minister [[Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107]] was unwilling to court unpopularity by being seen to bow down to Austria.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=186}} If he had actually warned the Austrians in advance of the plot against Franz Ferdinand, Pa\u0161i\u0107 was probably concerned about his chances at the polls and perhaps his life being endangered if news of them leaked out.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=186}}\n\nL\u00e9on Descos, French Ambassador to Belgrade, on 1 July reported that a Serbian military party was involved in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, that Serbia was in the wrong, and that Russian Ambassador Hartwig was in constant conversations with Regent Alexander to guide Serbia through this crisis.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=67, 271}} The \"military party\" was a reference to Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, [[Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107]] and the officers he led in the [[May Coup (Serbia)|1903 murder of the King and Queen of Serbia]].

On 24 June, Austria-Hungary had prepared a letter for its ally outlining the challenges in the Balkans and how to address them, but Franz Ferdinand was assassinated before it could be delivered.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|loc=Vol 1, pp. 534\u201339}} According to the letter, Romania was no longer a reliable ally especially since the Russo-Romanian summit meeting of 14 June in [[Constan\u021ba]]. Russia was working toward an alliance of Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, and Montenegro against Austria-Hungary, dismemberment of Austria-Hungary, and the movement of borders from east to west.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} To break up this effort, Germany and Austria-Hungary should first ally with Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire. To this letter was added a post-script on the Sarajevo Outrage and its impact. Finally, Emperor Franz Joseph added his own letter to Emperor Wilhelm II which closed with advocating the end of Serbia as a political power factor.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|pp=133-134}} Hoyos was dispatched to Germany to present these letters. The letters were presented to Wilhelm II on 5 July. \n\nVon Hoyos provided Austro-Hungarian Ambassador Count [[Ladislaus de Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny-Marich]] with two documents, one of which was a memo by [[Istv\u00e1n Tisza|Tisza]], advising that Bulgaria should join the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], and another letter by [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] stating that the only way of preventing the disintegration of the Dual Monarchy was \"to eliminate Serbia\" as a state.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=53}} The letter by Franz Joseph was based closely upon [[Count Leopold Berchtold|Berchtold]]'s 14 June memo calling for the destruction of Serbia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=155}} Franz Josef's letter explicitly stated that the decision for war against Serbia had been made before the assassination of the Archduke, and that the events of Sarajevo only confirmed the already pre-existing need for a war against Serbia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=157}}\n\nAfter meeting with Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Germany Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny on 5 July, the German Emperor informed him that his state could \"count on Germany's full support\", even if \"grave European complications\" ensued, and that Austria-Hungary \"ought to march at once\" against Serbia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=156}}{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=53}} He added that \"in any case, as things stood today, Russia was not at all ready for war, and would certainly think long before appealing to arms\".

Later on 17 July, the Army's [[Quartermaster general]] Count Waldersee wrote to [[Gottlieb von Jagow]], [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)|Foreign Minister]]: \"I can move at a moment's notice. We in the General Staff are ''ready'': there is nothing more for us to do at this juncture\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=54}}\n\nAs Wilhelm himself stated in private \"in order not to alarm world opinion\", the Kaiser left on his annual North Sea cruise.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=55}} Shortly after, Wilhelm's close friend [[Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach|Gustav Krupp von Bohlen]] wrote that the Emperor said that we would not waver in declaring war if Russia mobilized.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=55}}<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Fischer|1967|p=55}}: \"He [Wilhelm] would declare war at once, if Russia mobilized.

A Serbian defeat would also be a defeat for Russia and reduce her influence in the Balkans.\n\nThe benefits were clear but there were risks, namely that Russia would intervene and this would lead to a continental war. However, this was thought even more unlikely since the Russians had not yet finished their French-funded rearmament programme scheduled for completion in 1917. Moreover, they did not believe that Russia, as an absolute monarchy, would support regicides, and more broadly \"the mood across Europe was so anti-Serbian that even Russia would not intervene\".  Personal factors also weighed heavily and the German Kaiser was close to the murdered Franz Ferdinand and was affected by his death, to the extent that German counsels of restraint vis a vis Serbia in 1913 changed to an aggressive stance.{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=73}}\n\nOn the other hand, the military thought that if Russia did intervene then St Petersburg clearly desired war and now would be a better time to fight, when Germany had a guaranteed ally in Austria-Hungary, Russia was not ready and Europe was sympathetic to them. On balance, at this point in the crisis, the  Germans anticipated that their support would mean the war would be a localised affair between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. This would be particularly true if Austria moved quickly, \"while the other European powers were still disgusted over the assassinations and therefore likely to be sympathetic to any action Austria-Hungary took\".{{sfnp|Ponting|2002|page=74}}\n\n== Austria-Hungary considers an ultimatum ==\n[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|upright=2|A map of ethnic groups in Austria-Hungary in 1910.

It is worth stressing, since this is a cause of some confusion in general narratives of the war, that this was done prior to the Serbian rejection of the ultimatum, the Austrian declaration of war on 28 July or any military measures taken by Germany. As a diplomatic move this had limited value since the Russians did not make this mobilisation public until 28 July.\n\n==== Russian thinking ====\nThe arguments used to support this move in the Council of Ministers were:\n* The crisis was being used as a pretext by the Germans to increase their power.\n* Acceptance of the ultimatum would mean that Serbia would become a protectorate of Austria.\n* Russia had backed down in the past  \u2013 for example in the Liman von Sanders affair and the Bosnian Crisis \u2013 and this had encouraged the Germans rather than appeased them.\n* Russian arms had recovered sufficiently since the disasters of 1904\u201306.\n\nIn addition Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]] believed that war was inevitable and refused to acknowledge that Austria-Hungary had a right to counter measures in the face of Serbian irredentism. On the contrary, Sazonov had aligned himself with the irredentism, and expected the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Crucially, the French had provided their clear support for their Russian allies for a robust response in their recent state visit just days before. Also in the background was Russian anxiety of the future of the Turkish straits \u2013 \"where Russian control of the Balkans would place Saint Petersburg in a far better position to prevent unwanted intrusions on the Bosphorus\u201d {{sfn|Clark|2013|p=486}}\n\nChristopher Clark states, \"It would be difficult to overstate the historical importance of the meetings of 24 and 25 July\",{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=475}} as it emboldened Serbia and raised the stakes for Germany, which was still hoping for a conflict localized to the Balkans.<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Clark|2013|p=480}}: \"In taking these steps, [Russian Foreign Minister] Sazonov and his colleagues escalated the crisis and greatly increased the likelihood of a general European war. For one thing, Russian pre-mobilization altered the political chemistry in Serbia, making it unthinkable that the Belgrade government, which had originally given serious consideration to accepting the ultimatum, would back down in the face of Austrian pressure. It heightened the domestic pressure on the Russian administration&nbsp;... it sounded alarm bells in Austria-Hungary.

Jagow accepted the Franco-Russian offer as it offered the best chance to sever Britain from France and Russia.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=66}} In his talks with Prince Lichnowsky, Grey drew a sharp distinction between an Austro-Serbian war, which did not concern Britain, and an Austro-Russian war, which did.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=66}} Grey added that Britain was not working in concord with France and Russia, which heightened Jagow's hopes of severing Britain from the Triple Entente.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=66}} On the same day, Jagow sent another message to Vienna to encourage the Austrians to hurry up with declaring war on Serbia.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=69}}\n\nOn 26 July, [[Count Leopold Berchtold|Berchtold]] rejected Grey's mediation offer, and wrote that if a localization should not prove possible, then the Dual Monarchy was counting, \"with gratitude\", on Germany's support \"if a struggle against another adversary is forced on us\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=68}} That same day, [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|General von Moltke]] sent a message to Belgium demanding that German troops be allowed to pass through that kingdom \"in the event of an imminent war against France and Russia\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=68}} Bethmann Hollweg in a message to the German Ambassadors in London, Paris and St. Petersburg stated that the principal aim of German foreign policy now was to make it appear that Russia had forced Germany into a war, in order to keep Britain neutral and ensure that German public opinion would back the war effort.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|pp=72-73}} Bethmann Hollweg advised Wilhelm to send [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas]] a telegram, which he assured the Emperor was for public relations purposes only.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}} As [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg|Bethmann Hollweg]] put it, \"If war should come after all, such a telegram would make Russia's guilt glaringly plain\".{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}} Moltke visited the German Foreign Ministry to advise Jagow that Germany should start drafting an ultimatum to justify an invasion of Belgium.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|pp=210-211}} Later, Moltke met with Bethmann Hollweg, and told his wife later that same day that he had informed the Chancellor he was \"very dissatisfied\" that Germany had not yet attacked Russia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=211}}\n\nOn 26 July, in St. Petersburg, the German Ambassador von Pourtal\u00e8s told [[Sergey Sazonov|Sazonov]] to reject Grey's offer of a summit in London,{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=208}} stating that the proposed conference was \"too unwieldy\", and if Russia were serious about saving the peace, they would negotiate directly with the Austrians.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=208}} Sazonov replied that he was willing to see Serbia accept almost all of the Austrian demands, and following von Pourtal\u00e8s's advice, rejected Grey's conference proposal in favour of direct talks with the Austrians.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=208}} Von Pourtal\u00e8s reported to Germany that Sazonov was being \"more conciliatory\", seeking \"to find a bridge&nbsp;... to satisfy&nbsp;... Austrian demands\" and willing to do almost anything to save the peace.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=210}} At the same time, von Pourtal\u00e8s warned that changes in the Balkan balance of power would be regarded as a highly unfriendly act by Russia.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=69}} The following Austro-Russian talks were sabotaged by Austria's refusal to abandon any of the demands on Serbia{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=208}} As a preparatory move in case a war did break out, and Britain were to become involved, [[Winston Churchill]], First Lord of the British Admiralty, ordered the British fleet not to disperse as planned,{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}} arguing that news of the British move might serve as a deterrent to war, and thus help persuade Germany to put pressure on Austria to abandon some of the more outrageous demands in their ultimatum. Grey stated that a compromise solution could be worked out if Germany and Britain were to work together.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}} His approach generated opposition from British officials, who felt the Germans were dealing with the crisis in bad faith.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}} [[Arthur Nicolson, 1st Baron Carnock|Nicolson]] warned Grey that in his opinion \"Berlin is playing with us\".{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}} Grey for his part, rejected Nicolson's assessment, and believed that Germany was interested in stopping a general war.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}}\n\n[[Philippe Berthelot]], the political director of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|Quai d'Orsay]], told [[Wilhelm von Schoen]], the German Ambassador in Paris that \"to my simple mind Germany\u2019s attitude was inexplicable if it did not aim at war\".{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=209}}\n\nIn Vienna, [[Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf|Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]] and [[Count Leopold Berchtold|Berchtold]] disagreed about when Austria should begin operations.

The Kaiser wants peace&nbsp;... He even wants to influence Austria and to stop continuing further.\"{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=219}} Bethmann Hollweg sabotaged Wilhelm's proposal by instructing [[Heinrich von Tschirschky|von Tschirschky]] to not restrain Austria.<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Fischer|1967|p=72}}: \"You must most carefully avoid giving any impression that we want ''to hold Austria back''.

[[Erich von Falkenhayn|General Falkenhayn]] told Wilhelm he \"no longer had control of the affair in his own hands\". Falkenhayn went on to imply that the military would stage a coup d'\u00e9tat, and depose Wilhelm in favour of the hawkish [[William, German Crown Prince|Crown Prince Wilhelm]] if he continued to work for peace.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=219}}\n\nBethmann Hollweg mentioned two favourable conditions for war in his telegram to Vienna: that Russia be made to appear the aggressor forcing a reluctant Germany into war, and that Britain be kept neutral.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=72}} The necessity of making Russia appear the aggressor was the greater concern to Bethmann-Hollweg because the German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] had denounced Austria for declaring war on Serbia and ordered street demonstrations to protest Germany's actions in supporting Austria.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=221}} However, Bethmann Hollweg put great faith in the private promises he received from SPD leaders that they would support the government if Germany was faced with a Russian attack.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=221}}\n\nOn 27 July, Wilhelm ended his cruise in the North Sea and returned to Germany.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=221}} Wilhelm landed at Cuxhaven (Kiel) departing on 25 July at 6 p.m. despite the objections of his chancellor.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|loc=Vol II pp. 428n, 434\u201335}} The next afternoon, the order to disperse the British Fleet and dismiss British reservists was rescinded, putting the British Navy on a war footing.<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Butler|2010|p=103}}: When Wilhelm arrived at the Potsdam station late in the evening of July 26, he was met by a pale, agitated, and somewhat fearful Chancellor. Bethmann-Hollweg's apprehension stemmed not from the dangers of the looming war, but rather from his fear of the Kaiser's wrath when the extent of his deceptions were revealed. The Kaiser's first words to him were suitably brusque: \"How did it all happen?\" Rather than attempt to explain, the Chancellor offered his resignation by way of apology. Wilhelm refused to accept it, muttering furiously, \"You've made this stew, Now you're going to eat it!\"</ref>\n\n=== Austria-Hungary makes final preparations for war (27 July) ===\nLater, on 27 July, Austria-Hungary started to complete the preparations for war.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=69}} That same day, [[Gottlieb von Jagow|Jagow]] informed [[Count Ladislaus von Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny-Marich|Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny]] that he was only pretending to take up the British offers of mediation in order to ensure British neutrality but had no intention of stopping the war.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=70}} [[Count Ladislaus von Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny-Marich|Sz\u00f6gy\u00e9ny]] reported \"in order to avoid a misunderstanding\" that Jagow had promised him that \"the German government assured Austria in the most binding fashion that it in no way identifies itself with the proposal [Grey's mediation offer], which may very shortly be brought to Your Excellency [Berchtold]'s notice by the German government: it is, on the contrary ''decidedly'' opposed to consideration of them and is only passing them on out of deference to the British request\" (emphasis in the original).{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=70}} Jagow went on to state he was \"absolutely against taking account of the British wish\",{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=70}} because \"the German government point of view was that it was at the moment of the highest importance to prevent Britain from making common cause with Russia and France.

We cannot therefore reject the role of mediator; we have to pass on the British proposal to Vienna for consideration, especially since London and Paris are continuously using their influence on St. Petersburg.\"</ref> In passing on Grey's message, Bethmann Hollweg deleted the last line, which read: \"Also, the whole world here is convinced, and I hear from my colleagues that the key to the situation lies in Berlin, and that if Berlin seriously wants peace, it will prevent Vienna from following a foolhardy policy.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=71}} In his reply to London, Bethmann Hollweg pretended that: \"We have immediately initiated mediation in Vienna in the sense desired by Sir Edward Grey.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=71}} Jagow sent Grey's offer to [[Heinrich von Tschirschky|Tschirschky]], his ambassador in Vienna, but ordered him to not show it to any Austrian official in case they might accept it.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=214}} At the same time, Bethmann Hollweg sent a distorted account of Grey's offer to [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm]].{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=71}}\n\nIn London, Grey told a meeting of the British Cabinet that they now had to decide whether to choose neutrality if war did come or to enter the conflict.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=214}} While the Cabinet was still undecided about what course to choose, [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] put the British fleet on alert.<ref group=note>{{harvnb|Fromkin|2004|p=215}}: His order read: \"Secret.

Moltke ended his assessment with: \"We shall never hit it again so well as we do now.\"{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=218}} Jagow backed up Moltke by sending a message to Vienna telling the Austrians they must attack Serbia at once because otherwise the British peace plan might be accepted.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=219}}\n\n==Austria-Hungary declares war on Serbia (28 July) ==\n[[File:TelegramWW1.jpg|thumb|Austria-Hungary's telegram to the Kingdom of Serbia declaring war, 28 July 1914]]\nAt 11:00&nbsp;a.m. on 28 July, Austria declared war on Serbia.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}} Following instructions from Bethmann Hollweg, von Tschirschky did not present Wilhelm's \"Stop in Belgrade\" proposal until noon.{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=73}} At 1:00 a.m. on 29 July 1914 the first shots of the First World War were fired by the Austrian [[river monitor|monitor]] [[Yugoslav monitor Sava|SMS ''Bodrog'']], which bombarded Belgrade in response to Serbian sappers blowing up the railway bridge over the river Sava which linked the two countries.<ref>{{cite news |last=Keys |first=David |date=27 July 2014|title=Church to mark centenary of the start of WWI |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/church-to-mark-the-real-centenary-of-the-start-of-first-world-war-9631887.html |work=[[The Independent]] |location= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908181627/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/church-to-mark-the-real-centenary-of-the-start-of-first-world-war-9631887.html |archive-date= 8 September 2017 |access-date=28 June 2015 }}</ref> In Russia, partial mobilization was ordered for the four military districts bordering Austria-Hungary.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=220}} Wilhelm sent a telegram to Nicholas asking for Russian support for the Austrian war against Serbia.{{sfn|Fromkin|2004|p=220}} Nicholas replied: \"Am glad you are back&nbsp;...

It is imperative that the responsibility for any extension of the conflict to the Powers not directly concerned should under all circumstances fall on Russia alone.\"{{sfn|Fischer|1967|p=74}} At the same time, the German Ambassador to Russia, Portal\u00e9s, reported that, based on a conversation with Sazonov, Russia was prepared to make \"astonishing\" concessions by promising to pressure Serbia to agree to most of the Austrian demands to avoid a war.

Moltke was overruled by Bethmann Hollweg in two meetings on 29 July, who argued that Germany should wait for Russia to begin a general mobilization.

On 28 July, Russia ordered partial mobilization in response to Austria's declaration of war on Serbia, Bethmann-Hollweg became alarmed and changed his attitude 180 degrees. Already on 28 July, two hours before becoming aware of the Austrian declaration of war, the Kaiser had suggested the \"Halt in Belgrade\" plan and instructed von Jagow that a cause for war no longer existed with the Serbian reply and he was ready to mediate with Serbia.<ref group=note>\"I propose that we say to Austria: Serbia has been forced to retreat in a very humiliating manner and we offer our congratulations.

From these contradictions I must conclude that the telegram disavowing Hoyos {who, on July 5/6 at Berlin, had spoken unofficially of Austria's partitioning of Serbia} was intended for the gallery, and that the Austrian Government is harboring plans which it sees fit to conceal from us, in order to assure itself in all events of German support and to avoid the refusal which might result from a frank statement.\"</ref>\n\nAfter receiving information from Rome that Serbia was now ready \"on condition of certain interpretations, to swallow even Articles 5 and 6, that is, the whole Austrian ultimatum\", Bethmann Hollweg forwarded this information to Vienna at 12:30&nbsp;a.m., 30 July, adding that Serbia's response to the Austrian ultimatum were a \"suitable basis for negotiation.\"<ref group=note>\"Please show this to Berchtold immediately and add that we regard such a yielding on Serbia's part as a suitable basis for negotiations along with an occupation of a part of Serbian territory as a pledge.\"</ref> Berchtold replied that though the acceptance of the Austrian Note would have been satisfactory before hostilities had begun, \"now after a state of war has begun, Austria's conditions must naturally take another tone.\" In response, Bethmann Hollweg, now aware of the Russian order for partial mobilization, fired off several telegrams in the early morning hours of 30 July. He telegraphed Vienna at 2:55&nbsp;a.m.<ref group=note>\"The refusal of every exchange of views with St. Petersburg would be a serious mistake, for it provokes Russia precisely to armed interference, which Austria is primarily concerned in avoiding.

In a series of letters exchanged with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] of Germany (the so-called \"[[Willy and Nicky]] correspondence\") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against the Austrian border, in the hopes of preventing war with the [[German Empire]].

Jagow rejected the British ultimatum and Goschen demanded his passports and requested a private and personal meeting with Bethmann Hollweg, who invited Goschen to dine with him. During their highly emotional conversation Bethmann Hollweg, who had spent his career trying to improve relations, accused Britain of going to war for its own national agenda, which was unrelated to that of Belgium, who would have been compensated for the wrong done to it. He quoted Grey's speech as evidence that Britain was not going to war for Belgium's sake.<ref group=note>\"One needs only to read this speech through carefully to learn the reason of England's intervention in the war.  Amid all his beautiful phrases about England's honour and England's obligations, we find it over and over again expressed that England's interests - its own interests - called for participation in war, for it was not in England's interests that a victorious, and therefore stronger, Germany should emerge from the war.\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/scrapofpaper2.htm|title=First World War.com - Primary Documents - The Scrap of Paper, 4 August 1914|website=www.firstworldwar.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107163503/http://firstworldwar.com/source/scrapofpaper2.htm|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref> According to Goschen's report to Grey, Bethmann Hollweg said the [[Treaty of London, 1839]], was for Britain (not for Germany), an excuse i.e. a \"scrap of paper\"<ref name=\"byu.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/1914/paperscrap.html.bak|title=World War I, Origin of the Term \"A Scrap of Paper\"|website=net.lib.byu.edu|accessdate=3 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322015509/http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/1914/paperscrap.html.bak|archivedate=22 March 2018}}</ref> and, compared to the \"fearful fact of Anglo-German war\",{{sfn|Bethmann Hollweg|1920|pp=158\u201359}} the steps taken by His Majesty's Government were terrible to a degree; just for a word \u2013 \"neutrality\", a word which in war time had so often been disregarded \u2013 just for a scrap of paper Great Britain was going to make war on a kindred nation who desired nothing better than to be friends with it<ref name=\"byu.edu\"/>. \n\nGoschen's telegrams on 4 August to Grey never reached London, so it was unclear whether a state of war existed between Britain and Germany until the expiry of the ultimatum at midnight, Berlin time.{{sfn|Albertini|1953|loc=Vol III, p. 500}} On August 4th 1914, Great Britain declared war on Germany.

World War I (Punch Magazine 1914).jpg|thumb|British satirical magazine [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] depicted Belgium as a scrappy youth blocking the passage of elderly, bullying Germany, August 1914]]\nBritain's reasons for declaring war were complex. After the war began the propaganda reason given was that Britain was required to safeguard Belgium's neutrality under the [[Treaty of London 1839]]. The German invasion of Belgium was, therefore, the ''casus belli'' and, importantly, legitimized and galvanized popular support for the war among the antiwar Liberal Party constituency.  However, the Treaty of London of 1839 had not committed Britain on her own to safeguard Belgium's neutrality. \n\nRather Britain's support for France was decisive.  [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] argued that the naval agreements with France (although they had not been approved by the Cabinet) created a moral obligation vis a vis Britain and France. British Foreign office mandarin Eyre Crowe stated: \"Should the war come, and England stand aside, one of two things must happen. (a) Either Germany and Austria win, crush France and humiliate Russia. What will be the position of a friendless England? (b) Or France and Russia win. What would be their attitude towards England? What about India and the Mediterranean?\" {{sfn|Clark|2013|p=544}}\n \nIn the event that Britain abandoned its Entente friends, Britain feared that if Germany won the war, or the Entente won without British support, then, either way, it would be left without any friends. This would have left both Britain and her Empire vulnerable to attack.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=544}} \n\nDomestically, the Liberal Cabinet was split and in the event that war was not declared the Government would fall as [[Prime Minister Asquith]], [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]] and [[Winston Churchill]] made it clear they would resign. In that event, the existing Liberal government would lose control of Parliament. In that case the pro-war Conservatives would come to power.  The Liberal Party might never recover\u2013as indeed happened in 1916.{{sfn|Clark|2013|p=545}}\n\n== Austria-Hungary declares war on Russia (August 6) ==\nOn August 6, the Emperor Franz Joseph signed the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Russia.\n\n{{Portal|World War I}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Allies of World War I]]\n* [[Causes of World War I]]\n* [[Commission of Responsibilities]]\n* [[Diplomatic history of World War I]]\n** [[Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I]]\n** [[French entry into World War I]]\n** [[German entry into World War I]]\n** [[Russian entry into World War I]]\n** [[Historiography of the causes of World War I]]\n* [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)]]\n* [[Powder keg of Europe]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* Albrecht-Carri\u00e9, Ren\u00e9.
