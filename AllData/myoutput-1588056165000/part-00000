It was said that he could not even read the European notations. {{parabr}}\nAfter the tournament [the 1933 Folkestone Olympiad] the American team was invited to the home of Sultan Khan's master in London. When we were ushered in we were greeted by the maharajah with the remark, \"It is an honor for you to be here; ordinarily I converse only with my greyhounds.\" Although he was a [[Islam|Mohammedan]], the maharajah had been granted special permission to drink intoxicating beverages, and he made liberal use of this dispensation. He presented us with a four-page printed biography telling of his life and exploits; so far as we could see his greatest achievement was to have been born a maharajah. </blockquote>\n\nIn December 1933, Sir Umar took him back to India.<ref name=\"HooperWhyldp.402\"/><ref name=\"Sunnucksp.444\">Sunnucks, p. 444.</ref><ref name=\"FineWorld'sGreatp.181\">[[Reuben Fine]], ''The World's Great Chess Games'', Dover, 1983, p. 181. {{ISBN|0-486-24512-8}}.</ref> In 1935, he won a match against V.

Unable to read or write, he never studied any books on the game, and he was put into the hands of trainers who were also his rivals in play. He never mastered [[chess opening|openings]] which, by nature empirical, cannot be learned by the application of common sense alone. Under these adverse circumstances, and having known international chess for a mere seven years, only half of which was spent in Europe, Sultan Khan nevertheless had few peers in the [[chess middlegame|middlegame]], was among the world's best two or three [[chess endgame|endgame]] players, and one of the world's best ten players.

The \"Sultan\" was not the term of status that we supposed it to be; it was merely a first name. In fact, Sultan Khan was actually a kind of serf on the estate of a maharajah when his chess genius was discovered. He spoke English poorly, and kept score in Hindustani. It was said that he could not even read the European notations. {{parabr}}\nAfter the tournament [the 1933 Folkestone Olympiad] the American team was invited to the home of Sultan Khan's master in London. When we were ushered in we were greeted by the maharajah with the remark, \"It is an honor for you to be here; ordinarily I converse only with my greyhounds.\" Although he was a [[Islam|Mohammedan]], the maharajah had been granted special permission to drink intoxicating beverages, and he made liberal use of this dispensation. He presented us with a four-page printed biography telling of his life and exploits; so far as we could see his greatest achievement was to have been born a maharajah. In the meantime Sultan Khan, who was our real entr\u00e9e to his presence, was treated as a servant by the maharajah (which in fact he was according to Indian law), and we found ourselves in the peculiar position of being waited on at table by a chess grand master.</blockquote>\n\nIn December 1933, Sir Umar took him back to India.<ref name=\"HooperWhyldp.402\"/><ref name=\"Sunnucksp.444\">Sunnucks, p. 444.</ref><ref name=\"FineWorld'sGreatp.181\">[[Reuben Fine]], ''The World's Great Chess Games'', Dover, 1983, p. 181. {{ISBN|0-486-24512-8}}.</ref> In 1935, he won a match against V.

Although FIDE awarded titles to some long-retired players who had distinguished careers earlier in their lives, such as Rubinstein and [[Carlos Torre]], it never awarded any title to Sultan Khan.<ref>FIDE awarded Rubinstein the International Grandmaster title on its first title list in 1950.

Unable to read or write, he never studied any books on the game, and he was put into the hands of trainers who were also his rivals in play. He never mastered [[chess opening|openings]] which, by nature empirical, cannot be learned by the application of common sense alone. Under these adverse circumstances, and having known international chess for a mere seven years, only half of which was spent in Europe, Sultan Khan nevertheless had few peers in the [[chess middlegame|middlegame]], was among the world's best two or three [[chess endgame|endgame]] players, and one of the world's best ten players. This achievement brought admiration from Capablanca who called him a genius, an accolade he rarely bestowed.</blockquote>\n\n==Notable games==\n{{AN chess|pos=secright}}\n*Probably Sultan Khan's most famous game is his win as [[White and Black in chess|White]] against Capablanca at Hastings 1930\u201331: {{parabr}}1.Nf3 Nf6 2.d4 b6 3.c4 Bb7 4.Nc3 e6 5.a3 d5 6.cxd5 exd5 7.Bg5 Be7 8.e3 0-0 9.Bd3 Ne4 10.Bf4 Nd7 11.Qc2 f5 12.Nb5 Bd6 13.Nxd6 cxd6 14.h4 Rc8 15.Qb3 Qe7 16.Nd2 Ndf6 17.Nxe4 fxe4 18.Be2 Rc6 19.g4 Rfc8 20.g5 Ne8 21.Bg4 Rc1+ 22.Kd2 R8c2+ 23.Qxc2 Rxc2+ 24.Kxc2 Qc7+ 25.Kd2 Qc4 26.Be2 Qb3 27.Rab1 Kf7 28.Rhc1 Ke7 29.Rc3 Qa4 30.b4 Qd7 31.Rbc1 a6 32.Rg1 Qa4 33.Rgc1 Qd7 34.h5 Kd8 35.R1c2 Qh3 36.Kc1 Qh4 37.Kb2 Qh3 38.Rc1 Qh4 39.R3c2 Qh3 40.a4 Qh4 41.Ka3 Qh3 42.Bg3 Qf5 43.Bh4 g6 44.h6 Qd7 45.b5 a5 46.Bg3 Qf5 47.Bf4 Qh3 48.Kb2 Qg2 49.Kb1 Qh3 50.Ka1 Qg2 51.Kb2 Qh3 52.Rg1 Bc8 53.Rc6 Qh4 54.Rgc1 Bg4 55.Bf1 Qh5 56.Re1 Qh1 57.Rec1 Qh5 58.Kc3 Qh4 59.Bg3 Qxg5 60.Kd2 Qh5 61.Rxb6 Ke7 62.Rb7+ Ke6 63.b6 Nf6 64.Bb5 Qh3 65.Rb8 {{chessAN|1\u20130}} Black {{chessgloss|resigned}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1135510 |title=Sultan Khan vs. Capablanca, Hastings 1930\u201331 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |access-date=26 January 2009 }}</ref>\n*Sultan Khan won this crushing victory as [[White and Black in chess|Black]] against the Russo-Belgian player [[Victor Soultanbeieff]] at Li\u00e8ge 1930: {{parabr}}1.d4 Nf6 2.Nf3 b6 3.c4 e6 4.g3 Bb7 5.Bg2 Bb4+ 6.Bd2 Bxd2+ 7.Nbxd2 0-0 8.0-0 c5 9.Qc2 Nc6 10.dxc5 bxc5 11.e4 Qc7 12.Rfe1 d6 13.Rac1 h6 14.a3 Nd7 15.Qc3 a5 16.Nh4 g5 17.Qe3 Qd8 18.Nhf3 Qe7 19.h3 Rab8 20.b3 Ba8 21.Nb1 Nde5 22.a4 Nxf3+ 23.Bxf3 Nd4 24.Bd1 f5 25.exf5 Rxf5 26.Rc3 Rbf8 27.Rf1 Rf3! 28.Bxf3 Rxf3 {{chessAN|0\u20131}} White resigned.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1135513 |title=Soultanbeieff vs. Sultan Khan, Liege 1930 |website=[[ChessGames.com]] |access-date=26 January 2009 }}</ref>\n*In this game from Li\u00e8ge 1930, long-time American champion [[Frank Marshall (chess player)|Frank Marshall]] (Black) tries to add to his long list of [[Glossary of chess#Brilliancy|brilliancies]], but Sultan Khan defends coolly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1135515 |title=Sultan Khan vs. Marshall, Liege 1930 |website=[[Chessgames.com]] |access-date=6 February 2009 }}</ref> His biographer calls his play \"a wonderful example of ''sang-froid'' under pressure\":<ref name=\"Colesp.52\">R.
