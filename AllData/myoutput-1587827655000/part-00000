At the age of 21 she was burned at the stake for witchcraft in the village of Waret-la-Chaussee in Belgium France. Just before being burned she was strangled by the executioner. <ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref>\n\n==Trial of Anne de Chantraine==\n\n===26 March 1620===\nThe sergeant of the court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e arrested a young lady called Anne de Chantraine; she was 19 years old, she had come to live in the village with her father and was reputed to be a witch. Anne was a very beautiful girl, she has long red hair, people associated her hair with the flames of hell. There has been a lot of things going on in the village. The crops have been failing, the cows were not giving milk and the hens were laying sterile eggs, all this was deemed to be the workings of witchcraft. The person who denounced Anne a witch was none other than her neighbour, whose advances she refused. \n\nOn March 28, 1620, the accused was examined informally. She was brought before the mayor, Thomas Douclet, and the aldermen of the district. Fearing the instruments of the master of high works, she avoided torture by confessing freely to being a witch. She then made the most brazen avowals. \n\nBorn on March 19, 1601. in the town of Liege, to a traveling merchant father, her mother died when Anne was only 1 years old. Not long after the death of her mother, Anne's father placed her in the hospital of saint jean the Baptist in liege. Little Anne resided at the hospital for fifteen years, where she was fed and raised up, and along with other little girls was taught to read and write, also was taught about religion, and learned how to sew. Has heard that her father Jean de Chantraine is still alive and living in Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e. At the age of 17 she went to live in the house of one named Christine de la Ch\u00e9raille, to where Anne was taken and presented by a certain servant at the hospital named Catherine ; her having said that she knew how to sew well. Anne became a seamstress, her job was to sew, make new clothes, and sometimes mend old clothes. Catherine was Christine's daughter, she also had a son called Henry. One evening, Anne was asked by Christine if she wanted to go to a wedding celebration with her ? To which she agreed. And the same day, at midnight, she was woken by Christine, saying it was time to go to the party and being close to her she rubbed on some black grease down to her waist and encouraged the prisoner to do the same. To what To which she replied she didn\u2019t have scabies. Upon which Christine replied to her that she would be even more beautiful and afterwards Christine anointed her and having proffered the following words : \" kneel down, touch the ground, then straight, straight up ! \" flew up the chimney and then the prisoner did the same and was taken to a grand room where she found there to be many people amongst those other than Christine, the aforementioned CHAUMONT, with many others that she shall say upon afterwards, being all seated around a table where there were silver goblets and having taken a piece of meat in her mouth and smelling that it was foul she spat it from her mouth, saying also that the candles that were burning were black. And when the said prisoner asked of the said assembly where she had come to, it was said to her in reply that they had come to her wedding celebration, and having said \"well beautiful bride who shall be the groom,\" a young, beardless man with a black hat and cloven feet approached closely to her and asked her if she wanted to be married to him. And she having replied to him that she had not yet done any lovemaking. She replied to him that they were not accustomed to making love. And after having spent some time he asked her if he could be seated with her. She said \"Jesus Mary how have I came to do this\" ? And all of a sudden, the company and all who had been in the chamber disappeared and she found herself in a courtyard where she stayed some time. And at the breaking of the day, Christine, came to collect her and as she said that she could not go on foot, she took her under the arms and carried her to a river where she found a boat and two women who took her back and took two days to arrive in Li\u00e8ge. And after having been ill for a long time, Christine asked her if she wanted to give herself to the devil and that in doing so she would be cured. Her having refused to do so, Christine took up a knife threatening to cut her throat and after several moments, she finally gave in Christine who gave her some bread, having eaten of which she was cured. The same evening Christine, with Laurent, took her to the same room or chamber as before, or first to some handsome companions, the name of whom she has forgotten at present, the one who had feathers in his hat, the one who requested to get upon her. This which he did and has done many times since in fact every time she went to the dances that being three times a week, be it known on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Saying also that the member of her so-called demon was very cold and his semen hot, as it seemed to her, and as soon as he removed his member, under where it came out, according to her, something red has been there since. Confessing also that Laurent CHAUMONT had many affairs with her ; saying that his member was hot and twice as big as that of her demon's. During the dances here taking place there was a lame witch lying on her stomach, the whole length of the table, and with a black candle placed in the hole of her arse serving as a candlestick and that she danced around for a quarter of an hour, and when she had finished, all those of the assembly went and kissed the arse of a goat and worshipped it, each carrying a lit black candle, which they left upon the table. Then the goat burst into flames and was reduced to ashes, and these ashes were distributed amongst all the witches for their use, and just as they had been ordered to by their gallants. Saying also that the said goat, though having been burnt to ashes, stood upright as a man and distributed the said powder or ashes himself. And this done, each of the said gallants had relations with each witch just as they had had relations them with them previously at the dances. Laurent de Chamont, brother-in-law and lover of her mistress, he was the king of the witches in that region, he was the leader of the group. They entered people's houses at night by magic and stole money, jewelry, books, clothes, and food. It was Laurent de Chamont who shaved and cut hairs from his sexual organs, and armpits, placing them on the palm of his hand, he blew them into keyholes; for it was thus, by the help of the devil, that doors of houses and locks of chests were opened. But the gang of witches were finally caught. Anne denounced Christine, Laurent, Catherine, and henry witches, they were arrested and burned alive at the stake. She had resided with Christine in the space of one year, until She left Christine, because she and her children along with Laurent de Chaumont, brother-in-law of Christine were engaged in crime and they were so evil. Having left she went to live at La Seraille, a place she knew of because Christine was going to go there with a cart as she desired many goods and accoutrements belonging to the wife of the said Teraille ; the prisoner having warned the said wife which was the reason that she was received in the house having placed all her trust in the woman, the prisoner's job there was to wash the laundry, hanging the laundry out and ironing the laundry. Having left the said Teraille, she went to live with her godmother Agnes Le Pape, she lived there for the whole of winter. This Agnes gave her a bandeau. It was then that the prisoner was arrested. The prisoner's punishment was not to be tortured or executed like her accomplices, but she was to be banished from Liege. Leaving the principality of Liege, she was taken to her father, who had settled at War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, he had re married. Anne hired herself as a milkmaid to a farmer named Laurent Streignart, she milked his cows. She lived in Waret with her father for a whole year for 13 months. His new wife Marie Descry was very nice to her, Anne looked on her as the mother she never had. \n\nThese were the confessions of Anne de Chantraine. But the magistrate wanted to know more information. So that same day the tribunal decided to send one of its members to Liege to obtain more complete information. They will interrogate the prisoner to know more of her crimes and if she had any other accomplices now in Waret.\nGuilame BODART 1620\n\n===September 15, 1620===\nBecause of the number of cases under consideration, Anne's trial was put on hold.

And at the same instant it seemed, to the witness, that he lost his sight or at least that it was blurred, and that instead of seeing one person he saw three or four of the same, and this not long after all this happened. \n\nHaving also had brought before us Marie Descry (the new) wife of Jean de Chantraine, She stated that she thought of Anne as her actual daughter, always spoke with her, got on very well with her. Told that on one day the prisoner having returned from milking her cows at work, she took a knife and afterwards gave it back to the witness, Marie saying if Anne had kept the knife she would have stabbed herself because she was in so much despair. Later that evening when Anne had gone to bed, Marie heard a moan coming from her room. Going in she surprised her by seeing Anne trying to strangle herself with the cords of her headdress. Fortunately they were not strong enough. Anne started crying, Marie rushed to her hugging her and reassuring her, she rocked Anne in her arms where she fell asleep with her tears. And being, the witness, asked if Anne had saved her from taken poison out of her drink, said yes and she confirmed what she had said that she had thrown it into the fire. She also said that Anne had told her that Catherine had poised the Marshal's child. To which her step-mother urged her to go to the child and hurry to cure it at once. Anne later on coming back home she assured her step-mother that she had saved the child, and the child was now fine. \nAnd after reading they both confirmed that above.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk That same day Anne was asked why she had given the poison to the girl who lives two leagues from Waret. To which right then the prisoner declared that she don't remember saying that she gave the poison to some girl.\n\nOn the 16th of the same month of April (1621), before LINCHAMPS, de LOFFE, GAIFFIER and BOYEMANS. Having seen, Anne de Chantraine prisoner, previously examined upon whether she had given the poison mentioned in the two articles of this instruction of the said Master advisor to the girl therein mentioned: said she has no memory of this, to which she insisted.  \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621 \n\nSince then and at the time has confessed to it being veritable, that after having taken the poison from the child of the new marshal of the said Waret, in the presence of and assisted by the devil her gallant called Green-Bonnet, she had given the said poison, that consisted of a black powder that came from a goat that was ordinarily burnt at the dances, to a girl who passed behind Waret along the main road that goes from Namur to Hannut ; \u2026\u2026 asked touching with the hand in which she held the powder upon the back of the skirts of the said girl with the intention of killing her. Not knowing who she is, or where she lives, other than that she had afterwards been told by her gallant, that she was the daughter of a censor residing two leagues from the said Waret, without naming the name, or her residence, but that her father had the good means to support her. This which occurred not long before her imprisonment saying that on the day after her so-called gallant told her that the said girl was dead and that since then he told her she was not and that the devil was a liar. Not knowing of any other thing. And examined as to why she had until the present been secretive and had denied that above : said that she feared that we would have her done to death.\nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk \n1621\n \nOf the 9th of June 1621 \nAnne de Chantraine prisoner was interrogated upon which houses the crimes were committed in of which she spoke in her deposition of the said day and that Christine, Laurent de CHAUMONT and herself had stolen away. Has replied that the most they had taken away had been at la Theraille, where they had taken and stole away much money, sheets of lace, cloths and napkins. Item, in the house of L\u00e9onard de VAULX, they stole away : money, all at once, many sacks of oats, skirts, coats and cloaks. Item, in the house of Chenseval they stole away sheets of lace, and many other things, and also much money. At Cigne, upon le Goffe at Li\u00e8ge : wine in a bottle, only once. And said that when they returned they came with demons and said that all these crimes were carried out when they returned from the dances. Said that otherwise, said that they had stripped a house on the bridge to the Isle, the house known to belong to the Lady de la Theraille, and they took from this house : sheets for a skirt, money and silk. And from a house in front of the Court they stole away a barrel of white wine. \nGuilame BODART \n\nOn June 15th 1621. \nfive witnesses came from Li\u00e8ge to testify on her morals. They were Conrad de Phencenal, from whom she had stolen many tin plates; , Anne de Chevron who had been robbed by her of linen and jewels; L\u00e9onard de Vaulx and his daughter, who brought a theft of 300 florins against her. A young merchant, Wautier Betoren, declared he had been her victim to the extent of a piece of linen, but that a friend of Anne, had given him twenty florins by way of indemnity.\n\nThe mayor of War\u00eat had a meeting at Namur, where the Provincial Council gave an authorisation for torture, in order to know if the accused might have any other accomplices in War\u00eat.\n\nJune 19th, 1621. \nThe torturer of Namur L\u00e9onard Balzat came to War\u00eat. It was decided that the accused should be submitted to the torture of water cure. \nTwo days later the torture was repeated, but this time the torturer poured very hot water through the funnel placed in her throat. It was a horrible scene, when the funnel was removed from her mouth, Anne was coughing, moaning, sobbing. However this still did not make her to reveal her accomplices, nothing more could be found out. She was in a very bad condition, she could not eat any food that evening. She refused to eat because of her throat. \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\nJuly 23rd, 1621. \nThe judges of Waret then turned to their superiors in Namur who opted for death. On July 23, the delegates of the Provincial Council condemned Anne de Chantraine to death. \"for the confessed crime of witchcraft, and for having assisted at several larcenies by night, by means of the same witchcraft, in the houses of citizens in the city of Li\u00e8ge.\" \nB. de LINCHAMPS clerk\n\nJuly 26th 1621\nThe sentence was made known to Anne on the 26th. She in a burst of despair, denied all her confessions.\n\n===December 9, 1621===\nAnne de Chantraine was not executed. During the winter of 1621 the mayor made another visit to Namur. On December 9 he received an answer that \"in view of the inquiries held by a deputed commission since the sentence pronounced in the court of War\u00eat on July 26, the aldermen should see to it that the said sentence be carried into execution according to due form and tenor.\"  \n\n===December 14, 1621===\nThe undersigned clerk of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e certifies that on this day the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), at about six o\u2019clock in the morning, he has to be found at the gates of the prison, in which Anne de CHANTRAINE was imprisoned, where in the presence of Jacques de HERAUDE rag merchant, sentence was pronounced upon the prisoner obtained against her by the Mayor of Waret following the judgement made by My lords of the Council of Namur on the 9th of this month. After which announcement, the undersigned said to the prisoner that she should repent truly of all her sins so she would be able to properly give herself over to God. To which she made no reply. And that instantly father MONCEAU Jesuit and his companion came in, and after the sign of the cross having been made by MONCEAU he had asked of the prisoner how she fared, remonstrating with her, and that since she had been sentenced, that she should make a good and full confession. Upon which, the prisoner replied that she was happy to die for her sins but not for being a witch, which she twice reiterated to which father MONCEAU replied to her that a witch must die as a witch, a thief as a thief. Upon these words, the undersigned left to go and find the Lord Councillor BODART, leaving the Jesuits alone with the prisoner. Such was done the day and year above.  \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk to the Court \nOf the said Waret \n\nUpon this day, the fourteenth of December sixteen twenty-one (1621), Godefroid GAIFFIER, licensed in law and Jan de LOFFE magistrates of the Court of Waret la Chauss\u00e9e, were taken to the gaols of this town to Anne de CHANTRAINE prisoner, with effect to hear if she persists in her denials of events of witchcraft heretofore voluntarily confessed to by her, not only before those of the Court, but to the Lord Councillor BODART, and to question if the confessions made before, touching upon these events, were veritable. She replied no. And it was asked of her why she had accused herself as a witch for? To which she said she does not know why she told people that she was a witch. And it was asked of her where she had learned of the events and that she could not have any knowledge of them if she was not truly a witch. Said she learned by hearsay, and that she dare not die upon the false confessions of these events. And was asked of her if she was resolved to die. Replied that yes, but only for her sins. And it was asked of her if her sins were other than those legally confessed to by her. Gave no reply apart from some ambiguous ones, not wanting to reply pertinently, even when pressed. This day, brother Jean Bartholom\u00e9, a religious of the order of Saint Francis, declared to us that he had heard the prisoner today in her confession. And that after this was ended, the prisoner told him that she wishes to restore the honor and good reputation that she had taken from all those she had accused in her legal confessions as witches and that she doesn\u2019t know of badness in them and that they were good people like her and that she had decided to declare this in such a way publicly to the Judiciary. Outside the room, the clerk of the court was interested in the sanity of the prisoner, the jailer was asked if he had at anytime noticed anything abnormal about Anne, he said that \"the prisoner was stupid, did not understand what she said, though sometimes she seemed quite right in her mind\".\nBy ordonance. \nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n\nAgain Anne de Chantraine was still not executed. Not sure if Anne was insane, or if she was a witch. Her execution was put on hold. She languished for sometime in the prison of Waret. In September 1622 on the 7th, the Council decided to re-examine the facts confessed by the accused. Two new councillors were appointed. Upon examining the said prisoner she acted like she was troubled in spirit. It was hard to know if the prisoner was insane, or if the devil was making her tell lies, and preventing her from making a full confession. In order to facilitate the inquiry, the judges have decided to turn to their superiors in Namur for help. The prisoner has been taken to Namur where she was imprisoned in the Tour de Bordial, on the bank of the Sambre, at the foot of the citadel.\nBalduin de LINCHAMPS clerk  \nof the said Court.\n \n12th of September 1622. \nWas heard the commissioner\u2019s report upon what is required made law by them upon this day. Anne de Chantraine prisoner, has been advised that the first commissioner shall be informed by the jailer, his wife and others that the jailer shall name, upon whether during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner, they remarked that she was troubled in spirit and in judgement, as she demonstrated during the discourse held with the commissioners on this day, and on the 7th of the same month. They said that the prisoner was troubled in spirit. \n\nAnne was brought into the council at Namur, The jailer armed with scissors and razer cut Anne's hair and shaved her head. She was stripped of her shift, and dressed in a plain shift. Afterwards she had an exorcism performed on her by priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU.\nGuillaume BODART\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===28 September 1622===\nSummoned before us{{Who|date=March 2020}} is Jacques de HERAUD prison warder in this town, the same man heard and examined in conformity with the decree of the 12th of this month in order to know if during daily chats and conversations he, his wife or servants may have had with Anne de Chantraine, prisoner, if they noticed that she was troubled of spirit or in judgement ? Upon which, he replied to us under oath that he has not had any other conversation with the prisoner, apart from on the occasions when he checked up on her in prison and brought her something to eat or had it taken by his children, who he also accompanied, if then he had asked her at any time what she had done ? To which she had always responded well regarding this, never continuing on at any time from previous discourse, he remarked that he had not now noticed if she seemed troubled, or lacking in spirit, since the exorcism. Though by the hearsay of the priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU having visited her ; the prisoner was heavy-hearted and did not know what she was saying, and that going there to see her just after the witness, he found that she spoke and conversed as well as she had always been seen to do, saying \"if they make me say something enough I shall say it\", knowing that she is a witch, but that soon afterwards she revoked it. He told us also, that the prisoner's father came to see her. Where he made it heard that he blamed Anne his daughter for her actions, saying \"look well for yourselves, swear even that she has not done so\", and at that she replied, \"let us not speak of this at all father, if I have done something to you, I asked it of you\". The jailer also added that whilst she had been in prison, she had had a quarrel with two women (his) young nieces. Those who usually brought her something to eat, and this because they had not known soon enough, or well enough, what she desired upon which occasion, she menaced them and said they will pay for it. And in fact, sometimes having been near to the prisoner, they returned sick: spending water and foul stuff from their mouths, seeming to be ill enough to die. By which the jailer was overcame by emotion and trouble and accused the prisoner and harassed and menaced her, saying to her that if she did not cure them, there would be no other executioner than he to see her killed. Upon which she replied to him that she had not done anything to them, but that she could cure them fully, and having upon the instant brought the two girls towards her, he saw that she took them by the hand and started to say words which he cannot remember and that he began to run away, leaving behind with her the two girls, and forthwith and in an instant they returned to being all changed and healed just as they had been before, as was seen by several prisoners they were completely amazed and said, \"she must be a devil herself\". And as much the two girls have since been well, apart from one who seems to still feel the effects, as there may be no doubt. The hearsay of one of his nieces was, one time when she was taking Anne's food to her, she entered the room alone where Anne was languishing. Anne was sprawled on the straw. Her head in the corner made a light spot: the clarity was dull. when she gave the prisoner her food, Anne stared at her with a dead look. It was a terrible look. It seemed to the niece an accusation and a reproach. The niece was unable to bear it. She fled the room. The jailer states that the very first day the prisoner was brought to this prison, she had words and discourse with him pertaining to her doings and acts of witchcraft, circumstances and reasons and so surely that he was shocked and amazed by it all. Saying having had many witches on his hands, as many in Fernelmont as here, and that he has never heard any of them talk as much about witchcraft, nor none before, as does the prisoner. Upon which he insists. \nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\nOf the 5th of October 1622 before LINCHAMPS and de LOFFE. \nSummoned Marie de FODAU, wife of Jacques de HERAUDE (the jailer) aged seventy-two years. She after having sworn by oath, was examined upon whether if, during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner since she was in prison, had she noticed that she was troubled of spirit and judgement? Has stated not having any other conversation with the prisoner unless it was whilst bringing her food or having food brought to her by her two nieces, during which times they often conversed with her, not noticing in any way at all that she seemed troubled in spirit or in judgement. Given that she spoke and has always spoken and replied with assurance and good judgement, as she still does daily, without noticing any change from her since she has been in prison. Upon this she insists. \nNot having signed for not knowing how to write. \nB. de LINCHAMPS 1622  J. de LOFFE 1622 \n\nOctober 17, 1622, the definitive sentence was brought in: death by fire with preliminary strangulation. On that day Anne was brought back to War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, the place that would be fixed for her execution. During the following night L\u00e9onard Balzat and his assistant prepared the pyre, a huge heap of a hundred fagots bought in the village itself. In the centre, sheaves of straw were placed, and a hollow was made large enough in the straw to contain a stool. The prisoner had no idea that she was going to be executed the next day, nobody told her.\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===October 18, 1622===\nAt dawn Anne was awakened by the jailer, the clerk of the court, and a priest, who announced the fatal news to her. She said she was glad to die for her sins, but persisted in her denial of not being a witch. She was led out. The executioner was waiting with a cart, and the condemned girl climbed into it. When they reached the end of the village where the pyre was, L\u00e9onard Balzat took Anne out of the cart and walked her over to the stake. In a loud voice, Anne denied that she was a witch, admitted that she was a thief, and acknowledged that everything she did was wrong. Leonard Balzat helped her to climb the pyre, seated her on the stool among the straw, then with his own hands he abruptly strangled her. The executioner set fire to the stake. Smoke enveloped her, the crackling flames took her. The pyre burned for two days. On the third day the ashes were dispersed to the four winds. Anne de Chantraine was 21 years old when she was burned at the stake for being a witch.\nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n<ref>https://livres-mystiques.com/partieTEXTES/Etudes_satan/Satan.html#repression_appendice</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nAnne de Chantraine is a [[playable character]] in ''[[Nightmare (Atmosfear series)|Nightmare/Atmosfear]]'',<ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref><ref>[http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm Official Atmosfear website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308054916/http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm |date=March 8, 2008 }}</ref> a series of [[interactive]] [[board game]].

At the age of 21 she was burned at the stake for witchcraft in the village of Waret-la-Chaussee in Belgium France. Just before being burned she was strangled by the executioner. <ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref>\n\n==Trial of Anne de Chantraine==\n\n===26 March 1620===\nThe sergeant of the court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e arrested a young lady called Anne de Chantraine; she was 19 years old, she had come to live in the village with her father and was reputed to be a witch. Anne was a very beautiful girl, she has long red hair, people associated her hair with the flames of hell. There has been a lot of things going on in the village. The crops have been failing, the cows were not giving milk and the hens were laying sterile eggs, all this was deemed to be the workings of witchcraft. The person who denounced Anne a witch was none other than her neighbour, whose advances she refused. \n\nOn March 28, 1620, the accused was examined informally. She was brought before the mayor, Thomas Douclet, and the aldermen of the district. Fearing the instruments of the master of high works, she avoided torture by confessing freely to being a witch. She then made the most brazen avowals. \n\nBorn on March 19, 1601. in the town of Liege, to a traveling merchant father, her mother died when Anne was only 1 years old. Not long after the death of her mother, Anne's father placed her in the hospital of saint jean the Baptist in liege. Little Anne resided at the hospital for fifteen years, where she was fed and raised up, and along with other little girls was taught to read and write, also was taught about religion, and learned how to sew. Has heard that her father Jean de Chantraine is still alive and living in Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e. At the age of 17 she went to live in the house of one named Christine de la Ch\u00e9raille, to where Anne was taken and presented by a certain servant at the hospital named Catherine ; her having said that she knew how to sew well. Anne became a seamstress, her job was to sew, make new clothes, and sometimes mend old clothes. Catherine was Christine's daughter, she also had a son called Henry. One evening, Anne was asked by Christine if she wanted to go to a wedding celebration with her ? To which she agreed. And the same day, at midnight, she was woken by Christine, saying it was time to go to the party and being close to her she rubbed on some black grease down to her waist and encouraged the prisoner to do the same. To what To which she replied she didn\u2019t have scabies. Upon which Christine replied to her that she would be even more beautiful and afterwards Christine anointed her and having proffered the following words : \" kneel down, touch the ground, then straight, straight up ! \" flew up the chimney and then the prisoner did the same and was taken to a grand room where she found there to be many people amongst those other than Christine, the aforementioned CHAUMONT, with many others that she shall say upon afterwards, being all seated around a table where there were silver goblets and having taken a piece of meat in her mouth and smelling that it was foul she spat it from her mouth, saying also that the candles that were burning were black. And when the said prisoner asked of the said assembly where she had come to, it was said to her in reply that they had come to her wedding celebration, and having said \"well beautiful bride who shall be the groom,\" a young, beardless man with a black hat and cloven feet approached closely to her and asked her if she wanted to be married to him. And she having replied to him that she had not yet done any lovemaking. She replied to him that they were not accustomed to making love. And after having spent some time he asked her if he could be seated with her. She said \"Jesus Mary how have I came to do this\" ? And all of a sudden, the company and all who had been in the chamber disappeared and she found herself in a courtyard where she stayed some time. And at the breaking of the day, Christine, came to collect her and as she said that she could not go on foot, she took her under the arms and carried her to a river where she found a boat and two women who took her back and took two days to arrive in Li\u00e8ge. And after having been ill for a long time, Christine asked her if she wanted to give herself to the devil and that in doing so she would be cured. Her having refused to do so, Christine took up a knife threatening to cut her throat and after several moments, she finally gave in Christine who gave her some bread, having eaten of which she was cured. The same evening Christine, with Laurent, took her to the same room or chamber as before, or first to some handsome companions, the name of whom she has forgotten at present, the one who had feathers in his hat, the one who requested to get upon her. This which he did and has done many times since in fact every time she went to the dances that being three times a week, be it known on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Saying also that the member of her so-called demon was very cold and his semen hot, as it seemed to her, and as soon as he removed his member, under where it came out, according to her, something red has been there since. Confessing also that Laurent CHAUMONT had many affairs with her ; saying that his member was hot and twice as big as that of her demon's. During the dances here taking place there was a lame witch lying on her stomach, the whole length of the table, and with a black candle placed in the hole of her arse serving as a candlestick and that she danced around for a quarter of an hour, and when she had finished, all those of the assembly went and kissed the arse of a goat and worshipped it, each carrying a lit black candle, which they left upon the table. Then the goat burst into flames and was reduced to ashes, and these ashes were distributed amongst all the witches for their use, and just as they had been ordered to by their gallants. Saying also that the said goat, though having been burnt to ashes, stood upright as a man and distributed the said powder or ashes himself. And this done, each of the said gallants had relations with each witch just as they had had relations them with them previously at the dances. Laurent de Chamont, brother-in-law and lover of her mistress, he was the king of the witches in that region, he was the leader of the group. They entered people's houses at night by magic and stole money, jewelry, books, clothes, and food. It was Laurent de Chamont who shaved and cut hairs from his sexual organs, and armpits, placing them on the palm of his hand, he blew them into keyholes; for it was thus, by the help of the devil, that doors of houses and locks of chests were opened. But the gang of witches were finally caught. Anne denounced Christine, Laurent, Catherine, and henry witches, they were arrested and burned alive at the stake. She had resided with Christine in the space of one year, until She left Christine, because she and her children along with Laurent de Chaumont, brother-in-law of Christine were engaged in crime and they were so evil. Having left she went to live at La Seraille, a place she knew of because Christine was going to go there with a cart as she desired many goods and accoutrements belonging to the wife of the said Teraille ; the prisoner having warned the said wife which was the reason that she was received in the house having placed all her trust in the woman, the prisoner's job there was to wash the laundry, hanging the laundry out and ironing the laundry. Having left the said Teraille, she went to live with her godmother Agnes Le Pape, she lived there for the whole of winter. This Agnes gave her a bandeau. It was then that the prisoner was arrested. The prisoner's punishment was not to be tortured or executed like her accomplices, but she was to be banished from Liege. Leaving the principality of Liege, she was taken to her father, who had settled at War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, he had re married. Anne hired herself as a milkmaid to a farmer named Laurent Streignart, she milked his cows. She lived in Waret with her father for a whole year for 13 months. His new wife Marie Descry was very nice to her, Anne looked on her as the mother she never had. \n\nThese were the confessions of Anne de Chantraine. But the magistrate wanted to know more information. So that same day the tribunal decided to send one of its members to Liege to obtain more complete information. They will interrogate the prisoner to know more of her crimes and if she had any other accomplices now in Waret.\nGuilame BODART 1620\n\n===September 15, 1620===\nBecause of the number of cases under consideration, Anne's trial was put on hold. It ended up being for six months. A member of the tribunal has finally now been sent to Liege.\n\n===Enquiry held at Li\u00e8ge 15 September 1620===\nI the undersigned, deputy burgomaster of the High Court of Waret-la-Chauss\u00e9e, commissioner in this region, deputy of the Court by their ordinance laid down in certain words, containing the instruction to necessitate any enquiries or information to be given by the Mayor of Waret against, Anne de Chantraie, have, on the 15th of September 1620, left Namur and travelled to the city of Li\u00e8ge ; where upon arrival, on this day, today the 16th of the same month, after having taken leave of the parties, Mayors and deputy burgomasters of Li\u00e8ge, have provided the said necessary information as follows : \n\n1st Witness \n1.

And that instantly father MONCEAU Jesuit and his companion came in, and after the sign of the cross having been made by MONCEAU he had asked of the prisoner how she fared, remonstrating with her, and that since she had been sentenced, that she should make a good and full confession. Upon which, the prisoner replied that she was happy to die for her sins but not for being a witch, which she twice reiterated to which father MONCEAU replied to her that a witch must die as a witch, a thief as a thief. Upon these words, the undersigned left to go and find the Lord Councillor BODART, leaving the Jesuits alone with the prisoner.

She replied no. And it was asked of her why she had accused herself as a witch for? To which Anne shouted that she does not know why she told people that she was a witch. And it was asked of her where she had learned of the events and that she could not have any knowledge of them if she was not truly a witch. Said she learned by hearsay, and that she dare not die upon the false confessions of these events. And was asked of her if she was resolved to die. Replied that yes, but only for her sins. And it was asked of her if her sins were other than those legally confessed to by her. Gave no reply apart from some ambiguous ones, not wanting to reply pertinently, even when pressed.

She was stripped of her shift, and dressed in a plain shift. Afterwards she had an exorcism performed on her by priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU.\nGuillaume BODART\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===28 September 1622===\nSummoned before us{{Who|date=March 2020}} is Jacques de HERAUD prison warder in this town, the same man heard and examined in conformity with the decree of the 12th of this month in order to know if during daily chats and conversations he, his wife or servants may have had with Anne de Chantraine, prisoner, if they noticed that she was troubled of spirit or in judgement ? Upon which, he replied to us under oath that he has not had any other conversation with the prisoner, apart from on the occasions when he checked up on her in prison and brought her something to eat or had it taken by his children, who he also accompanied, if then he had asked her at any time what she had done ? To which she had always responded well regarding this, never continuing on at any time from previous discourse, he remarked that he had not now noticed if she seemed troubled, or lacking in spirit, since the exorcism. Though by the hearsay of the priest P\u00e8re MONCEAU having visited her ; the prisoner was heavy-hearted and did not know what she was saying, and that going there to see her just after the witness, he found that she spoke and conversed as well as she had always been seen to do, saying \"if they make me say something enough I shall say it\", knowing that she is a witch, but that soon afterwards she revoked it. He told us also, that the prisoner's father came to see her. Where he made it heard that he blamed Anne his daughter for her actions, saying \"look well for yourselves, swear even that she has not done so\", and at that she replied, \"let us not speak of this at all father, if I have done something to you, I asked it of you\". The jailer also added that whilst she had been in prison, she had had a quarrel with two women (his) young nieces. Those who usually brought her something to eat, and this because they had not known soon enough, or well enough, what she desired upon which occasion, she menaced them and said they will pay for it. And in fact, sometimes having been near to the prisoner, they returned sick: spending water and foul stuff from their mouths, seeming to be ill enough to die. By which the jailer was overcame by emotion and trouble and accused the prisoner and harassed and menaced her, saying to her that if she did not cure them, there would be no other executioner than he to see her killed. Upon which she replied to him that she had not done anything to them, but that she could cure them fully, and having upon the instant brought the two girls towards her, he saw that she took them by the hand and started to say words which he cannot remember and that he began to run away, leaving behind with her the two girls, and forthwith and in an instant they returned to being all changed and healed just as they had been before, as was seen by several prisoners they were completely amazed and said, \"she must be a devil herself\". And as much the two girls have since been well, apart from one who seems to still feel the effects, as there may be no doubt. The hearsay of one of his nieces was, one time when she was taking Anne's food to her, she entered the room alone where Anne was languishing. Anne was sprawled on the straw. Her head in the corner made a light spot: the clarity was dull. when she gave the prisoner her food, Anne stared at her with a dead look. It was a terrible look. It seemed to the niece an accusation and a reproach. The niece was unable to bear it. She fled the room. The jailer states that the very first day the prisoner was brought to this prison, she had words and discourse with him pertaining to her doings and acts of witchcraft, circumstances and reasons and so surely that he was shocked and amazed by it all. Saying having had many witches on his hands, as many in Fernelmont as here, and that he has never heard any of them talk as much about witchcraft, nor none before, as does the prisoner. Upon which he insists. \nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\nOf the 5th of October 1622 before LINCHAMPS and de LOFFE. \nSummoned Marie de FODAU, wife of Jacques de HERAUDE (the jailer) aged seventy-two years. She after having sworn by oath, was examined upon whether if, during daily chats and conversations with the prisoner since she was in prison, had she noticed that she was troubled of spirit and judgement? Has stated not having any other conversation with the prisoner unless it was whilst bringing her food or having food brought to her by her two nieces, during which times they often conversed with her, not noticing in any way at all that she seemed troubled in spirit or in judgement. Given that she spoke and has always spoken and replied with assurance and good judgement, as she still does daily, without noticing any change from her since she has been in prison. Upon this she insists. \nNot having signed for not knowing how to write. \nB. de LINCHAMPS 1622  J. de LOFFE 1622 \n\nOctober 17, 1622, the definitive sentence was brought in: death by fire with preliminary strangulation. On that day Anne was brought back to War\u00eat-la-Chauss\u00e9e, the place that would be fixed for her execution. During the following night L\u00e9onard Balzat and his assistant prepared the pyre, a huge heap of a hundred fagots bought in the village itself. In the centre, sheaves of straw were placed, and a hollow was made large enough in the straw to contain a stool. The prisoner had no idea that she was going to be executed the next day, nobody told her.\nJ. de LOFFE priest\n\n===October 18, 1622===\nAt dawn Anne was awakened by the jailer, the clerk of the court, and a priest, who announced the fatal news to her. She said she was glad to die for her sins, but persisted in her denial of not being a witch. She was led out. The executioner was waiting with a cart, and the condemned girl climbed into it. When they reached the end of the village where the pyre was, L\u00e9onard Balzat took Anne out of the cart and walked her over to the stake. In a loud voice, Anne denied that she was a witch, admitted that she was a thief, and acknowledged that everything she did was wrong. Leonard Balzat helped her to climb the pyre, seated her on the stool among the straw, then with his own hands he abruptly strangled her. The executioner set fire to the stake. Smoke enveloped her, the crackling flames took her. The pyre burned for two days. On the third day the ashes were dispersed to the four winds. Anne de Chantraine was 21 years old when she was burned at the stake for being a witch.\nGuillaume BODART \nJ. de LOFFE priest\n<ref>https://livres-mystiques.com/partieTEXTES/Etudes_satan/Satan.html#repression_appendice</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nAnne de Chantraine is a [[playable character]] in ''[[Nightmare (Atmosfear series)|Nightmare/Atmosfear]]'',<ref>[http://members.aol.com/LordKandar/anne.html Anne de Chantraine:  The Witch]</ref><ref>[http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm Official Atmosfear website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308054916/http://www.atmosfear.com.au/atmosfear/index.htm |date=March 8, 2008 }}</ref> a series of [[interactive]] [[board game]].
