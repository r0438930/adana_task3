In June 2011, while meeting members of the [[European Parliament]], he called Poland \"an uncivilized country\" and \"a totalitarian regime,\" and claimed that it was not ruled by Poles. The Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] protested against these statements and sent a diplomatic note to the [[Holy See]], to which Catholic religious orders, including the Redemptorists, are subject.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msz.gov.pl/Nota,dyplomatyczna,w,sprawie,wypowiedzi,ojca,Rydzyka,43881.html|title=Nota dyplomatyczna w sprawie wypowiedzi ojca Rydzyka|date=2011-07-01|access-date=2018-05-23|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701235431/https://www.msz.gov.pl/Nota,dyplomatyczna,w,sprawie,wypowiedzi,ojca,Rydzyka,43881.html|archivedate=2011-07-01}}</ref>

In 2006, the US-based [[Anti-Defamation League]] accused Rydzyk and his [[Radio Maryja]] station of antisemitism.<ref>[https://www.adl.org/blog/radio-maryja-25-years-of-anti-semitism Radio Maryja: 25 Years of Anti-Semitism - ADL website, 26 January 2017]</ref> However, Rydzyk also has Jewish backers, including Jonny Daniels, an Orthodox Jew from England who heads the \"From the Depths Foundation\" in Warsaw that highlights the heroism of Poles who rescued Jews during the war and who is a frequent guest on Rydzyk's media outlets. Daniels said that he \"feels like a part of the Radio Maryja family.\"<ref>[https://www.radiomaryja.pl/informacje/jonny-daniels-czuje-sie-czescia-rodziny-radia-maryja/ JONNY DANIELS: I FEEL PART OF THE RADIO MARYJA FAMILY - Radio Maryja 29-01-2017]</ref>

The {{nihongo|'''53rd Division'''|第53師団|Dai-gojūsan Shidan}} was an [[infantry]] [[Division (military unit)|division]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Its [[call sign]] was the {{nihongo|'''Peace Division'''|安兵団|Yasushi Heidan}}. It was formed on 16 September 1941 at [[Kyoto]] and initially assigned to [[Central District Army]]. The nucleus for the division formation was the headquarters of the [[16th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|16th division]]. The men of the ''53rd Division'' were drafted from [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]] and [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]] prefectures, belonging to [[:ja:京都師管区|Kyoto mobilization district]].

The ''53rd Division'' was initially assigned as the reserve of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] in November 1943. In December 1943, the division sailed from [[Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū|Moji]], with a stop-over in [[Kaohsiung]]<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/Kyuei_t.htm IJN KYUEI MARU: Tabular Record of Movement]</ref> and in January 1944 landed in [[Saigon]] and [[Singapore]]. On 29 April 1944, the division was assigned to the [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|33rd army]], and arrived in the northern outskirts of [[Mandalay]] on 13 May 1944.

In June 1944 the 153rd Infantry Regiment was detached to reinforce the [[33rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|33rd division]] in the ailing [[Battle of Imphal]] and was largely wiped out. The main body of the division took part in several battles against the [[Chindits]], a large British and Indian long-range penetration force which was operating north of [[Indaw]]. In late May, they defeated a Chindit brigade to clear the lines of communication to the [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th division]], but at the end of June the division was [[Battle of Mogaung|driven from Mogaung]], with 1600 casualties.<ref>Allen (1984), p.375 fn</ref>

From January 1945, the division was used as a reserve force in the [[Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay]], with the main body of the ''53rd division'' staying south of [[Mandalay]].

The {{nihongo|'''53rd Division'''|第53師団|Dai-gojūsan Shidan}} was an [[infantry]] [[Division (military unit)|division]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Its [[call sign]] was the {{nihongo|'''Peace Division'''|安兵団|Yasushi Heidan}}. It was formed on 16 September 1941 at [[Kyoto]] and initially assigned to [[Central District Army]]. The nucleus for the division formation was the headquarters of the [[16th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|16th division]]. The men of the ''53rd Division'' were drafted from [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]] and [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]] prefectures, belonging to [[:ja:京都師管区|Kyoto mobilization district]].

The ''53rd Division'' was initially assigned as the reserve of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] in November 1943. In December 1943, the division sailed from [[Moji-ku, Kitakyūshū|Moji]], with a stop-over in [[Kaohsiung]]<ref>[http://www.combinedfleet.com/Kyuei_t.htm IJN KYUEI MARU: Tabular Record of Movement]</ref> and in January 1944 landed in [[Saigon]] and [[Singapore]]. On 29 April 1944, the division was assigned to the [[Thirty-Third Army (Japan)|33rd army]], and arrived in the northern outskirts of [[Mandalay]] on 13 May 1944.

In June 1944 the 153rd Infantry Regiment was detached to reinforce the [[33rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|33rd division]] in the ailing [[Battle of Imphal]] and was largely wiped out. The main body of the division took part in several battles against the [[Chindits]], a large British and Indian long-range penetration force which was operating north of [[Indaw]]. In late May, they defeated a Chindit brigade to clear the lines of communication to the [[18th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|18th division]], but at the end of June the division was driven from [[Mogaung]], with 1600 casualties.<ref>Allen (1984), p.375 fn</ref>

From January 1945, the division was used as a reserve force in the [[Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay]], with the main body of the ''53rd division'' staying south of [[Mandalay]]. The 119th infantry regiment was attached to the 18th division for its attacks on Meiktila. After the attacks on Meiktila were broken off, the remnants of the division attempted to hold a position near [[Pyawbwe Township|Pyawbwe]] but were overrun by allied tanks.<ref>Allen (1984), p.463</ref>

Finally, after retreating south, the division suffered further heavy casualties to artillery fire and airstrikes in the [[Battle of the Sittang Bend]] in July–August 1945. The remnants of the division ceased fighting on the lower [[Sittang River]] on 17 August 1945,<ref>Yoshimi Yoshiaki, \"Grassroots Fascism: The War Experience of the Japanese People\", p.238</ref> after the [[surrender of Japan]].

In 2014 the magazine's print edition was reduced to biweekly and in 2015, to monthly; at the same time, the publication increased its web presence through a daily e-newsletter and frequent \"breaking news\" alerts. ''HM'' also published frequent special issues, such as special reports on 4K Ultra HD, Vidity, and UltraViolet; rankings of the top women in home entertainment, key digital drivers, and leading disruptors; and, in 2011, a salute to executives in home entertainment under the age of 40.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110914005477/en/Home-Media-Magazine-Presents-%E2%80%9CForty-Forty%E2%80%9D|title=Home Media Magazine Presents 'Forty Under Forty'|work=BusinessWire|date=September 14, 2011|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref>

The magazine was based in Santa Ana, California, and was a subsidiary of the Questex Media Group.

In July 2006, ''HM'' launched a consumer magazine called ''Agent DVD'', a semi-regular periodical focusing on home entertainment news. The first issue debuted at the 2006 [[Comic Con International]] in San Diego, California, and focused on titles and news that would appeal to convention-goers. The consumer magazine was later rebranded as ''Home Media Insider'' and offered only in digital form.

Additionally, ''Home Media Magazine'' presented annual awards covering the best DVD and Blu-ray products.

Questex ceased production of ''Home Media Magazine'' after the December 2017 issue.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bluetoad.com/publication/?i=462137&ver=html5&p=3|title=What a Long, Strange Trip|work=Home Media Magazine|date=December 18, 2017|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref> At the beginning of 2018, the core team responsible for producing the ''Home Media Magazine'' print and online properties returned with an independent operation called ''Media Play News'' that offers an expanded home entertainment focus from its predecessor, covering not just Blu-ray Disc and DVD but also transactional video-on-demand (both streaming and purchase) as well as subscription streaming. The new publication publishes a monthly magazine in both print and digital versions and maintains a website, a daily newsletter and breaking news alerts.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.mediaplaynews.com/redefining-home-entertainment/|title=Redefining Home Entertainment – Welcome to Media Play News!|work=Media Play News|date=January 2, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref>

The first issue debuted at the 2006 [[Comic Con International]] in San Diego, California, and focused on titles and news that would appeal to convention-goers. The consumer magazine was later rebranded as ''Home Media Insider'' and offered only in digital form.

Additionally, ''Home Media Magazine'' presented annual awards covering the best DVD and Blu-ray products.

Questex ceased production of ''Home Media Magazine'' after the December 2017 issue.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bluetoad.com/publication/?i=462137&ver=html5&p=3|title=What a Long, Strange Trip|work=Home Media Magazine|date=December 18, 2017|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref> At the beginning of 2018, the core team responsible for producing the ''Home Media Magazine'' print and online properties returned with an independent operation called ''Media Play News'' that offers an expanded home entertainment focus from its predecessor, covering not just Blu-ray Disc and DVD but also transactional video-on-demand (both streaming and purchase) as well as subscription streaming. The new publication publishes a monthly magazine in both print and digital versions and maintains a website, a daily newsletter and breaking news alerts.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.mediaplaynews.com/redefining-home-entertainment/|title=Redefining Home Entertainment – Welcome to Media Play News!|work=Media Play News|date=January 2, 2018|accessdate=January 9, 2018}}</ref>

'''WYNT''' (95.9 [[Frequency modulation|FM]]) is a Hot AC station formerly located in [[Upper Sandusky, Ohio]] now located with its studios in [[Marion, Ohio]] and its transmitter and city of license moved to [[Caledonia, Ohio]]. It broadcasts music from the 1980s through today as \"Majic 95.9\" and is part of the [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]]'s Marion cluster which includes [[WMRN (AM)|WMRN]] and [[WMRN-FM]]. Its Cleveland FM sister [[WMJI]] also uses the \"Majic\" branding for its 1960s/70s oldies station.  WYNT was also formerly an oldies station under the same branding.

The station had for years, served as a full-service adult contemporary/country music station serving Upper Sandusky, the seat of Wyandot County, as well as the communities surrounding Upper Sandusky, which is not to be confused with the town of Sandusky, Ohio...about 50 miles due north in Erie County, best known as the home of [[Cedar Point]].

==History==
According to the 1981 Broadcasting and Cable Yearbook, WYNT first went on the air on December 11, 1973 with the original call letters WYAN, licensed to Upper Sandusky.

The station was founded by Wendell A. Triplett, president of Triplett Broadcasting of [[Bellefontaine, Ohio]]; which also owned the former WTOO (now [[WBLL]]) in Bellefontaine, founded the former WPNM (currently [[WBUK]]) in Ottawa and the former WAXT (later WHTI, now [[WBKQ]]) in Alexandria, Indiana.  Triplett's brother and company vice president Robert S. Triplett served as the station's first general manager.  T.P. Communications, a company headed by Charles Earl, then acquired WYAN in October 1979.  Forest Whitehead, who would become a driving force in the station's future rescue from financial turmoil, became the station's general manager in 1980.

By 1981 the company had run into financial trouble and WYNT was silenced.  However, the license was already in the planning stages of a return to the air by the end of 1982.

[[Image:WXML-WYNT.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The original studio-office building and transmitter tower of WYAN, today used by [[WXML]], a non-profit Christian radio station, on the outskirts of Upper Sandusky.  WXML purchased this site after WYAN had fallen silent and its assets liquidated.  WYAN would return to the air as WYNT at a site about a mile west of this site later.]]

Determined to keep the radio station in local hands, then-general manager and morning DJ Forest Whitehead and a local funeral director formed an ownership group, which subsequently returned the station to the air under the name U.S. Broadcasting in 1986.  The funeral director stated he would invest in the station on the condition that it would provide the community with local high school sports game broadcasts, especially football.

According to [http://www.radio-locator.com the Radio Locator website], a construction permit has been granted to move the transmitter and city of license from Upper Sandusky to Caledonia located northeast of [[Marion, Ohio]].  Concurrent with the move, the station moved from an [[oldies]] to a [[Soft AC]] format, which has since been switched to Hot AC.  Most of the station's programming comes from Clear Channel's [[List of programming syndicated by Clear Channel#Premium Choice|Premium Choice]] Hot AC format, except for the locally originating morning show.  Clear Channel ran a similar format previously on 94.3 WDIF (now the home of [[WMRN-FM]] after [[WZCB|the original WMRN-FM]] was moved into the Columbus market).

As of November 20, 2006, this station was advertised for sale, along with other Clear Channel-owned radio stations operating out of Marion, Ohio. In May 2007, WYNT and the other stations of the Marion cluster of [[Clear Channel Communications]] was to have been sold to Florida-based [[GoodRadio.TV LLC]], but the deal has since collapsed.

Bengen''' is a retired financial adviser who first articulated the 4% [[withdrawal rate]] (\"Four percent rule\") as a [[rule of thumb]] for withdrawal rates from retirement savings in {{harvtxt|Bengen|1994}}; it is eponymously known as the \"Bengen rule\".<ref name=\"forbes\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2011/0523/investing-retirement-bill-bengen-savings-spending-solution.html |title=The Retirement Spending Solution |first=William P. |last=Barrett |date=2011-05-04 |journal=Forbes }}</ref> The rule was later further popularized by the [[Trinity study]] (1998), based on the same data and similar analysis. Bengen later called this rate the '''SAFEMAX''' rate, for \"the maximum 'safe' historical withdrawal rate\",{{sfn|Bengen|2012}} and revised it in {{harvtxt|Bengen|2006}} to 4.5% if tax-free and 4.1% for taxable.

==Withdrawal rate==
{{main|Withdrawal rate}}
Bengen conducted a number of empirical simulations of historical market behavior and concluded that a person could \"draw down\", withdraw, up to 4 percent  annually from their portfolio without fear of outliving their money. He published his research in the October 1994 issue of the ''Journal of Financial Planning''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Birken|first=Emily Guy|title=The Five Years Before You Retire: Retirement Planning When You Need It the Most|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WXXlAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA46|year=2014|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=9781440569722|page=46}}</ref> He is also the author of the book ''Conserving Client Portfolios During Retirement'' {{harv|Bengen|2006}}, where he revised and updated his analysis.

The withdrawal rate has since become a staple of the financial service industry, adopted by several major financial firms.

===Early life and education===
A native of [[Brooklyn]], born in 1947,{{efn|Turned 66 in 2013 October.<ref name=\"simonoff\"/>}} Bengen received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in [[aeronautics]] and [[astronautics]].

==The Four Percent Drawdown rule==
Based on his early research of actual stock returns and retirement scenarios over the past 75 years, Bengen found that retirees who draw down no more than ''4.2 percent'' of their portfolio in the ''initial year'', and adjust that amount  ''every subsequent year for inflation'', stand a great chance their money will outlive them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Colin|title=When Can I Tell My Boss, I Quit! : Seven Lessons for Financial and Personal Rebirth in Retirement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R_X5nGTA55UC&pg=PA122|year=2006|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595827350|page=122}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Ang|first=Andrew|title=Asset Management: A Systematic Approach to Factor Investing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztvHAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA179|year=2014|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=9780199382316|page=179}}</ref>

{{Chola history}}
'''Chola literature''', written in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], is the literature created during the period of [[Chola]] reign in [[South India]] between the 9th and the 13th centuries CE. The age of the imperial Cholas was the most creative epoch of the history of South India and was the Golden Age of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] culture.

With the revival of Chola power in the middle of the 9th century, the avenues for the literature and art broadened. For the first time in history, an imperial state encompassed the entire South India bringing with it the safety and security to the people and provided the opportunity for the people to experience cultures beyond their own. Tamil became a language of the people.

The literature during this period may be classified into religious, secular and political.

==Religious literature==
During the imperial Chola period the ''Prabhanda'' became the dominant form of poetry. The religious canons of [[Shaivism|Saiva]] and [[Vaishnava]] sects were beginning to be systematically collected and categorised. The Cholas built numerous temples, mainly for their favourite god [[Shiva]], and these were celebrated in numerous hymns.

Nambi Andar Nambi, who was a contemporary of [[Rajaraja Chola I]], collected and arranged the books on Saivism into eleven books called ''Tirumurais''. One of these include a short poem by [[Gandaraditya]], who was a Chola king during the early tenth century. The hagiology of Saivism was standardised in ''[[Periyapuranam]]'' (also known as ''Tiruttondar Puranam'') by [[Sekkizhar]], who lived during the reign of [[Kulothunga Chola II]] (1133 – 1150 CE). Sekkilar opus became the twelfth book in the Saiva canon.

Religious books on the Vaishnava sect were mostly composed in [[Sanskrit]] during this period. The great Vaishnava leader [[Ramanuja]] lived during this period. Perhaps due to the animosity of the later Cholas towards the Vaishavites, there was no much literary activity in Tamil from this sect.

One of the best known Tamil works of this period is the ''Ramavatharam'' by [[Kambar (poet)|Kamban]] who flourished during the reign of Kulottunga III. ''Ramavatharam'' is the greatest epic in Tamil Literature, and although the author states that he followed Valmiki, his work is not a mere translation or even an adaptation of the Sanskrit epic. Kamban imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time. His description of Kosala is an idealised account of the features of the Chola country.

Of the books on the [[Buddhist]] and the [[Jain]] faiths, the most noteworthy is the [[Jivaka-chintamani]] by the Jain ascetic Thirutakkadevar composed in the tenth century. This is the story of Jivaka, who was equally distinguished in war and peace, and tells the story of his youth during which he indulges in excesses and at his prime realises the hollowness of his existence and renounces everything to become a Jain ascetic.

==Secular literature==
There were a number of books written on Tamil grammar. ''Yapperungalam'' and ''Yapperungalakkarigai'' were two works on [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] by the Jain ascetic Amirtasagara. Buddamitra wrote ''Virasoliyam'',  another work on Tamil grammar, during the reign of [[Virarajendra Chola]]. ''Virasoliyam'' attempts to find synthesis between Sanskrit and Tamil grammar. Other grammatical works of this period are ''Nannul'' by Pavanandi, ''Vaccanandi Malai'' by Neminatha, and the annotations on ''[[Purananuru]]'', ''Purapporun Venbamalai'' by Aiyanaridanar.

==Political literature==
Of the works of a political nature, we find the poetic works on various Chola kings. Jayamkondar wrote ''Kalingattupparani'', a semi-historical account on the two invasion of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalinga]] by [[Kulothunga Chola I]]. Jayamkondar was a poet-laureate in the Chola court and his work is a fine example of the balance between fact and fiction the poets had to tread.  [[Ottakoothar]], a close contemporary of Kambar, wrote three ''Ulas'' on [[Vikrama Chola]], Kulothunga Chola II and [[Rajaraja Chola II]]

== Lost works==
Chola inscription mention the names of some of the literature which are currently not available to us. They were once considered worthy of public recognition, as the authors of these inscriptions assumed the readers would know them by the mere mention of their names. Of these are two works on Rajaraja Chola I, ''Rajararajesvara natakam'' and ''Rajararaja Vijayam''. The former of this was a play and was enacted at the great [[Brihadisvara Temple]] in [[Thanjavur]]. From the context in the inscriptions we learn that this was not a play on the life of the great king, but on the building of the temple.

There was a book on Kulothunga Chola I called ''Kulothunga Chola Charitai'' by Thirunarayana Bhatta. A certain Kamalalaya Bhatta wrote ''Kannivana Puranam'' and ''Pum Puliyur Natakam'', works of a popular nature. The poet was awarded some tax free gifts for his works.

It is indeed a tragedy that we are unable to trace these lost works. This is true of most of the extant literature in India, which have been preserved more by chance and accident than by deliberate act of preservation.

'''William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie, 4th Lord of Ruthven''' (c. 1541 – May 1584) was a [[Peerage of Scotland|Scottish peer]] known for devising the [[Raid of Ruthven]].

==Life and career==

In 1582 Ruthven devised and undertook the [[Raid of Ruthven]] - a plot to seize the fifteen-year-old [[James VI and I|James VI]] during the king's visit to his home at Hunting-tower Castle. Ruthven was the last-known custodian of the silver casket that contained the [[Casket letters|Casket Letters]]; letters said to have been written by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], implicating her in the murder of her husband, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/correspondenceof00bowerich/page/236 ''Bowes Correspondence''(Surtees Society, 1842)], pp. 236–7, Robert Bowes to Francis Cunningham, 8 November 1582.</ref>

In May 1584 Ruthven was detained, tried, and beheaded at [[Stirling Castle]] because of his leading involvement in the [[Raid of Ruthven]] and all of his honors were forfeited. Following his execution, his lands were divided among the king's favourites.<ref name=geni />  A letter produced in the [[posthumous trial]] of Robert Logan of Restalrig in 1609 referred to William as ''[[Greysteil]]'', a character in a popular poem of his time noted for his strength and sinister powers.<ref>''Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland'', vol. iv, p.422.</ref>

'''David Hopkins''' (born May 1, 1977) is an American comic book writer and essayist.  His works include ''[[Karma Incorporated]]'' and ''[[Emily Edison]]'' from publisher [[Viper Comics]], ''[[Astronaut Dad]]'', and a comic book adaptation of ''[[Antigone]]'' with frequent collaborator artist [[Tom Kurzanski]]. He writes a regular comic feature for [[D Magazine]] called ''[[Souvenir of Dallas]]'' with artist [[Paul Milligan]].  David is a contributor to the Smart Pop Series from [[BenBella Books]].  He is the co-host and co-producer of [[Fanboy Radio]]'s Indie Show, that showcases independent and small press comics. David lives in Arlington, Texas with his daughter Kennedy.

== Career ==
David Hopkins first professional writing was after college in 2002. Aja Jones asked him to write a stage play for her theatre troupe to be performed at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]]. The only performance of \"Space to Occupy\" was on September 14, 2002. Immediately afterwards, Hopkins began writing comics.

The first year, Hopkins wrote a five issue series ''The Insight''. Set in Dallas, Hopkins used extensive photo references from actual locations in the city. (He would later do this for [[Karma Incorporated]], which also takes place in Dallas.) Over the course of two years, there were two different artists attached to the project, which never came together and remains unpublished.

In June 2003, Hopkins wrote a 144-page graphic novel ''Astronaut Dad''—a fictional story about three astronaut families living in Houston, set in 1963. Hopkins cites this work as his \"most personally satisfying\". It is set to be published by [[Silent Devil Productions]].

Later that year, encouraged by the Isotope Awards, Hopkins self-published a mini-comic \"Some Other Day\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312100406/http://antiherocomics.com/sod_1.htm] with artist [[Brian Kelly (artist)|Brian Kelly]].

In 2004, Hopkins' first published work was a short story in [[Viper Comics]] ''[[Dead@17]]: Rough Cut''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060908160931/http://www.vipercomics.com/features_rc.asp]. Creator [[Josh Howard (comics)|Josh Howard]] invited him to contribute to this anthology. Afterwards, he also wrote short stories for ''[[Western Tales of Terror]]''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060819003606/http://hoarseandbuggy.com/shop/book.html/cat/1], ''Silent Forest Television Parody Special''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060625173744/http://silentdevil.com/silent-forest-television-parody-special.php], and ''Dead@17: Rough Cut Volume 2''.

At [[Comic Con International]] in 2005, [[Viper Comics]] released Hopkins first series ''[[Karma Incorporated]]'', illustrated by [[Tom Kurzanski]] and colored by Marlena Hall. In addition to the standard blue cover of issue one, a red exclusive [[variant cover]] was printed as part of the [[Diamond Comic Distributors Inc.|Diamond Distributors]] exclusives for that year. A second series was approved, but never completed.

Hopkins wrote ''Emily Edison'', which was published by [[Viper Comics]] in 2006, and illustrated by [[Brock Rizy]]. It was released as a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]. That summer, Rizy and Hopkins went on a month-long book tour to promote the release through California, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas.

David Hopkins is also an English III and Creative Writing teacher at [[Martin High School (Arlington, Texas)|Martin High School]] in [[Arlington, Texas]].

{{Nuclear physics|cTopic=Capturing processes}}
'''Double electron capture''' is a [[decay mode]] of an [[atomic nucleus]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Zeitschrift für Physik A |year=1994 |volume=347 |issue=3 |pages=151–160 |author1=Hirsch, M. |display-authors=etal |title=Nuclear structure calculation of β<sup>+</sup>β<sup>+</sup>, β<sup>+</sup>/EC and EC/EC decay matrix elements |doi=10.1007/BF01292371|bibcode=1994ZPhyA.347..151H }}</ref> For a nuclide (''A'', ''Z'') with number of [[nucleon]]s ''A'' and [[atomic number]] ''Z'', double electron capture is only possible if the mass of the nuclide of (''A'', ''Z''−2) is lower.

In this mode of decay, two of the orbital [[electron]]s are captured via the [[weak interaction]] by two [[proton]]s in the nucleus, forming two [[neutron]]s. Two [[neutrino]]s are emitted in the process. Since the protons are changed to neutrons, the number of neutrons increases by two, the number of protons ''Z'' decreases by two, and the atomic [[mass number]] ''A'' remains unchanged. By changing the number of protons, double electron capture transforms the [[nuclide]] into a new [[chemical element|element]].{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

Example:
{| border=\"0\"
|- style=\"height:2em;\"
|{{nuclide|link=yes|barium|130}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||2&nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron}}&nbsp;||→&nbsp;||{{nuclide|link=yes|xenon|130}}&nbsp;||+&nbsp;||2&nbsp;{{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Electron Neutrino}}
|}

== Rarity ==
In most cases this decay mode is masked by other, more probable modes involving fewer particles, such as single [[electron capture]]. When all other modes are “forbidden” (strongly suppressed) double electron capture becomes the main mode of decay. There exist 34&nbsp;naturally occurring nuclei that are believed to undergo double electron capture, but the process has been confirmed by observation in the decay of only three isotopes: [[krypton-78]], [[barium-130]], and [[xenon-124]].{{NUBASE2016|ref}}

One reason is that the probability of double electron capture is stupendously small; the theoretical predictions of [[half-life|half-lives]] for this mode lie well above 10{{sup|20}}&nbsp;years. A second reason is that the only detectable particles created in this process are [[X-ray]]s and [[Auger electron]]s that are emitted by the excited atomic shell. In the range of their energies (~1–10&nbsp;[[keV]]), the background is usually high. Thus, the experimental detection of double electron capture is more difficult than that for [[double beta decay]].

Double electron capture can be accompanied by the excitation of the daughter nucleus. Its de-excitation, in turn, is accompanied by an emission of photons with energies of hundreds of keV.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

== Modes with positron emission ==
If the mass difference between the mother and daughter atoms is more than two masses of an electron (1.022&nbsp;[[MeV]]), the energy released in the process is enough to allow another mode of decay, called '''electron capture with positron emission'''. It occurs along with double electron capture, their [[branching ratio]] depending on nuclear properties.

When the mass difference is more than four electron masses (2.044&nbsp;MeV), the third mode, called '''[[double positron decay]]''', is allowed. Only six naturally occurring nuclides{{which|date=May 2018}} can decay via these three modes simultaneously.

== Neutrinoless double electron capture ==
The above-described process with the capture of two electrons and emission of two neutrinos (two-neutrino double electron capture) is allowed by the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]: No conservation laws (including [[lepton number]] conservation) are violated. However, if the lepton number is not conserved, or the [[neutrino]] is [[Majorana fermion|its own antiparticle]], another kind of process can occur: the so-called neutrinoless double electron capture. In this case, two electrons are captured by nucleus, but neutrinos are not emitted.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Nuclear Physics B |volume=223 |issue=1 |date=1985-08-15 |df=dmy-all |pages=15–28 |title=Neutrinoless double electron capture as a tool to measure the electron neutrino mass |author1=Bernabeu, J. |author2=de&nbsp;Rujula, A. |author3=Jarlskog, C. |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(83)90089-5 |bibcode=1983NuPhB.223...15B|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/143368/files/198303194.pdf }}</ref> The energy released in this process is carried away by an internal [[bremsstrahlung]] [[gamma rays|gamma quantum]].

This mode of decay has never been observed experimentally, and would contradict the [[Standard Model]] if it were observed.

'''Wanuskewin Heritage Park''' is a non-profit cultural and historical centre of the [[First Nations]]'''.''' (In the [[Cree language|Cree]] language: '''ᐋᐧᓇᐢᑫᐃᐧᐣ''' / '''wânaskêwin''' means, \"being at peace with oneself\".)   The site is a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] due to the importance of its archaeological resources representing nearly 6000 years of the history of the [[Plains Indians|Northern Plains]] peoples.<ref>{{CRHP|15685|Wanuskewin|19 August 2012}}</ref> In 2016, it was announced that [[Wanuskewin]] intends to seek [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage]] designation,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saskatoon.ca/news-releases/city-supports-wanuskewin%E2%80%99s-unesco-aspirations-lease-deal-signed|title= City Supports Wanuskewin's UNESCO Aspirations: Lease Deal Signed|website=www.saskatoon.ca}}{{subscription needed}}</ref> which would make it the first [[List of World Heritage Sites in Canada|World Heritage Site]] in [[Saskatchewan]].

==Background==
The Saskatchewan Wanuskewin Indian Heritage Incorporated (WIHI) organization was established to present the interests of regional First Nations in planning the park.  The Wanuskewin Heritage Park Authority (WHPA) is in turn a 12 member organization responsible for the operation of the park.  The WHPA board has representation from the first nations community, [[Canada|Government of Canada]],  [[Saskatchewan|Province of Saskatchewan]], [[Saskatoon|City of Saskatoon]], [[University of Saskatchewan]] and [[Meewasin Valley Authority]] and the Friends of [[Saskatoon—Wanuskewin|Wanuskewin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wanuskewin.com/about_us/|title=About Us Page|publisher=}}</ref>

For more than 6,000 years people have gathered at this place. The migratory nations who roamed the Northern Plains came to hunt bison, gather food and herbs, and to find shelter from the winter winds. Some of the sites uncovered date back thousands of years. Wanuskewin is also the site of an arrangement of boulders called a [[medicine wheel]], of which fewer than 100 remain on the northern plains.

Wanuskewin Heritage Park is located near the west bank of the [[South Saskatchewan River]], just three kilometers north of [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan([[Help:IPA/English|/ˌsæskəˈtuːn/]]) . Within its 240 hectares (about 600 acres) there are 19 sites that represent the active and historical society of Northern Plains Peoples composed of [[Cree]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Saulteaux]], [[Atsina]], [[Sioux|Dakota]], and [[Blackfoot]]. On site there are summer and winter camp sites, [[Game drive system|bison kill]] sites, [[tipi ring]]s, and artifacts such as pottery fragments, plant seeds, projectile points, egg shells and animal bones, all within a compact area.

Wanuskewin Heritage Park officially opened in June 1992; however scientific investigations in the area began in the early 1930s. Today, the [[University of Saskatchewan]] manages an archaeological research program at Wanuskewin with active archaeological digs. The Park was designated a Provincial Heritage Property in 1984, the only such site in [[Saskatchewan]] featuring prehistoric artifacts. It was named a National Historic Site in 1986. The following year Queen [[Elizabeth II]] unveiled a dedication plaque. In 2001, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], was named ''Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk'', or, “the sun looks at him in a good way”, by an elder in a ceremony at [[Saskatoon—Wanuskewin|Wanuskewin]].

Wanuskewin's mission is to operate, on a sustainable basis, a Heritage Park under the leadership and guidance of First Nations people that contributes to increasing public awareness, understanding and appreciation of the cultural legacy of the [[Northern Plains]] First Nations people.

During the peak summer season about 40–45 people are employed at the park. The place serves as:
* a tourist attraction,

'''Wanuskewin Heritage Park''' is a non-profit cultural and historical centre of the [[First Nations]]'''.''' (In the [[Cree language|Cree]] language: '''ᐋᐧᓇᐢᑫᐃᐧᐣ''' / '''wânaskêwin''' means, \"being at peace with oneself\".)   The site is a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] due to the importance of its archaeological resources representing nearly 6000 years of the history of the [[Plains Indians|Northern Plains]] peoples.<ref>{{CRHP|15685|Wanuskewin|19 August 2012}}</ref> In 2016, it was announced that [[Wanuskewin]] intends to seek [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage designation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saskatoon.ca/news-releases/city-supports-wanuskewin%E2%80%99s-unesco-aspirations-lease-deal-signed|title= City Supports Wanuskewin's UNESCO Aspirations: Lease Deal Signed|website=www.saskatoon.ca}}{{subscription needed}}</ref> which would make it the first [[List of World Heritage Sites in Canada|World Heritage Site]] in [[Saskatchewan]].

==Background==
The Saskatchewan Wanuskewin Indian Heritage Incorporated (WIHI) organization was established to present the interests of regional First Nations in planning the park.  The Wanuskewin Heritage Park Authority (WHPA) is in turn a 12 member organization responsible for the operation of the park.  The WHPA board has representation from the first nations community, [[Canada|Government of Canada]],  [[Saskatchewan|Province of Saskatchewan]], [[Saskatoon|City of Saskatoon]], [[University of Saskatchewan]] and [[Meewasin Valley Authority]] and the Friends of [[Saskatoon—Wanuskewin|Wanuskewin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wanuskewin.com/about_us/|title=About Us Page|publisher=}}</ref>

For more than 6,000 years people have gathered at this place. The migratory nations who roamed the Northern Plains came to hunt bison, gather food and herbs, and to find shelter from the winter winds. Some of the sites uncovered date back thousands of years. Wanuskewin is also the site of an arrangement of boulders called a [[medicine wheel]], of which fewer than 100 remain on the northern plains.

Wanuskewin Heritage Park is located near the west bank of the [[South Saskatchewan River]], just three kilometers north of [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan([[Help:IPA/English|/ˌsæskəˈtuːn/]]) . Within its 240 hectares (about 600 acres) there are 19 sites that represent the active and historical society of Northern Plains Peoples composed of [[Cree]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Saulteaux]], [[Atsina]], [[Sioux|Dakota]], and [[Blackfoot]]. On site there are summer and winter camp sites, [[Game drive system|bison kill]] sites, [[tipi ring]]s, and artifacts such as pottery fragments, plant seeds, projectile points, egg shells and animal bones, all within a compact area.

Wanuskewin Heritage Park officially opened in June 1992; however scientific investigations in the area began in the early 1930s. Today, the [[University of Saskatchewan]] manages an archaeological research program at Wanuskewin with active archaeological digs. The Park was designated a Provincial Heritage Property in 1984, the only such site in [[Saskatchewan]] featuring prehistoric artifacts. It was named a National Historic Site in 1986. The following year Queen [[Elizabeth II]] unveiled a dedication plaque. In 2001, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], was named ''Pisimwa Kamiwohkitahpamikohk'', or, “the sun looks at him in a good way”, by an elder in a ceremony at [[Saskatoon—Wanuskewin|Wanuskewin]].

Wanuskewin's mission is to operate, on a sustainable basis, a Heritage Park under the leadership and guidance of First Nations people that contributes to increasing public awareness, understanding and appreciation of the cultural legacy of the [[Northern Plains]] First Nations people.

During the peak summer season about 40–45 people are employed at the park. The place serves as:
* a tourist attraction,
* human resource development agency
* scientific, cultural and educational authority
* Gathering place for present day spiritual uses such a Sweats, Pipe Ceremonies and more

'''HMS ''G2''''' was a [[British G-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War I.

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>

==Career==
Like the rest of her class, ''G2''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]]. On 27 October 1918,<ref>{{cite web|title=WWI U-boats|url=https://www.uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=78|website=uboat.net|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> she torpedoed and sank the German submarine [[SM U-78|''U-78'']] in the North Sea.<ref>{{cite web|title=German War Memorial Website|url=http://www.denkmalprojekt.org/u-boote/uboote_wk1/wk1_u78.htm|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> She survived the war and was sold for scrap in 1920.

'''HMS ''G2''''' was a [[British G-class submarine]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] during World War I.

==Description==
The G-class submarines were designed by the [[Admiralty]] in response to a rumour that the Germans were building [[double hull|double-hulled]] submarines for overseas duties. The submarines had a length of {{convert|187|ft|1|in|m|1}} [[length overall|overall]], a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|22|ft|8|in|m|1}} and a mean [[draft (ship)|draft]] of {{convert|13|ft|4|in|m|1}}. They [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{convert|703|LT|t}} on the surface and {{convert|837|LT|t}} submerged. The G-class submarines had a crew of 30 officers and [[other ranks (UK)|other ranks]]. They had a partial double hull.<ref name=gg9>Gardiner & Gray, p. 90</ref>

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|800|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[Vickers]] [[two-stroke]] [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|420|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14.25|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|9|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the G class had a range of {{convert|2400|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref name=gg9/>

The boats were intended to be armed with one [[British 21-inch torpedo|21-inch (53.3&nbsp;cm)]] [[torpedo tube]] in the bow and two [[British 18 inch torpedo|18-inch (45&nbsp;cm)]] torpedo tubes on the beam. This was revised, however, while they were under construction, the 21-inch tube was moved to the stern and two additional 18-inch tubes were added in the bow. They carried two 21-inch and eight 18-inch torpedoes. The G-class submarines were also armed with a single {{convert|3|in|cm|1|adj=on}} [[deck gun]].<ref name=gg9/>

==Career==
Like the rest of her class, ''G2''{{'}}s role was to patrol an area of the [[North Sea]] in search of German [[U-boats]]. On 27 October 1918,<ref>{{cite web|title=WWI U-boats|url=https://www.uboat.net/wwi/boats/index.html?boat=78|website=uboat.net|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> she torpedoed and sank the German submarine [[SM U-78|U-78]] in the North Sea.<ref>{{cite web|title=German War Memorial Website|url=http://www.denkmalprojekt.org/u-boote/uboote_wk1/wk1_u78.htm|accessdate=16 November 2017}}</ref> She survived the war and was sold for scrap in 1920.

'''Ms. Mystic''' is a fictional [[comic book]] [[Superhero#Female superheroes|superheroine]] created by comic book artist/writer [[Neal Adams]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/msmystic.htm |title=Ms. Mystic}}</ref> The comic published nine issues between 1982 and 1994. The character's first full appearance was in ''Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers'' #3 (March 1982), published by [[Pacific Comics]]. After Pacific published two issues, the character was published by Adams' own company [[Continuity Comics]].

==Fictional character biography==
Ms. Mystic is a genuine [[Witchcraft|witch]] who was burned at the stake during the [[Salem witch trials]] (1692–1695).  Her soul transferred to another plane, and returned to Earth in the modern world.  She is strongly concerned with environmental issues.  Mystic has long white hair down to her ankles, wears a set of golden spirals in her hair which resemble the insect-antenna of [[Fairy|faeries]], and her costume is basically a black [[spandex]] [[catsuit]] created with [[Screentone|Zip-A-Tone]].

==Powers and abilities==
Ms. Mystic is a magician; her ability to wield magic also gives her the power of flight, the ability to summon a sword of light, and undefined \"Elemental powers.\"  

She can also call upon [[Mother Nature]] for assistance. Ms. Mystic once called upon [[Mother Nature]] for help, and she responded by creating the superhero team [[Urth 4]].  Urth 4 are strongly influenced by the [[Fantastic Four]]: a group of four superheroes based on the four classical Greek elements.

==Controversy over co-creation==
In 1993 comics artist [[Michael Netzer]] sued Neal Adams for credit and misappropriation of a jointly created property, claiming that he initially conceived the character of Ms. Mystic at the behest of [[DC Comics]]' art director [[Vince Colletta]] in 1977, and went on to co-create the character with Adams.<ref>Newswatch: \"Adams Sued for $20 Million in Libel/Trademark Suit,\" ''The Comics Journal'' #162 (Oct. 1993), pp. 7–11</ref>  The suit was subsequently dismissed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] on grounds of the [[Statute of Limitations]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140304232052/http://www.earthx.org/flex/994389.html Netzer v.

[[File:Charles Rous-Marten.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Charles Rous-Marten from his Obituary in The Engineer]]'''Charles Rous-Marten''' (1842–1908) was a New Zealand journalist and British railway writer and recorder.

He was born in England. At the age of 16 his family emigrated to New Zealand, settling in [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]]. In 1864 he was appointed Meteorological Director of [[Southland Province]],<ref>''Southland Times'', 18 Oct 1864, p.5</ref> a position he held until 1870. He was employed as a journalist with ''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]]'' in Wellington about 1876 and was later editor, resigning in 1884. He was editor of ''[[The New Zealand Times]]'', also in Wellington, from 1885 to 1890. In that year he was appointed London correspondent for a number of leading New Zealand newspapers in the New Zealand Associated Press, which he continued to do until shortly before he died.<ref>''Press'', 23 Apr 1908, p.7</ref>

He took a close interest in railways over many years and in 1884 and 1885 he did a thorough study of the British rail network, involving around 40,000 miles of travel. In 1887 the results were embodied in a report to the New Zealand Minister of Public Works entitled [http://nla.gov.au/nla.obj-52019982/view;''Notes on the Railways of Great Britain''], which received favourable reviews.<ref>''Otago Daily Times'', 9 Jul 1908, p.12</ref>

He is chiefly known for recording a speed of 102.3&nbsp;mph on the 'Ocean Mail' special from Plymouth to London hauled by [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] locomotive [[GWR 3700 Class 3440 City of Truro|3440 City of Truro]] on 9 May 1904,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.heritagerailway.co.uk/news/could-it-ever-be-better-than-this |title= Could it ever be better than this? |date= 6 August 2012 |work= Heritage Railway |publisher= Mortons Media Group Ltd. |accessdate= 5 December 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20131205111428/http://www.heritagerailway.co.uk/news/could-it-ever-be-better-than-this |archivedate= 5 December 2013 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> the first time that a steam locomotive was recorded to have achieved 100&nbsp;mph.

Between the years of 1902 and 1908 he wrote a series of articles for ''[[The Railway Magazine]]'' on British locomotive practice and performance. In 1990, these were collated and reprinted in book form.<ref>{{Cite book

'''Moly''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|μῶλυ}}, {{IPA-el|mɔːly|}}) is a magical herb mentioned in book 10 of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} cites: Homer, ''Odyssey'', x. 302–306.</ref>

==In Greek myth==
In the story the Odyssey, [[Hermes]] gave this herb to [[Odysseus]] to protect him from [[Circe]]'s wizardry when he went to her palace to rescue his friends.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} These friends came together with him from the island [[Aiolos]] after they escaped from the [[Laestrygonians]]. 

According to the ''\"New History\"'' of [[Ptolemy Hephaestion]] (according to [[Photius]]) the plant mentioned by Homer grew from the blood of the [[Gigas (mythology)|Giant]]  killed on [[Circe]]'s island, by [[Helios]], father and ally of Circe. In this description the flower was white, and a derivation of the name was given, from the \"hard\" (Greek ''malos'') combat with the Giant.<ref>{{Citation|title=HELIUS : Greek Titan god of the sun | url = http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Helios.html}}</ref> 

Homer also describes Moly by saying \"The root was black, while the flower was as white as milk; the gods call it Moly, Dangerous for a mortal man to pluck from the soil, but not for the deathless gods. All lies within their power\".{{sfn|Homer|Butler|1898|loc=Book X}}
So [[Ovid]] describes in book 14 of  his [[Metamorphoses]] - \"A white bloom with a root of black\".

==Assignment to a real species==
There has been much controversy as to the identification. Philippe Champault decides in favour of the ''[[Peganum harmala]]'' (of the order Rutaceae),<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} cites: ''Phéniciens et Grecs en Italie d'après l'Odyssée'' (1906), pp.&nbsp;504 seq.</ref> the Syrian or African rue (Greek {{lang|grc|πἠγανον}}), from the husks of which the vegetable alkaloid [[harmaline]] is extracted.

Victor Bérard relying partly on a Semitic root,<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} cites: Victor Bérard ''Les Phéniciens et l'Odyssee'', ii. 288 seq.</ref> prefers the ''[[Atriplex halimus]]'' (''atriplex'', a Latin form of Greek {{lang|grc|ἀτράφαξυς}}, and {{lang|grc|ἅλιμος}}, marine), order Chenopodiaceae, a herb or low shrub common on the south European coasts. These identifications are noticed by R. M. Henry,<ref name=Chisholm-Henry>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|p=681}} cites: R. M. Henry ''Class. Rev.'' (Dec. 1906), p.&nbsp;434.</ref> who illustrates the Homeric account by passages in the Paris and Leiden [[magical papyri]], and argues that moly is probably a magical name, derived perhaps from Phoenician or Egyptian sources, for a plant which cannot be certainly identified. He shows that the \"difficulty of pulling up\" the plant is not a merely physical one, but rather connected with the peculiar powers claimed by magicians.<ref name=Chisholm-Henry/> 

Medical historians have speculated that the transformation to pigs was not intended literally but refers to [[anticholinergic]] intoxication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andreas Plaitakis & Roger C. Duvoisin |title=Homer's moly identified as ''Galanthus nivalis'' L.: physiologic antidote to stramonium poisoning |journal=[[Clinical Neuropharmacology]] |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |year=1983 |pmid=6342763 |doi=10.1097/00002826-198303000-00001}}</ref> Symptoms include [[amnesia]], [[hallucinations]], and [[delusions]] - this description of \"moly\" fits the [[snowdrop]], a [[flower]] of the region that contains [[galantamine]], which is an [[anticholinesterase]] and can therefore counteract anticholinergics.

==In other works==
*In [[Tennyson]]'s ''[[The Lotos-Eaters]]'', the moly is coupled with the [[amaranth]] (\"propt on beds of amaranth and moly\").{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}}
*[[Carl Linnaeus]] referenced the mythical plant with ''[[Allium moly]]'', the scientific name for golden garlic, though the perianth of this species is yellow, not white.
* [[Thom Gunn]] made his poem 'Moly' the title poem of his 1971 collection. See https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52888/moly
* In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' universe, moly is a powerful plant that can be eaten to counteract enchantments.
* [[John Milton]] referred to \"...that Moly/That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave\" in lines 636 and 637 of the ''Mask Performed at Ludlow Castle'', also known as [[Comus]]. See https://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/comus/text.shtml.
* In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s, [[The Farthest Shore]], the true names of the moly plant are taught to students of Roke, “Now the petal of the flower of moly hath a name, which is iebera, and so also the sepal, which is partonath; and stem and leaf and root hath each his name...\"

(Dec. 1906), p.&nbsp;434.</ref> who illustrates the Homeric account by passages in the Paris and Leiden [[magical papyri]], and argues that moly is probably a magical name, derived perhaps from Phoenician or Egyptian sources, for a plant which cannot be certainly identified. He shows that the \"difficulty of pulling up\" the plant is not a merely physical one, but rather connected with the peculiar powers claimed by magicians.<ref name=Chisholm-Henry/> 

Medical historians have speculated that the transformation to pigs was not intended literally but refers to [[anticholinergic]] intoxication.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Andreas Plaitakis & Roger C.

==In other works==
*In [[Tennyson]]'s ''[[The Lotos-Eaters]]'', the moly is coupled with the [[amaranth]] (\"propt on beds of amaranth and moly\").{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=681}}
*[[Carl Linnaeus]] referenced the mythical plant with ''[[Allium moly]]'', the scientific name for golden garlic, though the perianth of this species is yellow, not white.
* [[Thom Gunn]] made his poem 'Moly' the title poem of his 1971 collection. See https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/52888/moly
* In the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' universe, moly is a powerful plant that can be eaten to counteract enchantments.
* [[John Milton]] referred to \"...that Moly/That Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave\" in lines 636 and 637 of the ''Mask Performed at Ludlow Castle'', also known as [[Comus]]. See https://www.dartmouth.edu/~milton/reading_room/comus/text.shtml.
* In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s, [[The Farthest Shore]], the true names of the moly plant are taught to students of Roke, “Now the petal of the flower of moly hath a name, which is iebera, and so also the sepal, which is partonath; and stem and leaf and root hath each his name...\"
