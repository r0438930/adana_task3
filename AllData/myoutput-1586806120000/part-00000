Ferries operated by the [[The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority]] run regularly between Woods Hole and Martha's Vineyard.  The present Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority was formed from the New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket Steamboat Company, which in turn was a consolidation of earlier companies dating to the early 19th century, just before the railroad arrived.<ref>[[The Woods Hole, Martha%27s Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n[[Image:NobskaLight.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Nobska Light]]]]\n[[Image:Woods Hole, MA from the water.jpg|thumb|A view of [[downtown]] Woods Hole from the water, including [[Marine Biological Laboratory|MBL]] and [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|WHOI]] buildings]]\n\nMuch of Woods Hole centers around the enclosed harbor of Eel Pond. The [https://www.facebook.com/Eel-Pond-Bridge-187876691339687 Eel Pond Bridge], a [[bascule bridge|bascule]] [[drawbridge]] at the mouth of the harbor, allows boats to enter and exit the harbor according to a fixed schedule posted on the side of the bridge.\n\n[[Nobska Light]], a [[lighthouse]] at [[Nobska Point]], is operated by the [[United States Coast Guard]], and the accompanying house is the home of the commander of the Coast Guard base at Little Harbor.\n\nThe local landmark The Knob is a rocky outcropping that overlooks Buzzards Bay and Quisset Harbor. It is a part of the privately owned Salt Pond bird sanctuaries.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the Woods Hole CDP has a total area of {{convert|10.1|sqkm|order=flip}}. {{convert|5.5|sqkm|order=flip}} of it is land, and {{convert|4.6|sqkm|order=flip}} of it (45.24%) is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n== Falmouth Road Race ==\nThe annual [[Falmouth Road Race]] brings thousands of runners to Woods Hole in August each year. The route of the {{convert|7|mi|adj=on}} race starts outside the front door of the Captain Kidd tavern and follows the shore of Vineyard Sound through Falmouth to the British Beer Company, another tavern, in Falmouth Heights.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race History |url=https://falmouthroadrace.com/race-history/ |website=Falmouth Road Race |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Race Day |url=https://falmouthroadrace.com/race-day/ |website=Falmouth Road Race |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\nThe [[Woods Hole School]] is the home of the Children's School of Science. Founded in 1913, this institution (locally known as \"CSS\" and \"Science School\") provides science classes for students between 8 and 15 years old that focus on scientific investigation by observation. Students regularly visit ecosystems around the village to study the organisms in their natural environments, such as the [[Sippewissett Salt Marsh]]. The Children's School of Science draws upon the talent brought to the village by the research institutions but also educates the children of both scientists and locals. \nSome mention of the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] is made in the 1975 blockbuster film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' as having been the center of research for the fictional character Matt Hooper. Hooper is described as a [[marine biologist]], focusing on the study of sharks. Coincidentally, a [[great white shark]] was spotted some years later near Woods Hole in September 2004.\n\nWoods Hole is part of the Falmouth public school district, served by Mullen-Hall Elementary, Morse Pond Middle School, [[Lawrence Junior High School]], and [[Falmouth High School (Massachusetts)|Falmouth High School]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Falmouth Public Schools: District Information |url=http://www.falmouth.k12.ma.us/pages/Falmouth_Public_Schools/District/District_Information/District_Information |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Woods Hole students also often attend [[Upper Cape Cod Regional Technical High School]], [[Sturgis Charter Public School]], and [[Falmouth Academy]].{{Citation needed |reason=sentence inserted by Woods Hole local with knowledge, but no source for all 3 schools |date=January 2016}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=U.S. Census website}}</ref> of 2000, there were 925 people, 459 households, and 212 families residing in the CDP.
