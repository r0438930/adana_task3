The human body has four [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] (two arms and two legs), a head and a [[neck]] which connect to the [[torso]]. The body's shape is determined by a strong [[human skeleton|skeleton]] made of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]], surrounded by fat, muscle, connective tissue, organs, and other structures. The [[Vertebral column|spine]] at the back of the skeleton contains the flexible [[vertebral column]] which surrounds the [[spinal cord]], which is a collection of nerve fibres connecting the brain to the rest of the body. [[Nerve]]s connect the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body. All major bones, muscles, and nerves in the body are named, with the exception of [[anatomical variation]]s such as [[sesamoid bone]]s and [[accessory muscle]]s.\n\nBlood vessels carry blood throughout the body, which moves because of the beating of the [[heart]]. Venules and [[vein]]s collect blood low in oxygen from tissues throughout the body. These collect in progressively larger veins until they reach the body's two largest veins, the [[superior vena cava|superior]] and [[inferior vena cava]], which drain blood into the right side of the heart. From here, the blood is pumped into the [[lung]]s where it receives oxygen and drains back into the left side of the heart. From here, it is pumped into the body's largest [[artery]], the [[aorta]], and then progressively smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches tissue. Here blood passes from small arteries into [[capillaries]], then small veins and the process begins again. Blood carries [[oxygen]], waste products, and [[hormone]]s from one place in the body to another. Blood is filtered at the [[kidney]]s and [[liver]].\n\nThe body consists of a number of [[body cavity|body cavities]], separated areas which house different organ systems. The brain and [[central nervous system]] reside in an area protected from the rest of the body by the [[blood brain barrier]]. The lungs sit in the [[pleural cavity]]. The [[intestine]]s, [[liver]], and [[spleen]] sit in the [[abdominal cavity]].\n\nHeight, weight, [[Body shape|shape]] and other [[body proportions]] vary individually and with age and sex.

Some combined systems are referred to by joint names. For example, the nervous system and the endocrine system operate together as the [[neuroendocrine system]]. The nervous system receives information from the body, and transmits this to the brain via [[nerve impulse]]s and [[neurotransmitter]]s. At the same time, the [[endocrine system]] releases hormones, such as to help regulate [[blood pressure]] and volume. Together, these systems regulate the internal environment of the body, maintaining blood flow, posture, energy supply, temperature, and acid balance ([[pH]]).<ref name=UL/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Little baby from Puno.jpg|thumb|Baby being carried]]\n{{Main|Development of the human body}}\n\nDevelopment of the human body is the process of growth to maturity.

The egg then lodges in the [[uterus]], where an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develop until [[childbirth|birth]].

First, [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] is pulled through the trachea into the lungs by the [[thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] pushing down, which creates a [[vacuum]]. Air is briefly stored inside small sacs known as [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] (sing.: alveolus) before being expelled from the lungs when the diaphragm contracts again.

The human body has four [[limb (anatomy)|limbs]] (two arms and two legs), a head and a [[neck]] which connect to the [[torso]]. The body's shape is determined by a strong [[human skeleton|skeleton]] made of [[bone]] and [[cartilage]], surrounded by fat, muscle, connective tissue, organs, and other structures. The [[Vertebral column|spine]] at the back of the skeleton contains the flexible [[vertebral column]] which surrounds the [[spinal cord]], which is a collection of nerve fibres connecting the brain to the rest of the body. [[Nerve]]s connect the spinal cord and brain to the rest of the body. All major bones, muscles, and nerves in the body are named, with the exception of [[anatomical variation]]s such as [[sesamoid bone]]s and [[accessory muscle]]s.\n\nBlood vessels carry blood throughout the body, which moves because of the beating of the [[heart]]. Venules and [[vein]]s collect blood low in oxygen from tissues throughout the body. These collect in progressively larger veins until they reach the body's two largest veins, the [[superior vena cava|superior]] and [[inferior vena cava]], which drain blood into the right side of the heart. From here, the blood is pumped into the [[lung]]s where it receives oxygen and drains back into the left side of the heart. From here, it is pumped into the body's largest [[artery]], the [[aorta]], and then progressively smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches tissue. Here blood passes from small arteries into [[capillaries]], then small veins and the process begins again. Blood carries [[oxygen]], waste products, and [[hormone]]s from one place in the body to another. Blood is filtered at the [[kidney]]s and [[liver]].\n\nThe body consists of a number of [[body cavity|body cavities]], separated areas which house different organ systems. The brain and [[central nervous system]] reside in an area protected from the rest of the body by the [[blood brain barrier]]. The lungs sit in the [[pleural cavity]]. The [[intestine]]s, [[liver]], and [[spleen]] sit in the [[abdominal cavity]].\n\nHeight, weight, [[Body shape|shape]] and other [[body proportions]] vary individually and with age and sex. Body shape is influenced by the distribution of [[muscle]] and [[fat tissue]].<ref name=\"bartleby1918\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/107/|title=Anatomy of the Human Body|date=1918|publisher=Bartleby|last1=Gray|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Gray|accessdate=4 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Physiology==\n{{Main|Outline of physiology|Physiology}}\n\nHuman [[physiology]] is the study of how the human body functions. This includes the mechanical, physical, [[Bioelectromagnetism|bioelectrical]], and [[Biochemistry|biochemical]] functions of humans in good health, from [[organ (anatomy)|organs]] to the [[Cell (biology)|cells]] of which they are composed. The human body consists of many interacting systems of [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. These interact to maintain [[homeostasis]], keeping the body in a stable state with safe levels of substances such as sugar and oxygen in the blood.<ref name=UL>{{cite web |title=What is Physiology? |url=http://www.understanding-life.org/what-physiology |publisher=Understanding Life |accessdate=4 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170819102127/http://www.understanding-life.org/what-physiology |archive-date=19 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach system contributes to homeostasis, of itself, other systems, and the entire body. Some combined systems are referred to by joint names. For example, the nervous system and the endocrine system operate together as the [[neuroendocrine system]]. The nervous system receives information from the body, and transmits this to the brain via [[nerve impulse]]s and [[neurotransmitter]]s. At the same time, the [[endocrine system]] releases hormones, such as to help regulate [[blood pressure]] and volume. Together, these systems regulate the internal environment of the body, maintaining blood flow, posture, energy supply, temperature, and acid balance ([[pH]]).<ref name=UL/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Little baby from Puno.jpg|thumb|Baby being carried]]\n{{Main|Development of the human body}}\n\nDevelopment of the human body is the process of growth to maturity. The process begins with fertilisation, where an egg released from the [[ovary]] of a female is penetrated by [[sperm]]. The egg then lodges in the [[uterus]], where an [[embryo]] and later [[fetus]] develop until [[childbirth|birth]]. Growth and development occur after birth, and include both physical and psychological development, influenced by genetic, hormonal, environmental and other factors. Development and growth continue throughout life, through [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], and through [[adulthood]] to [[senility]], and are referred to as the process of [[ageing]].\n\n==Society and culture==\n===Professional study===\n[[File:Anatomical Male Figure Showing Heart, Lungs, and Main Arteries.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Anatomical study by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] ]]\n{{Further|History of anatomy|History of medicine|History of physiology}}\n\n[[Health professional]]s learn about the human body from illustrations, models, and demonstrations.
