Berkman also iterates that we often check our smartphones to relieve the social pressure we place upon ourselves to never miss out on exciting things. As Berkman says, \u201cSmartphones can be an escape from boredom because they are a window into many worlds other than the one right in front of you,\u201d helping us feel included and involved in society.<ref name=\"Baral\"/> When we do not check our mobile phones, we are unable to satisfy this \u201ccheck habit\u201d or suppress the [[fear of missing out]]''',''' leading us to feel anxious and irritable.

She says that people have become \"disconnected from what really matters, from what makes us feel nourished and grounded as human beings.\"<ref name=\"Colier\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/well/live/hooked-on-our-smartphones.html|title=Hooked on Our Smartphones|last=Brody|first=Jane E.|date=2017-01-09|newspaper=The New York Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> People's addiction to technology has deterred neurological and relationship development because tech is being introduced to people at a very young age. People have become so addicted to their phones that they are almost dependent on them. Humans are not meant to be constantly staring at a screen as time is needed to relax their eyes and more importantly their minds. Colier states: \"Without open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down\u2014it's in constant fight-or-flight mode. We're wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we\u2019re not doing it.\"<ref name=\"Colier\" />\n\nThe amount of time spent on screens appears to have a correlation with happiness levels. A nationally representative study of American 12th graders funded by the ''National Institute on Drug Abuse''  titled ''Monitoring the Future Survey'' found that \u201cteens who spent more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on non screen activities are more likely to be happy.'''\u201d''' One of the most important findings of this study is how the amount of time spent on non screen activities versus on screen activities affects the happiness levels of teenagers.<ref name=Atl/>\n\nHowever, while it is easy to see a correlation between cell phone overuse and these symptoms of depression, anxiety, and isolation, it is much harder to prove that cell phones themselves cause these issues. Studies of correlations cannot prove causation because there are multiple other factors that increase depression in people today. Although parents and other figures share these concerns, according to Peter Etchells, a psychologist at Bath Spa University in England, other possible variables must be reviewed as well. Etchells proposes two possible alternative theories: depression could cause teens to use iPhones more or teens could be more open to discussing the topic of depression in this day and age.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-investors-iphone-kids-depression-suicide-evidence|title=Apple investors say iPhones cause teen depression.

Texting and driving is banned in most of the country; new drivers in 38 states and DC are not permitted to use cell phones behind the wheel. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA (which promotes safe driving through research and education), drivers between the ages of 16 and 24 were most distracted, with women at greater risk of dying in a crash. About 20,000 of motor vehicle fatalities between 2012 and 2017 were related to distracted driving.\n\nIn the UK, the only way to currently use a mobile phone lawfully whilst driving is using a hands-free system. Any other type of phone use whilst in control of a vehicle, whether stationary or moving, carries a fine of \u00a3 1, 000 and 6 penalty points. This can be increased for serious misuse. 1 in 5 of UK residents admit to checking social media whilst being behind the wheel<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imslaw.co.uk/mobile-phone-laws-in-the-uk-being-safe-on-the-road/|title=Mobile Phone Laws In The UK - Make Sure You're Up To Date|last=Cultivate|website=IMS Law|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>.

Although brief, one driving at 55&nbsp;mph can travel the length of a football field in that time. Approximately three percent of drivers are talking on the phone when stopped at an intersection. Furthermore, five percent of drivers are on the phone at any given time. The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) reported those who used cell phones more often tended to brake harder, drive faster, and change lanes more frequently, predisposing them to crashes and near-crashes. They are also two to six times more likely to get into an accident.\n\nResearch indicates driver performance is adversely affected by concurrent cell phone use, delaying reaction time and increasing lane deviations and length of time with eyes off the road. It can also cause \"inattention blindness,\" in which drivers see but do not register what is in front of them.\n\nTeen drivers are especially at risk. About 1.2 million and 341,000 crashes in 2013 involved talking and texting, respectively. Distractions such as music, games, GPS, social media, etc., are potentially deadly when combined with inexperience. The dangers of driving and multitasking continue to rise as more technology is integrated into cars. Teens who texted more frequently were less likely to wear a seat belt and more likely to drive intoxicated or ride with a drunk driver.

Users found interventions related to information, limit, and mindfulness to be the most useful.

Second, [[social isolation]] is the lack of interaction between individuals and society. If the communications are just done by the message on the phone, the conversation with face-to-face would no more happen and the offline real-life friends would not be made or resisted anymore. People might think they are happy and satisfying their life, however, only online. Therefore, they would end up people feel lonely and isolated from the world when they are in real life. Lastly, [[Self-esteem|low self-esteem]] and [[anxiety]] are a lack of confidence and feeling negative about oneself.

For example, if the person is diagnosed with depression, they start to compare themselves with others. They might think everyone expects him or herself is happy and lucky.

Furthermore, the person will remind their selves that they might fail in everything they try because they cannot succeed.\n\nTheir suicide rate rose by 65% in those five years and the number of girls with severe depression rose by 58%.

Furthermore, Phone addiction not only makes the people who are addicted to phone isolated but also makes the people around them feel isolated.\n\n== Low self-esteem and anxiety ==\nThe other psychological symptoms that are caused by phone addiction are self-esteem and anxiety. [[Social networking service|Social Network Service]] (SNS) is one of the main streams in the world these days, therefore it dissolved a lot in daily life too. Studies have consistently shown that there are significant relationships between high extraversion, high anxiety, and teenagers\u2019 low self-esteem with mobile phone, and the stronger the young person\u2019s mobile phone addiction, the more likely is that individual to have high mobile phone call time, and excessive number of calls and text messages.<ref name=\"Hong 2152\u20132159\"/> When we communicate with friends, we use SNS or message to contact.\n\nAnxious people more easily perceive certain normal life matters as pressure. To reduce this stress might result in even more addictive behaviors and females are more likely to use mobile phones to maintain social relations.<ref name=\"Hong 2152\u20132159\"/> When we see cool things or want to show something to others, we open our Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter to post it. After, people check the reaction to their posts and care about likes, comments, and other\u2019s post, which decreases self-esteem. Furthermore, even we are with friends, we check our SNS updates instead of having a conversation. We reply to another friend\u2019s message even we are with other friend and check our phone even the notifications were not on. These connect to [[anxiety]]; caring other\u2019s reaction to show off themselves, checking phone frequently with no reason. In other words, it is called, \u201cForecast error\u201d that keeps us coming back, even though it often has a negative effect on our mental health. And this cycle sounds eerily like a classic addiction.\n\nMoreover, online, under the name anonymous, people utilize it in bad ways like the cyberbully or spread rumors. People also force their opinions and post bad comments that might hurt others too. All of these examples would result in people by having a symptom of anxiety and low self-esteem that connects to depression.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Telecommunication}}\n*[[Computer addiction]]\n*[[De Quervain syndrome]]\n*[[Digital detox]], a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic connecting devices\n*[[Digital media use and mental health]]\n*[[Internet addiction disorder]]\n*{{Section link|Mobile phone|Health effects}}\n*[[Mobile phone radiation and health]]\n*[[Mobile phones and driving safety]]\n*[[Nomophobia]], a proposed name for the fear of being out of cellular phone contact\n*[[Smartphone zombie]]\n*[[Television addiction]]\n* [[Underearners Anonymous]]\n*[[Video game overuse]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING: Are You Addicted to Your Smartphone? |publisher=Sentia Publishing |last=Roberts |first=James A. |year=2015 |isbn=978-0996300476}}\n* {{cite news|last=Richtel|first=Matt|title=It Don't Mean a Thing if You Ain't Got That Ping|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/weekinreview/22richtel.html|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 April 2007}} {{open access}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Takao |first1=Motoharu |last2=Takahashi |first2=Susumu |last3=Kitamura |first3=Masayoshi |title=Addictive Personality and Problematic Mobile Phone Use |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=October 2009 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=501\u2013507 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2009.0022 |pmid=19817562 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fea84a81afb30758b29218dd44e54762fa881cd4 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=S\u00e1nchez-Mart\u00ednez |first1=Mercedes |last2=Otero |first2=Angel |title=Factors Associated with Cell Phone Use in Adolescents in the Community of Madrid (Spain) |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=April 2009 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=131\u2013137 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2008.0164 |pmid=19072078 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ac1971162d061f2e6da497d407cf65c80185c2c }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Mark |title=Does Internet and Computer 'Addiction' Exist?

Berkman also iterates that we often check our smartphones to relieve the social pressure we place upon ourselves to never miss out on exciting things. As Berkman says, \u201cSmartphones can be an escape from boredom because they are a window into many worlds other than the one right in front of you,\u201d helping us feel included and involved in society.<ref name=\"Baral\"/> When we do not check our mobile phones, we are unable to satisfy this \u201ccheck habit\u201d or suppress the [[fear of missing out]]''',''' leading us to feel anxious and irritable.

Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, there is a correlation between mobile phone overuse and depression.

People have become so addicted to their phones that they are almost dependent on them. Humans are not meant to be constantly staring at a screen as time is needed to relax their eyes and more importantly their minds. Colier states: \"Without open spaces and downtime, the nervous system never shuts down\u2014it's in constant fight-or-flight mode. We're wired and tired all the time. Even computers reboot, but we\u2019re not doing it.\"<ref name=\"Colier\" />\n\nThe amount of time spent on screens appears to have a correlation with happiness levels. A nationally representative study of American 12th graders funded by the ''National Institute on Drug Abuse''  titled ''Monitoring the Future Survey'' found that \u201cteens who spent more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on non screen activities are more likely to be happy.'''\u201d''' One of the most important findings of this study is how the amount of time spent on non screen activities versus on screen activities affects the happiness levels of teenagers.<ref name=Atl/>\n\nHowever, while it is easy to see a correlation between cell phone overuse and these symptoms of depression, anxiety, and isolation, it is much harder to prove that cell phones themselves cause these issues. Studies of correlations cannot prove causation because there are multiple other factors that increase depression in people today. Although parents and other figures share these concerns, according to Peter Etchells, a psychologist at Bath Spa University in England, other possible variables must be reviewed as well. Etchells proposes two possible alternative theories: depression could cause teens to use iPhones more or teens could be more open to discussing the topic of depression in this day and age.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/apple-investors-iphone-kids-depression-suicide-evidence|title=Apple investors say iPhones cause teen depression.

Texting and driving is banned in most of the country; new drivers in 38 states and DC are not permitted to use cell phones behind the wheel. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA (which promotes safe driving through research and education), drivers between the ages of 16 and 24 were most distracted, with women at greater risk of dying in a crash. About 20,000 of motor vehicle fatalities between 2012 and 2017 were related to distracted driving.\n\nA text can take one's eyes off the road for an average of five seconds. Although brief, one driving at 55&nbsp;mph can travel the length of a football field in that time. Approximately three percent of drivers are talking on the phone when stopped at an intersection. Furthermore, five percent of drivers are on the phone at any given time. The Insurance Institute of Highway Safety (IIHS) reported those who used cell phones more often tended to brake harder, drive faster, and change lanes more frequently, predisposing them to crashes and near-crashes. They are also two to six times more likely to get into an accident.\n\nResearch indicates driver performance is adversely affected by concurrent cell phone use, delaying reaction time and increasing lane deviations and length of time with eyes off the road. It can also cause \"inattention blindness,\" in which drivers see but do not register what is in front of them.\n\nTeen drivers are especially at risk. About 1.2 million and 341,000 crashes in 2013 involved talking and texting, respectively. Distractions such as music, games, GPS, social media, etc., are potentially deadly when combined with inexperience. The dangers of driving and multitasking continue to rise as more technology is integrated into cars. Teens who texted more frequently were less likely to wear a seat belt and more likely to drive intoxicated or ride with a drunk driver.

Users found interventions related to information, limit, and mindfulness to be the most useful.

It is the common word related to the mental problem that everyone might have heard. It is the symptom that people possess a lot offline, however, the number of people gets in online these days. Second, [[social isolation]] is the lack of interaction between individuals and society. If the communications are just done by the message on the phone, the conversation with face-to-face would no more happen and the offline real-life friends would not be made or resisted anymore. People might think they are happy and satisfying their life, however, only online. Therefore, they would end up people feel lonely and isolated from the world when they are in real life. Lastly, [[Self-esteem|low self-esteem]] and [[anxiety]] are a lack of confidence and feeling negative about oneself. People check the reaction to their posts and care about likes, comments, and other\u2019s post, which decreases self-esteem.

For example, if the person is diagnosed with depression, they start to compare themselves with others. They might think everyone expects him or herself is happy and lucky. Then, the person will start to curse all the people and hate him or herself. Furthermore, the person will remind their selves that they might fail in everything they try because they cannot succeed.\n\nTheir suicide rate rose by 65% in those five years and the number of girls with severe depression rose by 58%.

People might think they are happy and satisfying their life, however, only online. Therefore, they would end up people feel lonely and isolated from the world when they are in real life. Furthermore, Phone addiction not only makes the people who are addicted to phone isolated but also makes the people around them feel isolated.\n\n== Low self-esteem and anxiety ==\nThe other psychological symptoms that are caused by phone addiction are self-esteem and anxiety. [[Social networking service|Social Network Service]] (SNS) is one of the main streams in the world these days, therefore it dissolved a lot in daily life too. Studies have consistently shown that there are significant relationships between high extraversion, high anxiety, and teenagers\u2019 low self-esteem with mobile phone, and the stronger the young person\u2019s mobile phone addiction, the more likely is that individual to have high mobile phone call time, and excessive number of calls and text messages.<ref name=\"Hong 2152\u20132159\"/> When we communicate with friends, we use SNS or message to contact.\n\nAnxious people more easily perceive certain normal life matters as pressure. To reduce this stress might result in even more addictive behaviors and females are more likely to use mobile phones to maintain social relations.<ref name=\"Hong 2152\u20132159\"/> When we see cool things or want to show something to others, we open our Snapchat, Instagram, or Twitter to post it. After, people check the reaction to their posts and care about likes, comments, and other\u2019s post, which decreases self-esteem. Furthermore, even we are with friends, we check our SNS updates instead of having a conversation. We reply to another friend\u2019s message even we are with other friend and check our phone even the notifications were not on. These connect to [[anxiety]]; caring other\u2019s reaction to show off themselves, checking phone frequently with no reason. In other words, it is called, \u201cForecast error\u201d that keeps us coming back, even though it often has a negative effect on our mental health. And this cycle sounds eerily like a classic addiction.\n\nMoreover, online, under the name anonymous, people utilize it in bad ways like the cyberbully or spread rumors. People also force their opinions and post bad comments that might hurt others too. All of these examples would result in people by having a symptom of anxiety and low self-esteem that connects to depression.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Telecommunication}}\n*[[Computer addiction]]\n*[[De Quervain syndrome]]\n*[[Digital detox]], a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic connecting devices\n*[[Digital media use and mental health]]\n*[[Internet addiction disorder]]\n*{{Section link|Mobile phone|Health effects}}\n*[[Mobile phone radiation and health]]\n*[[Mobile phones and driving safety]]\n*[[Nomophobia]], a proposed name for the fear of being out of cellular phone contact\n*[[Smartphone zombie]]\n*[[Television addiction]]\n* [[Underearners Anonymous]]\n*[[Video game overuse]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book |title=TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING: Are You Addicted to Your Smartphone? |publisher=Sentia Publishing |last=Roberts |first=James A. |year=2015 |isbn=978-0996300476}}\n* {{cite news|last=Richtel|first=Matt|title=It Don't Mean a Thing if You Ain't Got That Ping|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/weekinreview/22richtel.html|accessdate=3 December 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 April 2007}} {{open access}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Takao |first1=Motoharu |last2=Takahashi |first2=Susumu |last3=Kitamura |first3=Masayoshi |title=Addictive Personality and Problematic Mobile Phone Use |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=October 2009 |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=501\u2013507 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2009.0022 |pmid=19817562 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/fea84a81afb30758b29218dd44e54762fa881cd4 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=S\u00e1nchez-Mart\u00ednez |first1=Mercedes |last2=Otero |first2=Angel |title=Factors Associated with Cell Phone Use in Adolescents in the Community of Madrid (Spain) |journal=CyberPsychology & Behavior |date=April 2009 |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=131\u2013137 |doi=10.1089/cpb.2008.0164 |pmid=19072078 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3ac1971162d061f2e6da497d407cf65c80185c2c }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Griffiths |first1=Mark |title=Does Internet and Computer 'Addiction' Exist?
