He later studied in Germany, and worked as a dramatic critic in [[New York City]] from 1890 to 1897. Like fellow-aesthete and good friend [[James Huneker]], he helped bring [[fin-de-si\u00e8cle]] French authors to the attention of the American public. He also wrote a study on the ego entitled ''the Ego Book: a Book of Selfish Ideals'' (1914). A study of French authors with ties to the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist movement]] was published in 1913, entitled ''French Portraits: Being Appreciations of the Writers of Young France''. From 1895 to 1899, he co-edited the periodical ''M'lle New York'' with Huneker. Described as \"a highly idiosyncratic blend of serious analyses and presentations of European Symbolist literature and thought with buffoonery and incessant anti-philistinism\", it quickly became a manifesto for their cultural ideals.<ref>''The Symbolist Prints of Edvard Munch: the Vivian and David Campbell Collection.''
