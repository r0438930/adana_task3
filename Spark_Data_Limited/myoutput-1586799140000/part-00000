They discuss the day's latest headlines, while usually tying in the show's theme of motherhood or at least parenthood, such as by giving their opinions \"through the eyes of mothers.\" The show also contains celebrity interviews and segments for mothers and parents in general.\n\n''The Talk'' is broadcast before a live studio audience at the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, California]] each Monday through Friday at 11:00 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and airs live on most CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States]] at 2:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The program is broadcast on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere from the [[Mountain Time Zone]] westward. The Friday shows are recorded on Thursday afternoons at 1:00&nbsp;pm PT for broadcast the next day. Friday shows are taped before the same studio audience in attendance for the earlier live Thursday broadcast.\n\n==Format==\n''The Talk'' has a format similar in style to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.  The opening segment of the broadcast is known as \"Everybody Talks\" and usually runs a combined 12 to 25 minutes over multiple segments, depending on the number of stories featured and the number of guests.  It is followed by topical discussion segments, involves the five-female host panel discussing current news items, typically focusing on [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines, offbeat stories, and celebrity news. The program also actively incorporates [[social media]] to allow viewers to provide their opinions on the stories discussed through [[Twitter]] (using the hashtag #EverybodyTalks, or alternately the abbreviated #EVBT).  In season five, the program began allowing viewers to use [[Instagram]] to record and upload videos using the aforementioned hashtags, with one or two videos being selected to air on the live broadcasts.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS's \"The Talk\" Kicks Off Season 5 Monday, Sept. 8!|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/09/02/cbss-the-talk-kicks-off-season-5-monday-sept-8-45010/20140902cbs01/|publisher=CBS|via=The Futon Critic|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn most editions, the \"Top Talker\" serves as the final segment of the topical discussion, featuring a rotating set of contributors - most of whom are correspondents/hosts of entertainment-related newsmagazine programs or magazines or hosts of local or syndicated radio programs - providing detailed analysis of a single trending, usually celebrity-related, story. Following the \"Everybody Talks\" segment, all five hosts interview one or two featured celebrity guests; most of these interviews are conducted at the set's roundtable. Musical performances are also occasionally included.\n\nThe show also regularly has a cooking segment two to four times each week, with two of the panelists - rotating between any combination of Chen, Underwood, Gilbert, or Osbourne - assisting in the preparation of the featured recipes with the guest chef. Product giveaways are also done once per week, as part of a segment showcasing fashion/beauty products and electronics that are given away to studio audience members for attending the show, and are often tied into online [[Deal of the day|flash sale]]s where the viewing audience can purchase the products offered at a reduced price.\n\nTo conclude the show through season 9, each episode signed-off with one of the co-hosts, primarily the moderator, saying \"Remember, it's always the right time to have ''The Talk!''\". With the start of season 10 the sign-off \"Let's Talk Tomorrow!\" or \"Let's Talk Later\" (used on Friday) is used.\n\n==Development==\nIn December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' after 54 years, and was looking for a program to replace the long-running [[soap opera]] in its time slot. Sara Gilbert approached CBS about producing a pilot that would feature six women talking about the day's headlines with opinions told through \"the eyes of mothers.\"<ref name = Mothers />\n\nOn July 21, 2010, CBS announced that it had picked up the show (by then, given the title ''The Talk''), beating out several other contenders, including a cooking show featuring [[Emeril Lagasse]]; ''Say It Now'', a talk show featuring [[Valerie Bertinelli]] and [[Rove McManus]]; and a revamped version of the classic game show ''[[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]'', hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref name=Mothers>{{cite web|title=Sara Gilbert talk show to replace veteran CBS soap|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/21/us-gilbert-idUSTRE66K5XA20100721|author=Georg Szalai|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=September 19, 2012|date=July 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the 4 weeks prior to the show's debut, new episodes of ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', as well as repeats of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', aired in the timeslot vacated by ''As the World Turns''.\n\n==Co-hosts==\n\n=== Timeline ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width:\"100%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Co-host !!  colspan=10 style=text-align:center; | Seasons\n|-\n!! width=\"80\" | 1 !! width=\"80\" | 2 !! width=\"80\" | 3 !! width=\"80\" | 4 !! width=\"80\" | 5 !! width=\"80\"| 6 !! width=\"80\" | 7 !! width=\"80\" |8 !! width=\"80\" | 9 !! width=\"80\" | 10\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Julie Chen]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sara Gilbert]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sharon Osbourne]]}} || colspan=\"10\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marissa Jaret Winokur]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Holly Robinson Peete]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Leah Remini]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Aisha Tyler]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"6\" {{yes|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{n/a|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Sheryl Underwood]]}} || colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"9\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Eve (rapper)|Eve]]}} || colspan=\"7\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"3\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Carrie Ann Inaba]]}} || colspan=\"8\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"2\" {{yes|}}\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Marie Osmond]]}} || colspan=\"9\" {{n/a|}} || colspan=\"1\" {{yes|}}\n|}\n\n===Season 1===\nThe original panel consisted of [[Sara Gilbert]], known for her role on the TV series ''[[Roseanne]]''; [[Holly Robinson Peete]], known for her roles on the TV series ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[Hangin' with Mr. Cooper]]''; [[Leah Remini]], known for her role as Carrie Heffernan in the 1998\u20132007 CBS sitcom ''[[The King of Queens]]''; ''[[Big Brother (U.S.)|Big Brother]]'' hostess [[Julie Chen]]; and former talk show hostess/''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|X Factor]]'' judge [[Sharon Osbourne]], the wife of rocker [[Ozzy Osbourne]].

They discuss the day's latest headlines, while usually tying in the show's theme of motherhood or at least parenthood, such as by giving their opinions \"through the eyes of mothers.\" The show also contains celebrity interviews and segments for mothers and parents in general.\n\n''The Talk'' is broadcast before a live studio audience at the [[CBS Studio Center]] in [[Studio City, California]] each Monday through Friday at 11:00 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], and airs live on most CBS [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]] in the [[Eastern United States|Eastern]] and [[Central United States]] at 2:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. The program is broadcast on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] elsewhere from the [[Mountain Time Zone]] westward. The Friday shows are recorded on Thursday afternoons at 1:00&nbsp;pm PT for broadcast the next day. Friday shows are taped before the same studio audience in attendance for the earlier live Thursday broadcast.\n\n==Format==\n''The Talk'' has a format similar in style to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''.  The opening segment of the broadcast is known as \"Everybody Talks\" and usually runs a combined 12 to 25 minutes over multiple segments, depending on the number of stories featured and the number of guests.  It is followed by topical discussion segments, involves the five-female host panel discussing current news items, typically focusing on [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines, offbeat stories, and celebrity news. The program also actively incorporates [[social media]] to allow viewers to provide their opinions on the stories discussed through [[Twitter]] (using the hashtag #EverybodyTalks, or alternately the abbreviated #EVBT).  In season five, the program began allowing viewers to use [[Instagram]] to record and upload videos using the aforementioned hashtags, with one or two videos being selected to air on the live broadcasts.<ref>{{cite press release|title=CBS's \"The Talk\" Kicks Off Season 5 Monday, Sept. 8!|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2014/09/02/cbss-the-talk-kicks-off-season-5-monday-sept-8-45010/20140902cbs01/|publisher=CBS|via=The Futon Critic|date=September 2, 2014|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn most editions, the \"Top Talker\" serves as the final segment of the topical discussion, featuring a rotating set of contributors - most of whom are correspondents/hosts of entertainment-related newsmagazine programs or magazines or hosts of local or syndicated radio programs - providing detailed analysis of a single trending, usually celebrity-related, story. Following the \"Everybody Talks\" segment, all five hosts interview one or two featured celebrity guests; most of these interviews are conducted at the set's roundtable. Musical performances are also occasionally included.\n\nThe show also regularly has a cooking segment two to four times each week, with two of the panelists - rotating between any combination of Chen, Underwood, Gilbert, or Osbourne - assisting in the preparation of the featured recipes with the guest chef.
