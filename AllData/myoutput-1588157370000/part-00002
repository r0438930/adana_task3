It represents the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Hampshire]]. Hampshire teams formed by earlier organisations, principally the [[Hambledon Club]], always had first-class status and the same applied to the county club when it was founded in 1863. Because of poor performances for several seasons until 1885, Hampshire then lost its status for nine seasons until it was invited into the [[County Championship]] in 1895, since when the team have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England.<ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |first= |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}</ref> Hampshire originally played at the [[Antelope Ground]], [[Southampton]] until 1885 when they relocated to the [[County Ground, Southampton]] until 2000, before moving to the purpose-built [[Rose Bowl (cricket ground)|Rose Bowl]] in West End, which is in the Borough of [[Eastleigh]]. The club has twice won the County Championship, in the [[1961 English cricket season|1961]] and [[1973 English cricket season|1973]] seasons.\n\nHampshire played their first [[list A cricket|one-day match]] in the [[1963 Gillette Cup]], but did not win their first one-day silverware until 1975 when they won the [[Sunday League (cricket)|Sunday League]] which it won twice more, in 1978 and 1986.  It has twice won the [[Benson & Hedges Cup]], in 1988 and 1991; the [[Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy]] once in 2005 and the [[Friends Provident Trophy]] once in 2009.  Having first played [[Twenty20 cricket]] in 2003, Hampshire won the [[Friends Provident t20]] in 2010.  The County Championship was restructured in 2000, and at the end of the 2002 Hampshire was relegated for the first time. The club remained in the second division for three seasons and since 2004 had competed in the top tier.  However, the club was relegated once more in 2011. The club won both the [[Friends Life t20]] and [[ECB 40]] in 2012, but it wasn't until 2014 before they were promoted to the first division again. They narrowly avoided relegation in 2015 before being relegated again in 2016, only to be reprieved after [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] were relegated after taking ECB sanctions to secure their future.\n\n[[Phil Mead]] is the club's leading run-scorer with 48,892&nbsp;runs in 700&nbsp;matches for Hampshire between 1905 and 1936. Fast bowler [[Derek Shackleton]] took 2,669&nbsp;wickets in 583&nbsp;first-class matches between 1948 and 1969 which remains a club record.  [[Alec Kennedy]], whose career lasted from 1907 to 1936, was the first player to score 10,000&nbsp;runs and take 1,000&nbsp;wickets for Hampshire.  [[Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie]] was both Hampshire last amateur captain and first professional captain.\n\n==Honours==\n{{See also|List of the competitive honours won by county cricket clubs in England and Wales}}\n[[File:DominicCork.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Dominic Cork (left) and Sean Ervine hold aloft the [[2009 Friends Provident Trophy]]]]\n===First XI honours===\n* '''Champion County'''{{#tag:ref|An unofficial seasonal title sometimes proclaimed by consensus of media and historians prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship was constituted.

If authentic, this is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire.  But, with the sport having originated in Saxon or Norman times on the [[Weald]], it is likely to  have reached what is now modern Hampshire long before 1647.  In 1680, lines written in an old Bible invite \"All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets\".  [[Marden, West Sussex|Marden]] is in [[Sussex]], north of [[Chichester]], and close to [[Hambledon, Hampshire|Hambledon]], which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire.  Hampshire is used in a team name for the first time in August 1729, when a combined Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex XI played against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]].\n\n===Hambledon and after===\n[[File:HambledonCCPitch.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Broadhalfpenny Down]], the original ground of the Hambledon Club]]\n{{For|information about Hampshire county teams before the formation of Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire county cricket teams}}\nThe origin of the legendary [[Hambledon Club]] is lost.  There remains no definite knowledge of Hambledon cricket before 1756, when its team had gained sufficient repute to be capable of attempting three matches against [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]], itself a famous club since the 1720s if not earlier. Hambledon had presumably earned recognition as the best parish team in Hampshire, but no reports of their local matches have been found. We do not know when the Hambledon Club was founded and it seems likely that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, although there may well have been a patron involved.  The Sussex v Hampshire match in June 1766 is the earliest reference to Hampshire as an individual county team.  Whether the Hambledon Club was involved is unrecorded but presumably it was. Some historians believe it was at about this time that the club, as distinct from a parish organisation, was founded.  The Hambledon Club was in many respects a Hampshire county club for it organised Hampshire matches, although it was a multi-functional club and not dedicated to cricket alone. Its membership attracted large numbers of sporting gentry and it dominated the sport, both on and off the field, for about thirty years until the formation of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1787. Hambledon produced some legendary Hampshire players including master [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] and the two great fast bowlers [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]] and [[David Harris (Hambledon cricketer)|David Harris]].  Following the demise of the Hambledon Club towards the end of the 18th century, Hampshire continued to be recognised as a first-class team into the nineteenth century but, after the 1828 season, they had long spells without any first-class matches until the county club was founded in 1864. The county played some first-class fixtures during 1842 to 1845 and one match versus [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] in 1861 but was otherwise outside cricket\u2019s mainstream through 1829 to 1863.\n\n===Origin of club===\n[[File:James Southerton.JPG|thumb|right|200px| James Southerton, who played in the first ever [[Test cricket|Test match]] ]]\nHampshire County Cricket Club was founded on 12 August 1863<ref>''Guinness Book of Cricket Facts and Feats''</ref> and played its first first-class match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at the [[Antelope Ground]], [[Southampton]] on 7 and 8 July 1864. Sussex won by 10 wickets with [[James Lillywhite]] claiming ten wickets in the match for 80 runs, including his 100th career wicket.<ref>{{cite web|date=7 July 1864 |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1333.html |title=Hampshire v Sussex, 1864 |publisher=cricketarchive.com |accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref> Hampshire was recognised as a first-class team from 1864 to 1885. In 1886, Hampshire lost its status after years of difficult circumstances and poor results. The team did play against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and Sussex in 1886 but the matches were considered minor standard. Hampshire recovered first-class status from the beginning of the [[1895 County Championship]] season when the team was invited to join the now official [[County Championship]]. They finished the season in tenth place, sixteen points behind winners Surrey.<ref>{{cite web| year= 1895| url= http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1895.html| title= 1895 County Championship table| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=19 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:CB Fry batting.jpg|thumb|left|200px| C.B. Fry, who represented Hampshire between 1909\u20131921]]\nBetween 1900 and 1905, Hampshire were almost continuously struggling as their key officer-batsmen, [[Robert Poore|Major Poore]] and [[Teddy Wynyard|Captain Wynyard]] were faced with either moving to South Africa or increased military duties at home from the [[Boer War]]. The club finished last or equal last in 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905, failing to win a single game in the first of those seasons; however in 1901, with the temporary acquisition of [[J. G. Greig|Captain Greig]] from India and the qualification of [[Charlie Llewellyn]], Hampshire won as many games as it lost. From 1906 onwards, with the qualification of [[Phil Mead]], [[Jack Newman (English cricketer)|Jack Newman]] and later [[George Brown (cricketer, born 1887)|George Brown]], Hampshire became a much more competitive side, though not until 1910 did they win as many games as they lost in a season.\n\nThe period from 1912 to 1926, though they never got near [[County Championship]] honours, was to be the most successful for a long time in Hampshire\u2019s history: in those eleven seasons they won 98 and lost 96 of 292 games \u2013 only once otherwise until 1954 did they win more games than they lost.<ref>Wynne-Thomas, Peter; ''The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records''; pp. 55\u201359 {{ISBN|0-7270-1868-X}}</ref> Mead, Brown, Kennedy and Newman were in the prime during this period, and they had the services of [[Lionel Tennyson, 3rd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] who captained the side from 1919\u20131932 as well as captaining the England team in three Tests, and the occasional aid of many other amateurs including the great [[C. B. Fry]], who averaged an amazing 102 in seven games during [[1912 English cricket season|1912]]. In 1922, Hampshire won one of the most remarkable victories in County Championship history when, they defeated [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] by 155 runs after having followed on when dismissed for just 15. They scored 521 after being invited to bat again, set Warwickshire 314 to win and bowled them out for 158. Brown, with 172, and Livsey who scored 110* at number 10, were the heroes.<ref>{{cite web| url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Hampshire/Scorecards/10/10456.html| title= Warwickshire v Hampshire, 1922 (scorecard)| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With [[Stuart Boyes]] and [[Lofty Herman]] not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from [[1929 English cricket season|1929]] onwards. In 1937 [[Dick Moore (cricketer)|Dick Moore]] set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at [[Dean Park Cricket Ground]] in [[Bournemouth]]. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 [[Boundary (cricket)|fours]] and three sixes.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Hampshire/Scorecards/16/16325.html| title= Hampshire v Warwickshire, 1937 (scorecard)| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> After [[World War II]], [[Derek Shackleton]] became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by [[Victor Cannings]], but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and [[Peter Sainsbury]] around 100, with [[Roy Marshall]] was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time.\n\nThe following years were mixed: a rise to second in 1958 with [[Malcolm Heath]] replacing Cannings as Shackleton\u2019s partner was followed by two disappointing years before Hampshire won the 1961 County Championship, their first ever County Championship success, finishing the season with 268 points, 18 ahead of Yorkshire. Hampshire won 19 of their 32 matches, losing only seven matches all season.<ref>{{cite web| date= 17 October 2009  | url=  https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1961.html| title= 1961 County Championship Table| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> The club were led by [[Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie]] with Marshall scoring the most runs for the club with 2,455. [[Derek Shackleton]] took the most wickets for the club with 153, and [[Butch White]]\u2019s tearaway speed was equally dangerous in a dry summer.\n\nAgain, however, Hampshire were disappointing until [[Barry Richards]] joined the county in 1968, when they rose from tenth to fifth in the Championship and established themselves as a power in limited-overs cricket. [[Bob Cottam]] was the second-highest first-class wicket-taker in 1968 and the highest in 1969, but did not maintain this excellence before joining [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] and in 1970 and 1971 Hampshire fell to mid-table. In the 1973 County Championship Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time, winning the competition by 31 points from Surrey.<ref>{{cite web| date= 17 October 2009  | url=  https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1973.html| title= 1973 County Championship Table| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> The club won 10 of their 20 matches and drew the other 10. During this season they were led by [[Richard Gilliat]] with [[Gordon Greenidge]] scoring the most runs for the club with 1,620. [[Bob Herman]] and [[Mike Taylor (cricketer, born 1942)|Mike Taylor]] both took 63 wickets. This remains Hampshire's last success in the tournament.  In 1979 West Indian [[Malcolm Marshall]], widely regarded as one of the best bowlers to grace the game joined the club. This was to be the start of a 14-year stay with the club. During that time Marshall would go on to take 824 first-class wickets at an average of 18.64<ref>{{cite web| date= 20 October 2009 | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/1/1571/f_Bowling_by_Team.html| title= Malcolm Marshall first-class breakdown by team| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> and 239 wickets at 24.88 in one-day cricket.<ref>{{cite web| date= 20 October 2009 | url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Players/1/1571/a_Bowling_by_Team.html| title= Malcolm Marshall List A breakdown by team| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> 1984 also saw the last game of [[Venezuela]]n  captain [[Nick Pocock]] ([[Maracaibo]], 1951) and the  arrival of another West Indian, [[Cardigan Connor]] who would spend 14 years with the club.

The 1990s brought about further success in the first half of the decade, and later struggles in the latter half. In the 1991 County Championship season Hampshire won the [[1991 NatWest Trophy|NatWest Trophy]], defeating [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] by 4 wickets, with [[Shaun Udal]] claiming the man of the match award. This was the clubs first [[List-A cricket|one day]] honour in this competition. Hampshire again repeated their 1988 success in the Benson & Hedges Cup by winning the 1992 competition. In the final at [[Lord's]] they beat [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] by 41 runs, including 90 runs from [[Robin Smith (cricketer)|Robin Smith]] and three wickets each from [[Malcolm Marshall]] and Shaun Udal.  This marked Hampshire's second success in the competition. In 1996 Malcolm Marshall returned to coach the club. In 1997 work begun on Hampshire's long-awaited new ground. The realisation of this move almost led the club to financial ruin, as encouragement from financial partners [[Sport England]] and the hiring of architect [[Sir Michael Hopkins]] had led the then part-time voluntary committee running the club to lose control of the budget.<ref>{{cite web  | date= 17 October 2009  | url= http://www.rosebowlplc.com/news/from-groupie-to-godfather-/  | title= Rod Bransgrove interview  | publisher= rosebowlplc.com  | accessdate= 20 October 2009  | url-status= dead  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080820114229/http://www.rosebowlplc.com/news/from-groupie-to-godfather-  | archivedate= 20 August 2008  | df= dmy-all  }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Dimitri Mascarenhas.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Former captain [[Dimitri Mascarenhas]]]]\n\nIn 2000 Australian great [[Shane Warne]] was signed as the club's overseas player.

He brought instant success as Hampshire won promotion as champions to the County Championship First Division with victory over [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] on 23 September 2014. The 2015 season was reasonable successful with Hampshire qualifying for a record 6th successive Twenty20 Finals Day, however their First class performances at the beginning of the season were poor leading to Adams' resignation as captain. [[James Vince]] took over as captain, having already become List A and [[Twenty20|T20]] captain previously, and led a revival as Hampshire won four of their last five games, meaning that Hampshire completed the 'Great Escape' as victory over [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] in their final games thanks to 10 wickets from [[West Indies|West Indian]] [[Fidel Edwards]], and [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire's]] victory over [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] meant that Sussex and [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] were relegated to Division Two with Hampshire staying up.\n\nIn the winter of 2015 Hampshire completed the signing of [[England national cricket team|England]] seamer [[Reece Topley]] from [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]]. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and [[South Africa national cricket team|South African]] all rounder [[Ryan McLaren]] had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's [[Twenty20]] competition against the other team.<ref>{{cite web| date=14 January 2016 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/35312785 |title=Women's Cricket Super League:Six successful bids announced for new T20 league | work=BBC Sport | accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach [[Nicholas Denning|Nick Denning]] as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the [[Southern Vipers]]. The Vipers then won the inaugural [[Kia Super League]] on 21 August, defeating [[Western Force]] in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star [[Suzie Bates]] was named as player of the tournament. For the male team though it was a season of disappointment. A large number of injuries at the start of the season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, [[Chris Wood (cricketer)|Chris Wood]] and [[Ryan Stevenson (cricketer)|Ryan Stevenson]], coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler [[Hamza Ali]] in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman [[Michael Carberry]] being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the [[Natwest t20 Blast]], where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the [[Royal London One-Day Cup]]. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves too much to do and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a financial package from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement.<ref>{{cite web | date=3 October 2016 | url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-and-durham-agree-financial-package | title=ECB and Durham agree financial package | publisher=ECB | accessdate=3 October 2016 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003135157/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-and-durham-agree-financial-package | archivedate=3 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Coach [[Dale Benkenstein]] departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by [[Craig White]] originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer [[James Tomlinson]] retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of [[Kyle Abbott (cricketer)|Kyle Abbott]] and [[Rilee Rossouw]] on [[Kolpak ruling|Kolpak]] deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web| date=5 January 2017 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/05/kyle-abbott-rilee-rossouw-sign-kolpak-deals-with-hampshire-south-africa-cricket |title=South Africa head coach slams player for signing Kolpak deal with Hampshire |work=The Guardian |agency=The Press Association| accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref> On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] meaning relegation for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] scoring 249-8, with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] overseas player [[Shahid Afridi]] scoring a century.\n\n2018 saw improved performances in first-class cricket as Hampshire secured their Division One status before the final day for the first time since promotion in 2014. Kolpak stars [[Kyle Abbott (cricketer)|Kyle Abbott]] and [[Fidel Edwards]] both taking more than 50 wickets in the season but it was in List A cricket where Hampshire were most successful, winning the [[2018 Royal London One-Day Cup]], with a century in the final at [[Lord's]] by [[Rilee Rossouw]]. Hampshire though performed poorly in Twenty20 cricket finishing 2nd bottom of the South group. Overseas player [[Mujeeb Ur Rahman]] though became the first Afghan to play for Hampshire, and the first player to be born in the 21st century to play for Hampshire. Long time players [[James Adams (cricketer, born 1980)|Jimmy Adams]] and [[Sean Ervine]] though retired at the end of the 2018 season having amassed more than 35,000 runs in all formats between them for Hampshire, while coach [[Craig White]] also departed after two seasons as head coach, and was replaced by South African [[Adrian Birrell]] in December.\n\n2019 again saw strong performance in first-class cricket as Hampshire finished 3rd in the County Championship, their highest finish in over 10 years. Kyle Abbott once again was leading wicket taker, while also taking the best Hampshire bowling figures in a match when he took 17/86 against Somerset in September. [[Ajinkya Rahane]] also became the first Indian player to represent Hampshire during an overseas spell in June. Hampshire once again also made the [[2019 Royal London One-Day Cup]] final, however this year they were defeated in the final by Somerset. There was though success for Hampshire academy graduates James Vince and Liam Dawson as they were part of England's victorious World Cup winning side. Hampshire, though, again failed to progress from the group in T20 cricket.\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n* No. denotes the player's squad number, as worn on the back of their shirt.\n* {{double-dagger}} denotes players with international caps.\n* {{Color box|#CFECEC|<nowiki>*</nowiki>|border=darkgray}} denotes a player who has been awarded a [[Cricket cap#First-class cricket|county cap]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"font-size:95%; width:80%;\"\n|-\n!

The old [[County Ground, Southampton|County Ground]], Hampshire's home since 1885, no longer had the capability to do this. Land in [[West End, Hampshire|West End]], on the outskirts of Southampton was chosen as the location for The Rose Bowl. Construction began in March 1997 and was completed in time for the [[2001 English cricket season|2001 season]].  Hampshire's first first-class match on the ground was against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], ending in a victory by 124 runs for Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web| date= 22 October 2009  | url=  https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/72/72089.html| title= First match at the Rose Bowl|website=Cricketarchive.com| accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref>  In July 2008 the ground hosted the [[Twenty20 Cup]] final, with [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] defeating [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] by 3 runs in the final.  In August 2010, the ground hosted the [[2010 Friends Provident t20|Friends Provident t20]] finals day, in which history was created when Hampshire became the first team to win the tournament at their home ground as they defeated [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in dramatic scenes off the last ball of the match.<ref>{{cite web

is one of eighteen [[first-class cricket|first-class]] [[county cricket|county clubs]] within the domestic [[cricket]] structure of [[England]] and [[Wales]]. It represents the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Hampshire]]. Hampshire teams formed by earlier organisations, principally the [[Hambledon Club]], always had first-class status and the same applied to the county club when it was founded in 1863. Because of poor performances for several seasons until 1885, Hampshire then lost its status for nine seasons until it was invited into the [[County Championship]] in 1895, since when the team have played in every top-level domestic cricket competition in England.<ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |first= |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}</ref> Hampshire originally played at the [[Antelope Ground]], [[Southampton]] until 1885 when they relocated to the [[County Ground, Southampton]] until 2000, before moving to the purpose-built [[Rose Bowl (cricket ground)|Rose Bowl]] in West End, which is in the Borough of [[Eastleigh]]. The club has twice won the County Championship, in the [[1961 English cricket season|1961]] and [[1973 English cricket season|1973]] seasons.\n\nHampshire played their first [[list A cricket|one-day match]] in the [[1963 Gillette Cup]], but did not win their first one-day silverware until 1975 when they won the [[Sunday League (cricket)|Sunday League]] which it won twice more, in 1978 and 1986.  It has twice won the [[Benson & Hedges Cup]], in 1988 and 1991; the [[Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy]] once in 2005 and the [[Friends Provident Trophy]] once in 2009.  Having first played [[Twenty20 cricket]] in 2003, Hampshire won the [[Friends Provident t20]] in 2010.  The County Championship was restructured in 2000, and at the end of the 2002 Hampshire was relegated for the first time. The club remained in the second division for three seasons and since 2004 had competed in the top tier.  However, the club was relegated once more in 2011. The club won both the [[Friends Life t20]] and [[ECB 40]] in 2012, but it wasn't until 2014 before they were promoted to the first division again. They narrowly avoided relegation in 2015 before being relegated again in 2016, only to be reprieved after [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] were relegated after taking ECB sanctions to secure their future.\n\n[[Phil Mead]] is the club's leading run-scorer with 48,892&nbsp;runs in 700&nbsp;matches for Hampshire between 1905 and 1936. Fast bowler [[Derek Shackleton]] took 2,669&nbsp;wickets in 583&nbsp;first-class matches between 1948 and 1969 which remains a club record.  [[Alec Kennedy]], whose career lasted from 1907 to 1936, was the first player to score 10,000&nbsp;runs and take 1,000&nbsp;wickets for Hampshire.  [[Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie]] was both Hampshire last amateur captain and first professional captain.\n\n==Honours==\n{{See also|List of the competitive honours won by county cricket clubs in England and Wales}}\n[[File:DominicCork.jpg|thumb|right|250px| Dominic Cork (left) and Sean Ervine hold aloft the [[2009 Friends Provident Trophy]]]]\n===First XI honours===\n* '''Champion County'''{{#tag:ref|An unofficial seasonal title sometimes proclaimed by consensus of media and historians prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship was constituted.

If authentic, this is the earliest known mention of cricket in Hampshire.  But, with the sport having originated in Saxon or Norman times on the [[Weald]], it is likely to  have reached what is now modern Hampshire long before 1647.  In 1680, lines written in an old Bible invite \"All you that do delight in Cricket, come to Marden, pitch your wickets\".  [[Marden, West Sussex|Marden]] is in [[Sussex]], north of [[Chichester]], and close to [[Hambledon, Hampshire|Hambledon]], which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire.  Hampshire is used in a team name for the first time in August 1729, when a combined Hampshire, Surrey and Sussex XI played against [[Kent county cricket teams|Kent]].\n\n===Hambledon and after===\n[[File:HambledonCCPitch.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Broadhalfpenny Down]], the original ground of the Hambledon Club]]\n{{For|information about Hampshire county teams before the formation of Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire county cricket teams}}\nThe origin of the legendary [[Hambledon Club]] is lost.  There remains no definite knowledge of Hambledon cricket before 1756, when its team had gained sufficient repute to be capable of attempting three matches against [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]], itself a famous club since the 1720s if not earlier. Hambledon had presumably earned recognition as the best parish team in Hampshire, but no reports of their local matches have been found. We do not know when the Hambledon Club was founded and it seems likely that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, although there may well have been a patron involved.  The Sussex v Hampshire match in June 1766 is the earliest reference to Hampshire as an individual county team.  Whether the Hambledon Club was involved is unrecorded but presumably it was. Some historians believe it was at about this time that the club, as distinct from a parish organisation, was founded.  The Hambledon Club was in many respects a Hampshire county club for it organised Hampshire matches, although it was a multi-functional club and not dedicated to cricket alone. Its membership attracted large numbers of sporting gentry and it dominated the sport, both on and off the field, for about thirty years until the formation of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in 1787. Hambledon produced some legendary Hampshire players including master [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]] [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] and the two great fast bowlers [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]] and [[David Harris (Hambledon cricketer)|David Harris]].  Following the demise of the Hambledon Club towards the end of the 18th century, Hampshire continued to be recognised as a first-class team into the nineteenth century but, after the 1828 season, they had long spells without any first-class matches until the county club was founded in 1864. The county played some first-class fixtures during 1842 to 1845 and one match versus [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] in 1861 but was otherwise outside cricket\u2019s mainstream through 1829 to 1863.\n\n===Origin of club===\n[[File:James Southerton.JPG|thumb|right|200px| James Southerton, who played in the first ever [[Test cricket|Test match]] ]]\nHampshire County Cricket Club was founded on 12 August 1863<ref>''Guinness Book of Cricket Facts and Feats''</ref> and played its first first-class match against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] at the [[Antelope Ground]], [[Southampton]] on 7 and 8 July 1864. Sussex won by 10 wickets with [[James Lillywhite]] claiming ten wickets in the match for 80 runs, including his 100th career wicket.<ref>{{cite web|date=7 July 1864 |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/1/1333.html |title=Hampshire v Sussex, 1864 |publisher=cricketarchive.com |accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref> Hampshire was recognised as a first-class team from 1864 to 1885. In 1886, Hampshire lost its status after years of difficult circumstances and poor results. The team did play against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and Sussex in 1886 but the matches were considered minor standard. Hampshire recovered first-class status from the beginning of the [[1895 County Championship]] season when the team was invited to join the now official [[County Championship]]. They finished the season in tenth place, sixteen points behind winners Surrey.<ref>{{cite web| year= 1895| url= http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1895.html| title= 1895 County Championship table| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=19 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:CB Fry batting.jpg|thumb|left|200px| C.B. Fry, who represented Hampshire between 1909\u20131921]]\nBetween 1900 and 1905, Hampshire were almost continuously struggling as their key officer-batsmen, [[Robert Poore|Major Poore]] and [[Teddy Wynyard|Captain Wynyard]] were faced with either moving to South Africa or increased military duties at home from the [[Boer War]]. The club finished last or equal last in 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904 and 1905, failing to win a single game in the first of those seasons; however in 1901, with the temporary acquisition of [[J. G. Greig|Captain Greig]] from India and the qualification of [[Charlie Llewellyn]], Hampshire won as many games as it lost. From 1906 onwards, with the qualification of [[Phil Mead]], [[Jack Newman (English cricketer)|Jack Newman]] and later [[George Brown (cricketer, born 1887)|George Brown]], Hampshire became a much more competitive side, though not until 1910 did they win as many games as they lost in a season.\n\nThe period from 1912 to 1926, though they never got near [[County Championship]] honours, was to be the most successful for a long time in Hampshire\u2019s history: in those eleven seasons they won 98 and lost 96 of 292 games \u2013 only once otherwise until 1954 did they win more games than they lost.<ref>Wynne-Thomas, Peter; ''The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records''; pp. 55\u201359 {{ISBN|0-7270-1868-X}}</ref> Mead, Brown, Kennedy and Newman were in the prime during this period, and they had the services of [[Lionel Tennyson, 3rd Baron Tennyson|Lord Tennyson]] who captained the side from 1919\u20131932 as well as captaining the England team in three Tests, and the occasional aid of many other amateurs including the great [[C. B. Fry]], who averaged an amazing 102 in seven games during [[1912 English cricket season|1912]]. In 1922, Hampshire won one of the most remarkable victories in County Championship history when, they defeated [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] by 155 runs after having followed on when dismissed for just 15. They scored 521 after being invited to bat again, set Warwickshire 314 to win and bowled them out for 158. Brown, with 172, and Livsey who scored 110* at number 10, were the heroes.<ref>{{cite web| url=  http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Hampshire/Scorecards/10/10456.html| title= Warwickshire v Hampshire, 1922 (scorecard)| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1927, Hampshire declined severely as their stalwart professionals declined and the level of amateur support fell off alarmingly. Only in 1932 and 1948 did they finish above tenth until 1955. With [[Stuart Boyes]] and [[Lofty Herman]] not fully adequate replacements as bowling mainstays for Kennedy and Newman, the bowling was never strong, and the batting generally uncertain especially when Mead declined from [[1929 English cricket season|1929]] onwards. In 1937 [[Dick Moore (cricketer)|Dick Moore]] set the individual scoring record for Hampshire against Warwickshire at [[Dean Park Cricket Ground]] in [[Bournemouth]]. His 316 took just 380 minutes and contained 43 [[Boundary (cricket)|fours]] and three sixes.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Hampshire/Scorecards/16/16325.html| title= Hampshire v Warwickshire, 1937 (scorecard)| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=20 October 2009}}</ref> After [[World War II]], [[Derek Shackleton]] became an outstanding bowling mainstay well backed up by [[Victor Cannings]], but not until 1955 did these two have enough support to rise the fortunes of the club. In 1955 Hampshire finished as high as third with Shackleton taking 160 wickets and Cannings and [[Peter Sainsbury]] around 100, with [[Roy Marshall]] was one of the few exciting batsmen of the time.\n\nThe following years were mixed: a rise to second in 1958 with [[Malcolm Heath]] replacing Cannings as Shackleton\u2019s partner was followed by two disappointing years before Hampshire won the 1961 County Championship, their first ever County Championship success, finishing the season with 268 points, 18 ahead of Yorkshire. Hampshire won 19 of their 32 matches, losing only seven matches all season.<ref>{{cite web| date= 17 October 2009  | url=  https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1961.html| title= 1961 County Championship Table| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> The club were led by [[Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie]] with Marshall scoring the most runs for the club with 2,455. [[Derek Shackleton]] took the most wickets for the club with 153, and [[Butch White]]\u2019s tearaway speed was equally dangerous in a dry summer.\n\nAgain, however, Hampshire were disappointing until [[Barry Richards]] joined the county in 1968, when they rose from tenth to fifth in the Championship and established themselves as a power in limited-overs cricket. [[Bob Cottam]] was the second-highest first-class wicket-taker in 1968 and the highest in 1969, but did not maintain this excellence before joining [[Northamptonshire County Cricket Club|Northamptonshire]] and in 1970 and 1971 Hampshire fell to mid-table. In the 1973 County Championship Hampshire won the County Championship for a second time, winning the competition by 31 points from Surrey.<ref>{{cite web| date= 17 October 2009  | url=  https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1973.html| title= 1973 County Championship Table| work=CricketArchive|url-access=subscription| accessdate=17 October 2009}}</ref> The club won 10 of their 20 matches and drew the other 10. During this season they were led by [[Richard Gilliat]] with [[Gordon Greenidge]] scoring the most runs for the club with 1,620. [[Bob Herman]] and [[Mike Taylor (cricketer, born 1942)|Mike Taylor]] both took 63 wickets. This remains Hampshire's last success in the tournament.  In 1979 West Indian [[Malcolm Marshall]], widely regarded as one of the best bowlers to grace the game joined the club. This was to be the start of a 14-year stay with the club.

The 1990s brought about further success in the first half of the decade, and later struggles in the latter half. In the 1991 County Championship season Hampshire won the [[1991 NatWest Trophy|NatWest Trophy]], defeating [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] by 4 wickets, with [[Shaun Udal]] claiming the man of the match award. This was the clubs first [[List-A cricket|one day]] honour in this competition. Hampshire again repeated their 1988 success in the Benson & Hedges Cup by winning the 1992 competition. In the final at [[Lord's]] they beat [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] by 41 runs, including 90 runs from [[Robin Smith (cricketer)|Robin Smith]] and three wickets each from [[Malcolm Marshall]] and Shaun Udal.  This marked Hampshire's second success in the competition. In 1996 Malcolm Marshall returned to coach the club. In 1997 work begun on Hampshire's long-awaited new ground. The realisation of this move almost led the club to financial ruin, as encouragement from financial partners [[Sport England]] and the hiring of architect [[Sir Michael Hopkins]] had led the then part-time voluntary committee running the club to lose control of the budget.<ref>{{cite web  | date= 17 October 2009  | url= http://www.rosebowlplc.com/news/from-groupie-to-godfather-/  | title= Rod Bransgrove interview  | publisher= rosebowlplc.com  | accessdate= 20 October 2009  | url-status= dead  | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080820114229/http://www.rosebowlplc.com/news/from-groupie-to-godfather-  | archivedate= 20 August 2008  | df= dmy-all  }}</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Dimitri Mascarenhas.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Former captain [[Dimitri Mascarenhas]]]]\n\nIn 2000 Australian great [[Shane Warne]] was signed as the club's overseas player.

He brought instant success as Hampshire won promotion as champions to the County Championship First Division with victory over [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]] on 23 September 2014. The 2015 season was reasonable successful with Hampshire qualifying for a record 6th successive Twenty20 Finals Day, however their First class performances at the beginning of the season were poor leading to Adams' resignation as captain. [[James Vince]] took over as captain, having already become List A and [[Twenty20|T20]] captain previously, and led a revival as Hampshire won four of their last five games, meaning that Hampshire completed the 'Great Escape' as victory over [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] in their final games thanks to 10 wickets from [[West Indies|West Indian]] [[Fidel Edwards]], and [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire's]] victory over [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] meant that Sussex and [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] were relegated to Division Two with Hampshire staying up.\n\nIn the winter of 2015 Hampshire completed the signing of [[England national cricket team|England]] seamer [[Reece Topley]] from [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]]. The club also announced that Fidel Edwards had signed a new deal and [[South Africa national cricket team|South African]] all rounder [[Ryan McLaren]] had signed as an overseas player. On 14 January 2016, Hampshire Cricket was announced as one of six new teams in the inaugural Women's Cricket Super League. Hampshire, in partnership with Berkshire, Dorset, Isle of Wight, Oxfordshire, Sussex and Wiltshire cricket boards along with Southampton Solent University, will compete in a women's [[Twenty20]] competition against the other team.<ref>{{cite web| date=14 January 2016 | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/35312785 |title=Women's Cricket Super League:Six successful bids announced for new T20 league | work=BBC Sport | accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> On 28 January 2016 Hampshire appointed former Wiltshire coach [[Nicholas Denning|Nick Denning]] as their inaugural coach for their Women's team. Following the appointment of Denning, Hampshire announced the naming of their Women's Cricket Super League team as the [[Southern Vipers]]. The Vipers then won the inaugural [[Kia Super League]] on 21 August, defeating [[Western Force]] in the final by 7 wickets. Overseas star [[Suzie Bates]] was named as player of the tournament. For the male team though it was a season of disappointment. A large number of injuries at the start of the season, including to fast bowlers Reece Topley, Fidel Edwards, [[Chris Wood (cricketer)|Chris Wood]] and [[Ryan Stevenson (cricketer)|Ryan Stevenson]], coupled with poor form and tough circumstances, after the death of trialist fast bowler [[Hamza Ali]] in a drowning accident, and long serving opening batsman [[Michael Carberry]] being diagnosed with a cancerous lung tumour, saw Hampshire suffer a poor season, being knocked out in the group stages of both the [[Natwest t20 Blast]], where they missed out on Finals Day for the first time since 2009, and the [[Royal London One-Day Cup]]. Their championship season was much the same as in 2015, again making a slow start, but they gave themselves too much to do and were relegated back to Division Two after defeat against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]] on 23 September 2016. However, on 3 October 2016 Hampshire were given a reprieve as Durham were relegated to Division Two after taking up a financial package from the ECB to help with their finances, with their relegation and a points deduction being the fine for taking this agreement.<ref>{{cite web | date=3 October 2016 | url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-and-durham-agree-financial-package | title=ECB and Durham agree financial package | publisher=ECB | accessdate=3 October 2016 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003135157/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-and-durham-agree-financial-package | archivedate=3 October 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Coach [[Dale Benkenstein]] departed as coach for 'Personal Reasons' in mid-July and was replaced by [[Craig White]] originally in a caretaker role, before taking over as full-time first team coach in November. At the end of the season, long serving seamer [[James Tomlinson]] retired having been with Hampshire since 2002 and making over 150 appearances in all formats for Hampshire. The Winter of 2017 saw Hampshire draw criticism over the signings of [[Kyle Abbott (cricketer)|Kyle Abbott]] and [[Rilee Rossouw]] on [[Kolpak ruling|Kolpak]] deals, with these players giving up international cricket to represent Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web| date=5 January 2017 | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/05/kyle-abbott-rilee-rossouw-sign-kolpak-deals-with-hampshire-south-africa-cricket |title=South Africa head coach slams player for signing Kolpak deal with Hampshire |work=The Guardian |agency=The Press Association| accessdate=28 September 2017}}</ref> On the field Hampshire again had a mixed season in first class cricket, avoiding relegation for the 3rd season in a row by drawing against already relegated [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] meaning relegation for [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]], with Kolpak Abbott taking 60 wickets across the First-class season. In List A cricket Hampshire again missed out on the knockout stages. However Hampshire performed better in Twenty20 cricket, qualifying for their 7th Finals Day in 8 years, although they lost in the Semi-final to eventual winners [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]. They also recorded their highest Twenty20 score in their Quarter final victory over [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] scoring 249-8, with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] overseas player [[Shahid Afridi]] scoring a century.\n\n2018 saw improved performances in first-class cricket as Hampshire secured their Division One status before the final day for the first time since promotion in 2014. Kolpak stars [[Kyle Abbott (cricketer)|Kyle Abbott]] and [[Fidel Edwards]] both taking more than 50 wickets in the season but it was in List A cricket where Hampshire were most successful, winning the [[2018 Royal London One-Day Cup]], with a century in the final at [[Lord's]] by [[Rilee Rossouw]]. Hampshire though performed poorly in Twenty20 cricket finishing 2nd bottom of the South group. Overseas player [[Mujeeb Ur Rahman]] though became the first Afghan to play for Hampshire, and the first player to be born in the 21st century to play for Hampshire. Long time players [[James Adams (cricketer, born 1980)|Jimmy Adams]] and [[Sean Ervine]] though retired at the end of the 2018 season having amassed more than 35,000 runs in all formats between them for Hampshire, while coach [[Craig White]] also departed after two seasons as head coach, and was replaced by South African [[Adrian Birrell]] in December.\n\n2019 again saw strong performance in first-class cricket as Hampshire finished 3rd in the County Championship, their highest finish in over 10 years. Kyle Abbott once again was leading wicket taker, while also taking the best Hampshire bowling figures in a match when he took 17/86 against Somerset in September. [[Ajinkya Rahane]] also became the first Indian player to represent Hampshire during an overseas spell in June. Hampshire once again also made the [[2019 Royal London One-Day Cup]] final, however this year they were defeated in the final by Somerset. There was though success for Hampshire academy graduates James Vince and Liam Dawson as they were part of England's victorious World Cup winning side. Hampshire, though, again failed to progress from the group in T20 cricket.\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current squad===\n* No. denotes the player's squad number, as worn on the back of their shirt.\n* {{double-dagger}} denotes players with international caps.\n* {{Color box|#CFECEC|<nowiki>*</nowiki>|border=darkgray}} denotes a player who has been awarded a [[Cricket cap#First-class cricket|county cap]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"font-size:95%; width:80%;\"\n|-\n!

One reason for building the new Rose Bowl ground was to attract international cricket to the south coast of England. The old [[County Ground, Southampton|County Ground]], Hampshire's home since 1885, no longer had the capability to do this. Land in [[West End, Hampshire|West End]], on the outskirts of Southampton was chosen as the location for The Rose Bowl. Construction began in March 1997 and was completed in time for the [[2001 English cricket season|2001 season]].  Hampshire's first first-class match on the ground was against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]], ending in a victory by 124 runs for Hampshire.<ref>{{cite web| date= 22 October 2009  | url=  https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/72/72089.html| title= First match at the Rose Bowl|website=Cricketarchive.com| accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref>  In July 2008 the ground hosted the [[Twenty20 Cup]] final, with [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] defeating [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] by 3 runs in the final.  In August 2010, the ground hosted the [[2010 Friends Provident t20|Friends Provident t20]] finals day, in which history was created when Hampshire became the first team to win the tournament at their home ground as they defeated [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in dramatic scenes off the last ball of the match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rosebowlplc.com/news/friends-provident-t20-final/ |title=Hampshire Cricket Club &#124; Wedding Venue &#124; Exhibitions & Meetings &#124; The Ageas Bowl \u2013 News |publisher=Rosebowlplc.com |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=4 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002114434/http://www.rosebowlplc.com/news/friends-provident-t20-final/ |archive-date=2 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  In 2011, [[England cricket team|England]] played their first Test cricket|Test match at the Rose Bowl during their series with [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]].\n\nThe ends are called the ''Pavilion End'' and the ''Northern End''.\n\n===Other grounds===\n{{for|a complete list of grounds used by Hampshire|List of Hampshire County Cricket Club grounds}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lists of Hampshire County Cricket Club players]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=notes/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book | title = Entertain or Perish: Hampshire County Cricket 1946\u20132006 | last=Allen | first=David | edition = 2007 | publisher = Phillimore | isbn = 1-86077-448-2 }}\n*{{Cite book | title = A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914) | last= [[Harry Altham|Altham, H S]] | edition = 1962 | publisher = [[George Allen & Unwin]] | asin = B0014QE7HQ }}\n*{{Cite book | title = A Social History of English Cricket | last = [[Derek Birley|Birley, Derek]] | edition = 1999 | publisher = [[Aurum Press]] | isbn = 1-85410-941-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/socialhistoryofe0000birl }}\n*{{Cite book | title = Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development | last=[[Rowland Bowen|Bowen, Rowland]] | edition = 1970 | publisher = [[Eyre & Spottiswoode]] | isbn = 0-413-27860-3 }}\n*{{Cite book | title = The Playfair Book of Cricket Records | last=[[Roy Webber|Webber, Roy]] | edition = 1951 | publisher = Playfair Books | asin = B0000CHVVU }}\n*[[Playfair Cricket Annual]] \u2013 various editions\n*[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] \u2013 various editions\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.hampshirecricket.com}}\n*[http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Hampshire/index.html CricketArchive \u2013 lists of numerous club records and scorecards]\n\n{{Hampshire CCC}}\n{{Hampshire County Cricket Club squad}}\n{{English first-class cricket clubs}}\n\n[[Category:Cricket clubs established in 1863]]\n[[Category:English first-class cricket teams]]\n[[Category:Cricket in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:History of Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Clubs and societies in Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Hampshire County Cricket Club| ]]\n[[Category:1863 establishments in England]]\n", "name_user": "Joelhesslegrave", "label": "safe", "comment": "added Ajeet Dale's squad number as in his Instagram bio", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampshire_County_Cricket_Club"}
