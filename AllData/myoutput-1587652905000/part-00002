It is located in [[Sepang District]] of [[Selangor]], approximately {{convert|45|km|mi}} south of [[Kuala Lumpur]] city centre and serves the Greater [[Klang Valley]] conurbation.\n\nKLIA is the largest and busiest airport in Malaysia. In 2018, it handled 59,988,409 passengers, 714,669 tonnes of cargo and 399,827 aircraft movements. It is the world's [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|23rd-busiest airport by total passenger traffic]].\n\nThe airport is operated by [[Malaysia Airports]] (MAHB) Sepang Sdn Bhd and is the major hub of [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[MASkargo]], [[AirAsia]], [[AirAsia X]], [[Malindo Air]], [[flyGlobal]], [[UPS Airlines]] and [[AsiaCargo Express]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Klia entrance.jpg|thumb|left|KLIA main entrance from the side]]\n[[File:KLIAMTB.jpg|alt=|thumb|KLIA Main terminal architecture]]\nThe ground breaking ceremony for Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) took place on 1 June 1993 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://diveintomalaysia.com/klia-klia2/|title=KLIA/KLIA2|website=Dive Into Malaysia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> when the government under [[Mahathir Mohamad]] decided that the existing Kuala Lumpur airport, then known as [[Subang International Airport]] (now [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport]]) could not handle future demand. The construction of the airport was done mainly by a few state owned construction companies as well as Ekovest Berhad \u2013 helmed by Tan Sri Datuk [[Lim Kang Hoo]]. It was created as part of the [[Multimedia Super Corridor]], a grand development plan for Malaysia. The chief architect who designed the new airport terminal was the Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kisho.co.jp/page/223.html|title=KISHO KUROKAWA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUpon KLIA's completion, Subang Airport's Terminal 1 building was demolished. [[Malaysia Airports]] agreed to redevelop the remaining Terminal 3 to create a specialist airport for turboprop and charter planes surrounded by a residential area and a business park. The [[IATA]] airport code '''KUL''' was transferred from Subang Airport, which currently handles only turboprop aircraft, general aviation and military aircraft.

The terminal has a built-up area of 257,845 sqm with 68 departure gates, 10 remote stands, 80 aerobridges, includes a retail space of 35,000 sqm to accommodate a total of 220 retail outlets.<ref>{{cite news|title=About klia2|url=http://www.klia2.info/about-klia2|accessdate=24 April 2014}}</ref> The main terminal building of klia2 is connected with its satellite piers with a skybridge, making it the first airport in Asia with such facility.<ref>{{cite news|title=klia2 opens to public|url=http://www.thesundaily.my/news/1029677|accessdate=27 April 2014}}</ref> klia2 is certified with Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED).\n\nCheck-in counters are divided into 8 rows located in 4 islands, each row identified by the letters S \u2013 Z. Boarding gates are located in 5 piers, indicated by the letters '''''J''''' and '''''K''''' for domestic flights, and '''''L''''', '''''P''''' and '''''Q''''' for international flights. Piers J, K and L are connected directly to the main terminal building, while Piers P and Q are accessible via the skybridge. Piers K and L are physically the same pier and share the same gates, but with waiting lounges on different levels (Level 1A for K and Level 2 for L). For international flights, the access door from Pier K is sealed off, while for domestic flights, the access door from Pier L is sealed off instead.\n\nAt present, inter-terminal connection is provided on the landside at Gateway@klia2 complex and there are provisions for future airside inter-terminal connection.\n\n====Gateway@klia2====\n\n'''Gateway@klia2''' is an integrated shopping complex that is connected to the main klia2 terminal building. It has a 350,000 square feet of net lettable space spanning over four levels. The transport hub at Gateway@klia2 links [[klia2 ERL station|klia2]] to the [[KLIA Ekspres]] and [[KLIA Transit]] service, with allotted pick-up and drop-off areas for coaches, taxis, rented vehicles and private transportation.<ref>{{cite news|title=About gateway@klia2|url=http://gatewayklia2.com.my/about.aspx?cat=1&cid=3|accessdate=1 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407231315/http://gatewayklia2.com.my/about.aspx?cat=1&cid=3#|archive-date=7 April 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGateway@klia2 hosts an 8-storey car park that directly adjoins klia2.

The terminal was designed and built in accordance to the [[low cost carrier business model]], with limited terminal amenities. As requested by the low-cost airline, the terminal does not provide [[aerobridge]]s, nor are there transfer facilities, rail connections, and other facilities provided in a full-fledged terminal. LCCT is located within the Air Support Zone, and has since ceased operations on 9 May 2014 and all low-cost carrier flights are now operating out of klia2.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Airlines and

Each 250-person capacity train can transport 3,000 passengers per hour in each direction at up to 56&nbsp;km/h (35&nbsp;mph). These three-car driverless trains run on elevated rail and under the taxiways. The journey takes under two minutes. The Aerotrain operates between three and five-minute intervals between terminal. Automatic train controls manage the operation of the entire Aerotrain system, controlling the speeds, headways, stops and door openings in stations, and integrating functions that enhance the reliability and performance of the system.<ref name=\"Kiat.net: Kuala Lumpur International\">{{cite web|title=Kuala Lumpur International |url=http://kiat.net/klia/index.html |publisher=Kiat.net |accessdate=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503161615/http://www.kiat.net/klia/index.html |archivedate=3 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===External connections===\n\n====Rail====\n{{Main|Express Rail Link|KLIA Ekspres|KLIA Transit|Kuala Lumpur International Airport ERL station|klia2 ERL station}}\n\nKuala Lumpur International Airport is linked to the [[KL Sentral]] transportation hub in the city centre by the {{cvt|57|km}} long [[Express Rail Link]] (ERL). There are two ERL stations at the airport: [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport ERL station|KLIA station]] at the Main Terminal Building and [[klia2 ERL station|klia2 station]] at Gateway@klia2. The airport is served by two rail services on the ERL:\n* [[KLIA Ekspres]]: The dedicated [[airport rail link]] which runs non-stop between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 28 minutes to/from KLIA, and 33 minutes to/from klia2 with a two-minute stop at KLIA. The KLIA Ekspres terminal at KL Sentral is known as the [[KL Sentral#KL City Air Terminal|KL City Air Terminal]] (KL CAT), which has an [[IATA]] designation '''XKL'''. KL CAT offers in-town flight check-in service up to two hours before flight departure time for passengers travelling on [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Etihad Airways]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Malindo Air]] and [[Royal Brunei Airlines]].\n* [[KLIA Transit]]: A [[commuter rail]] service which stops at three additional stops ([[Bandar Tasik Selatan station|Bandar Tasik Selatan]], [[Putrajaya/Cyberjaya ERL station|Putrajaya/Cyberjaya]] and [[Salak Tinggi ERL station|Salak Tinggi]]) between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 35 minutes to/from KLIA and 39 minutes to/from klia2. Check-in facilities are only through automated kiosks at KLIA Transit stations.\n\n===Taxis and limousine===\nAirport taxis or airport limousines are provided by Airport Limo. The taxis and limousines are readily available at the Taxi and Limousine counters. They run from airport itself to destinations in Klang Valley and Greater Klang Valley. The fares are to be paid at the counter and are charged according to the destinations' zone. A surcharge is applied for services between 12&nbsp;am to 5&nbsp;am\n\n===Bus===\nBoth public and private buses connect KLIA and klia2 to several points in Kuala Lumpur and beyond. Direct buses to the city centre take about an hour and run every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours. All buses are air-conditioned. Bus tickets to [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral station|KL Sentral]] transportation hub cost RM11 and to [[Putra Heights station|Putra Heights LRT station]] cost RM4.\n\n==Expansion and developments==\n\n===Plans===\n[[File:KLIAAeropolis.jpg|thumb|KLIA Aeropolis Masterplan]]\n\nWith the slight modification of the masterplan, the future Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be combined into one satellite terminal. The expansion of Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be exactly the same as Terminal 1's (the current Main Terminal) satellite terminal, where initially the satellite terminal will have four arms, and another four arms when the terminal reached its capacity. There is sufficient land and capacity to develop facilities to handle up to 97.5 million passengers a year, four runways by the year 2020 and two mega-terminals, each linked with satellite terminals.<ref name=\"KLIA Phases\"/>\n\n{| class=\"collapsible wikitable collapsed\" style=\"width: 70% ; font-size: 85%; border: #999 solid 1px; text-align: lcenter; margin-bottom: 0; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"background: #8B8589;\"| Summary of Kuala Lumpur International Airport Masterplan\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:#d3d3d3;\"\n!Phase!!Year!!Description\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 1||1998||Initial Capacity of 25 million Passenger Per Annum\n|-\n|2006||Capable of Handling 35 million Passengers per annum with the construction of Low Cost Carrier Terminal\n|-\n|Phase 2||2008||Expansion of Low Cost Carrier Terminal to accommodate 40 Million Passengers per annum.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 3||2011||New Low Cost Carrier Terminal will be constructed to accommodate additional 30 million (55 million) passengers Per Annum, Current Low Cost Carrier Terminal converted to cargo usage.\n|-\n|Not fixed||Satellite Terminal B will be constructed to handle maximum of 75 million passengers.

KLIA is the only airport in Malaysia that accommodate the landing and take off of the A380. Upgrading works started on 3 April 2006, and was completed by 28 May 2007. Works include the provision of shoulders on both sides of the two existing runways of 15 meters as well as the taxiways, building additional aerobridges at the three departure halls, namely C17, C27 and C37, and enhancing the mezzanine lounges for upper deck passengers of the aircraft at the departure halls.

It is located in [[Sepang District]] of [[Selangor]], approximately {{convert|45|km|mi}} south of [[Kuala Lumpur]] city centre and serves the Greater [[Klang Valley]] conurbation.\n\nKLIA is the largest and busiest airport in Malaysia. In 2018, it handled 59,988,409 passengers, 714,669 tonnes of cargo and 399,827 aircraft movements. It is the world's [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|23rd-busiest airport by total passenger traffic]].\n\nThe airport is operated by [[Malaysia Airports]] (MAHB) Sepang Sdn Bhd and is the major hub of [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[MASkargo]], [[AirAsia]], [[AirAsia X]], [[Malindo Air]], [[flyGlobal]], [[UPS Airlines]] and [[AsiaCargo Express]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Klia entrance.jpg|thumb|left|KLIA main entrance from the side]]\n[[File:KLIAMTB.jpg|alt=|thumb|KLIA Main terminal architecture]]\nThe ground breaking ceremony for Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) took place on 1 June 1993 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://diveintomalaysia.com/klia-klia2/|title=KLIA/KLIA2|website=Dive Into Malaysia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-01}}</ref> when the government under [[Mahathir Mohamad]] decided that the existing Kuala Lumpur airport, then known as [[Subang International Airport]] (now [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport]]) could not handle future demand. The construction of the airport was done mainly by a few state owned construction companies as well as Ekovest Berhad \u2013 helmed by Tan Sri Datuk [[Lim Kang Hoo]]. It was created as part of the [[Multimedia Super Corridor]], a grand development plan for Malaysia. The chief architect who designed the new airport terminal was the Japanese architect [[Kisho Kurokawa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kisho.co.jp/page/223.html|title=KISHO KUROKAWA|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUpon KLIA's completion, Subang Airport's Terminal 1 building was demolished. [[Malaysia Airports]] agreed to redevelop the remaining Terminal 3 to create a specialist airport for turboprop and charter planes surrounded by a residential area and a business park. The [[IATA]] airport code '''KUL''' was transferred from Subang Airport, which currently handles only turboprop aircraft, general aviation and military aircraft. [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport|Subang Airport]]'s IATA code has since been changed to '''SZB'''.\n\n===Current site===\nThe airport's site spans {{convert|100|km2|sqmi}} <sup>2</sup>,<ref name=\"KLIA History\">{{cite web|title=History of KLIA |year=1998 |url=http://www.dcaklia.gov.my/EnglishPages/MENU/MainFrame.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305010314/http://www.dcaklia.gov.my/EnglishPages/MENU/MainFrame.htm |archivedate= 5 March 2008 }}</ref> of former agricultural land and is one of the world's largest airport sites. An ambitious three-phase development plan anticipates KLIA to have three runways and two terminals each with two satellite terminals.<ref name=\"KLIA Phases\"/> Phase One involved the construction of the main terminal and one satellite terminal, giving a capacity of 25 million passengers, and two full service runways.

Building]]\n\nThe [[AeroTrain (KLIA)|Aerotrain]] is an [[People mover|automated people mover]] (APM) that connects the airside of KLIA Main Terminal Building (MTB) and the Satellite Building. Each 250-person capacity train can transport 3,000 passengers per hour in each direction at up to 56&nbsp;km/h (35&nbsp;mph). These three-car driverless trains run on elevated rail and under the taxiways. The journey takes under two minutes. The Aerotrain operates between three and five-minute intervals between terminal. Automatic train controls manage the operation of the entire Aerotrain system, controlling the speeds, headways, stops and door openings in stations, and integrating functions that enhance the reliability and performance of the system.<ref name=\"Kiat.net: Kuala Lumpur International\">{{cite web|title=Kuala Lumpur International |url=http://kiat.net/klia/index.html |publisher=Kiat.net |accessdate=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503161615/http://www.kiat.net/klia/index.html |archivedate=3 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===External connections===\n\n====Rail====\n{{Main|Express Rail Link|KLIA Ekspres|KLIA Transit|Kuala Lumpur International Airport ERL station|klia2 ERL station}}\n\nKuala Lumpur International Airport is linked to the [[KL Sentral]] transportation hub in the city centre by the {{cvt|57|km}} long [[Express Rail Link]] (ERL). There are two ERL stations at the airport: [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport ERL station|KLIA station]] at the Main Terminal Building and [[klia2 ERL station|klia2 station]] at Gateway@klia2. The airport is served by two rail services on the ERL:\n* [[KLIA Ekspres]]: The dedicated [[airport rail link]] which runs non-stop between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 28 minutes to/from KLIA, and 33 minutes to/from klia2 with a two-minute stop at KLIA. The KLIA Ekspres terminal at KL Sentral is known as the [[KL Sentral#KL City Air Terminal|KL City Air Terminal]] (KL CAT), which has an [[IATA]] designation '''XKL'''. KL CAT offers in-town flight check-in service up to two hours before flight departure time for passengers travelling on [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Etihad Airways]], [[Malaysia Airlines]], [[Malindo Air]] and [[Royal Brunei Airlines]].\n* [[KLIA Transit]]: A [[commuter rail]] service which stops at three additional stops ([[Bandar Tasik Selatan station|Bandar Tasik Selatan]], [[Putrajaya/Cyberjaya ERL station|Putrajaya/Cyberjaya]] and [[Salak Tinggi ERL station|Salak Tinggi]]) between KL Sentral and KLIA. The journey takes 35 minutes to/from KLIA and 39 minutes to/from klia2. Check-in facilities are only through automated kiosks at KLIA Transit stations.\n\n===Taxis and limousine===\nAirport taxis or airport limousines are provided by Airport Limo. The taxis and limousines are readily available at the Taxi and Limousine counters. They run from airport itself to destinations in Klang Valley and Greater Klang Valley. The fares are to be paid at the counter and are charged according to the destinations' zone. A surcharge is applied for services between 12&nbsp;am to 5&nbsp;am\n\n===Bus===\nBoth public and private buses connect KLIA and klia2 to several points in Kuala Lumpur and beyond. Direct buses to the city centre take about an hour and run every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours. All buses are air-conditioned. Bus tickets to [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral station|KL Sentral]] transportation hub cost RM11 and to [[Putra Heights station|Putra Heights LRT station]] cost RM4.\n\n==Expansion and developments==\n\n===Plans===\n[[File:KLIAAeropolis.jpg|thumb|KLIA Aeropolis Masterplan]]\n\nWith the slight modification of the masterplan, the future Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be combined into one satellite terminal. The expansion of Terminal 2's satellite terminal will be exactly the same as Terminal 1's (the current Main Terminal) satellite terminal, where initially the satellite terminal will have four arms, and another four arms when the terminal reached its capacity. There is sufficient land and capacity to develop facilities to handle up to 97.5 million passengers a year, four runways by the year 2020 and two mega-terminals, each linked with satellite terminals.<ref name=\"KLIA Phases\"/>\n\n{| class=\"collapsible wikitable collapsed\" style=\"width: 70% ; font-size: 85%; border: #999 solid 1px; text-align: lcenter; margin-bottom: 0; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! colspan=5 style=\"background: #8B8589;\"| Summary of Kuala Lumpur International Airport Masterplan\n|- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:#d3d3d3;\"\n!Phase!!Year!!Description\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 1||1998||Initial Capacity of 25 million Passenger Per Annum\n|-\n|2006||Capable of Handling 35 million Passengers per annum with the construction of Low Cost Carrier Terminal\n|-\n|Phase 2||2008||Expansion of Low Cost Carrier Terminal to accommodate 40 Million Passengers per annum.\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Phase 3||2011||New Low Cost Carrier Terminal will be constructed to accommodate additional 30 million (55 million) passengers Per Annum, Current Low Cost Carrier Terminal converted to cargo usage.\n|-\n|Not fixed||Satellite Terminal B will be constructed to handle maximum of 75 million passengers.

KLIA is the only airport in Malaysia that accommodate the landing and take off of the A380. Upgrading works started on 3 April 2006, and was completed by 28 May 2007. Works include the provision of shoulders on both sides of the two existing runways of 15 meters as well as the taxiways, building additional aerobridges at the three departure halls, namely C17, C27 and C37, and enhancing the mezzanine lounges for upper deck passengers of the aircraft at the departure halls.
