''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''.

The overall character of the climate of the islands is influenced by the strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the [[North Atlantic Current]]. This, together with the remoteness of any source of landmass-induced warm or cold airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0&nbsp;\u00b0C or 37 to 39&nbsp;\u00b0F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5&nbsp;\u00b0C or 49 to 51&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe islands are windy, cloudy, and cool throughout the year with an average of 210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common. [[Hurricane Faith]] struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.<ref>GHCN Climate data, Thorshavn series 1881 to 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Funningsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (fjord) in October.jpg|left|thumb|An October evening on [[Eysturoy]]]]\nThe climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean currents, topography, and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

In earlier times, each ''s\u00fdsla'' had its own [[Thing (assembly)|assembly]], the so-called ''v\u00e1rting'' (\"spring assembly\").\n\n===Relationship with Denmark===\n{{Multiple issues|{{POV section|date=March 2020}}{{More citations needed section|date=March 2020}}|section=yes}}\nThe Faroe Islands have been under Norwegian-Danish control since 1388. The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]]. The Faroes are not grouped with the EU when it comes to international trade; for instance, when the EU and Russia imposed reciprocal trade sanctions on each other over the [[War in Donbass]] in 2014, the Faroes began exporting significant amounts of fresh [[salmon]] to Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/faeroe-islands-boom-by-selling-salmon-to-russia-1424483776|title=Faeroe Islands Boom by Selling Salmon to Russia|first=Anton|last=Troianovski|date=21 February 2015|publisher=|via=Wall Street Journal}}</ref> Moreover, a [[special member state territories and the European Union#Faroe Islands|protocol]] to the treaty of accession of Denmark to the European Communities stipulates that Danish nationals residing in the Faroe Islands are not considered Danish nationals within the meaning of the treaties. Hence, Danish people living in the Faroes are not [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] (though other EU nationals living there remain EU citizens). The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Relationship with international organisations===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

It is difficult to say exactly how many people worldwide speak the Faroese language, because many ethnic Faroese live in Denmark, and few who are born there return to the Faroes with their parents or as adults.\n\nFaroese belongs to the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] branch of [[Indo-European languages]]. Written Faroese (grammar and vocabulary) is most similar to [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and to their ancestor [[Old Norse]], though the spoken language is closer to [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] dialects of [[Western Norway]].

According to official statistics from 2019, 79.7% of the Faroese population are members of the state church, the [[Church of the Faroe Islands]] (F\u00f3lkakirkjan), a form of [[Lutheranism]].<ref>[https://statbank.hagstova.fo/pxweb/en/H2/H2__MM__MM03/atrud_prgj.px/ Parishes, 1st January (2000-2019)] Statistics Faroe Islands</ref> The F\u00f3lkakirkjan became an independent church in 2007; previously it had been a diocese within the [[Church of Denmark]]. Faroese members of the clergy who have had historical importance include [[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] (1819\u20131909), [[Fr\u00ed\u00f0rikur Petersen]] (1853\u20131917) and, perhaps most significantly, [[J\u00e1kup Dahl]] (1878\u20131944), who had a great influence in ensuring that the [[Faroese language]] was spoken in the church instead of [[Danish language|Danish]]. Participation in churches is more prevalent among the Faroese population than among most other Scandinavians.\n\nIn the late 1820s, the Christian [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] religious movement, the [[Plymouth Brethren]], was established in England. In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[T\u00f3rshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.\n[[File:Kunoy, Faroe Islands (2).JPG|thumb|Church in [[Kunoy]]]]\n\nThere are also around fifteen [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] who meet at four different places. The [[Ahmadiyya]]s established a community in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Si\u00f0r|Forn Si\u00f0r]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.\n\nThe best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the Maria Church, both of which are situated in T\u00f3rshavn; the church of [[F\u00e1mjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Hald\u00f3rsv\u00edk]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksv\u00edk]]; and also the two pictured here.\n\nIn 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Vider\u00f8 (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|archive-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Education===\n{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}\nThe levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education.

Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]].

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier. Some of the Faroese folk songs have been used by the Faroese Viking metal band [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], i.e., ''[[Ormurin Langi]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ormurin-Langi/dp/B0042GGCG4 |title=Ormurin Langi: T\u00fdr: MP3 Downloads |date=31 August 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[List of novels written in Faroese|Faroese novel]], ''B\u00e1belstorni\u00f0'' by [[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0]], was published in 1909; the second novel was published 18 years later.

Some of these writers have been nominated for the [[Nordic Council's Literature Prize]] two to six times, but have never won it.

[[B\u00e1r\u00f0ur Oskarsson]] (born 1972) is a children's book writer and illustrator; his books won prizes in the Faroes, Germany and the [[West Nordic Council's Children and Youth Literature Prize]] (2006). Though not born in the Faroe Islands, Matthew Landrum an American poet and editor for the Structo magazine, has written a collection of poems about the Islands.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].

''{{lang|fo|Oyar}}'' represents the plural of ''{{lang|fo|oy}}'', older Faroese for \"island\". Due to sound changes, the modern Faroese word for island is ''oyggj''. The first element, ''{{lang|fo|f\u00f8r}}'', may reflect an Old Norse word ''{{lang|non|f\u00e6r}}'' (sheep), although this analysis is sometimes disputed because Faroese now uses the word ''{{lang|fo|sey\u00f0ur}}'' (from Old Norse ''{{lang|non|sau\u00f0r}}'') to mean \"sheep\". Another possibility is that the Irish monks, who settled the island around 625, had already given the islands a name related to the Gaelic word ''{{lang|ga|fearrann}}'', meaning \"land\" or \"estate\". This name could then have been passed on to the Norwegian settlers, who then added ''{{lang|fo|oyar}}'' (islands).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=f%C3%A6r%C3%B8ske|title=f\u00e6r\u00f8ske \u2014 Den Danske Ordbog|website=ordnet.dk}}</ref> The name thus translates as either \"Islands of Sheep\" or \"Islands of Fearrann\".\n\nIn [[Danish language|Danish]], the name ''{{lang|da|F\u00e6r\u00f8erne}}'' contains the same elements, though ''{{lang|da|\u00f8erne}}'' is the definite plural of ''{{lang|da|\u00f8}}'' (island).\n\nIn English, it may be seen as redundant to say ''the Faroe Islands'', since the ''oe'' comes from an element meaning \"island\". This is seen in the [[BBC]] [[Shipping Forecast]], where the waters around the islands are called ''Faeroes''. The name is also sometimes spelled \"Faeroe\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Faroe Islands|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faroe+islands|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Faeroe Islands|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Faeroe%20Islands|website=[[Dictionary.com]]|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Faroe Islands}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\n\nArchaeological evidence shows settlers living on the Faroe Islands in two successive periods before the Norse arrived, the first between 300 and 600 AD and the second between 600 and 800 AD.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = M.

Norwegian control of the Faroes continued until 1814, although, when the [[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)]] entered the [[Kalmar Union]] with Denmark, it gradually resulted in Danish control of the islands.

The overall character of the climate of the islands is influenced by the strong warming influence of the Atlantic Ocean, which produces the [[North Atlantic Current]]. This, together with the remoteness of any source of landmass-induced warm or cold airflows, ensures that winters are mild (mean temperature 3.0 to 4.0&nbsp;\u00b0C or 37 to 39&nbsp;\u00b0F) while summers are cool (mean temperature 9.5 to 10.5&nbsp;\u00b0C or 49 to 51&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe islands are windy, cloudy, and cool throughout the year with an average of 210 rainy or snowy days per year. The islands lie in the path of depressions moving northeast, making strong winds and heavy rain possible at all times of the year. Sunny days are rare and overcast days are common. [[Hurricane Faith]] struck the Faroe Islands on 5 September 1966 with sustained winds over 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and only then did the storm cease to be a tropical system.<ref>GHCN Climate data, Thorshavn series 1881 to 2007</ref>\n\n[[File:Faroe Islands, Eysturoy, Funningsfj\u00f8r\u00f0ur (fjord) in October.jpg|left|thumb|An October evening on [[Eysturoy]]]]\nThe climate varies greatly over small distances, due to the altitude, ocean currents, topography, and winds. Precipitation varies considerably throughout the archipelago. In some highland areas, snow cover may last for months with snowfalls possible for the greater part of the year (on the highest peaks, summer snowfall is by no means rare), while in some sheltered coastal locations, several years pass without any snowfall whatsoever. T\u00f3rshavn receives frosts more often than other areas just a short distance to the south. Snow also is seen at a much higher frequency than on outlying islands nearby.

The 1814 [[Treaty of Kiel]] terminated the [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Danish\u2013Norwegian]] union, and Norway came under the rule of the [[King of Sweden]], while the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and [[Greenland]] remained Danish possessions. From ancient times the Faroe Islands had a parliament (''L\u00f8gting''), which was abolished in 1816, and the Faroe Islands were to be governed as an ordinary [[Counties of Denmark|Danish amt]] (county), with the [[Prefect|Amtmand]] as its head of government. In 1851, the ''L\u00f8gting'' was reinstated, but, until 1948, served mainly as an advisory body.\n\nThe islands are home to a notable [[Faroese independence|independence movement]] that has seen an increase in popularity within recent decades. At the end of [[World War II]], some of the population favoured independence from Denmark, and on 14 September 1946, [[1946 Faroese independence referendum|an independence referendum]] was held on the question of [[secession]]. It was a consultative referendum; the parliament was not bound to follow the people's vote. This was the first time that the Faroese people had been asked whether they favoured independence or wanted to continue within the [[Danish kingdom]].\n\n[[File:Queen Margrethe 21-06-2005 V\u00e1gur.jpg|thumb|left|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]], monarch of the [[Unity of the Realm]], during a visit to [[V\u00e1gur]] in 2005]]\nThe result of the vote was a majority in favour of secession. The Speaker of the L\u00f8gting, together with the majority, started the process of becoming a sovereign nation. The minority of the L\u00f8gting left in protest, because they thought these actions were illegal. One parliament member, J\u00e1kup \u00ed J\u00e1kupsstovu, was shunned from his own party, the Social Democratic Party, because he joined the majority of the L\u00f8gting.\n\nThe Speaker of the L\u00f8gting declared the Faroe Islands independent on 18 September 1946.\n\nOn 25 September 1946, a Danish prefect announced to the L\u00f8gting, that the king had dissolved the parliament and wanted new elections, therefore not honoring the wish of the majority.\n\nA parliamentary election was held a few months later, in which the political parties that favoured staying in the Danish kingdom increased their share of the vote and formed a coalition. Based on this, they chose to reject secession. Instead, a compromise was made and the [[Folketing]] passed a home-rule law that went into effect in 1948. The Faroe Islands' status as a Danish ''amt'' was thereby brought to an end; the Faroe Islands were given a high degree of self-governance, supported by a financial [[subsidy]] from Denmark to recompense expenses the islands have on Danish services.\n\nIn protest to the new Home Rule Act, the Republic Party (Tj\u00f3\u00f0veldi), was founded.\n\nAt present, the islanders are about evenly split between those favouring independence and those who prefer to continue as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Within both camps there is a wide range of opinions. Of those who favour independence, some are in favour of an immediate [[unilateral declaration of independence]]. Others see it as something to be attained gradually and with the full consent of the Danish government and the [[Danish nation]]. In the unionist camp there are also many who foresee and welcome a gradual increase in autonomy even while strong ties with Denmark are maintained.\n\n{{As of|2011}}, a new draft Faroese constitution is being drawn up. However the draft has been declared by the former [[Danish Prime Minister]], [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen]], as incompatible with Denmark's constitution and if the Faroese political parties wish to continue with it, then they must declare independence.<ref>[http://www.icenews.is/index.php/2011/07/06/denmark-and-faroe-islands-in-constitutional-clash/ Denmark and Faroe Islands in constitutional clash], IceNews 6 July 2011</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with the European Union ===\n{{main|Faroe Islands and the European Union}}\nAs explicitly asserted by both [[treaties of the European Union]], the Faroe Islands are not part of the [[European Union]].

The Faroes are not covered by the [[Schengen Agreement]], but there are no border checks when travelling between the Faroes and any Schengen country (the Faroes have been part of the [[Nordic Passport Union]] since 1966, and since 2001 there have been no permanent border checks between the Nordic countries and the rest of the [[Schengen Area]] as part of the Schengen agreement).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |title=Implementation of Schengen convention by the prime minister as approved by the L\u00f8gting |publisher=Tinganes.fo |date= |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721114619/http://www.tinganes.fo/logir/Rikislogartilmaeli/2001Schengen.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Relationship with international organisations ===\nThe Faroe Islands are not a fully independent country, but they do have political relations directly with other countries through agreement with Denmark.

Later, when the Vikings colonised the islands, there was a considerable increase in the population. However, it never exceeded 5,000 until the 19th century. Around 1349, about half the population perished in the [[Black Death]] plague.\n\nOnly with the rise of the deep-sea fishery (and thus independence from agriculture in the islands' harsh terrain) and with general progress in the health service was rapid population growth possible in the Faroes. Beginning in the 19th century, the population increased tenfold in 200 years.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the Faroe Islands entered a deep economic crisis leading to heavy emigration; however, this trend reversed in subsequent years to a net immigration. This has been in the form of a population replacement as young Faroese women leave and are replaced with Asian/Pacific brides.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-24637771|title=Faroe Islands: Men 'must import brides'|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2013}}</ref>\nIn 2011, there were 2,155 more men than women between the age of 0 to 59 in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.fo/news-detail/news/faid-kvinnurnar-heimaftur/|title=F\u00e1i\u00f0 kvinnurnar heimaftur|last=Rana|first=Danjal av|date=22 January 2015|publisher=Sosialurin \u2013 in.fo|language=Faroese|accessdate=4 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Faroese population is spread across most of the area; it was not until recent decades that significant urbanisation occurred. Industrialisation has been remarkably decentralised, and the area has therefore maintained quite a viable rural culture. Nevertheless, villages with poor harbour facilities have been the losers in the development from agriculture to fishing, and in the most peripheral agricultural areas, also known as [[\u00datoyggjar]] \"Outer Islands\", there are few young people. In recent decades, the village-based social structure has nevertheless been placed under pressure, giving way to a rise in interconnected \"centres\" that are better able to provide goods and services than the badly connected periphery. This means that shops and services are now relocating en masse from the villages into the centres, and slowly but steadily the Faroese population is concentrating in and around the centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the government abandoned the old national policy of developing the villages (Bygdamenning), and instead began a process of regional development (\u00d8kismenning). The term \"region\" referred to the large islands of the Faroes. Nevertheless, the government was unable to press through the structural reform of merging small rural municipalities to create sustainable, decentralised entities that could drive forward regional development. As regional development has been difficult on the administrative level, the government has instead invested heavily in infrastructure, interconnecting the regions.\n\nIn general, it is becoming less valid to regard the Faroes as a society based on separate islands and regions. The huge investments in roads, bridges and sub-sea tunnels (see also [[Transport in the Faroe Islands]]) have bound the islands together, creating a coherent economic and cultural sphere that covers almost 90% of the population. From this perspective it is reasonable to regard the Faroes as a dispersed city or even to refer to it as the ''Faroese Network City''.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}\n\n[[File:Faroe stamp 048 europe (v u hammershaimb).jpg|thumb|upright|A stamp commemorating [[V.

In 1865, a member of this movement, [[William Gibson Sloan]], travelled to the Faroes from [[Shetland]]. At the turn of the 20th century, the Faroese Plymouth Brethren numbered thirty. Today, around 10% of the Faroese population are members of the Open Brethren community (''Br\u00f8\u00f0rasamkoman''). About 3% belong to the [[Charismatic Movement]]. There are several charismatic churches around the islands, the largest of which, called Keldan (The Spring), has about 200 to 300 members. About 2% belong to other Christian groups. The [[Adventism|Adventists]] operate a private school in T\u00f3rshavn. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] also have four congregations with a total of 121 members. The Roman Catholic congregation has about 170 members and falls under the jurisdiction of Denmark's [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen]]. The municipality of [[T\u00f3rshavn]] has an old [[Franciscans|Franciscan]] school.\n[[File:Kunoy, Faroe Islands (2).JPG|thumb|Church in [[Kunoy]]]]\n\nThere are also around fifteen [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] who meet at four different places. The [[Ahmadiyya]]s established a community in the Faroe Islands in 2010. Unlike [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Iceland]] with [[Heathenry (new religious movement)#Forn Si\u00f0r|Forn Si\u00f0r]], the Faroes have no organised Heathen community.\n\nThe best-known church buildings in the Faroe Islands include [[T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral]], [[Olaf II of Norway]]'s Church and the [[Magnus Cathedral]] in [[Kirkjub\u00f8ur]]; the Vesturkirkjan and the Maria Church, both of which are situated in T\u00f3rshavn; the church of [[F\u00e1mjin]]; the octagonal church in [[Hald\u00f3rsv\u00edk]]; Christianskirkjan in [[Klaksv\u00edk]]; and also the two pictured here.\n\nIn 1948, Victor Danielsen (Plymouth Brethren) completed the first Bible translation into Faroese from different modern languages. Jacob Dahl and Kristian Osvald Vider\u00f8 (F\u00f3lkakirkjan) completed the second translation in 1961. The latter was translated from the original Biblical languages ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]) into Faroese.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there were 33,018 Christians (95.44%), 23 Muslims (0.07%), 7 [[Hindu]]s (0.02%), 66 [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] (0.19%), 12 [[Jews]] (0.03%), 13 Baha'i (0.04%), 3 [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] (0.01%), 149 others (0.43%), 85 with more than one belief (0.25%), and 1,397 with no religion (4.04%).<ref>{{cite web|title=CS 10.1.2 Population by religious faith, educational attainment, occupation, country of birth, year of arrival in the country and place of usual residence.|url=http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|website=Statistics Faroe Islands|accessdate=1 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002070910/http://www.hagstova.fo/en/statbank/census/2011/religion/religion-educaton-and-country-of-birth|archive-date=2 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main|Education in the Faroe Islands}}\nThe levels of education in the Faroe Islands are [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]] and [[higher education|higher]] education.

The F\u00f3lkask\u00fali also provides optional preschool education as well as the tenth year of education that is a prerequisite to get admitted to upper secondary education. Students that complete compulsory education are allowed to continue education in a [[vocational school]], where they can have job-specific training and education. Since the fishing industry is an important part of [[Economy of the Faroe Islands|country's economy]], maritime schools are an important part of Faroese education. Upon completion of the tenth year of F\u00f3lkask\u00fali, students can continue to upper secondary education which consists of several different types of schools. Higher education is offered at the [[University of the Faroe Islands]]; a part of Faroese youth moves abroad to pursue higher education, mainly in [[Denmark]]. Other forms of education comprise [[adult education]] and music schools.

The Faroe Islands were long isolated from the main cultural phases and movements that swept across parts of Europe. This means that they have maintained a great part of their traditional culture. The language spoken is [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which is one of three insular [[North Germanic languages]] descended from the [[Old Norse]] language spoken in Scandinavia in the [[Viking Age]], the others being [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]], which is thought to have been mutually intelligible with Faroese. Until the 15th century, Faroese had a similar orthography to Icelandic and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], but after the Reformation in 1538, the ruling [[Norway|Norwegians]] outlawed its use in schools, churches and official documents. Although a rich spoken tradition survived, for 300 years the language was not written down. This means that all poems and stories were handed down orally. These works were split into the following divisions: sagnir (historical), \u00e6vint\u00fdr (stories) and [[kv\u00e6\u00f0i]] (ballads), often set to music and the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] chain dance. These were eventually written down in the 19th century.\n\n===Faroese literature===\n{{main|Faroese literature}}\n[[File:Faroe stamp 364 rasmussen and skardi.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0|Rasmus Rasmussen]], the writer who wrote the first novel in the [[Faroese language]] (poetical name: Regin \u00ed L\u00ed\u00f0) and [[S\u00edmun av Skar\u00f0i]], the poet who wrote the Faroese national hymn]]\nFaroese written literature has only really developed in the past 100\u2013200 years. This is mainly because of the islands' isolation, and also because the [[Faroese language]] was not written down in a standardised format until 1890. The Danish language was also encouraged at the expense of Faroese. Nevertheless, the Faroes have produced several authors and poets. A rich centuries-old oral tradition of folk tales and Faroese folk songs accompanied the [[Faroese dance|Faroese chain dance]]. The people learned these songs and stories by heart, and told or sang them to each other, teaching the younger generations too. This kind of literature was gathered in the 19th century and early 20th century. The Faroese folk songs, in Faroese called ''kv\u00e6\u00f0i'', are still in use although not so large-scale as earlier.

Multiple Danish Music Award winner [[Teitur Lassen]] calls the Faroes home and is arguably the islands' most internationally well-known musical export.\n\nThe Islands have their own [[orchestra]] (the classical ensemble ''Aldub\u00e1ran'') and many different choirs; the best-known of these is ''Havnark\u00f3ri\u00f0''. The best-known local Faroese composers are [[Sunleif Rasmussen]] and [[Kristian Blak]], who is also head of the record company [[Tutl]]. The first Faroese opera was by Sunleif Rasmussen. It is entitled ''\u00cd \u00d3\u00f0amansgar\u00f0i'' (The Madman's Garden) and was premiered on 12 October 2006 at the Nordic House. The opera is based on a short story by the writer [[William Heinesen]].\n\nYoung Faroese musicians who have gained much popularity recently are [[Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir]], Anna Katrin Egilstr\u00f8\u00f0, Lena (Lena Andersen), [[H\u00f8gni Reistrup]], [[H\u00f8gni Lisberg]], HEI\u00d0RIK ([[Hei\u00f0rik \u00e1 Heygum]]), [[Gu\u00f0ri\u00f0 Hansd\u00f3ttir]] and [[Brandur Enni]].\n\nWell-known bands include [[T\u00fdr (band)|T\u00fdr]], Gestir, [[Hamfer\u00f0]], [[The Ghost (Faroese band)|The Ghost]], [[Boys in a Band]], ORKA, [[:fo:200 (rokkb\u00f3lkur)|200]], Grandma's Basement, [[Sic (band)|SIC]], and the former band Clickhaze.\n\nThe festival of contemporary and classical music, ''Summart\u00f3nar'', is held each summer. The [[G! Festival]] in [[Nor\u00f0rag\u00f8ta]] in July and [[Summarfestivalurin]] in [[Klaksv\u00edk]] in August are both large, open-air music festivals for popular music with both local and international musicians participating. Havnar Jazzfelag was established 21 November 1975, and is still active. Currently Havnar Jazzfelag is arranging VetrarJazz amongst other jazz-festivals in The Faroe Islands.\n\n===The Nordic House in the Faroe Islands===\nThe [[Nordic House in the Faroe Islands]] ({{lang-fo|Nor\u00f0urlandah\u00fasi\u00f0}}) is the most important cultural institution in the Faroes. Its aim is to support and promote [[Scandinavia]]n and Faroese culture, locally and in the Nordic region. [[Erlendur Patursson]] (1913\u201386), Faroese member of the [[Nordic Council]], raised the idea of a Nordic cultural house in the Faroe Islands. A Nordic competition for architects was held in 1977, in which 158 architects participated. Winners were Ola Steen from [[Norway]] and Kolbr\u00fan Ragnarsd\u00f3ttir from [[Iceland]]. By staying true to [[folklore]], the architects built the Nordic House to resemble an enchanted hill of [[elf|elves]]. The house opened in [[T\u00f3rshavn]] in 1983. The Nordic House is a cultural organization under the Nordic Council. The Nordic House is run by a steering committee of eight, of whom three are Faroese and five from other Nordic countries. There is also a local advisory body of fifteen members, representing Faroese cultural organizations. The House is managed by a director appointed by the steering committee for a four-year term.\n\n===Traditional food===\n{{main|Faroese cuisine}}\nTraditional Faroese food is mainly based on meat, seafood and potatoes and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the [[Faroe sheep]] is the basis of many meals, and one of the most popular treats is ''[[skerpikj\u00f8t]]'', well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The drying shed, known as a ''hjallur'', is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ''r\u00e6st kj\u00f8t'' (semi-dried mutton) and ''r\u00e6stur fiskur'', matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is ''[[tv\u00f8st og spik]]'', made from [[pilot whale]] meat and [[blubber]]. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with [[offal]] is ''[[garnat\u00e1lg]]''.) The tradition of consuming meat and blubber from pilot whales arises from the fact that a single kill can provide many meals. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do [[seabird]]s, such as [[Faroese puffin]]s, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.\n[[File:Dog as truck driver.jpg|thumb|right|Truck delivering [[Cadbury]] chocolate in the Faroe Islands]]\nThere are two breweries in the Faroe Islands. The first brewery is called [[F\u00f6roya Bj\u00f3r]] and has produced beer since 1888 with exports mainly to Iceland and Denmark. The second brewery is called Okkara Bryggjar\u00ed and was founded in 2010. A local specialty is ''fredrikk'', a special brew made in [[N\u00f3lsoy]]. Production of hard alcohol such as [[snaps]] is forbidden in the Faroe Islands, hence the Faroese [[akvavit]] is produced abroad.\n\nSince the friendly British occupation, the Faroese have been fond of British food, in particular [[fish and chips]] and British-style chocolate such as [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], which is found in many of the island's shops.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nordic holiday ideas |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/sep/02/scandinavia-holidays-sweden-lapland |work=The Guardian |date=2 September 2011|last = Dixon|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n\n===Whaling===\n{{main|Whaling in the Faroe Islands}}\n[[File:Whaling in the Faroe Islands in August 2012.JPG|thumb|Boats driving a pod of pilot whales into a bay of [[Su\u00f0uroy]] in 2012]]\nThere are records of drive hunts in the Faroe Islands dating from 1584.<ref>{{cite book |first=Philippa |last=Brakes |chapter=A background to whaling |year=2004 |editor=Philippa Brakes |editor2=Andrew Butterworth |editor3=Mark Simmonds |editor4=Philip Lymbery |title=Troubled Waters: A Review of the Welfare Implications of Modern Whaling Activities |isbn=0-9547065-0-1 |page=7 |chapter-url=http://www.wdcs.org/submissions_bin/troubledwaters.pdf}}</ref> [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands]] is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the [[International Whaling Commission]] as there are disagreements about the Commission's legal authority to regulate [[cetacea]]n hunts. Hundreds of [[long-finned pilot whale]]s (''Globicephala melaena'') could be killed in a year, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called ''grindadr\u00e1p'' in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level; anyone can participate. When a whale pod by chance is spotted near land the participating hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats and then slowly and quietly begin to drive the whales towards the chosen authorised bay.<ref name=\"Home\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/en/home/|title=Home|publisher=}}</ref> When a pod of whales has been stranded the killing is begun.\n\nFaroese animal welfare legislation, which also applies to whaling, requires that animals are killed as quickly and with as little suffering as possible. A regulation spinal lance is used to sever the [[spinal cord]], which also severs the major blood supply to the brain, ensuring both loss of consciousness and death within seconds. The spinal lance has been introduced as preferred standard equipment for killing pilot whales and has been shown to reduce killing time to 1\u20132 seconds.<ref name=\"Home\"/>\n\nThis \"grindadr\u00e1p\" is legal and provides food for many people in the Faroe Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm#Drivingthewhales |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324072829/http://www.whaling.fo/thepilot.htm |title=Whales and whaling in the Faroe Islands |publisher=Faroese Government |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=24 March 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031231236/http://www.wdcs.org/dan/publishing.nsf/allweb/99E632F7502FCC3B802568F20048794C |title=Why do whales and dolphins strand? |publisher=[[WDCS]] |accessdate=5 December 2006 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Nicole|last=Chrismar|date=28 July 2006|title=Dolphins Hunted for Sport and Fertilizer|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=2248161&page=1|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> However, a study has found whale meat and blubber to currently be contaminated with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and not recommended for human consumption, as too much may cause such adverse health effects as birth defects of the nervous system, high blood pressure, damaged immune system, increased risk for developing [[Parkinson's disease]], [[hypertension]], [[arteriosclerosis]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]]:\n{{quote|Therefore we recommend that adults eat no more than one to two meals a month.

Garments include sweaters, scarves, and gloves. Faroese jumpers have distinct Nordic patterns; each village has some regional variations handed down from mother to daughter. There has recently been a strong revival of interest in Faroese knitting, with young people knitting and wearing updated versions of old patterns emphasized by strong colours and bold patterns. This appears to be a reaction to the loss of traditional lifestyles, and as a way to maintain and assert cultural tradition in a rapidly-changing society. Many young people study and move abroad, and this helps them maintain cultural links with their specific Faroese heritage.\n\nThere has also been a great interest in Faroese [[sweater]]s<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/10/sarah-lund-jumper-copyright-the-killing|title=Sarah Lund's jumper is exhibit A in a legal battle|first=Mark|last=Townsend|date=9 August 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> from the TV series ''[[The Killing (Danish TV series)|The Killing]]'', where the main actress (Detective Inspector Sarah Lund, played by [[Sofie Gr\u00e5b\u00f8l]]) wears Faroese sweaters.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9533226/Fans-of-The-Killing-can-now-knit-their-own-Sarah-Lund-jumper.html|title=Fans of 'The Killing' can now knit their own Sarah Lund jumper|last=Hall|first=James|date=2012-09-10|access-date=2020-01-28|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\n[[Lace knitting]] is a traditional handicraft. The most distinctive trait of [[Faroese lace shawls]] is the centre-back [[gusset]] shaping. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually shoulder shaping. These are worn by all generations of women, particularly as part of the traditional Faroese costume as an overgarment.\n\n[[File:Faroese folk dance club from vagar.jpg|thumb|left|Faroese folk dancers, some of them in national costume]]\nThe traditional Faroese national dress is also a local handicraft that people spend a lot of time, money, and effort to assemble. It is worn at weddings and traditional dancing events, and on feast days. The cultural significance of the garment should not be underestimated, both as an expression of local and national identity and a passing on and reinforcing of traditional skills that bind local communities together.\n\nA young Faroese person is normally handed down a set of children's Faroese clothes that have passed from generation to generation. Children are [[confirmed]] at age 14, and normally start to collect the pieces to make an adult outfit, which is considered as a rite of passage. Traditionally the aim would have been to complete the outfit by the time a young person was ready to marry and wear the clothes at the ceremony\u2014though it is mainly only men who do this now.\n\nEach piece is intricately hand-knitted, dyed, woven or embroidered to the specifications of the wearer. For example, the man's waistcoat is put together by hand in bright blue, red or black fine wool. The front is then intricately embroidered with colourful silk threads, often by a female relative. The motifs are often local Faroese flowers or herbs. After this, a row of Faroese-made solid silver buttons are sewn on the outfit.\n\nWomen wear embroidered silk, cotton or wool shawls and pinafores that can take months to weave or embroider with local flora and fauna. They are also adorned with a handwoven black and red ankle-length skirt, knitted black and red jumper, a velvet belt, and black 18th century style shoes with silver buckles. The outfit is held together by a row of solid silver buttons, silver chains and locally-made silver brooches and belt buckles, often fashioned with Viking style motifs.\n\nBoth men's and women's national dress are extremely costly and can take many years to assemble. Women in the family often work together to assemble the outfits, including knitting the close-fitting jumpers, weaving and embroidering, sewing and assembling the national dress.\n\nThis tradition binds together families, passes on traditional crafts, and reinforces the Faroese culture of traditional village life in the context of a modern society.\n\n===Public holidays===\n[[File:F\u00f8roysk fl\u00f8gg \u00e1 \u00d3lavs\u00f8ku.jpg|thumb|The annual ''\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka'' parade on 28 July 2005.]]\n{{see also|Public holidays in Denmark}}\n''[[\u00d3lavs\u00f8ka]]'' is on 29 July; it commemorates the death of [[Saint Olaf]].
