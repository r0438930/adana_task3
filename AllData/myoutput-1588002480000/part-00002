Saks has been an influential figure in the field of [[social psychology]] and has been recognized for his contributions to improving jury functioning. In 1976, the Supreme Court considered the monumental case ([[Williams v. Florida]]) in which Williams attempted to have his conviction overturned on the grounds that the jury consisted of only six individuals. The Supreme Court ruled that a jury of six individuals is large enough to fulfill the roles and duties of a jury while representing the community accurately. It was presumed that a jury of six was sufficient to protect its members and promote adequate group deliberation. Saks suggested that the Supreme Court should have considered aspects of [[Group dynamics]] when making this decision. He explained that modifying jury size is likely to influence:\n\n1. ''Group Structure'': Smaller Juries are more cohesive and individuals tend to participate at more equal rates. Members of larger juries on the other hand, exchange more information.\n\n2. ''Representativeness'': Saks concluded that smaller juries were not as representative as larger juries. That is, if a community was 10% Latino and 90% Anglo, it is probable that approximately 80% of 12 member juries would include at least one Latino member, while only 40% of 6 member juries would consist of any Latinos.\n\n3. ''Majority Influence'': The influence of a majority is more likely in smaller juries, while the influence of a minority would be more likely in a larger group as dissenters are more likely to find at least one other who shares their opinion.\n\nSaks disputed that a common error inferred by the Court was the assumption that a 5 to 1 vote in a 6-person jury was equivalent to a 10\u20132 split in a 12-person jury. In the situation of the 10 to 2 vote, the dissenting individual would be accompanied by a partner while in the 5 to 1 vote he or she faces the majority alone. Considering this phenomenon, Saks concluded that likelihood of a hung jury is more likely in larger-sized juries.<ref>Forsyth, D.R.
