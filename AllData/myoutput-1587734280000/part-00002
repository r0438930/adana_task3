most of Amos's albums, is also known for its collection of original b-sides. Amos recorded a host of songs that did not make the album, but were released as b-sides to various singles or performed live in concerts. The songs \"Cooling,\" \"Never Seen Blue,\" and \"Beulah Land\" were originally written and recorded for 1996's ''[[Boys for Pele]]'' album. In 2010, several tracks from a demo CD for the album leaked online, including a new track entitled \"Violet's Eyes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LVkxX1Euq0 |title=Tori Amos \u2013 Violet's Eyes (demo) |via=YouTube |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> Parts of this song were included in two tracks on 2007's [[American Doll Posse]], \"Almost Rosey\" and \"Miracle\".\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

most of Amos's albums, is also known for its collection of original b-sides. Amos recorded a host of songs that did not make the album, but were released as b-sides to various singles or performed live in concerts. The songs \"Cooling,\" \"Never Seen Blue,\" and \"Beulah Land\" were originally written and recorded for 1996's ''[[Boys for Pele]]'' album. In 2010, several tracks from a demo CD for the album leaked online, including a new track entitled \"Violet's Eyes\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LVkxX1Euq0 |title=Tori Amos \u2013 Violet's Eyes (demo) |via=YouTube |date=July 8, 2010 |accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref> Parts of this song were included in two tracks on 2007's [[American Doll Posse]], \"Almost Rosey\" and \"Miracle\".\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!
