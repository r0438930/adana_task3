If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that \"brand\" now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even further into services (such as legal, financial and medical), political parties and people (e.g. [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Katy Perry]]). Branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice.\n\nIn the modern era, the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the [[marketing]] and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand's identity, personality, product design, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |first=Bhimrao M|last=Ghodeswar|title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model |journal=Journal of Product & Brand Management |publisher=Emerald Publishing|location=Bingely, West Yorkshire, England|volume=17 |pages=4\u201312 |date=2008|doi=10.1108/10610420810856468 }}</ref> Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, hence branding is among a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].<ref>ranchhod, 2004</ref>\n\n[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|first=Kevin Lane|last=Keller|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|journal=Journal of Marketing|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|volume=57|issue=1|date=January 1, 1993|pages=1\u201322|jstor=1252054|doi=10.2307/1252054}}</ref> As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is built by the deployment of  marketing techniques to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.<ref name=\":0\"/> A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits.<ref name=\":0\"/> When a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably to its competitors, a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.<ref name=\":1\"/> Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]], is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value.  [[Brand valuation]] is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.\n\nThe word \u2018brand\u2019 is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. [[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''[[commodity brand]]'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word, ''brand'', derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning piece of wood. That word comes from the [[Old High German]], ''brinnan'' and [[Old English]] ''byrnan'', ''biernan'', and ''brinnan'' via [[Middle English]] as ''birnan'' and ''brond''.<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=Webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary|date=1983|location=Springfield, Massachusetts}}</ref> Torches were used to indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying marks into the skin of slaves and livestock.

Packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. Gradually, manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market. Marketers generally began to realize that brands, to which personalities were attached, outsold rival brands.<ref>Arnold E. J. and Thompson C. J., \"Consumer Culture Theory (CCT): Twenty Years of Research,\" Journal of Consumer Research,'' vol. 31, 2005, pp 868\u2013882</ref> By the 1880s large manufacturers had learned to imbue their brands' [[brand identity|identity]] with [[personality]] traits such as youthfulness, fun, sex appeal, luxury or the \"cool\" factor. This began the modern practice now known as ''branding'', where the consumers buy ''the brand'' instead of the product and rely on the brand name instead of a retailer's recommendation.\n\nThe process of giving a brand \"human\" characteristics represented, at least in part, a response to consumer concerns about mass-produced goods.<ref>Haig, M., ''Brand Failures: The truth about the 100 biggest branding mistakes of all time,'' London, Kogan-Page, 2005, p.3</ref> The [[Quaker Oats Company]] began using the image of the ''[[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker man]]'' in place of a trademark from the late 1870s, with great success.<ref>Petty, R.D., \"A History of Brand Identity Protection and Brand Marketing,\" in ''The Routledge Companion to Marketing History,'' D.G.

Brand development, often the task of a [[design]] [[team]], takes time to produce.\n\n===Brand names and trademarks===\n{{See|Trademark|Trademark symbol}}\n[[File:CocaColaBottle.jpg|thumb|''[[Coca-Cola]]'' is a brand name, while the distinctive [[Spencerian script]] and the [[contour bottle]] are [[Trademark|trademarked]]]]\nA brand name is the part of a brand that can be spoken or written and ''identifies'' a product, service or company  and sets it apart from other comparable products within a category. A brand name may include words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or any combination of these elements. For consumers, a brand name is a \"memory heuristic\": a convenient way to remember preferred product choices. A brand name is not to be confused with a ''trademark'' which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected.<ref>Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 296</ref> For example, Coca-Cola not only protects the brand name, ''Coca-Cola'', but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle.\n\nIt appears that a brand name and the relationship the consumer keep with the brand as a whole has evolved. From the simple product recognition process a brand name now holds a symbolic and social identification spectrum. [fournier 1998] For example, one can buy Nike because they want to be associated with the kind of people who wear Nike and with the values and attributes of that brand. More than a product it\u2019s a statement that one should seek to purchase by proxy of the brand [Belk 1988].\n\n===Corporate brand identity===\nThe brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of images, a slogan, a vision, a design, writing style, a particular font or a symbol etc. which sets the brand aside from others.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}</ref><ref>\nCompare: {{cite book\n| last1 = Franzen\n| first1 = Giep\n| last2 = Moriarty\n| first2 = Sandra E.\n| orig-year = 2009\n| chapter = 1: The Brand as a System\n| title = The Science and Art of Branding\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mWSmBgAAQBAJ\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2015\n| page = 19\n| isbn = 9781317454670\n| access-date = 2016-08-16\n| quote = This deeper meaning, the core values, character, or essence of a brand, is what Upshaw (1995) refers to when they use the term ''brand identity''.

(2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:\n\n# attributes\n# benefits\n# values\n# personality\n\nA brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.<ref name=\":2\" /> These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.<ref name=\":2\" /> If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a \"just do it\" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value.

Marketers tend to treat brands as more than the difference between the actual cost of a product and its selling price; rather brands represent the sum of all valuable qualities of a product to the consumer and are often treated as the total investment in brand building activities including marketing communications.<ref>Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, pp  295\u201397</ref>\n\nConsumers may look on branding as an aspect of products or services,{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} as it often serves to denote a certain attractive quality or characteristic (see also [[#Brand promise|brand promise]]). From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.\n\n===Brand awareness===\n\n{{Main|Brand awareness}}\n[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognize brands, logos, and branded advertising. Brands help customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers & potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category.\n\nBrand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing.

Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMarketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').<ref>Belch, G. E., & Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012{{page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref> These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.\n\n* Most companies aim for \"'''Top-of-Mind'''\" which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, \"Kleenex\", will represent a top-of-mind brand. Top-of-mind awareness is a special case of brand recall.\n* '''Brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand awareness'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category\n* '''Brand recognition''' (also known as ''aided brand awareness'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.\n* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.\n\n===Brand recognition===\n\n'''Brand recognition''' is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.<ref name=\":5\" /> Brand recognition (also known as ''aided brand recall'') refers to consumers' ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name. When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as a toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. When given some type of cue, consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, they exhibit brand recognition.<ref name=\":1\" /> Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8 |title=Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=48 |pages=5\u201315 |year=2000 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Emma K |last2=Sharp |first2=Byron M }}</ref>\n\nBrand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in [[retail]] shopping environments. When presented with a product at the point-of-sale, or after viewing its visual packaging, consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word-of-mouth referrals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology & Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263\u2013274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}</ref> In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it.\n\nBrand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}</ref> For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's \"signature\" [[logo]]), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].\n\n=== Brand recall===\n\nUnlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand recall'' or ''spontaneous brand recall'') is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory.<ref name=\":1\" /> Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need. This level of brand awareness is stronger than brand recognition, as the brand must be firmly cemented in the consumer's memory to enable unassisted remembrance.<ref name=\":5\" /> This gives the company huge advantage over its competitors because the customer is already willing to buy or at least know the company offering available in the market. Thus, brand recall is a confirmation that previous branding [[touchpoint]]s have successfully fermented in the minds of its consumers.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n[[Marketing mix modeling|Marketing-mix modeling]] can help [[marketing leader]]s optimize how they spend marketing budgets to maximize the impact on brand awareness or on sales.

Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate \u2013 defines a touch point. According to Dahlen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the \"\u2026potential to add positive \u2013 or suppress negative \u2013 associations to the brand's equity\" <ref name=\":8\" /> Thus, a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.<ref name=\":9\" /> For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilizing the best communication channel is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].<ref name=\":2\" /> As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognize that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nBrand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Ebru|last1=Uzuno\u011flu |first2=Sema|last2=Misci Kip|title=Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=34 |issue=5 |page=592 |date=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.04.007 }}</ref> One method of brand communication that companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM).

In this context, a \"brand name\" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through [[trademark registration]] \u2013 such trademarks are called \"Registered Trademarks\". Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].\n\n====Types of brand names====\nBrand names come in many styles.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}</ref>\nA few include:\n* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as \"UPS\" or \"IBM\"\n* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as \"Whole Foods\" or \"Toys R' Us\"\n* '''[[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]]''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as \"Reese's Pieces\" or \"[[Dunkin' Donuts]]\"\n* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as \"Amazon\" or \"Crest\"\n* '''[[neologism]]s''': completely made-up words, such as \"[[Wii]]\" or \"[[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]]\"\n* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as \"[[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]\" or \"[[Samsung]]\"\n* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's surname), such as \"[[Hewlett-Packard]]\", \"[[Dell]]\", \"[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]\", \"Stussy\" or \"Mars\"\n* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as \"[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]\" or \"[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]\"\n* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|\"Nike\"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as \"[[Betty Crocker]]\"\n* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as \"[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]\", \"Wok on Water\" or \"Eggs Eggscetera\"\n*'''[[portmanteau]]''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as \"[[Microsoft]]\" (\"microcomputer\" and \"software\"), \"[[Comcast]]\" (\"communications\" and \"broadcast\"), \"[[Evernote]]\" (\"forever\" and \"note\"), \"[[Vodafone]]\" (\"voice\", \"data\", \"telephone\")\n\nThe act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]\u2014which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word \"copy\".\n\n===Brand line===\nA brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].\n\n[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group <ref>{{cite web|url=http://product.okfn.org|title=Open Product Data|website=Open Product Data}}</ref> of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.\n\n===Brand identity===\n{{Main|Corporate identity}}\nThe expression of a brand \u2013 including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance \u2013 is brand identity.<ref name=\"Dictionary of Brand\">{{cite book|first=Marty|last=Neumeier|title=The Dictionary of Brand|publisher=AIGA Center for Brand Experience |location=New York City|date=2004|isbn=978-1-884081-06-4|page=20}}</ref> Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand \u2013 and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.<ref name=\"Dictionary of Brand\" /> The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.\n\nBrand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications, an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.\n\nThe brand identity works as a guideline, as the frame in which a brand will evolve and define itself, or in the words of David Aaker, \u201c\u2026a unique set of brand associations that the brand strategist aspires to create or maintain.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kapferer (2007), there are 6 facets to a brand\u2019s identity:\n\n* Physique: The physical characteristics and iconography of your brand ( such as the Nike swoosh or the orange pantone of easyJet).\n* Personality: The persona, how a brand communicates with their audience, which is expressed through its tone of voice, design assets and then integrates this into communication touchpoints in a coherent way.\n* Culture: The values,the principles on which a brand bases its behaviour. For example, Google flexible office hours and fun environment so the employees feel happy and creative at work.\n* Reflection: The \u201cstereotypical user\u201d of the brand. A brand is likely to be purchased by several buyer\u2019s profiles but they will have a go-to person that they use in their campaigns. For example Lou Yetu and the Parisian chic profile.\n* Relationship: The bond between a brand and its customers, and the customer expectations of the brand (the experience beyond the tangible product). Such as warranties or services during and after purchase help maintain a sustainable relationship and keep the consumer trust.\n\nSelf-image: How does one brand-customer portrays their ideal self \u2013 how they want to look and behave; what they aspire to \u2013 brands can target their messaging accordingly and make the brand\u2019s aspirations reflect theirs.\n\n====Visual brand identity====\n[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]\n\nA brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement \u2013 simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of \"Less is more\") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [[Paul Rand]] and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.\n\nColor is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Zena|last=O'Connor |title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping |journal=Color Research & Application |volume=36 |date=December 10, 2010|doi=10.1002/col.20594|pages=55\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Brand trust===\nBrand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Arjun |title=Product class effects on brand commitment and brand outcomes: The role of brand trust and brand affect |journal=Journal of Brand Management |date=14 February 2002 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201358 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540100 |url=https://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/content_policy.pdf }}</ref> This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, the perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies. Brand trust is often used as an important part of developing the portrayal of the business globally. Foreign companies will often use names that are associated with quality, in order to entrust the brand itself. An example would be a Chinese company using a German name.\n\n''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of the action, behavior, communication, and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. The action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in transferring the trust experience to audiences who have never experienced the brand, the all-important secondary audience.\n\n===Brand parity===\nBrand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Paul S. |last1=Richardson|first2=Alan S. |last2=Dick |first3=Arun K.|last3=Jain |title=Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=58 |issue=4 |page=28 |date=October 1994 |doi=10.2307/1251914 |jstor=1251914 }}</ref> This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.\n\n==Expanding role of brands==\nThe original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products. Over time, manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality. Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.\n\nToday, brands play a much bigger role. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention, makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Shayna|last=Smilovitz|url= https://instapage.com/blog/emotional-marketing|title=Emotional Marketing Examples Scientifically Proven To Sway Buyers|website=Instapage|date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate= February 9, 2019 }}</ref> Cultural conflict over a brand's meaning has also influences the diffusion of an innovation.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Markus|last=Giesler|title=How Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=76|issue=6|pages=55\u201368|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=November 2012|doi=10.1509/jm.10.0406}}</ref>\n\n==Branding strategies==\n{{See|Brand management}}\n\n===Company name===\nOften, especially in the industrial sector, [[brand engineer]]s will promote a company's name.

A change in corporate naming may also have a role in seeking to shed an undesirable image: for example, [[Werner Erhard and Associates]] re-branded its activities as [[Landmark Education]] in 1991 at a time when publicity in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigative-report broadcast cast the [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] and [[Werner Erhard]] brands in a negative light,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= https://boingboing.net/2009/08/31/suppressed-60-minute.html\n |url-access=\n |title= Wikileaks re-publishes 60 Minutes piece on est/Landmark cult leader Werner Erhard\n |last= Jardin\n |first= Xeni\n |author-link= Xeni Jardin\n |date= 31 Aug 2009\n |publisher= Boing Boing\n |access-date= 28 Apr 2019\n |quote= Wikileaks has published the video and transcript of an investigative report into \"est\" (Erhard Seminars Training) guru and Landmark Education Forum godfather Werner Erhard by CBS News, originally broadcast on the program 60 Minutes on March 3, 1991. \n}}\n</ref>\nand [[Union Carbide India Limited]] became [[Eveready Industries India]] in 1994 subsequent to the [[Bhopal disaster]] of 1984\n\n===Individual branding===\n{{Main|Individual branding}}\nEach brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]])), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).\n\n===Challenger brands===\n{{main|Challenger brand}}\nA challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader nor a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset that sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.\n\n===Multiproduct branding strategy===\nMultiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all its products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  \nOther examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church & Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk-inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church & Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm & Hammer (brand)|Arm & Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. A multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.\n\n====Product line extension====\n{{main|Product line extension}}\nA product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], primarily a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.\n\n====Subbranding====\n{{main|Subbranding}}\nSubbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].\n\n====Brand extension====\n{{main|Brand extension}}\nBrand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.\n\n====Co-branding====\n{{main|Co-branding}}\nCo-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.\n\n===Multibranding strategy===\nMultibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head & Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].\n\nThis approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.\n\n====Fighting brands====\n{{main|Fighter brand}}\nThe main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.\n\n===Private branding strategy===\n\n{{main|Store brand}}\nPrivate branding (also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands) have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.\n\n===Mixed branding strategy===\nMixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. \nFor example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the \"skin simple\" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.\n\n===Attitude branding and iconic brands===\nAttitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 1999 book ''[[No Logo]]'', [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a \"fetish strategy\".<ref name=\"nologo\">{{cite book|first=Naomi|last=Klein|authorlink=Naomi Klein|title=No Logo|publisher=Knopf Canada |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=1999|isbn=978-0-676-97282-5|page=141|title-link=No Logo}}</ref> Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Ben & Jerry's]] or [[Chanel]] describing them as 'Ueber-Brands' \u2013 brands that are able to gain and retain \"meaning beyond the material.\"<ref name=\"uber=brands\">{{cite book|first1=Wolf|last1=Schaefer|first2=JP|last2=Kuehlwein|title=Rethinking Prestige Branding \u2013 Secrets of the Ueber-Brands|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=London, England|date= 2015|isbn=9780749470036|page=17}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A great brand raises the bar \u2013 it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. \u2013 [[Howard Schultz]] (President, CEO, and Chairman of [[Starbucks]])\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:English & Hebrew Coke labels.jpg|thumb|alt=Bottles of Coca-Cola with labels printed in English and Hebrew|The color, letter font and style of the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Diet Coke|Diet Coca-Cola]] [[logo]]s in [[English language|English]] were copied into matching [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] logos to maintain brand identity in Israel.]]\n\nIconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be \"identity brands\". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them \"iconic brands\". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.\n\nThere are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):\n# \"Necessary conditions\" \u2013 The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.\n# \"Myth-making\" \u2013 A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.\n# \"Cultural contradictions\" \u2013 Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.\n# \"The cultural brand management process\" \u2013 Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.\n\nSchaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:<ref name=\"uber=brands\"/>\n# \"Mission Incomparable\" \u2013 Having a differentiated and meaningful brand purpose beyond 'making money.'<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Wolf|last1=Schaefer |first2=J.|last2=Kuehlwein |title=Ueber-Branding: How modern prestige brands create meaning through mission and myth \u2013 Part 1 |journal=Journal of Brand Strategy |publisher=Henry Stewart Publications|location=London, England|volume=5 |issue=4 |date=26 June 2016|pages=395\u2013409 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/jbs/2017/00000005/00000004/art00006 }}</ref>  Setting rules that follow this purpose \u2013 even when it violates the mass marketing mantra of \"Consumer is always Boss/right\".\n# \"Longing versus Belonging\" \u2013 Playing with the opposing desires of people for Inclusion on the one hand and Exclusivity on the other. \n# \"Un-Selling\" \u2013 First and foremost seeking to seduce through pride and provocation, rather than to sell through arguments.<ref>Kuehlwein, JP.

Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means \"No label\" in English (from \u7121\u5370\u826f\u54c1 \u2013 \"Mujirushi Ryohin\" \u2013 literally, \"No brand quality goods\"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no-name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |accessdate=2013-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024950/http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |archive-date=2013-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Heig, Matt.

It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.\n\n==={{anchor|derivative}} Derived brands<!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy]] [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] -->===\n\n{{See|Derived demand}}\nIn this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) \"[[Intel Inside]]\".\n\n===Brand extension and brand dilution===\n\n{{See|brand extension}}\nThe existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;\nfor example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.\n\nMars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.\n\nThere is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.\nWhen [[Coca-Cola]] launched \"Diet Coke\" and \"Cherry Coke\", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.\n\nThe risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Social media brands===\nIn ''The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy'' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. \"We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us \u2013 but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see.\"<ref name=\"Media Democracy\">{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Pont|title=The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=London, England|date=2013|isbn=978-0749466213}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-brands===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\nAlternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the shares of the market which will, in any case, go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as a multi-brand strategy.\n\nIndividual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what\nbusiness the company is in or diluting higher quality products.\n\n[[Procter & Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this approach to branding, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of \"facings\" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses the approach to keep the very different parts of the business separate\u2014from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).\n\n[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular challenge with a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.\n\n===Private labels===\n\n{{See|Private label}}\n[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks & Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this \"own brand\" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.\n\n'''Designer Private Labels'''\n\nA relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer's budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.\n\nIn Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and \u2018L\u2019 for Lisa Ho.<ref>Schetzer, A., \"Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html</ref> Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers \u2018Collette\u2019 for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.<ref>Roy Morgan Research,\"Private Label Could be the New Black\" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337</ref> Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her \u201cPetites\u2019 range.<ref>Roy Morgan Research, \"Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion,\" Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520</ref> Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frame designed by Peter Morrissey.\n\n===Individual and organizational brands===\nWith the development of the brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.<ref name=\"The Wall Street Journal\">{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}</ref> There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is to leave a social impact so their brand becomes associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims.

Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people.

Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state \"and the successful transference of this image to its exports \u2013 is just as important as what they actually produce and sell.\"\n\n===Destination branding===\n\nDestination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations. The Destination Marketing Association International is the industry leading organization.\n\n==Doppelg\u00e4nger brand image (DBI)==\n{{Main|Doppelg\u00e4nger brand image}}\nA [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] brand image or \"DBI\"  is a disparaging image or story about a brand that it circulated in popular culture. DBI targets tend to be widely known and recognizable brands. The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.<ref name=\"Thompson 50\u201364\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50 |title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Image |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=70 |pages=50\u201364 |year=2006 |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig J |last2=Rindfleisch |first2=Aric |last3=Arsel |first3=Zeynep }}</ref>\n\nThe term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''g\u00e4nger'' (walker).\n\nDoppelg\u00e4nger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.\n\nDue to the ability of Doppelg\u00e4nger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand.

If a person stole any of the cattle, anyone else who saw the symbol could deduce the actual owner. The term has been extended to mean a strategic personality for a product or company, so that \"brand\" now suggests the values and promises that a consumer may perceive and buy into. Over time the practice of branding objects extended to a broader range of packaging and goods offered for sale including oil, wine, cosmetics, and fish sauce and, in the 21st century, extends even further into services (such as legal, financial and medical), political parties and people (e.g. [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Katy Perry]]). Branding in terms of painting a cow with symbols or colors at flea markets was considered to be one of the oldest forms of the practice.\n\nIn the modern era, the concept of branding has expanded to include deployment by a manager of the [[marketing]] and communication techniques and tools that help to distinguish a [[company]] or products from competitors, aiming to create a lasting impression in the minds of [[customer]]s. The key components that form a brand's toolbox include a brand's identity, personality, product design, brand communication (such as by [[logo]]s and [[trademark]]s), [[brand awareness]], [[brand loyalty]], and various branding ([[brand management]]) strategies.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal |first=Bhimrao M|last=Ghodeswar|title=Building brand identity in competitive markets: A conceptual model |journal=Journal of Product & Brand Management |publisher=Emerald Publishing|location=Bingely, West Yorkshire, England|volume=17 |pages=4\u201312 |date=2008|doi=10.1108/10610420810856468 }}</ref> Many companies believe that there is often little to differentiate between several types of products in the 21st century, hence branding is among a few remaining forms of [[product differentiation]].<ref>ranchhod, 2004</ref>\n\n[[Brand equity]] is the measurable totality of a brand's worth and is validated by observing the effectiveness of these branding components.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|first=Kevin Lane|last=Keller|title=Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity|journal=Journal of Marketing|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|volume=57|issue=1|date=January 1, 1993|pages=1\u201322|jstor=1252054|doi=10.2307/1252054}}</ref> As markets become increasingly dynamic and fluctuating, brand equity is built by the deployment of  marketing techniques to increase customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, with side effects like reduced price sensitivity.<ref name=\":0\"/> A brand is, in essence, a promise to its customers of what they can expect from products and may include emotional as well as functional benefits.<ref name=\":0\"/> When a customer is familiar with a brand or favors it incomparably to its competitors, a corporation has reached a high level of brand equity.<ref name=\":1\"/> Special accounting standards have been devised to assess brand equity. In accounting, a brand defined as an [[intangible asset]], is often the most valuable asset on a corporation's balance sheet. Brand owners manage their brands carefully to create shareholder value.  [[Brand valuation]] is a management technique that ascribes a monetary value to a brand, and allows marketing investment to be managed (e.g.: prioritized across a portfolio of brands) to maximize shareholder value. Although only acquired brands appear on a company's balance sheet, the notion of putting a value on a brand forces marketing leaders to be focused on long term stewardship of the brand and managing for value.\n\nThe word \u2018brand\u2019 is often used as a [[Metonymy|metonym]] referring to the company that is strongly identified with a brand. [[wikt:marque|Marque]] or [[wikt:make|make]] are often used to denote a brand of [[motor vehicle]], which may be distinguished from a [[car model]]. A ''concept brand'' is a brand that is associated with an abstract concept, like [[breast cancer awareness]] or [[environmentalism]], rather than a specific product, service, or business. A ''[[commodity brand]]'' is a brand associated with a [[commodity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word, ''brand'', derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a burning piece of wood. That word comes from the [[Old High German]], ''brinnan'' and [[Old English]] ''byrnan'', ''biernan'', and ''brinnan'' via [[Middle English]] as ''birnan'' and ''brond''.<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=Webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary|date=1983|location=Springfield, Massachusetts}}</ref> Torches were used to indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn identifying marks into the skin of slaves and livestock.

Packaged-goods manufacturers needed to convince the market that the public could place just as much trust in the non-local product. Gradually, manufacturers began using personal identifiers to differentiate their goods from generic products on the market. Marketers generally began to realize that brands, to which personalities were attached, outsold rival brands.<ref>Arnold E. J. and Thompson C.

A brand name may include words, phrases, signs, symbols, designs, or any combination of these elements. For consumers, a brand name is a \"memory heuristic\": a convenient way to remember preferred product choices. A brand name is not to be confused with a ''trademark'' which refers to the brand name or part of a brand that is legally protected.<ref>Pride, W.M., Ferrell, O.C., Lukas, B.A., Schembri, S., Niininen, O. and Casidy, E., ''Marketing Principles,'' 3rd Asia-Pacific ed., Cengage, 2018, p. 296</ref> For example, Coca-Cola not only protects the brand name, ''Coca-Cola'', but also protects the distinctive Spencerian script and the contoured shape of the bottle.\n\nIt appears that a brand name and the relationship the consumer keep with the brand as a whole has evolved. From the simple product recognition process a brand name now holds a symbolic and social identification spectrum. [fournier 1998] For example, one can buy Nike because they want to be associated with the kind of people who wear Nike and with the values and attributes of that brand. More than a product it\u2019s a statement that one should seek to purchase by proxy of the brand [Belk 1988].\n\n===Corporate brand identity===\nThe brand identity is a set of individual components, such as a name, a design, a set of images, a slogan, a vision, a design, writing style, a particular font or a symbol etc. which sets the brand aside from others.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title= Principles of marketing|last= Kotler|first= Philip|publisher= Pearson Education Australia|year= 2009|isbn= 9781442500419|location= |pages= }}</ref><ref>\nCompare: {{cite book\n| last1 = Franzen\n| first1 = Giep\n| last2 = Moriarty\n| first2 = Sandra E.\n| orig-year = 2009\n| chapter = 1: The Brand as a System\n| title = The Science and Art of Branding\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mWSmBgAAQBAJ\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge\n| publication-date = 2015\n| page = 19\n| isbn = 9781317454670\n| access-date = 2016-08-16\n| quote = This deeper meaning, the core values, character, or essence of a brand, is what Upshaw (1995) refers to when they use the term ''brand identity''.

(2009), a brand's identity may deliver four levels of meaning:\n\n# attributes\n# benefits\n# values\n# personality\n\nA brand's '''attributes''' are a set of labels with which the corporation wishes to be associated. For example, a brand may showcase its primary attribute as environmental friendliness. However, a brand's attributes alone are not enough to persuade a customer into purchasing the product.<ref name=\":2\" /> These attributes must be communicated through '''benefits''', which are more emotional translations. If a brand's attribute is being environmentally friendly, customers will receive the benefit of feeling that they are helping the environment by associating with the brand. Aside from attributes and benefits, a brand's identity may also involve branding to focus on representing its core set of '''values'''.<ref name=\":2\" /> If a company is seen to symbolise specific values, it will, in turn, attract customers who also believe in these values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} For example, Nike's brand represents the value of a \"just do it\" attitude.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Thus, this form of brand identification attracts customers who also share this same value.

From the perspective of brand owners, branded products or services can command higher prices. Where two products resemble each other, but one of the products has no associated branding (such as a [[generic brand|generic]], store-branded product), potential purchasers may often select the more expensive branded product on the basis of the perceived quality of the brand or on the basis of the reputation of the brand owner.\n\n===Brand awareness===\n\n{{Main|Brand awareness}}\n[[Brand awareness]] involves a customers' ability to recall and/or recognize brands, logos, and branded advertising. Brands help customers to understand which brands or products belong to which product or service category. Brands assist customers to understand the constellation of benefits offered by individual brands, and how a given brand within a category is differentiated from its competing brands, and thus the brand helps customers & potential customers understand which brand satisfies their needs. Thus, the brand offers the customer a short-cut to understanding the different product or service offerings that make up a particular category.\n\nBrand awareness is a key step in the customer's purchase decision process, since some kind of awareness is a precondition to purchasing.

Each form reflects a different stage in a customer's cognitive ability to address the brand in a given circumstance.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMarketers typically identify two distinct types of brand awareness; namely ''brand recall'' (also known as ''unaided recall'' or occasionally ''spontaneous recall'') and ''brand recognition'' (also known as ''aided brand recall'').<ref>Belch, G. E., & Belch, M. A., ''Advertising and Promotion: An integrated marketing communications perspective,''9th ed., New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2012{{page needed|date=March 2018}}</ref> These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising.\n\n* Most companies aim for \"'''Top-of-Mind'''\" which occurs when a brand pops into a consumer's mind when asked to name brands in a product category. For example, when someone is asked to name a type of facial tissue, the common answer, \"Kleenex\", will represent a top-of-mind brand. Top-of-mind awareness is a special case of brand recall.\n* '''Brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand awareness'' or ''spontaneous awareness'') refers to the brand or set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when prompted with a product category\n* '''Brand recognition''' (also known as ''aided brand awareness'') occurs when consumers see or read a list of brands, and express familiarity with a particular brand only after they hear or see it as a type of memory aide.\n* '''Strategic awareness''' occurs when a brand is not only top-of-mind to consumers, but also has distinctive qualities which consumers perceive as making it better than other brands in the particular market. The distinction(s) that set a product apart from the competition is/are also known{{by whom|date=August 2016}} as the [[Unique selling proposition|unique selling point]] or USP.\n\n===Brand recognition===\n\n'''Brand recognition''' is one of the initial phases of brand awareness and validates whether or not a customer remembers being pre-exposed to the brand.<ref name=\":5\" /> Brand recognition (also known as ''aided brand recall'') refers to consumers' ability to correctly differentiate a brand when they come into contact with it. This does not necessarily require that the consumers identify or recall the brand name. When customers experience brand recognition, they are triggered by either a visual or verbal cue.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, when looking to satisfy a category need such as a toilet paper, the customer would firstly be presented with multiple brands to choose from. Once the customer is visually or verbally faced with a brand, he/she may remember being introduced to the brand before. When given some type of cue, consumers who are able to retrieve the particular memory node that referred to the brand, they exhibit brand recognition.<ref name=\":1\" /> Often, this form of brand awareness assists customers in choosing one brand over another when faced with a low-involvement purchasing decision.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(98)00070-8 |title=Brand Awareness Effects on Consumer Decision Making for a Common, Repeat Purchase Product |journal=Journal of Business Research |volume=48 |pages=5\u201315 |year=2000 |last1=MacDonald |first1=Emma K |last2=Sharp |first2=Byron M }}</ref>\n\nBrand recognition is often the mode of brand awareness that operates in [[retail]] shopping environments. When presented with a product at the point-of-sale, or after viewing its visual packaging, consumers are able to recognize the brand and may be able to associate it with attributes or meanings acquired through exposure to promotion or word-of-mouth referrals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Percy|first=Larry|author2=Rossiter, John|title=A model of brand awareness and brand attitude advertising strategies|journal=Psychology & Marketing|year=1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=263\u2013274|doi=10.1002/mar.4220090402}}</ref> In contrast to brand recall, where few consumers are able to spontaneously recall brand names within a given category, when prompted with a brand name, a larger number of consumers are typically able to recognize it.\n\nBrand recognition is most successful when people can elicit recognition without being explicitly exposed to the company's name, but rather through visual signifiers like logos, slogans, and colors.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brand-recognition.asp#axzz1ZU3vlT4j |title = Brand Recognition Definition |publisher = Investopedia |date= 2013-04-19 |accessdate = 2013-04-29}}</ref> For example, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] successfully branded its particular script font (originally created for Walt Disney's \"signature\" [[logo]]), which it used in the logo for [[go.com]].\n\n=== Brand recall===\n\nUnlike brand recognition, '''brand recall''' (also known as ''unaided brand recall'' or ''spontaneous brand recall'') is the ability of the customer retrieving the brand correctly from memory.<ref name=\":1\" /> Rather than being given a choice of multiple brands to satisfy a need, consumers are faced with a need first, and then must recall a brand from their memory to satisfy that need.

Any point where a customer has an interaction with the brand - whether watching a television advertisement, hearing about a brand through word of mouth, or even noticing a branded license plate \u2013 defines a touch point. According to Dahlen ''et al.'' (2010), every touch point has the \"\u2026potential to add positive \u2013 or suppress negative \u2013 associations to the brand's equity\" <ref name=\":8\" /> Thus, a brand's IMC should cohesively deliver positive messages through appropriate touch points associated with its target market. One methodology involves using sensory stimuli touch points to activate customer emotion.<ref name=\":9\" /> For example, if a brand consistently uses a pleasant smell as a primary touch point, the brand has a much higher chance of creating a positive lasting effect on its customers' senses as well as memory.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another way a brand can ensure that it is utilizing the best communication channel is by focusing on touch points that suit particular areas associated with [[customer experience]].<ref name=\":2\" /> As suggested Figure 2, certain touch points link with a specific stage in customer-brand-involvement. For example, a brand may recognize that advertising touch points are most effective during the pre-purchase experience stage therefore they may target their advertisements to new customers rather than to existing customers. Overall, a brand has the ability to strengthen brand equity by using IMC branding communications through touch points.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nBrand communication is important in ensuring brand success in the [[business sector|business world]] and refers to how  businesses transmit their brand messages, characteristics and attributes to their [[consumer]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Ebru|last1=Uzuno\u011flu |first2=Sema|last2=Misci Kip|title=Brand communication through digital influencers: Leveraging blogger engagement |journal=International Journal of Information Management |volume=34 |issue=5 |page=592 |date=2014 |doi=10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2014.04.007 }}</ref> One method of brand communication that companies can exploit involves [[electronic word-of mouth]] (eWOM).

In this context, a \"brand name\" constitutes a type of [[trademark]], if the brand name exclusively identifies the brand owner as the commercial source of products or services. A brand owner may seek to protect [[Intellectual property|proprietary rights]] in relation to a brand name through [[trademark registration]] \u2013 such trademarks are called \"Registered Trademarks\". Advertising spokespersons have also become part of some brands, for example: [[Mr. Whipple]] of [[Charmin]] toilet tissue and [[Tony the Tiger]] of [[Frosted Flakes|Kellogg's Frosted Flakes]]. Putting a value on a brand by [[brand valuation]] or using [[marketing mix modeling]] techniques is distinct to valuing a [[trademark]].\n\n====Types of brand names====\nBrand names come in many styles.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/ |title= MerriamAssociates.com |publisher= MerriamAssociates.com |date= 2012-11-15 |accessdate= 2013-04-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822050819/http://merriamassociates.com/2009/02/styles-and-types-of-company-and-product-names/|archivedate= 2009-08-22}}</ref>\nA few include:\n* '''initialism''': a name made of initials, such as \"UPS\" or \"IBM\"\n* '''descriptive''': names that describe a product benefit or function, such as \"Whole Foods\" or \"Toys R' Us\"\n* '''[[alliteration]] and [[rhyme]]''': names that are fun to say and which stick in the mind, such as \"Reese's Pieces\" or \"[[Dunkin' Donuts]]\"\n* '''evocative''': names that can evoke a vivid image, such as \"Amazon\" or \"Crest\"\n* '''[[neologism]]s''': completely made-up words, such as \"[[Wii]]\" or \"[[H\u00e4agen-Dazs]]\"\n* '''foreign word''': adoption of a word from another language, such as \"[[Volvo Cars|Volvo]]\" or \"[[Samsung]]\"\n* '''founders' names''': using the names of real people, (especially a founder's surname), such as \"[[Hewlett-Packard]]\", \"[[Dell]]\", \"[[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]\", \"Stussy\" or \"Mars\"\n* '''geography''': naming for regions and landmarks, such as \"[[Cisco Systems|Cisco]]\" or \"[[Fujifilm|Fuji Film]]\"\n* '''personification''': taking names from myths, such as [[Nike, Inc.|\"Nike\"]]; or from the minds of ad execs, such as \"[[Betty Crocker]]\"\n* '''punny''': some brands create their name by using a silly pun, such as \"[[Lord of the Flies|Lord of the Fries]]\", \"Wok on Water\" or \"Eggs Eggscetera\"\n*'''[[portmanteau]]''': combining multiple words together to create one, such as \"[[Microsoft]]\" (\"microcomputer\" and \"software\"), \"[[Comcast]]\" (\"communications\" and \"broadcast\"), \"[[Evernote]]\" (\"forever\" and \"note\"), \"[[Vodafone]]\" (\"voice\", \"data\", \"telephone\")\n\nThe act of associating a product or service with a brand has become part of [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. Most products have some kind of brand identity, from common [[Salt|table salt]] to [[Designer clothing|designer jeans]]. A [[Generic trademark|brandnomer]] is a brand name that has [[Colloquialism|colloquial]]ly become a generic term for a product or service, such as [[Band-Aid]], [[Nylon]], or [[Kleenex]]\u2014which are often used to describe any brand of adhesive bandage; any type of hosiery; or any brand of facial tissue respectively. [[Xerox]], for example, has become [[synonym]]ous with the word \"copy\".\n\n===Brand line===\nA brand line allows the introduction of various subtypes of a product under a common, ideally already established, brand name. Examples would be the individual [[Kinder Chocolate]]s by Ferrero SA, the subtypes of [[Coca-Cola]], or [[special edition]]s of popular brands. See also [[#Brand extension and brand dilution|brand extension]].\n\n[[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] created in December 2013 the [[BSIN]] (Brand Standard Identification Number). [[BSIN]] is universal and is used by the Open Product Data Working Group <ref>{{cite web|url=http://product.okfn.org|title=Open Product Data|website=Open Product Data}}</ref> of the [[Open Knowledge International|Open Knowledge Foundation]] to assign a brand to a product. The OKFN Brand repository is critical for the Open Data movement.\n\n===Brand identity===\n{{Main|Corporate identity}}\nThe expression of a brand \u2013 including its name, trademark, communications, and visual appearance \u2013 is brand identity.<ref name=\"Dictionary of Brand\">{{cite book|first=Marty|last=Neumeier|title=The Dictionary of Brand|publisher=AIGA Center for Brand Experience |location=New York City|date=2004|isbn=978-1-884081-06-4|page=20}}</ref> Because the identity is assembled by the brand owner, it reflects how the owner ''wants'' the consumer to perceive the brand \u2013 and by extension the branded company, organization, product or service. This is in contrast to the brand image, which is a customer's mental picture of a brand.<ref name=\"Dictionary of Brand\" /> The brand owner will seek to bridge the gap between the brand image and the brand identity. Brand identity is fundamental to consumer recognition and symbolizes the brand's differentiation from competitors.\n\nBrand identity is what the owner wants to communicate to its potential consumers. However, over time, a product's brand identity may acquire (evolve), gaining new attributes from consumer perspective but not necessarily from the marketing communications, an owner percolates to targeted consumers. Therefore, businesses research consumer's brand associations.\n\nThe brand identity works as a guideline, as the frame in which a brand will evolve and define itself, or in the words of David Aaker, \u201c\u2026a unique set of brand associations that the brand strategist aspires to create or maintain.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kapferer (2007), there are 6 facets to a brand\u2019s identity:\n\n* Physique: The physical characteristics and iconography of your brand ( such as the Nike swoosh or the orange pantone of easyJet).\n* Personality: The persona, how a brand communicates with their audience, which is expressed through its tone of voice, design assets and then integrates this into communication touchpoints in a coherent way.\n* Culture: The values,the principles on which a brand bases its behaviour. For example, Google flexible office hours and fun environment so the employees feel happy and creative at work.\n* Reflection: The \u201cstereotypical user\u201d of the brand. A brand is likely to be purchased by several buyer\u2019s profiles but they will have a go-to person that they use in their campaigns. For example Lou Yetu and the Parisian chic profile.\n* Relationship: The bond between a brand and its customers, and the customer expectations of the brand (the experience beyond the tangible product). Such as warranties or services during and after purchase help maintain a sustainable relationship and keep the consumer trust.\n\nSelf-image: How does one brand-customer portrays their ideal self \u2013 how they want to look and behave; what they aspire to \u2013 brands can target their messaging accordingly and make the brand\u2019s aspirations reflect theirs.\n\n====Visual brand identity====\n[[File:Mobil manuals.png|thumb|The visual brand identity manual for [[Mobil|Mobil Oil]] (developed by [[Chermayeff & Geismar & Haviv]]), one of the first visual identities to integrate logotype, icon, alphabet, color palette, and station architecture.]]\n\nA brand can also be used to attract customers by a company, if the brand of a company is well established and has goodwill. The recognition and perception of a brand is highly influenced by its visual presentation. A brand's visual identity is the overall look of its communications. Effective visual brand identity is achieved by the consistent use of particular visual elements to create distinction, such as specific fonts, colors, and graphic elements. At the core of every brand identity is a brand mark, or [[logo]]. In the United States, brand identity and logo design naturally grew out of the Modernist movement in the 1950s and greatly drew on the principles of that movement \u2013 simplicity ([[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]'s principle of \"Less is more\") and geometric abstraction. These principles can be observed in the work of the pioneers of the practice of visual brand identity design, such as [[Paul Rand]] and [[Saul Bass]]. As part of a company's brand identity, a logo should complement the company's message strategy. An effective logo is simple, memorable, and works well in any medium including both online and offline applications.\n\nColor is a particularly important element of visual brand identity and color mapping provides an effective way of ensuring color contributes to differentiation in a visually cluttered marketplace.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Zena|last=O'Connor |title=Logo colour and differentiation: A new application of environmental colour mapping |journal=Color Research & Application |volume=36 |date=December 10, 2010|doi=10.1002/col.20594|pages=55\u201360}}</ref>\n\n===Brand trust===\nBrand trust is the intrinsic 'believability' that any entity evokes. In the commercial world, the intangible aspect of brand trust impacts the behavior and performance of its business stakeholders in many intriguing ways. It creates the foundation of a strong brand connect with all stakeholders, converting simple awareness to strong commitment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Arjun |title=Product class effects on brand commitment and brand outcomes: The role of brand trust and brand affect |journal=Journal of Brand Management |date=14 February 2002 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=33\u201358 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.bm.2540100 |url=https://digitalcommons.fairfield.edu/content_policy.pdf }}</ref> This, in turn, metamorphoses normal people who have an indirect or direct stake in the organization into devoted ambassadors, leading to concomitant advantages like easier acceptability of brand extensions, the perception of premium, and acceptance of temporary quality deficiencies. Brand trust is often used as an important part of developing the portrayal of the business globally. Foreign companies will often use names that are associated with quality, in order to entrust the brand itself. An example would be a Chinese company using a German name.\n\n''[[The Brand Trust Report]]'' is syndicated primary research that has elaborated on this metric of brand trust. It is a result of the action, behavior, communication, and attitude of an entity, with the most trust results emerging from its action component. The action of the entity is most important in creating trust in all those audiences who directly engage with the brand, the primary experience carrying primary audiences. However, the tools of communications play a vital role in transferring the trust experience to audiences who have never experienced the brand, the all-important secondary audience.\n\n===Brand parity===\nBrand parity is the perception of the customers that some brands are equivalent.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Paul S. |last1=Richardson|first2=Alan S. |last2=Dick |first3=Arun K.|last3=Jain |title=Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cue Effects on Perceptions of Store Brand Quality |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=58 |issue=4 |page=28 |date=October 1994 |doi=10.2307/1251914 |jstor=1251914 }}</ref> This means that shoppers will purchase within a group of accepted brands rather than choosing one specific brand. When brand parity operates, quality is often not a major concern because consumers believe that only minor quality differences exist.\n\n==Expanding role of brands==\nThe original aim of branding was to simplify the process of identifying and differentiating products. Over time, manufacturers began to use branded messages to give the brand a unique personality. Brands came to embrace a performance or benefit promise, for the product, certainly, but eventually also for the company behind the brand.\n\nToday, brands play a much bigger role. The power of brands to communicate a complex message quickly, with emotional impact and with the ability of brands to attract media attention, makes them ideal tools in the hands of activists.<ref>{{cite web |first=Shayna|last=Smilovitz|url= https://instapage.com/blog/emotional-marketing|title=Emotional Marketing Examples Scientifically Proven To Sway Buyers|website=Instapage|date=September 11, 2018 |accessdate= February 9, 2019 }}</ref> Cultural conflict over a brand's meaning has also influences the diffusion of an innovation.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Markus|last=Giesler|title=How Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=76|issue=6|pages=55\u201368|publisher=[[American Marketing Association]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=November 2012|doi=10.1509/jm.10.0406}}</ref>\n\n==Branding strategies==\n{{See|Brand management}}\n\n===Company name===\nOften, especially in the industrial sector, [[brand engineer]]s will promote a company's name.

A change in corporate naming may also have a role in seeking to shed an undesirable image: for example, [[Werner Erhard and Associates]] re-branded its activities as [[Landmark Education]] in 1991 at a time when publicity in a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' investigative-report broadcast cast the [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] and [[Werner Erhard]] brands in a negative light,<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= https://boingboing.net/2009/08/31/suppressed-60-minute.html\n |url-access=\n |title= Wikileaks re-publishes 60 Minutes piece on est/Landmark cult leader Werner Erhard\n |last= Jardin\n |first= Xeni\n |author-link= Xeni Jardin\n |date= 31 Aug 2009\n |publisher= Boing Boing\n |access-date= 28 Apr 2019\n |quote= Wikileaks has published the video and transcript of an investigative report into \"est\" (Erhard Seminars Training) guru and Landmark Education Forum godfather Werner Erhard by CBS News, originally broadcast on the program 60 Minutes on March 3, 1991. \n}}\n</ref>\nand [[Union Carbide India Limited]] became [[Eveready Industries India]] in 1994 subsequent to the [[Bhopal disaster]] of 1984\n\n===Individual branding===\n{{Main|Individual branding}}\nEach brand has a separate name (such as [[7 Up|Seven-Up]], [[Kool-Aid]], or [[Nivea]] Sun ([[Beiersdorf]])), which may compete against other brands from the same company (for example, [[Persil]], Omo, [[Surf (detergent)|Surf]], and [[Axe (brand)|Lynx]] are all owned by [[Unilever]]).\n\n===Challenger brands===\n{{main|Challenger brand}}\nA challenger brand is a brand in an industry where it is neither the market leader nor a niche brand. Challenger brands are categorised by a mindset that sees them have business ambitions beyond conventional resources and an intent to bring change to an industry.\n\n===Multiproduct branding strategy===\nMultiproduct branding strategy is when a company uses one name across all its products in a product class. When the company's trade name is used, multiproduct branding is also known as corporate branding, family branding or umbrella branding. Examples of companies that use corporate branding are [[Microsoft]], [[Samsung]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Sony]] as the company's brand name is identical to their trade name.  \nOther examples of multiproduct branding strategy include [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] and [[Church & Dwight]]. Virgin, a multination conglomerate uses the punk-inspired, handwritten red logo with the iconic tick for all its products ranging from airlines, hot air balloons, telecommunication to healthcare. Church & Dwight, a manufacturer of household products displays the [[Arm & Hammer (brand)|Arm & Hammer]] family brand name for all its products containing baking soda as the main ingredient. A multiproduct branding strategy has many advantages. It capitalises on brand equity as consumers that have a good experience with the product will in turn pass on this positive opinion to supplementary objects in the same product class as they share the same name. Consequently, the multiproduct branding strategy makes product line extension possible.\n\n====Product line extension====\n{{main|Product line extension}}\nA product line extension is the procedure of entering a new market segment in its product class by means of using a current brand name. An example of this is the [[Campbell Soup Company]], primarily a producer of canned soups. They utilize a multiproduct branding strategy by way of soup line extensions. They have over 100 soup flavours putting forward varieties such as regular Campbell soup, condensed, chunky, fresh-brewed, organic, and soup on the go. This approach is seen as favourable as it can result in lower promotion costs and advertising due to the same name being used on all products, therefore increasing the level of brand awareness. Although, line extension has potential negative outcomes with one being that other items in the company's line may be disadvantaged because of the sale of the extension. Line extensions work at their best when they deliver an increase in company revenue by enticing new buyers or by removing sales from competitors.\n\n====Subbranding====\n{{main|Subbranding}}\nSubbranding is used by certain multiproduct branding companies. Subbranding merges a corporate, family or umbrella brand with the introduction of a new brand in order to differentiate part of a product line from others in the whole brand system. Subbranding assists to articulate and construct offerings. It can alter a brand's identity as subbranding can modify associations of the parent brand. Examples of successful subbranding can be seen through [[Gatorade]] and [[Porsche]]. Gatorade, a manufacturer of sport-themed food and beverages effectively introduced Gatorade G2, a low-calorie line of Gatorade drinks. Likewise, Porsche, a specialised automobile manufacturer successfully markets its lower-end line, [[Porsche Boxster/Cayman|Porsche Boxster]] and higher-end line, [[Porsche Carrera]].\n\n====Brand extension====\n{{main|Brand extension}}\nBrand extension is the system of employing a current brand name to enter a different product class. Having a strong brand equity allows for brand extension. Nevertheless, brand extension has its disadvantages. There is a risk that too many uses for one brand name can oversaturate the market resulting in a blurred and weak brand for consumers. Examples of brand extension can be seen through [[Kimberly-Clark]] and [[Honda]]. Kimberly-Clark is a corporation that produces personal and health care products being able to extend the [[Huggies]] brand name across a full line of toiletries for toddlers and babies. The success of this brand extension strategy is apparent in the $500 million in annual sales generated globally. Similarly, Honda using their reputable name for automobiles has spread to other products such as motorcycles, power equipment, engines, robots, aircraft, and bikes.\n\n====Co-branding====\n{{main|Co-branding}}\nCo-branding is a variation of brand extension. It is where a single product is created from the combining of two brand names of two manufacturers. Co-branding has its advantages as it lets firms enter new product classes and exploit a recognized brand name in that product class. An example of a co-branding success is Whitaker's working with [[Lewis Road Creamery]] to create a co-branded beverage called Lewis Road Creamery and Whittaker's Chocolate Milk. This product was a huge success in the New Zealand market with it going viral.\n\n===Multibranding strategy===\nMultibranding strategy is when a company gives each product a distinct name. Multibranding is best used as an approach when each brand in intended for a different market segment. Multibranding is used in an assortment of ways with selected companies grouping their brands based on price-quality segments. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G), a multinational consumer goods company that offers over 100 brands, each suited for different consumer needs. For instance, [[Head & Shoulders]] that helps consumers relieve dandruff in the form of a shampoo, [[Oral-B]] which offers inter-dental products, [[Vicks]] which offers cough and cold products, and [[Downy]] which offers dryer sheets and fabric softeners. Other examples include [[Coca-Cola]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]].\n\nThis approach usually results in higher promotion costs and advertising. This is due to the company being required to generate awareness among consumers and retailers for each new brand name without the benefit of any previous impressions. Multibranding strategy has many advantages. There is no risk that a product failure will affect other products in the line as each brand is unique to each market segment. Although, certain large multiband companies have come across that the cost and difficulty of implementing a multibranding strategy can overshadow the benefits. For example, [[Unilever]], the world's third-largest multination consumer goods company recently streamlined its brands from over 400 brands to centre their attention onto 14 brands with sales of over 1 billion euros. Unilever accomplished this through product deletion and sales to other companies. Other multibrand companies introduce new product brands as a protective measure to respond to competition called fighting brands or fighter brands.\n\n====Fighting brands====\n{{main|Fighter brand}}\nThe main purpose of fighting brands is to challenge competitor brands. For example, [[Qantas]], Australia's largest flag carrier airline, introduced [[Jetstar Airways|Jetstar]] to go head-to-head against the low-cost carrier, [[Virgin Australia]] (formerly known as Virgin Blue). Jetstar is an Australian low-cost airline for budget conscious travellers, but it receives many negative reviews due to this. The launching of Jetstar allowed Qantas to rival Virgin Australia without the criticism being affiliated with Qantas because of the distinct brand name.\n\n===Private branding strategy===\n\n{{main|Store brand}}\nPrivate branding (also known as reseller branding, private labelling, store brands, or own brands) have increased in popularity. Private branding is when a company manufactures products but it is sold under the brand name of a wholesaler or retailer. Private branding is popular because it typically produces high profits for manufacturers and resellers. The pricing of private brand product are usually cheaper compared to competing name brands. Consumers are commonly deterred by these prices as it sets a perception of lower quality and standard but these views are shifting.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn Australia, their leading supermarket chains, both [[Woolworths Supermarkets|Woolworths]] and [[Coles Supermarkets|Coles]] are saturated with store brands (or private labels). For example, in the United States, Paragon Trade Brands, [[Ralcorp|Ralcorp Holdings]], and [[Spectrum Brands|Rayovac]] are major suppliers of diapers, grocery products, and private label alkaline batteries, correspondingly. [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[RadioShack]], [[Sears]], and [[Kroger]] are large retailers that have their own brand names. Similarly, [[Macy's]], a mid-range chain of department stores offers a wide catalogue of private brands exclusive to their stores, from brands such as First Impressions which supply newborn and infant clothing, Hotel Collection which supply luxury linens and mattresses, and Tasso Elba which supply European inspired menswear. They use private branding strategy to specifically target consumer markets.\n\n===Mixed branding strategy===\nMixed branding strategy is where a firm markets products under its own name(s) and that of a reseller because the segment attracted to the reseller is different from its own market. \nFor example, [[Elizabeth Arden, Inc.]], a major American cosmetics and fragrance company, uses mixed branding strategy. The company sells its Elizabeth Arden brand through department stores and line of skin care products at [[Walmart]] with the \"skin simple\" brand name. Companies such as [[Whirlpool Corporation|Whirlpool]], [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]], and [[Dial (soap)|Dial]] produce private brands of home appliances, pet foods, and soap, correspondingly. Other examples of mixed branding strategy include [[Michelin]], [[Seiko Epson|Epson]], [[Microsoft]], [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]], and [[Toyota]]. Michelin, one of the largest tire manufacturers allowed [[Sears]], an American retail chain to place their brand name on the tires. Microsoft, a multinational technology company is seriously regarded as a corporate technology brand but it sells its versatile home entertainment hub under the brand Xbox to better align with the new and crazy identity. Gillette catered to females with Gillette for Women which has now become known as Venus. The launch of Venus was conducted in order to fulfil the feminine market of the previously dominating masculine razor industry. Similarly, Toyota, an automobile manufacturer used mixed branding. In the U.S., Toyota was regarded as a valuable car brand being economical, family orientated and known as a vehicle that rarely broke down. But Toyota sought out to fulfil a higher end, expensive market segment, thus they created [[Lexus]], the luxury vehicle division of premium cars.\n\n===Attitude branding and iconic brands===\nAttitude branding is the choice to represent a larger feeling, which is not necessarily connected with the product or [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of the product at all. [[Marketing]] labeled as attitude branding include that of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Starbucks]], [[The Body Shop]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Apple Inc.]]. In the 1999 book ''[[No Logo]]'', [[Naomi Klein]] describes attitude branding as a \"fetish strategy\".<ref name=\"nologo\">{{cite book|first=Naomi|last=Klein|authorlink=Naomi Klein|title=No Logo|publisher=Knopf Canada |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=1999|isbn=978-0-676-97282-5|page=141|title-link=No Logo}}</ref> Schaefer and Kuehlwein analyzed brands such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Ben & Jerry's]] or [[Chanel]] describing them as 'Ueber-Brands' \u2013 brands that are able to gain and retain \"meaning beyond the material.\"<ref name=\"uber=brands\">{{cite book|first1=Wolf|last1=Schaefer|first2=JP|last2=Kuehlwein|title=Rethinking Prestige Branding \u2013 Secrets of the Ueber-Brands|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=London, England|date= 2015|isbn=9780749470036|page=17}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A great brand raises the bar \u2013 it adds a greater sense of purpose to the experience, whether it's the challenge to do your best in sports and fitness, or the affirmation that the cup of coffee you're drinking really matters. \u2013 [[Howard Schultz]] (President, CEO, and Chairman of [[Starbucks]])\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:English & Hebrew Coke labels.jpg|thumb|alt=Bottles of Coca-Cola with labels printed in English and Hebrew|The color, letter font and style of the [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Diet Coke|Diet Coca-Cola]] [[logo]]s in [[English language|English]] were copied into matching [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] logos to maintain brand identity in Israel.]]\n\nIconic brands are defined as having aspects that contribute to consumer's self-expression and personal identity. Brands whose value to consumers comes primarily from having identity value are said to be \"identity brands\". Some of these brands have such a strong identity that they become more or less cultural icons which makes them \"iconic brands\". Examples are: [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], and [[Harley-Davidson]]. Many iconic brands include almost ritual-like behaviour in purchasing or consuming the products.\n\nThere are four key elements to creating iconic brands (Holt 2004):\n# \"Necessary conditions\" \u2013 The performance of the product must at least be acceptable, preferably with a reputation of having good quality.\n# \"Myth-making\" \u2013 A meaningful storytelling fabricated by cultural insiders. These must be seen as legitimate and respected by consumers for stories to be accepted.\n# \"Cultural contradictions\" \u2013 Some kind of mismatch between prevailing ideology and emergent undercurrents in society. In other words, a difference with the way consumers are and how they wish they were.\n# \"The cultural brand management process\" \u2013 Actively engaging in the myth-making process in making sure the brand maintains its position as an icon.\n\nSchaefer and Kuehlwein propose the following 'Ueber-Branding' principles.  They derived them from studying successful modern Prestige brands and what elevates them above mass competitors and beyond considerations of performance and price (alone) in the minds of consumers:<ref name=\"uber=brands\"/>\n# \"Mission Incomparable\" \u2013 Having a differentiated and meaningful brand purpose beyond 'making money.'<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Wolf|last1=Schaefer |first2=J.|last2=Kuehlwein |title=Ueber-Branding: How modern prestige brands create meaning through mission and myth \u2013 Part 1 |journal=Journal of Brand Strategy |publisher=Henry Stewart Publications|location=London, England|volume=5 |issue=4 |date=26 June 2016|pages=395\u2013409 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/jbs/2017/00000005/00000004/art00006 }}</ref>  Setting rules that follow this purpose \u2013 even when it violates the mass marketing mantra of \"Consumer is always Boss/right\".\n# \"Longing versus Belonging\" \u2013 Playing with the opposing desires of people for Inclusion on the one hand and Exclusivity on the other. \n# \"Un-Selling\" \u2013 First and foremost seeking to seduce through pride and provocation, rather than to sell through arguments.<ref>Kuehlwein, JP.

Examples include the [[Japan]]ese company [[Muji]], which means \"No label\" in English (from \u7121\u5370\u826f\u54c1 \u2013 \"Mujirushi Ryohin\" \u2013 literally, \"No brand quality goods\"), and the Florida company No-Ad Sunscreen. Although there is a distinct Muji brand, Muji products are not branded. This no-brand strategy means that little is spent on advertisement or classical marketing and Muji's success is attributed to the word-of-mouth, simple shopping experience and the anti-brand movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |title=Muji brand strategy, Muji branding, no-name brand |publisher=VentureRepublic |accessdate=2013-04-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309024950/http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Muji_The_Japanese_No-Brand.asp |archive-date=2013-03-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Heig, Matt.

It was simply recognized by the color of the cap of this cleaning products company.\n\n==={{anchor|derivative}} Derived brands<!-- Section linked from [[Horus Heresy]] [[Horus Heresy (novels)]] -->===\n\n{{See|Derived demand}}\nIn this case the supplier of a key component, used by a number of suppliers of the end-product, may wish to guarantee its own position by promoting that component as a brand in its own right. The most frequently quoted example is [[Intel]], which positions itself in the [[Personal computer|PC]] market with the slogan (and sticker) \"[[Intel Inside]]\".\n\n===Brand extension and brand dilution===\n\n{{See|brand extension}}\nThe existing strong brand name can be used as a vehicle for new or modified products;\nfor example, many [[fashion]] and designer companies extended brands into fragrances, shoes and [[Fashion accessory|accessories]], home textile, [[Interior design|home decor]], [[baggage|luggage]], (sun-) glasses, furniture, hotels, etc.\n\nMars extended its brand to ice cream, [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] to shoes and watches, [[Michelin]] to a restaurant guide, [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]] to personal hygiene. [[Dunlop (brands)|Dunlop]] extended its brand from tires to other rubber products such as shoes, golf balls, tennis racquets, and adhesives. Frequently, the product is no different from what else is on the market, except a brand name marking. Brand is product identity.\n\nThere is a difference between brand extension and [[#Brand line|line]] extension. A line extension is when a current brand name is used to enter a new market segment in the existing product class, with new varieties or flavors or sizes.\nWhen [[Coca-Cola]] launched \"Diet Coke\" and \"Cherry Coke\", they stayed within the originating product category: non-alcoholic carbonated beverages. [[Procter & Gamble]] (P&G) did likewise extending its strong lines (such as Fairy Soap) into neighboring products (Fairy Liquid and Fairy Automatic) within the same category, dish washing detergents.\n\nThe risk of over-extension is brand dilution where the brand loses its brand associations with a market segment, product area, or quality, price or cachet.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Social media brands===\nIn ''The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy'' (2012), author and brand strategist Simon Pont posits that social media brands may be the most evolved version of the brand form, because they focus not on themselves but on their users. In so doing, social media brands are arguably more charismatic, in that consumers are compelled to spend time with them, because the time spent is in the meeting of fundamental human drivers related to belonging and individualism. \"We wear our physical brands like badges, to help define us \u2013 but we use our digital brands to help express who we are. They allow us to be, to hold a mirror up to ourselves, and it is clear. We like what we see.\"<ref name=\"Media Democracy\">{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Pont|title=The Better Mousetrap: Brand Invention in a Media Democracy|publisher=[[Kogan Page]]|location=London, England|date=2013|isbn=978-0749466213}}</ref>\n\n===Multi-brands===\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2016}}\nAlternatively, in a market that is fragmented amongst a number of brands a supplier can choose deliberately to launch totally new brands in apparent competition with its own existing strong brand (and often with identical product characteristics); simply to soak up some of the shares of the market which will, in any case, go to minor brands. The rationale is that having 3 out of 12 brands in such a market will give a greater overall share than having 1 out of 10 (even if much of the share of these new brands is taken from the existing one). In its most extreme manifestation, a supplier pioneering a new market which it believes will be particularly attractive may choose immediately to launch a second brand in competition with its first, in order to pre-empt others entering the market. This strategy is widely known as a multi-brand strategy.\n\nIndividual brand names naturally allow greater flexibility by permitting a variety of different products, of differing quality, to be sold without confusing the consumer's perception of what\nbusiness the company is in or diluting higher quality products.\n\n[[Procter & Gamble]] is a leading exponent of this approach to branding, running as many as ten detergent brands in the US market. This also increases the total number of \"facings\" it receives on supermarket shelves. [[Sara Lee Corporation|Sara Lee]], on the other hand, uses the approach to keep the very different parts of the business separate\u2014from Sara Lee cakes through Kiwi polishes to L'Eggs pantyhose. In the hotel business, [[Marriott International|Marriott]] uses the name [[Fairfield Inn by Marriott|Fairfield Inns]] for its budget chain (and [[Choice Hotels]] uses [[Rodeway Inn|Rodeway]] for its own cheaper hotels).\n\n[[Cannibalization (marketing)|Cannibalization]] is a particular challenge with a multi-brand strategy approach, in which the new brand takes business away from an established one which the organization also owns. This may be acceptable (indeed to be expected) if there is a net gain overall. Alternatively, it may be the price the organization is willing to pay for shifting its position in the market; the new product being one stage in this process.\n\n===Private labels===\n\n{{See|Private label}}\n[[Private label]] brands, also called [[own brand]]s, or [[store brand]]s have become popular. Where the retailer has a particularly strong identity (such as [[Marks & Spencer]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] clothing sector) this \"own brand\" may be able to compete against even the strongest brand leaders, and may outperform those products that are not otherwise strongly branded.\n\n'''Designer Private Labels'''\n\nA relatively recent innovation in retailing is the introduction of designer private labels. Designer-private labels involve a collaborative contract between a well-known fashion designer and a retailer. Both retailer and designer collaborate to design goods with popular appeal pitched at price points that fit the consumer's budget. For retail outlets, these types of collaborations give them greater control over the design process as well as access to exclusive store brands that can potentially drive store traffic.\n\nIn Australia, for example, the department store, Myer, now offers a range of exclusive designer private labels including Jayson Brundson, Karen Walker, Leona Edmiston, Wayne Cooper, Fleur Wood and \u2018L\u2019 for Lisa Ho.<ref>Schetzer, A., \"Private Labels in Designer Sheep's Clothing, Sydney Morning Herald, 7 September 2014 Online:http://www.smh.com.au/business/private-labels-in-designer-sheeps-clothing-20140925-10ilia.html</ref> Another up-market department store, David Jones, currently offers \u2018Collette\u2019 for leading Australian designer, Collette Dinnigan, and has recently announced its intention to extend the number of exclusive designer brands.<ref>Roy Morgan Research,\"Private Label Could be the New Black\" Research Finding no. 5613, [Media Release] May, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5613-private-label-could-be-new-black-201405292337</ref> Target has teamed up with Danii Minogue to produce her \u201cPetites\u2019 range.<ref>Roy Morgan Research, \"Target On Target for New Era Women's Fashion,\" Research Finding, no. 5756, August, 2014 Online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5756-target-on-target-for-new-era-womens-fashion-201408260520</ref> Specsavers has joined up with Sydney designer, Alex Perry to create an exclusive range of spectacle frames while Big W stocks frame designed by Peter Morrissey.\n\n===Individual and organizational brands===\nWith the development of the brand, Branding is no longer limited to a product or service.<ref name=\"The Wall Street Journal\">{{cite news|url=http://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/2014/12/16/is-your-personal-brand-working-for-or-against-you/?KEYWORDS=branding |title=Is Your Personal Brand Working For or Against You? |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |date=2014-12-16 |accessdate=2015-02-01}}</ref> There are kinds of branding that treat individuals and organizations as the products to be branded. Most [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]] carry their brand as a fundraising tool. The purpose of most NGOs is to leave a social impact so their brand becomes associated with specific social life matters. [[Amnesty International]], [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] and [[AIESEC]] are among the most recognized brands around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_role_of_brand_in_the_nonprofit_sector|title=The Role of Brand in the Nonprofit Sector (SSIR)|website=ssir.org|language=en-us|access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> NGOs and non-profit organizations moved beyond using their brands for fundraising to express their internal identity and to clarify their social goals and long-term aims.

Examples of this include the #ShareACoke campaign by [[Coca-Cola]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} which printed people's names and place names on their bottles encouraging people.

Some approaches applied, such as an increasing importance on the symbolic value of products, have led countries to emphasise their distinctive characteristics. The branding and image of a nation-state \"and the successful transference of this image to its exports \u2013 is just as important as what they actually produce and sell.\"\n\n===Destination branding===\n\nDestination branding is the work of cities, states, and other localities to promote the location to tourists and drive additional revenues into a tax base. These activities are often undertaken by governments, but can also result from the work of community associations.

The purpose of DBIs is to undermine the positive brand meanings the brand owners are trying to instill through their marketing activities.<ref name=\"Thompson 50\u201364\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jmkg.2006.70.1.50 |title=Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Image |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=70 |pages=50\u201364 |year=2006 |last1=Thompson |first1=Craig J |last2=Rindfleisch |first2=Aric |last3=Arsel |first3=Zeynep }}</ref>\n\nThe term stems from the combination of the German words ''doppel'' (double) and ''g\u00e4nger'' (walker).\n\nDoppelg\u00e4nger brands are typically created by individuals or groups to express criticism of a brand and its perceived values, through a form of parody, and are typically unflattering in nature.\n\nDue to the ability of Doppelg\u00e4nger brands to rapidly propagate virally through digital media channels, they can represent a real threat to the equity of the target brand. Sometimes the target organization is forced to address the root concern or to re-position the brand in a way that defuses the criticism.\n\nExamples include:\n* '''Joe Chemo''' campaign organized to criticize the marketing of tobacco products to children and their harmful effects.<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Chemo: A Camel Who Wishes He'd Never Smoked|url=http://www.joechemo.org/|website = www.joechemo.org|accessdate=2015-09-10}}</ref>\n* Parody of the '''Pepsi logo as an obese man''' to highlight the relationship between soft drink consumption and obesity.<ref>{{cite web|title = Designer Makes Fun Of Pepsi, Turns Its Logo Into A Fat Man - DesignTAXI.com|url=http://designtaxi.com/news/360382/Designer-Makes-Fun-Of-Pepsi-Turns-Its-Logo-Into-A-Fat-Man/|website=designtaxi.com|accessdate=2015-09-10}}</ref>\n* The '''FUH2 campaign''' protesting the Hummer SUV as a symbol of corporate and consumer irresponsibility toward public safety and the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title = FUH2 {{!}} Fuck You And Your H2|url = http://www.fuh2.com |website = www.fuh2.com|accessdate = 2015-09-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319105357/http://www.fuh2.com/|archivedate=2016-03-19|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nIn the 2006 article \"Emotional Branding and the Strategic Value of the Doppelg\u00e4nger Brand Image\", Thompson, Rindfleisch, and Arsel suggest that a doppelg\u00e4nger brand image can be a benefit to a brand if taken as an early warning sign that the brand is losing emotional authenticity with its market.<ref name=\"Thompson 50\u201364\"/>\n\n==International Standards==\nThe [[ISO]] branding standards developed by the Committee [[ISO/TC 289]] are:\n* '' '[[ISO 10668]]:2010' '' '' Brand valuation - Requirements for monetary brand valuation '', \n* '' '[[ISO 20671]]:2019' '' '' Brand evaluation - Principles and fundamentals ''.\n\nTwo other ISO standards are being developed by ISO/TC289:\n* [[ISO/AWI 23353]] Brand evaluation - Guidelines for brands relating to geographical indications <ref> https://www.iso.org/standard/75306.html </ref>\n* [[ISO/AWI 24051]] Brand evaluation - Guide for the annual brand evaluation. <ref> https://www.iso.org/standard/77636.html?browse=tc </ref>\n\n==See also==\n<!--NOTE: This list needs to be reduced by incorporating listed items into the body of the article, per \"Wikipedia:See also\".
