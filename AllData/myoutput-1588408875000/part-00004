Two objects connected by an ideal hinge rotate relative to each other about a fixed [[axis of rotation]]: all other [[translations]] or [[rotations]] being prevented, and thus a hinge has one [[degree of freedom]]. Hinges may be made of [[Flexure bearing|flexible material]] or of moving components. In [[biology]], many [[joint]]s function as hinges like the elbow joint.\n\n==Door types==\nThere are many types of [[door]] hinges. The main types include:\n\n;Spring hinge: a spring-loaded hinge made to provide assistance in the closing or the opening of the hinge leaves. A ''spring'' is a component of a hinge, that applies force to secure a hinge closed or keep a hinge opened.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spring Hinges|url=http://www.guden.com/ItemDisplay/Spring-Hinges|website=Guden|accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref>\n;Barrel hinge: a sectional barrel secured by a [[wiktionary:pivot|pivot]]. A ''barrel'' is a component of a hinge, that has a hollow [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] shaped section where the rotational bearing force is applied to the pivot, and may also have a [[screw]] shaped section for fastening and/or driving the pivot.\n;Pivot hinges: which pivot in openings in the floor and the top of the door frame. Also referred to as a double-acting floor hinge. This type is found in ancient dry stone buildings and rarely in old wooden buildings. These are also called haar-hung doors. They are a low cost alternative for use with light weight doors.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pivot Hinges|url=http://www.guden.com/ItemDisplay/PivotHinges|website=Guden|accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref>\n;Butt / mortise hinges:usually in threes or fours, which are inset (mortised) into the door and frame. Most residential hinges found in the U.S. are made of steel, although mortise hinges for exterior doors are often made of brass or stainless steel to prevent corrosion.\n;Case hinges: Case hinges are similar to a butt hinge however usually more of a decorative nature most commonly used in suitcases, briefcases and the like. Traveling trunks were often utilized in the 17th and 18th centuries for storing personal items and these chest hinges are found in the archaeological record<ref>https://jefpat.maryland.gov/Pages/mac-lab/curators-choice/2018-curators-choice/2018-03-stumbling-upon-a-storage-chest.aspx</ref>.\n[[File:Continuoushinge.jpg|50px|right]]\n;Continuous hinges, or piano hinges: This type of hinge is also known as a piano hinge. It runs the entire length of the door, panel, or box. Continuous hinges are manufactured with or without holes. These hinges also come in various thicknesses, pin diameters, and knuckle lengths.\n[[File:Topfscharnier.jpg|50px|right]]\n;{{anchor|Concealed hinge}}[[Concealed hinge jig#Concealed hinges|Concealed hinges]]:Used for furniture doors (with or without self-closing feature, and with or without damping systems). They are made of two parts: One part is the hinge cup and the arm, the other part is the mounting plate. Also called \"cup hinge\", or \"Euro hinge\", as they were developed in Europe and use metric installation standards. Most such concealed hinges offer the advantage of full ''in situ'' adjustability for standoff distance from the cabinet face as well as pitch and roll by means of two screws on each hinge.\n;Butterfly hinges, or parliament (UK) hinges: These were known as dovetail hinges from the 17th century onwards and can be found on old desks and cabinets from about 1670 until the 18th century. The form of these hinges varied slightly between manufacturers, and their size ranged from the very large for heavy doors to the tiniest decorative hinge for use on jewellery boxes. Many hinges of this type were exported to America to support the home trade's limited supply. They are still found to be both fairly cheap and decorative, especially on small items.\n;Flag hinges: A flag hinge can be taken apart with a fixed pin on one leaf. Flag hinges can also swivel a full 360 degrees around the pin. Flag hinges are manufactured as a right hand and a left hand configuration.\n[[File:Hinge 03.jpg|50px|right]]\n{{Anchor|strap hinges}}\n;Strap hinges: An early hinge and used on many kinds of interior and exterior doors and cabinets.\n;H hinges:Shaped like an H and used on flush-mounted doors. Small H hinges ({{convert|3|\u2013|4|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) tend to be used for cabinets hinges, while larger hinges ({{convert|6|\u2013|7|in|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are for passage doors or closet doors.\n;HL hinges: Large HL hinges were common for passage doors, room doors and closet doors in the 17th, 18th and even 19th centuries. On taller doors H hinges were occasionally used in the middle along with the HL hinges.\n;Self closing hinge: a spring-loaded hinge with speed control function. The same as ''spring hinge'', use ''spring'' to provide force to close the door and provide a mechanical or hydraulic damper to control door close speed.

Hinges are used in contemporary [[architecture]] where building settlement can be expected over the life of the building. For example, the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California|Brisbane]], [[California]], was designed with its entrance ramp on a large hinge to allow settlement of the building built on piles over [[bay mud]]. This device was effective until October 2006, when it was replaced due to damage and excessive ramp slope.\n\n==Large structures==\nHinges appear in large structures such as elevated freeway and railroad viaducts. These are included to reduce or eliminate the transfer of bending stresses between structural components, typically in an effort to reduce sensitivity to [[earthquakes]]. The primary reason for using a hinge, rather than a simpler device such as a slide, is to prevent the separation of adjacent components. When no bending stresses are transmitted across the hinge it is called a ''zero moment hinge''.\n\n== Spacecraft ==\n\nPeople have developed a variety of self-actuating, self-locking hinge designs for spacecraft [[deployable structure]]s such as [[solar array]] panels, synthetic aperture radar antennas, booms, radiators, etc.<ref>\nAlan M.
