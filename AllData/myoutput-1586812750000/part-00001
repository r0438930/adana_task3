[[John Barwell Cator]] and his family began the leasing and selling of land for the building of villas which led to a rapid increase in population, between 1850 and 1900, from 2,000 to 26,000. Housing and population growth has continued at a lesser pace since 1900.\n\nThe town, directly west of [[Bromley]], has areas of commerce and industry, principally around the curved network of streets featuring its high street and is served in transport by three main railway stations &mdash; nine within the post town &mdash; plus towards its western periphery two [[Tramlink]] stations. In common with the rest of Bromley, the largest borough of London by area, Beckenham has several pockets of recreational land which are a mixture of sports grounds, fishing ponds and parks.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe place-name 'Beckenham' is first attested in a Saxon charter of 862 as ''Biohhahema mearc''.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.33.</ref>\nThe settlement is referred to as ''Bacheham'' in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and in the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'' as ''Becceham''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> The name is thought to derive from ''Beohha'''s homestead (Beohha + ham in [[Old English]]).<ref name=Brewer>Brewer's Britain and Ireland, compiled by John Ayto and Ian Crofton, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-304-35385-X}}.</ref> The name of the small stream here \u2013 the River Beck \u2013 is most likely to have been named after the village. Other variants of the  name Beckingham (can be confused with a place in Lincolnshire) or Beghenham. (sources: British History Online, The National Archive).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Beckenham2.jpg|thumb|left|Central Beckenham, flooded in 1878.]]\n\nAlthough early written history tells little of the area, archaeological evidence at Holwood Park, where [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] artifacts have been found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] camp was sited here, and a [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]], the [[London to Lewes Way (Roman road)|London to Lewes Way]] passed through the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenhamhistory.co.uk/beckenhamearlyhistory.html|title=Search|work=beckenhamhistory.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://www.beckenhamplaceparkfriends.org.uk/index.html</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Normans]], the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham. St George's Church was built in the 12th century. In the Middle Ages, the manor lands were divided: The other estates of Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley form the bulk of Beckenham. Beckenham still remained a small village until well into the 19th century. The beginning of its growth began after 1825 When the estates of John Cator and Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydir began to be developed. In 1760, (source: Peter Collinson, Cator's father in law, in his <ref>Hortus Collinsonianus</ref>) [[John Cator]] built Beckenham Place and became Lord of the Manor in 1773 after purchasing the Manor of Beckenham from Frederick St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke. After he died in 1806, his heirs (Joseph Cator's sons) soon became aware that the area in such close proximity to London was ripe for development, especially once the railway had arrived in 1857; and large villas began to be built around the new station. Wide roads and large gardens epitomised these properties often built by developers who acquired land from the Cators.(sources: Bromley Historic Collections catalogue; Cator)\nPeter Burrell, Baron Gwydir died in 1820 and his estates were purchased by the Hoare banking family and the Goodharts who purchased Langley. These estates were subsequently split up and developed. \nBetween then and the early 20th century, further growth of Beckenham took place: the [[Shortlands]] area in 1863; Clock House in the 1890s; [[Elmers End]] in 1911 (where smaller suburban houses were built); Park Langley in 1908; and Eden Park in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |title=Ideal Homes: Suburbia in Focus |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921071901/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |archive-date=21 September 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Manor of Foxgrove was also broken up at some point: its name is commemorated in a local road.\n\nBeckenham is a [[suburb]] and a town in its own right with a non-bypassed non-pedestrianised [[high street]] on a route between the rest of the borough and [[South London]] and has spread about its centre on 15 pre-1850 houses which are [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|title=About Beckenham Town Centre & Historical Information  - Beckenham TownTalk|work=towntalk.co.uk|access-date=4 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023142937/http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|archive-date=23 October 2009|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261534|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 1-3 Kelsey Square</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261549|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 4-7 Kelsey Square</ref>\n\n{{See also|Municipal Borough of Beckenham}}\n\n==Governance==\nThe [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]] came into being in 1935. It took over from what had been, since 1894, Beckenham [[Urban District Council]] and included parts of [[Hayes, Kent|Hayes]] and [[West Wickham]], previously part of Bromley [[Rural District Council]]. The new Borough status reflected the growth of Beckenham in less than fifty years.<ref>In 1861 its population was 2,100; by 1921 this had increased to 33,300, and to 77,300 by 1961.

There is also [[St George's Church, Beckenham|St George's Church]], dating back to 1100 but mostly rebuilt at the end of the 19th century. The [[lych gate]] dates from the 13th century, and is one of the oldest in England; the almshouses date back to 1694. There are two old pubs, Ye Olde George Inn (1662), and the Three Tuns (now a branch of [[Zizzi]] restaurants).\n\n[[Kelsey Park]] is another landmark.

[[John Barwell Cator]] and his family began the leasing and selling of land for the building of villas which led to a rapid increase in population, between 1850 and 1900, from 2,000 to 26,000. Housing and population growth has continued at a lesser pace since 1900.\n\nThe town, directly west of [[Bromley]], has areas of commerce and industry, principally around the curved network of streets featuring its high street and is served in transport by three main railway stations &mdash; nine within the post town &mdash; plus towards its western periphery two [[Tramlink]] stations. In common with the rest of Bromley, the largest borough of London by area, Beckenham has several pockets of recreational land which are a mixture of sports grounds, fishing ponds and parks.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe place-name 'Beckenham' is first attested in a Saxon charter of 862 as ''Biohhahema mearc''.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.33.</ref>\nThe settlement is referred to as ''Bacheham'' in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and in the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'' as ''Becceham''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> The name is thought to derive from ''Beohha'''s homestead (Beohha + ham in [[Old English]]).<ref name=Brewer>Brewer's Britain and Ireland, compiled by John Ayto and Ian Crofton, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-304-35385-X}}.</ref> The name of the small stream here \u2013 the River Beck \u2013 is most likely to have been named after the village. Other variants of the  name Beckingham (can be confused with a place in Lincolnshire) or Beghenham. (sources: British History Online, The National Archive). \n\n==History==\n[[File:Beckenham2.jpg|thumb|left|Central Beckenham, flooded in 1878.]]\n\nAlthough early written history tells little of the area, archaeological evidence at Holwood Park, where [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] artifacts have been found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] camp was sited here, and a [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]], the [[London to Lewes Way (Roman road)|London to Lewes Way]] passed through the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenhamhistory.co.uk/beckenhamearlyhistory.html|title=Search|work=beckenhamhistory.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://www.beckenhamplaceparkfriends.org.uk/index.html</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Normans]], the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham. St George's Church was built in the 12th century. In the Middle Ages, the manor lands were divided: The other estates of Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley form the bulk of Beckenham. Beckenham still remained a small village until well into the 19th century. The beginning of its growth began after 1825 When the estates of John Cator and Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydir began to be developed. In 1760,(source: Peter Collinson, Cator's father in law, in his <ref>Hortus Collinsonianus</ref>) [[John Cator]] built Beckenham Place and became Lord of the Manor in 1773 after purchasing the Manor of Beckenham from Frederick St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke. After he died in 1806, his heirs (Joseph Cator's sons) soon became aware that the area in such close proximity to London was ripe for development, especially once the railway had arrived in 1857; and large villas began to be built around the new station. Wide roads and large gardens epitomised these properties often built by developers who acquired land from the Cators.(sources: Bromley Historic Collections catalogue; Cator)\nPeter Burrell, Baron Gwydir died in 1820 and his estates were purchased by the Hoare banking family and the Goodharts who purchased Langley. These estates were subsequently split up and developed. \nBetween then and the early 20th century, further growth of Beckenham took place: the [[Shortlands]] area in 1863; Clock House in the 1890s; [[Elmers End]] in 1911 (where smaller suburban houses were built); Park Langley in 1908; and Eden Park in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |title=Ideal Homes: Suburbia in Focus |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921071901/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |archive-date=21 September 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Manor of Foxgrove was also broken up at some point: its name is commemorated in a local road.\n\nBeckenham is a [[suburb]] and a town in its own right with a non-bypassed non-pedestrianised [[high street]] on a route between the rest of the borough and [[South London]] and has spread about its centre on 15 pre-1850 houses which are [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|title=About Beckenham Town Centre & Historical Information  - Beckenham TownTalk|work=towntalk.co.uk|access-date=4 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023142937/http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|archive-date=23 October 2009|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261534|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 1-3 Kelsey Square</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261549|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 4-7 Kelsey Square</ref>\n\n{{See also|Municipal Borough of Beckenham}}\n\n==Governance==\nThe [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]] came into being in 1935.
