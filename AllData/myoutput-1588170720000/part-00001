of dysentery is bacillary dysentery, which is typically a mild sickness, causing symptoms normally consisting of mild gut pains and frequent passage of stool or diarrhea. Symptoms normally present themselves after 1\u20133 days, and are usually no longer present after a week. The frequency of urges to defecate, the large volume of liquid feces ejected, and the presence of blood, mucus, or pus depends on the [[pathogen]] causing the disease. Temporary [[lactose intolerance]] can occur, as well. In some caustic occasions, severe abdominal cramps, [[fever]], [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], and [[delirium]] can all be symptoms.<ref name=Dor2009/><ref name=\"pmid359524\">{{cite journal |last=DuPont |first=H.

More often, individuals will complain of [[diarrhea]] with [[blood]], accompanied by abdominal pain, [[rectal pain]] and a low-grade [[fever]]. Rapid weight loss and [[muscle ache]]s sometimes also accompany dysentery, while [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] are rare. On rare occasions, the [[Amoeba|amoebic parasite]] will invade the body through the bloodstream and [[Systemic disease|spread beyond the intestines]].  In such cases, it may more seriously infect other organs such as the [[Human brain|brain]], [[Human lungs|lungs]], and most commonly the [[Human liver|liver]].<ref name=Diagnosis>{{cite web | website=mdguidelines.com | title=Dysentery-Diagnosis | url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/dysentery/diagnosis | accessdate=November 17, 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714063637/http://www.mdguidelines.com/dysentery/diagnosis | archivedate=14 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\n\n[[File:A cross-section of diseased intestines (dysentery). Coloured Wellcome V0009858ER.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of diseased intestines. Colored lithograph {{circa|1843}}]]\n\nDysentery results from [[bacteria]]l, or [[Parasitism|parasitic]] infections. Viruses do not generally cause the disease.<ref name=CDC2019/> These pathogens typically reach the [[large intestine]] after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so on.\n\nEach specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general, the result is damage to the intestinal linings, leading to the [[Inflammation|inflammatory immune responses]]. This can cause [[Fever|elevated physical temperature]], painful spasms of the intestinal muscles ([[cramping]]), swelling due to fluid leaking from capillaries of the intestine ([[edema]]) and further tissue damage by the body's immune cells and the chemicals, called [[cytokine]]s, which are released to fight the infection. The result can be impaired nutrient absorption, excessive water and mineral loss through the stools due to breakdown of the control mechanisms in the intestinal tissue that normally remove water from the stools, and in severe cases, the entry of pathogenic organisms into the bloodstream. [[Anemia]] may also arise due to the blood loss through diarrhea.\n\nBacterial infections that cause bloody diarrhea are typically classified as being either invasive or toxogenic. Invasive species cause damage directly by invading into the mucosa. The toxogenic species do not invade, but cause cellular damage by secreting toxins, resulting in bloody diarrhea. This is also in contrast to toxins that cause watery diarrhea, which usually do not cause cellular damage, but rather they take over cellular machinery for a portion of life of the cell.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Boards and Beyond: Infectious Disease|last=Ryan|first=Jason|year=2016|isbn=|edition=Version 9-26-2016|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSome microorganisms &ndash; for example, bacteria of the genus ''[[Shigella]]'' &ndash; secrete substances known as [[cytotoxin]]s, which kill and damage intestinal tissue on contact. Shigella is thought to cause bleeding due to invasion rather than toxin, because even non-toxogenic strains can cause dysentery, but E. coli with shiga-like toxins do not invade the intestinal mucosa, and are therefore toxin dependent.\n\nDefinitions of dysentery can vary by region and by medical specialty. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits its definition to \"diarrhea with visible blood\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf |work=WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.8 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta, Georgia 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305065701/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> Others define the term more broadly.<ref name=TFD>{{cite web|title=Dysentery|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dysentery|publisher=TheFreeDictionary's Medical dictionary}}</ref> These differences in definition must be taken into account when defining mechanisms. For example, using the CDC definition requires that intestinal tissue be so severely damaged that blood vessels have ruptured, allowing visible quantities of blood to be lost with defecation. Other definitions require less specific damage.\n\n===Amoebic dysentery===\n{{main|Amoebiasis}}\n\n[[Amoebiasis]], also known as amoebic dysentery, is caused by an infection from the [[amoeba]] ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=WHO | title=''Amoebiasis. Report of a WHO Expert Committee |journal=WHO Technical Report Series |year=1969 |volume=421 |pages=1\u201352 |pmid=4978968 | author-link=World Health Organization }}</ref> which is found mainly in tropical areas.<ref>{{MeshName|Amebic+Dysentery}}</ref> Proper treatment of the underlying infection of amoebic dysentery is important; insufficiently treated amoebiasis can lie dormant for years and subsequently lead to [[Amoebiasis#Complications|severe, potentially fatal, complications]].\n\nWhen amoebae inside the bowel of an infected person are ready to leave the body, they group together and form a shell that surrounds and protects them. This group of amoebae is known as a cyst, which is then passed out of the person's body in the feces and can survive outside the body. If hygiene standards are poor \u2013 for example, if the person does not dispose of the feces hygienically \u2013 then it can contaminate the surroundings, such as nearby food and water.\nIf another person then eats or drinks food or water that has been contaminated with feces containing the cyst, that person will also become infected with the amoebae. Amoebic dysentery is particularly common in parts of the world where human feces are used as fertilizer.\nAfter entering the person's body through the mouth, the cyst travels down into the stomach. The amoebae inside the cyst are protected from the stomach's digestive acid. From the stomach, the cyst travels to the intestines, where it breaks open and releases the amoebae, causing the infection. The amoebae can burrow into the walls of the intestines and cause small abscesses and ulcers to form. The cycle then begins again.\n\n===Bacillary dysentery===\n{{Main|Bacillary dysentery}}\n\nDysentery may also be caused by [[shigellosis]], an infection by [[bacteria]] of the genus ''Shigella'', and is then known as bacillary dysentery (or Marlow syndrome). The term ''bacillary dysentery'' etymologically might seem to refer to any dysentery caused by any [[bacillus (shape)|bacilliform]] bacteria, but its meaning is restricted by convention to ''Shigella'' dysentery.\n\n===Other bacteria===\n\nSome strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cause bloody diarrhea. The typical culprits are [[shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterohemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'']], of which [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]] is the best known.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA diagnosis may be made by taking a history and doing a brief examination. Dysentery should not be confused with [[hematochezia]], which is the passage of fresh blood through the anus, usually in or with stools.\n\n===Physical exam===\nThe mouth, skin, and lips may appear dry due to dehydration. Lower abdominal tenderness may also be present.<ref name=Diagnosis/>\n\n===Stool and blood tests===\n\n[[cell culture|Cultures]] of [[stool sample]]s are examined to identify the organism causing dysentery. Usually, several samples must be obtained due to the number of amoebae, which changes daily.<ref name=Diagnosis/> [[Blood test]]s can be used to measure abnormalities in the levels of essential [[electrolyte|minerals and salts]].<ref name=Diagnosis/>\n\n==Prevention==\nEfforts to prevent dysentery include [[hand washing]] and [[food safety]] measures while traveling in areas of high risk.<ref name=NHS2019/>\n\n===Vaccine===\nAlthough there is currently no vaccine which protects against ''Shigella'' infection, several are in development.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/|title=WHO vaccine pipeline tracker|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725174627/http://who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/|archivedate=25 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Vaccination may eventually become a part of the strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea, particularly among children in low-resource settings. For example, ''Shigella'' is a longstanding World Health Organization (WHO) target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent this disease should be feasible. The development of vaccines against these types of infection has been hampered by technical constraints, insufficient support for coordination, and a lack of market forces for research and development. Most vaccine development efforts are taking place in the public sector or as research programs within biotechnology companies.\n\n== Treatment ==\nDysentery is managed by maintaining fluids using [[oral rehydration therapy]]. If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for [[intravenous]] fluid replacement. In ideal situations, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an [[amebicide|amoebicidal]] drug to kill the [[parasite]], and an [[antibiotic]] to treat any associated bacterial infection.\n\nIf shigellosis is suspected and it is not too severe, letting it run its course may be reasonable \u2014 usually less than a week. If the case is severe, antibiotics such as [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|TMP-SMX]] or oral cefixime may be useful. However, many strains of ''Shigella'' are becoming resistant to common antibiotics, and effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries. If necessary, a doctor may have to reserve antibiotics for those at highest risk for death, including young children, people over 50, and anyone suffering from dehydration or malnutrition.\n\nAmoebic dysentery is often treated with two antimicrobial drugs such as [[metronidazole]] and [[paromomycin]] or [[iodoquinol]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chapter 3 Infectious Diseases Related To Travel|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/amebiasis|website=CDC|accessdate=9 June 2014|date=August 1, 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714124434/http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2014/chapter-3-infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/amebiasis|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\n\nWith correct treatment, most cases of amoebic and bacterial dysentery subside within 10 days, and most individuals achieve a full recovery within two to four weeks after beginning proper treatment.  If the disease is left untreated, the prognosis varies with the immune status of the individual patient and the severity of disease.

On rare occasions, the [[Amoeba|amoebic parasite]] will invade the body through the bloodstream and [[Systemic disease|spread beyond the intestines]].  In such cases, it may more seriously infect other organs such as the [[Human brain|brain]], [[Human lungs|lungs]], and most commonly the [[Human liver|liver]].<ref name=Diagnosis>{{cite web | website=mdguidelines.com | title=Dysentery-Diagnosis | url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/dysentery/diagnosis | accessdate=November 17, 2010 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714063637/http://www.mdguidelines.com/dysentery/diagnosis | archivedate=14 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\n\n[[File:A cross-section of diseased intestines (dysentery). Coloured Wellcome V0009858ER.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of diseased intestines. Colored lithograph {{circa|1843}}]]\n\nDysentery results from [[bacteria]]l, or [[Parasitism|parasitic]] infections. Viruses do not generally cause the disease.<ref name=CDC2019/> These pathogens typically reach the [[large intestine]] after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so on.\n\nEach specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general, the result is damage to the intestinal linings, leading to the [[Inflammation|inflammatory immune responses]]. This can cause [[Fever|elevated physical temperature]], painful spasms of the intestinal muscles ([[cramping]]), swelling due to fluid leaking from capillaries of the intestine ([[edema]]) and further tissue damage by the body's immune cells and the chemicals, called [[cytokine]]s, which are released to fight the infection. The result can be impaired nutrient absorption, excessive water and mineral loss through the stools due to breakdown of the control mechanisms in the intestinal tissue that normally remove water from the stools, and in severe cases, the entry of pathogenic organisms into the bloodstream. [[Anemia]] may also arise due to the blood loss through diarrhea.\n\nBacterial infections that cause bloody diarrhea are typically classified as being either invasive or toxogenic. Invasive species cause damage directly by invading into the mucosa. The toxogenic species do not invade, but cause cellular damage by secreting toxins, resulting in bloody diarrhea. This is also in contrast to toxins that cause watery diarrhea, which usually do not cause cellular damage, but rather they take over cellular machinery for a portion of life of the cell.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Boards and Beyond: Infectious Disease|last=Ryan|first=Jason|year=2016|isbn=|edition=Version 9-26-2016|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSome microorganisms &ndash; for example, bacteria of the genus ''[[Shigella]]'' &ndash; secrete substances known as [[cytotoxin]]s, which kill and damage intestinal tissue on contact. Shigella is thought to cause bleeding due to invasion rather than toxin, because even non-toxogenic strains can cause dysentery, but E. coli with shiga-like toxins do not invade the intestinal mucosa, and are therefore toxin dependent.\n\nDefinitions of dysentery can vary by region and by medical specialty. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits its definition to \"diarrhea with visible blood\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Laboratory Methods for the Diagnosis of Epidemic Dysentery and Cholera |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf |work=WHO/CDS/CSR/EDC/99.8 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta, Georgia 1999 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305065701/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/cholera/complete.pdf |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}</ref> Others define the term more broadly.<ref name=TFD>{{cite web|title=Dysentery|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/dysentery|publisher=TheFreeDictionary's Medical dictionary}}</ref> These differences in definition must be taken into account when defining mechanisms. For example, using the CDC definition requires that intestinal tissue be so severely damaged that blood vessels have ruptured, allowing visible quantities of blood to be lost with defecation. Other definitions require less specific damage.\n\n===Amoebic dysentery===\n{{main|Amoebiasis}}\n\n[[Amoebiasis]], also known as amoebic dysentery, is caused by an infection from the [[amoeba]] ''[[Entamoeba histolytica]]'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=WHO | title=''Amoebiasis. Report of a WHO Expert Committee |journal=WHO Technical Report Series |year=1969 |volume=421 |pages=1\u201352 |pmid=4978968 | author-link=World Health Organization }}</ref> which is found mainly in tropical areas.<ref>{{MeshName|Amebic+Dysentery}}</ref> Proper treatment of the underlying infection of amoebic dysentery is important; insufficiently treated amoebiasis can lie dormant for years and subsequently lead to [[Amoebiasis#Complications|severe, potentially fatal, complications]].\n\nWhen amoebae inside the bowel of an infected person are ready to leave the body, they group together and form a shell that surrounds and protects them. This group of amoebae is known as a cyst, which is then passed out of the person's body in the feces and can survive outside the body. If hygiene standards are poor \u2013 for example, if the person does not dispose of the feces hygienically \u2013 then it can contaminate the surroundings, such as nearby food and water.\nIf another person then eats or drinks food or water that has been contaminated with feces containing the cyst, that person will also become infected with the amoebae. Amoebic dysentery is particularly common in parts of the world where human feces are used as fertilizer.\nAfter entering the person's body through the mouth, the cyst travels down into the stomach. The amoebae inside the cyst are protected from the stomach's digestive acid. From the stomach, the cyst travels to the intestines, where it breaks open and releases the amoebae, causing the infection. The amoebae can burrow into the walls of the intestines and cause small abscesses and ulcers to form. The cycle then begins again.\n\n===Bacillary dysentery===\n{{Main|Bacillary dysentery}}\n\nDysentery may also be caused by [[shigellosis]], an infection by [[bacteria]] of the genus ''Shigella'', and is then known as bacillary dysentery (or Marlow syndrome). The term ''bacillary dysentery'' etymologically might seem to refer to any dysentery caused by any [[bacillus (shape)|bacilliform]] bacteria, but its meaning is restricted by convention to ''Shigella'' dysentery.\n\n===Other bacteria===\n\nSome strains of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' cause bloody diarrhea. The typical culprits are [[shigatoxigenic and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli|enterohemorrhagic ''Escherichia coli'']], of which [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|O157:H7]] is the best known.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA diagnosis may be made by taking a history and doing a brief examination. Dysentery should not be confused with [[hematochezia]], which is the passage of fresh blood through the anus, usually in or with stools.\n\n===Physical exam===\nThe mouth, skin, and lips may appear dry due to dehydration. Lower abdominal tenderness may also be present.<ref name=Diagnosis/>\n\n===Stool and blood tests===\n\n[[cell culture|Cultures]] of [[stool sample]]s are examined to identify the organism causing dysentery. Usually, several samples must be obtained due to the number of amoebae, which changes daily.<ref name=Diagnosis/> [[Blood test]]s can be used to measure abnormalities in the levels of essential [[electrolyte|minerals and salts]].<ref name=Diagnosis/>\n\n==Prevention==\nEfforts to prevent dysentery include [[hand washing]] and [[food safety]] measures while traveling in areas of high risk.<ref name=NHS2019/>\n\n===Vaccine===\nAlthough there is currently no vaccine which protects against ''Shigella'' infection, several are in development.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/|title=WHO vaccine pipeline tracker|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-21|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725174627/http://who.int/immunization/research/vaccine_pipeline_tracker_spreadsheet/en/|archivedate=25 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Vaccination may eventually become a part of the strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea, particularly among children in low-resource settings. For example, ''Shigella'' is a longstanding World Health Organization (WHO) target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent this disease should be feasible. The development of vaccines against these types of infection has been hampered by technical constraints, insufficient support for coordination, and a lack of market forces for research and development. Most vaccine development efforts are taking place in the public sector or as research programs within biotechnology companies.\n\n== Treatment ==\nDysentery is managed by maintaining fluids using [[oral rehydration therapy]]. If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for [[intravenous]] fluid replacement. In ideal situations, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an [[amebicide|amoebicidal]] drug to kill the [[parasite]], and an [[antibiotic]] to treat any associated bacterial infection.\n\nIf shigellosis is suspected and it is not too severe, letting it run its course may be reasonable \u2014 usually less than a week. If the case is severe, antibiotics such as [[ciprofloxacin]] or [[Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|TMP-SMX]] may be useful. However, many strains of ''Shigella'' are becoming resistant to common antibiotics, and effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries.
