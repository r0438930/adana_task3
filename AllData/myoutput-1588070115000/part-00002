Galle reached the height of its development in the 18th century, during the [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Dutch colonial period]]. Galle is the best example of a fortified city built by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in South and Southeast [[Asia]], showing the interaction between [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[architectural]] styles and native traditions. The city was extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. The [[Galle fort]] is a world heritage site and is the largest remaining [[fortress]] in Asia built by European occupiers.\n\nOther prominent [[landmark]]s in Galle include the [[Galle Harbour|city's natural harbour]], the [[National Maritime Museum (Galle)|National Maritime Museum]], [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Galle|St. Mary's Cathedral]] founded by [[Jesuit]] [[priest]]s, one of the main [[Shiva]] temples on the island, and [[Amangalla]], the historic luxury hotel. On 26 December 2004, the city was devastated by the massive tsunami caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which occurred off the coast of [[Indonesia]] a thousand miles away. Thousands were killed in the city alone. Galle is home to the [[Galle International Stadium]], which is considered to be one of the most picturesque [[cricket]] grounds in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/pitching-it-up-the-galle-international-stadium/|title=Pitching it Up: The Galle International Stadium|publisher=World Cricket Watch|year=2011|access-date=2013-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213018/http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/pitching-it-up-the-galle-international-stadium/|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ground, which was severely damaged by the tsunami, was rebuilt and [[Test Cricket|test]] matches resumed there on 18 December 2007.\n\nImportant natural geographical features in Galle include Rumassala in [[Unawatuna]], a large mound-like hill that forms the eastern protective barrier to Galle Harbour. Local tradition associates this hill with some events of [[Ramayana]], one of the great Hindu epics. The major river in the area is the [[Gin River]] ''(Gin Ganga)'', which begins from Gongala Kanda, passes villages such as Neluwa, Nagoda, Baddegama, [[Thelikada]] and Wakwella, and reaches the sea at Ginthota. The river is bridged at Wakwella by the [[Wakwella Bridge]].\n\n==Etymology==\nGalle was known as ''Gimhathitha'' in ancient times. The term is believed to be derived from the classical [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] term meaning \"port near the river Gin\". It is believed that the town got its name as ''Gaalla'' in the native tongue as a result of the large number of bullock carts that took shelter in the area, following the long slow journeys from remote areas of the island. \"''Gaala''\" in Sinhala means the place where cattle are herded together; hence the Sinhalese name for Galle, \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd,  is a  development from 'Gaala'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysrilankaholidays.com/galle-dutch-fort.html|title=VOC Galle Dutch Fort, South Coast, Sri Lanka (A World Heritage Site)|publisher=My Sri Lanka Holidays|accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://discover.lankanest.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=100&Itemid=71.html/ |title=Galle and Galle Fort. |publisher=Discover Sri Lanka |date=9 March 2008 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |author=Lanka Nest |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003141427/http://discover.lankanest.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=100&Itemid=71.html%2F |archivedate=3 October 2013 }}</ref> Another theory is that the word Galle is derived from the Latin word \u2018Gallus\u2019, which means [[rooster]].{{citation needed| date=February 2017}} The Dutch have used the rooster as a symbol of Galle, though probably the word comes from the Portuguese 'Galo' (rooster).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pointe de Galle sud de Ceylan en 1754.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|The port of Galle in 1754]]\nAccording to [[James Emerson Tennent]], Galle was the ancient seaport of [[Tarshish]], from which [[King Solomon]] drew [[ivory]], [[peacock]]s and other valuables.

Ptolemy might also have known about the port in which he referred to as Odoka. Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta visited Galle (or Qali as he called it) in 1342. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Sinhalese refugees fleeing from Tamil armies from the north began to settle in Galle and other nearby areas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=272|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nGalle had been a prominent seaport long before western rule in the country. [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arabs]], [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[India]]ns, and [[China|Chinese]] were doing business through Galle port.  In 1411, the [[Galle Trilingual Inscription]], a stone tablet inscription in three languages, [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], was erected in Galle to commemorate [[Ming treasure voyages|the second visit to Sri Lanka]] by the Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]].\nIn 1502, when a small fleet of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ships, under the command of [[Louren\u00e7o de Almeida]], on their way to the [[Maldives]], were blown off course by a storm. Realising that the [[Kingdom of Kotte#History|king]] resided in [[Kotte#History|Kotte]] close to [[Colombo]], Louren\u00e7o proceeded there after a brief stop in Galle.\n\nIn 1640, the [[Siege of Galle (1640)|Portuguese were forced to surrender]] to the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The Dutch built the present [[Galle Fort|fort]] in 1663. They built a fortified solid granite wall and three bastions, known as \"Sun\", \"Moon\" and \"Star\".\n\nAfter the [[British Ceylon|British]] took over the country from the Dutch in 1796, the British preserved the fort unchanged and used it as the administrative centre of the district.\n\n==Climate==\nGalle features a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. The city has no true [[dry season]], though it is noticeably drier in the months of January and February. As is commonplace with many cities with this type of climate, temperatures show little variation throughout the course of the year, with average temperatures hovering at around 26 degrees Celsius throughout.\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Galle\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 34.9\n|Feb record high C = 34.6\n|Mar record high C = 36.4\n|Apr record high C = 35.5\n|May record high C = 35.3\n|Jun record high C = 32.6\n|Jul record high C = 31.2\n|Aug record high C = 31.3\n|Sep record high C = 31.2\n|Oct record high C = 33.2\n|Nov record high C = 33.4\n|Dec record high C = 33.5\n|year record high C = \n|Jan high C = 29.0\n|Feb high C = 29.0\n|Mar high C = 29.9\n|Apr high C = 30.6\n|May high C = 30.6\n|Jun high C = 29.8\n|Jul high C = 29.0\n|Aug high C = 28.6\n|Sep high C = 28.4\n|Oct high C = 28.5\n|Nov high C = 28.7\n|Dec high C = 29.1\n|year high C = 29.3\n|Jan low C = 22.8\n|Feb low C = 23.0\n|Mar low C = 23.9\n|Apr low C = 24.8\n|May low C = 25.5\n|Jun low C = 25.2\n|Jul low C = 24.8\n|Aug low C = 24.7\n|Sep low C = 24.7\n|Oct low C = 24.1\n|Nov low C = 23.5\n|Dec low C = 23.1\n|year low C = 24.2\n|Jan record low C = 18.7\n|Feb record low C = 19.4\n|Mar record low C = 17.1\n|Apr record low C = 18.2\n|May record low C = 17.1\n|Jun record low C = 20.7\n|Jul record low C = 20.9\n|Aug record low C = 20.9\n|Sep record low C = 20.4\n|Oct record low C = 20.7\n|Nov record low C = 18.1\n|Dec record low C = 18.9\n|year record low C = \n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 85.1\n|Feb rain mm = 70.5\n|Mar rain mm = 111.3\n|Apr rain mm = 206.8\n|May rain mm = 290.4\n|Jun rain mm = 188.2\n|Jul rain mm = 163.2\n|Aug rain mm = 185.9\n|Sep rain mm = 255.8\n|Oct rain mm = 322.7\n|Nov rain mm = 321.0\n|Dec rain mm = 176.9\n|year rain mm = 2377.8\n|Jan rain days = 8\n|Feb rain days = 6\n|Mar rain days = 9\n|Apr rain days = 12\n|May rain days = 16\n|Jun rain days = 17\n|Jul rain days = 16\n|Aug rain days = 16\n|Sep rain days = 18\n|Oct rain days = 18\n|Nov rain days = 16\n|Dec rain days = 12\n|year rain days = 164\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organisation]]<ref name= WMO >{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=340\n| title = World Weather Information Service&nbsp;\u2014 Galle\n| publisher = World Meteorological Organisation\n| accessdate = 9 May 2016}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Department of Meteorology (records up to 2007)<ref name = records>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091229081618/http://www.meteo.gov.lk/Up_Date/weather/Extreme%20Values.pdf\n| archivedate = 29 December 2009\n| url = http://www.meteo.gov.lk/Up_Date/weather/Extreme%20Values.pdf\n| title = Ever Recorded Daily Extreme Values\n| publisher = Department of Meteorology\n| accessdate = 8 December 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n\n===Wards===\nGalle has fifteen [[Wards of Sri Lanka|wards]]:<ref>{{cite web|title=Administrations |url=http://www.cityofgalle.org |website=Galle city |accessdate=7 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110101801/http://galle.mc.gov.lk/en/Administrations/Administrations.php |archivedate=10 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Fort, Galle|Fort]]\n* [[Bazaar, Galle|Bazaar]]\n* [[Thalapitiya, Galle|Thalapitiya]]\n* [[Magalle, Galle|Magalle]]\n* [[Katugoda, Galle|Katugoda]]\n* [[Ethiligoda, Galle|Ethiligoda]]\n* [[Dangedara, Galle|Dangedara]]\n* [[Minuwangoda, Galle|Minuwangoda]]\n* [[Galwadugoda, Galle|Galwadugoda]]\n* [[Kaluwella, Galle|Kaluwella]]\n* [[Dadalla, Galle|Dadalla]]\n* [[Kumbalwella, Galle|Kumbalwella]]\n* [[Madawalamulla, Galle|Madawalamulla]]\n* [[Hirmbura, Galle|Hirmbura]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Governance==\nThe [[Galle Municipal Council]] governs the City of Galle, established under the Municipalities Ordinance of 1865.

Galle reached the height of its development in the 18th century, during the [[Dutch period in Ceylon|Dutch colonial period]]. Galle is the best example of a fortified city built by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in South and Southeast [[Asia]], showing the interaction between [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[architectural]] styles and native traditions. The city was extensively fortified by the Dutch during the 17th century from 1649 onwards. The [[Galle fort]] is a world heritage site and is the largest remaining [[fortress]] in Asia built by European occupiers.\n\nOther prominent [[landmark]]s in Galle include the [[Galle Harbour|city's natural harbour]], the [[National Maritime Museum (Galle)|National Maritime Museum]], [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Galle|St. Mary's Cathedral]] founded by [[Jesuit]] [[priest]]s, one of the main [[Shiva]] temples on the island, and [[Amangalla]], the historic luxury hotel. On 26 December 2004, the city was devastated by the massive tsunami caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]], which occurred off the coast of [[Indonesia]] a thousand miles away. Thousands were killed in the city alone. Galle is home to the [[Galle International Stadium]], which is considered to be one of the most picturesque [[cricket]] grounds in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/pitching-it-up-the-galle-international-stadium/|title=Pitching it Up: The Galle International Stadium|publisher=World Cricket Watch|year=2011|access-date=2013-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213018/http://worldcricketwatch.com/stories/feature/pitching-it-up-the-galle-international-stadium/|archive-date=2016-03-03|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ground, which was severely damaged by the tsunami, was rebuilt and [[Test Cricket|test]] matches resumed there on 18 December 2007.\n\nImportant natural geographical features in Galle include Rumassala in [[Unawatuna]], a large mound-like hill that forms the eastern protective barrier to Galle Harbour. Local tradition associates this hill with some events of [[Ramayana]], one of the great Hindu epics. The major river in the area is the [[Gin River]] ''(Gin Ganga)'', which begins from Gongala Kanda, passes villages such as Neluwa, Nagoda, Baddegama, [[Thelikada]] and Wakwella, and reaches the sea at Ginthota. The river is bridged at Wakwella by the [[Wakwella Bridge]].\n\n==Etymology==\nGalle was known as ''Gimhathitha'' in ancient times. The term is believed to be derived from the classical [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] term meaning \"port near the river Gin\". It is believed that the town got its name as ''Gaalla'' in the native tongue as a result of the large number of bullock carts that took shelter in the area, following the long slow journeys from remote areas of the island. \"''Gaala''\" in Sinhala means the place where cattle are herded together; hence the Sinhalese name for Galle, \u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd,  is a  development from 'Gaala'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysrilankaholidays.com/galle-dutch-fort.html|title=VOC Galle Dutch Fort, South Coast, Sri Lanka (A World Heritage Site)|publisher=My Sri Lanka Holidays|accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://discover.lankanest.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=100&Itemid=71.html/ |title=Galle and Galle Fort. |publisher=Discover Sri Lanka |date=9 March 2008 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |author=Lanka Nest |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003141427/http://discover.lankanest.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=100&Itemid=71.html%2F |archivedate=3 October 2013 }}</ref> Another theory is that the word Galle is derived from the Latin word \u2018Gallus\u2019, which means [[rooster]].{{citation needed| date=February 2017}} The Dutch have used the rooster as a symbol of Galle, though probably the word comes from the Portuguese 'Galo' (rooster).\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pointe de Galle sud de Ceylan en 1754.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|The port of Galle in 1754]]\nAccording to [[James Emerson Tennent]], Galle was the ancient seaport of [[Tarshish]], from which [[King Solomon]] drew [[ivory]], [[peacock]]s and other valuables.

Ptolemy might also have known about the port in which he referred to as Odoka. Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta visited Galle (or Qali as he called it) in 1342. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Sinhalese refugees fleeing from Tamil armies from the north began to settle in Galle and other nearby areas.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=272|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nGalle had been a prominent seaport long before western rule in the country. [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arabs]], [[Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[India]]ns, and [[China|Chinese]] were doing business through Galle port.  In 1411, the [[Galle Trilingual Inscription]], a stone tablet inscription in three languages, [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and [[Persian language|Persian]], was erected in Galle to commemorate [[Ming treasure voyages|the second visit to Sri Lanka]] by the Chinese admiral [[Zheng He]].\nIn 1502, when a small fleet of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ships, under the command of [[Louren\u00e7o de Almeida]], on their way to the [[Maldives]], were blown off course by a storm. Realising that the [[Kingdom of Kotte#History|king]] resided in [[Kotte#History|Kotte]] close to [[Colombo]], Louren\u00e7o proceeded there after a brief stop in Galle.\n\nIn 1640, the [[Siege of Galle (1640)|Portuguese were forced to surrender]] to the [[Dutch East India Company]]. The Dutch built the present [[Galle Fort|fort]] in 1663. They built a fortified solid granite wall and three bastions, known as \"Sun\", \"Moon\" and \"Star\".\n\nAfter the [[British Ceylon|British]] took over the country from the Dutch in 1796, the British preserved the fort unchanged and used it as the administrative centre of the district.\n\n==Climate==\nGalle features a [[tropical rainforest climate]]. The city has no true [[dry season]], though it is noticeably drier in the months of January and February. As is commonplace with many cities with this type of climate, temperatures show little variation throughout the course of the year, with average temperatures hovering at around 26 degrees Celsius throughout.\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Galle\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 34.9\n|Feb record high C = 34.6\n|Mar record high C = 36.4\n|Apr record high C = 35.5\n|May record high C = 35.3\n|Jun record high C = 32.6\n|Jul record high C = 31.2\n|Aug record high C = 31.3\n|Sep record high C = 31.2\n|Oct record high C = 33.2\n|Nov record high C = 33.4\n|Dec record high C = 33.5\n|year record high C = \n|Jan high C = 29.0\n|Feb high C = 29.0\n|Mar high C = 29.9\n|Apr high C = 30.6\n|May high C = 30.6\n|Jun high C = 29.8\n|Jul high C = 29.0\n|Aug high C = 28.6\n|Sep high C = 28.4\n|Oct high C = 28.5\n|Nov high C = 28.7\n|Dec high C = 29.1\n|year high C = 29.3\n|Jan low C = 22.8\n|Feb low C = 23.0\n|Mar low C = 23.9\n|Apr low C = 24.8\n|May low C = 25.5\n|Jun low C = 25.2\n|Jul low C = 24.8\n|Aug low C = 24.7\n|Sep low C = 24.7\n|Oct low C = 24.1\n|Nov low C = 23.5\n|Dec low C = 23.1\n|year low C = 24.2\n|Jan record low C = 18.7\n|Feb record low C = 19.4\n|Mar record low C = 17.1\n|Apr record low C = 18.2\n|May record low C = 17.1\n|Jun record low C = 20.7\n|Jul record low C = 20.9\n|Aug record low C = 20.9\n|Sep record low C = 20.4\n|Oct record low C = 20.7\n|Nov record low C = 18.1\n|Dec record low C = 18.9\n|year record low C = \n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 85.1\n|Feb rain mm = 70.5\n|Mar rain mm = 111.3\n|Apr rain mm = 206.8\n|May rain mm = 290.4\n|Jun rain mm = 188.2\n|Jul rain mm = 163.2\n|Aug rain mm = 185.9\n|Sep rain mm = 255.8\n|Oct rain mm = 322.7\n|Nov rain mm = 321.0\n|Dec rain mm = 176.9\n|year rain mm = 2377.8\n|Jan rain days = 8\n|Feb rain days = 6\n|Mar rain days = 9\n|Apr rain days = 12\n|May rain days = 16\n|Jun rain days = 17\n|Jul rain days = 16\n|Aug rain days = 16\n|Sep rain days = 18\n|Oct rain days = 18\n|Nov rain days = 16\n|Dec rain days = 12\n|year rain days = 164\n|source 1 = [[World Meteorological Organisation]]<ref name= WMO >{{cite web\n| url = http://worldweather.wmo.int/en/city.html?cityId=340\n| title = World Weather Information Service&nbsp;\u2014 Galle\n| publisher = World Meteorological Organisation\n| accessdate = 9 May 2016}}</ref>\n|source 2 = Department of Meteorology (records up to 2007)<ref name = records>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091229081618/http://www.meteo.gov.lk/Up_Date/weather/Extreme%20Values.pdf\n| archivedate = 29 December 2009\n| url = http://www.meteo.gov.lk/Up_Date/weather/Extreme%20Values.pdf\n| title = Ever Recorded Daily Extreme Values\n| publisher = Department of Meteorology\n| accessdate = 8 December 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n\n===Wards===\nGalle has fifteen [[Wards of Sri Lanka|wards]]:<ref>{{cite web|title=Administrations |url=http://www.cityofgalle.org |website=Galle city |accessdate=7 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110101801/http://galle.mc.gov.lk/en/Administrations/Administrations.php |archivedate=10 January 2015 }}</ref>\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Fort, Galle|Fort]]\n* [[Bazaar, Galle|Bazaar]]\n* [[Thalapitiya, Galle|Thalapitiya]]\n* [[Magalle, Galle|Magalle]]\n* [[Katugoda, Galle|Katugoda]]\n* [[Ethiligoda, Galle|Ethiligoda]]\n* [[Dangedara, Galle|Dangedara]]\n* [[Minuwangoda, Galle|Minuwangoda]]\n* [[Galwadugoda, Galle|Galwadugoda]]\n* [[Kaluwella, Galle|Kaluwella]]\n* [[Dadalla, Galle|Dadalla]]\n* [[Kumbalwella, Galle|Kumbalwella]]\n* [[Madawalamulla, Galle|Madawalamulla]]\n* [[Hirmbura, Galle|Hirmbura]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Governance==\nThe [[Galle Municipal Council]] governs the City of Galle, established under the Municipalities Ordinance of 1865.
