A [[Neolithic]] and a late [[Bronze Age]] settlement have been found in the Springfield suburb, and the town was occupied by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. A Roman fort was built in AD 60, and a civilian town grew up around it. The town was given the name of ''Caesaromagus'' (the market place of Caesar), although the reason for it being given the great honour of bearing the Imperial prefix is now unclear \u2013 possibly as a failed 'planned town' provincial capital to replace [[Londinium]] or [[Camulodunum]]. The remains of a ''[[mansio]]'', a combination post office, civic centre and hotel, lie beneath the streets of modern [[Moulsham]], and the ruins of an octagonal temple are located beneath the Odeon roundabout. The town disappeared for a while after the Romans left Britain.\n\nIn 1199, following the commissioning of a bridge over the [[River Can]] by [[Maurice (Bishop of London)|Maurice, Bishop of London]], [[William of Sainte-M\u00e8re-Eglise]] was granted a Royal Charter for Chelmsford to hold a market, marking the origin of the modern town. An under-cover market, operating Tuesday to Saturday, is still an important part of the city centre over 800 years later. The city's name is derived from ''Ceolmaer's [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]'' which was close to the site of the present High Street stone bridge. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, the town was called ''Celmeresfort'' and by 1189 it had changed to ''Chelmsford''. Its position on the Londinium \u2013 Camulodonum Roman road (the modern [[A12 road (England)|A12]]) ensured the early prosperity of Chelmsford.\n\nThe town became the seat of the local assize during the early 13th century (though assizes were also held at [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]]) and by 1218 it was recognised as the county town of Essex, a position it has retained to the present day. Chelmsford was significantly involved in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] moved on to the town after quelling the rebellion in London. 'The Sleepers and The Shadows', written by Hilda Grieve in 1988 using original sources, states: \"For nearly a week, from Monday 1st July to Saturday 6th July [1381], Chelmsford became the seat of government ... The king probably lodged at his nearby manor house at Writtle. He was attended by his council, headed by the temporary Chancellor ... the new chief justice ... the royal chancery ... Their formidable task in Chelmsford was to draft, engross, date, seal and despatch by messengers riding to the farthest corners of the realm, the daily batches of commissions, mandates, letters, orders and proclamations issued by the government not only to speed the process of pacification of the kingdom, but to conduct much ordinary day-to-day business of the Crown and Government.\" Richard II famously revoked the charters which he had made in concession to the peasants on 2 July 1381, while in Chelmsford. It could be said that given this movement of government power, Chelmsford for a few days at least became the capital of England. Many of the ringleaders of the revolt were executed on the gallows at what is now Primrose Hill.\n\nAn Anglo-Saxon burial was discovered at [[Broomfield, Essex|Broomfield]] to the north of Chelmsford in the late 19th century and the finds are now in the [[British Museum]]. The road 'Saxon Way' now marks the site. In the 17th century many of the victims of [[Matthew Hopkins]] (the self-styled \"Witchfinder General\") spent their last days imprisoned in Chelmsford, before being tried at the Assizes and hanged for [[witchcraft]].\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] purchased the Boleyn estate in 1516, and built [[Palace of Beaulieu|Beaulieu Palace]] on the current site of [[New Hall School]]. This later became the residence of his then mistress, and later wife Anne. Soon after it became the residence of Henry's daughter, by his first marriage, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].\n\nKing [[Robert I of Scotland]], better known as [[Robert the Bruce]], had close ties with the nearby village of [[Writtle]] and there is some evidence to suggest he was born at Montpeliers Farm in the village,<ref name=RB_Birth>Robert's [[absolution]] for Comyn\u2019s murder, in 1310, gives Robert as a layman of Carrick, indicating Carrick / Turnberry was either his primary residence, or place of birth. [[Lochmaben]] has a claim, as a possession of the Bruce family, but is not supported by a medieval source. The contemporary claims of Essex / the Bruce estate at [[Writtle]] Essex, during the coronation of Edward, have been discounted by [[G. W. S. Barrow]].</ref><ref name=birth2>[[Geoffrey the Baker|Geoffrey le Baker's]]: [https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft Chronicon Galfridi le Baker de Swynebroke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831232310/https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft |date=31 August 2016 }}, ed.

A recently restored monument to the dead is in the city cemetery in Writtle Road.\n\nOn 13 May 1943 Luftwaffe bombing raids hit Chelmsford leaving more than 50 people dead and making nearly 1,000 residents homeless. The bombs on this night were dropped mainly in the town centre, [[Springfield, Essex|Springfield]] and [[Moulsham]].\n\nThe [[GHQ Line]] part of the [[British hardened field defences of World War II]] runs directly through Chelmsford with many [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] still in existence to the north and south of the city.\n\n[[Hylands Park]], the site of the former annual [[V festival]], and its replacement the [[RiZe festival]], then hosted a prisoner of war camp, and from 1944 was the headquarters of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS).<ref>[http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands The History of Hylands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404214844/http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands |date=4 April 2016 }}, Chelmsford City Council, published 24 November 2004.

The site on West Hanningfield Road was sold to [[BAE Systems]]; the Waterhouse Lane site sold to E2V and the New Street site is undergoing major redevelopment for residential/mixed use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Marconi site, New Street|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/marconi}}</ref> However, the city's location close to London and at the centre of Essex has helped it grow in importance as an administrative and distribution centre. The one-time largest employer in Chelmsford, RHP, the former Hoffman ball bearing manufacturing company, closed its New Street/Rectory Lane site in 1989. Some of the factory remains and has been converted into luxury apartments and a health club although most of the site was demolished to make way for the Rivermead Campus of the [[Anglia Ruskin University]].\n\nBeaulieu Park, The Village and Chancellor Park are some of the most recent large-scale housing developments built in the city to complement earlier developments, such as [[Chelmer Village]] which was built in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Channel 4]] programme \"[[Location, Location, Location]]\" voted Chelmsford the 8th-best place to live in the UK.<ref>[http://www.buyabetterhome.co.uk/23.html The 20 Best Places in Britain to Buy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017005014/http://www.buyabetterhome.co.uk/23.html |date=17 October 2015 }}.

E. B. Crompton|Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton]]. Crompton as he was better known was a leading authority of electrical engineering and was a pioneer of electric street lighting and electric traction motors within the [[United Kingdom]]. Crompton installed electric street lights around the town centre to celebrate the incorporation of the Borough of Chelmsford in 1888. Although this made Chelmsford one of the earliest towns to receive electric street lighting, the Council later decided to have it removed because gas was cheaper and the Council owned the gasworks. Crompton supplied the traction motors for the first electric trains on [[Southend Pier]]. The company also manufactured electrical switchgear, alternators and generators for many [[power stations]] in the UK and worldwide.\n\nCrompton set up his original factory known as the 'Arc Works' in Queen Street in 1878.

The \u00a334.8m nine-mile (14&nbsp;km) bypass opened in November 1986. It is a very important route, linking London and the M25 motorway with the docks at Harwich and Felixstowe, and the East Coast. Despite being notorious for frequent congestion, poor road surfaces and potholes, as well as accidents, many people move to Chelmsford for it being so well connected by not only rail services, but roads. The A414 trunk road, running from Hemel Hempstead to nearby Maldon, is a main road into the city, just off the A12, and also links the city to the M11 motorway at J7 near Harlow.

Until 1986, when the Chelmsford bypass was opened, the roundabout was in an even worse state. Traffic lights were tried to improve matters in the early 2000s but that scheme was abandoned after a short while however some of the lights where recommissioned for early morning and evening part-time use in 2009. The recently built bus lane on the A1114 Great Baddow Bypass and priority to traffic using it has meant traffic queues approaching the roundabout can now be over {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} long during peak periods. The roundabout is still called \"The Army and Navy\" even though the public house from which the junction got its name has long been demolished.\n\nThe junction was until 2019 unusual for its flyover, in a similar manner to the [[Hogarth Roundabout]] in [[Chiswick]], London.

This was completed early in 2009. Recently, plans were revealed for 'Waterside', a large development of shops, bars and restaurants on the banks of the [[River Chelmer]] on derelict land near the [[Essex Records Office]] at the end of Wharf Road. If this development goes ahead, High Bridge Road connecting Parkway and Springfield Road would be demolished along with the adjacent [[gasometers]] and a new central link road would be built.\n\nThe former [[Anglia Ruskin University]] central campus off Park Road was demolished in January/February 2010 and has been redeveloped by social housing provider Genesis as a mixed use development of housing for social rent, alongside other new housing for private sale and several retail units, new squares, streets and plazas. The new development has been given the name ' City Park West'.\n\nHigh Chelmer Shopping Centre underwent a refit during 2008/2009 with new flooring, lighting with a new front entrance and logo re-brand. Further work is being carried out in the shopping centre; an old portion was demolished in Spring 2011.  The work was completed in early 2012.\n\nIn January 2011, John Lewis announced together with development partner Aquila House Holdings that it was to anchor a brand new {{convert|119,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} department store as part of a {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} retail development at Bond Street.

One of the oldest and most prominent buildings in Chelmsford, it was built as a courthouse and there has been a court on the site since at least 1199.

The 1979 film special of the TV series ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]'' was filmed largely on location at Chelmsford Prison (while it was closed for repairs after a fire).\n\n[[Hylands House]] and Park just to the west of the city is a country house and parkland, saved from dereliction and purchased by the local council in 1966 after the death of the last private owner. Much damaged by fire and vandalism by the time of the sale, the house has now been completely restored by Chelmsford City Council. The house dates from 1730, and the park, {{convert|574|acre|km2}}, was landscaped by [[Humphry Repton]]. It is open to the public and used for a wide range of community events, including the annual music festival [[V Festival]]. It is also available for weddings and other private hires including conferences etc. The 21st [[World Scout Jamboree 2007]] was held at Hylands Park from 27 July to 8 August 2007.  Within the grounds which comprise woodland, rolling grassland and lakes is a large children's play area with adjoining car parking.\n\n[[Chelmsford Museum]] in Oaklands Park, off Moulsham Street, is a local history and industrial heritage museum which also incorporates the [[Essex Regiment]] Museum. A major \u00a35&nbsp;million extension and redevelopment scheme opened in January 2010 and the museum now includes exhibits and interactive displays focusing on Crompton, Marconi, and Hoffmann, as well as illustrating the development of the town and city from prehistory up to modern times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=18250 |title=Chelmsford Borough Council \u2013 New Chelmsford Museum draws in the crowds |publisher=Chelmsford.gov.uk |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref> A second site at Sandford Mill \u2013 Chelmsford's former waterworks \u2013 displays further exhibits from Chelmsford's telecommunications, electrical engineering and rolling bearings industries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/sandfordmill |title=Chelmsford City Council \u2013 Sandford Mill |publisher=Chelmsford.gov.uk |accessdate=17 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\n===Geology===\nFrom over 600,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]], until the [[Anglian Stage]] around 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, the early [[River Thames]] flowed through the area where Chelmsford now stands, from [[Harlow]] to [[Colchester]], before crossing what is now the [[North Sea]] to become a tributary of the [[Rhine]]. Consequently, gravel deposits are frequently found in the area and current and former [[gravel pit]]s in the district are common.\n\nChelmsford has two rivers, the [[River Can]] and the [[River Chelmer]]. Although often confused to be the same river in the city centre, they are quite separate until they join together towards the east of the city to form the [[Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation]] which heads out towards [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] before flowing into [[tidal]] waters at the [[Blackwater Estuary]]. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near [[Thaxted]] while the Can comes from the West from [[Writtle]] where it separates from the River Wid.\n\nUp to the 1960s, these rivers were extremely prone to flooding the city centre area including two disastrous floods in August 1888 (known locally as 'The Great Flood') and in September 1958 (which also badly affected nearby [[Wickford]]) causing widespread damage. Flood prevention schemes in the 1960s on both rivers have largely prevented any further incidents here although the natural floodplains to the north and east such as The 'Baddow Meads' and The 'Chelmer Valley' continue to see flooding on a regular basis especially after prolonged heavy rainfall.\n\n===Climate===\nAs with the large majority of the UK, Chelmsford has a [[maritime climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). Being in the southeast of England, the city enjoys a warmer climate than most of the United Kingdom; it is also one of the drier areas in the country. The nearest met office weather station is Writtle, about {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} west of the city centre.\n\nTemperatures occasionally reach {{convert|30.0|C|F}} in the summer, this figure was last achieved on 25 July 2019 when {{convert|37.7|C|F}} was recorded and on an average of 19.2 days<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/calcdetail.php?seasonid=0&periodid=1981-2010&indexid=SU&stationid=1845\n|title=1981-10 Days >25c\n|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref> the temperature will achieve a value of {{convert|25.1|C|F}} or above.

A [[Neolithic]] and a late [[Bronze Age]] settlement have been found in the Springfield suburb, and the town was occupied by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. A Roman fort was built in AD 60, and a civilian town grew up around it. The town was given the name of ''Caesaromagus'' (the market place of Caesar), although the reason for it being given the great honour of bearing the Imperial prefix is now unclear \u2013 possibly as a failed 'planned town' provincial capital to replace [[Londinium]] or [[Camulodunum]]. The remains of a ''[[mansio]]'', a combination post office, civic centre and hotel, lie beneath the streets of modern [[Moulsham]], and the ruins of an octagonal temple are located beneath the Odeon roundabout. The town disappeared for a while after the Romans left Britain.\n\nIn 1199, following the commissioning of a bridge over the [[River Can]] by [[Maurice (Bishop of London)|Maurice, Bishop of London]], [[William of Sainte-M\u00e8re-Eglise]] was granted a Royal Charter for Chelmsford to hold a market, marking the origin of the modern town. An under-cover market, operating Tuesday to Saturday, is still an important part of the city centre over 800 years later. The city's name is derived from ''Ceolmaer's [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]'' which was close to the site of the present High Street stone bridge. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, the town was called ''Celmeresfort'' and by 1189 it had changed to ''Chelmsford''. Its position on the Londinium \u2013 Camulodonum Roman road (the modern [[A12 road (England)|A12]]) ensured the early prosperity of Chelmsford.\n\nThe town became the seat of the local assize during the early 13th century (though assizes were also held at [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]]) and by 1218 it was recognised as the county town of Essex, a position it has retained to the present day. Chelmsford was significantly involved in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] moved on to the town after quelling the rebellion in London. 'The Sleepers and The Shadows', written by Hilda Grieve in 1988 using original sources, states: \"For nearly a week, from Monday 1st July to Saturday 6th July [1381], Chelmsford became the seat of government ... The king probably lodged at his nearby manor house at Writtle. He was attended by his council, headed by the temporary Chancellor ... the new chief justice ... the royal chancery ... Their formidable task in Chelmsford was to draft, engross, date, seal and despatch by messengers riding to the farthest corners of the realm, the daily batches of commissions, mandates, letters, orders and proclamations issued by the government not only to speed the process of pacification of the kingdom, but to conduct much ordinary day-to-day business of the Crown and Government.\" Richard II famously revoked the charters which he had made in concession to the peasants on 2 July 1381, while in Chelmsford. It could be said that given this movement of government power, Chelmsford for a few days at least became the capital of England. Many of the ringleaders of the revolt were executed on the gallows at what is now Primrose Hill.\n\nAn Anglo-Saxon burial was discovered at [[Broomfield, Essex|Broomfield]] to the north of Chelmsford in the late 19th century and the finds are now in the [[British Museum]]. The road 'Saxon Way' now marks the site. In the 17th century many of the victims of [[Matthew Hopkins]] (the self-styled \"Witchfinder General\") spent their last days imprisoned in Chelmsford, before being tried at the Assizes and hanged for [[witchcraft]].\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] purchased the Boleyn estate in 1516, and built [[Palace of Beaulieu|Beaulieu Palace]] on the current site of [[New Hall School]]. This later became the residence of his then mistress, and later wife Anne. Soon after it became the residence of Henry's daughter, by his first marriage, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].\n\nKing [[Robert I of Scotland]], better known as [[Robert the Bruce]], had close ties with the nearby village of [[Writtle]] and there is some evidence to suggest he was born at Montpeliers Farm in the village,<ref name=RB_Birth>Robert's [[absolution]] for Comyn\u2019s murder, in 1310, gives Robert as a layman of Carrick, indicating Carrick / Turnberry was either his primary residence, or place of birth. [[Lochmaben]] has a claim, as a possession of the Bruce family, but is not supported by a medieval source. The contemporary claims of Essex / the Bruce estate at [[Writtle]] Essex, during the coronation of Edward, have been discounted by [[G. W. S. Barrow]].</ref><ref name=birth2>[[Geoffrey the Baker|Geoffrey le Baker's]]: [https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft Chronicon Galfridi le Baker de Swynebroke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831232310/https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft |date=31 August 2016 }}, ed.

The worst ''single'' loss of life took place on Tuesday 19 December 1944, when the 367th [[Vergeltungswaffe]] 2 or [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rocket to hit England fell on a residential street (Henry Road) near the Hoffmans ball bearing factory and not far from the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]] factory in New Street, which may also have been the target (Hoffmans factory was key to the war effort, supplying bearings for countless applications, making it a key target).

A recently restored monument to the dead is in the city cemetery in Writtle Road.\n\nOn 13 May 1943 Luftwaffe bombing raids hit Chelmsford leaving more than 50 people dead and making nearly 1,000 residents homeless. The bombs on this night were dropped mainly in the town centre, [[Springfield, Essex|Springfield]] and [[Moulsham]].\n\nThe [[GHQ Line]] part of the [[British hardened field defences of World War II]] runs directly through Chelmsford with many [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] still in existence to the north and south of the city.\n\n[[Hylands Park]], the site of the former annual [[V festival]], and its replacement the [[RiZe festival]], then hosted a prisoner of war camp, and from 1944 was the headquarters of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS).<ref>[http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands The History of Hylands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404214844/http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands |date=4 April 2016 }}, Chelmsford City Council, published 24 November 2004.

The site on West Hanningfield Road was sold to [[BAE Systems]]; the Waterhouse Lane site sold to E2V and the New Street site is undergoing major redevelopment for residential/mixed use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Marconi site, New Street|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/marconi}}</ref> However, the city's location close to London and at the centre of Essex has helped it grow in importance as an administrative and distribution centre. The one-time largest employer in Chelmsford, RHP, the former Hoffman ball bearing manufacturing company, closed its New Street/Rectory Lane site in 1989. Some of the factory remains and has been converted into luxury apartments and a health club although most of the site was demolished to make way for the Rivermead Campus of the [[Anglia Ruskin University]].\n\nBeaulieu Park, The Village and Chancellor Park are some of the most recent large-scale housing developments built in the city to complement earlier developments, such as [[Chelmer Village]] which was built in the 1980s.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Channel 4]] programme \"[[Location, Location, Location]]\" voted Chelmsford the 8th-best place to live in the UK.<ref>[http://www.buyabetterhome.co.uk/23.html The 20 Best Places in Britain to Buy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017005014/http://www.buyabetterhome.co.uk/23.html |date=17 October 2015 }}.

The Company Christy Norris still survives, trading as Christy Turner Ltd based in [[Ipswich]]. A residential street close to the old Factory was named \"Fell Christy\" in his honour.\n\nAs well as the headquarters of Essex Police, Essex County and Chelmsford City Councils, the modern city is home to a range of national and international companies including [[M&G]] Group, [[Teledyne e2v]] and [[ebm-papst]]. The continuing importance of Chelmsford as an employment centre is demonstrated by the fact that the number of \"in\" commuters (mostly from other parts of Essex) almost exactly balances the number of workers commuting into London.\n\nChelmsford is largely a commercial city which employs around 80,000 people. There are three medium-sized shopping centres, Bond Street, High Chelmer and The Meadows. Chelmsford has six retail parks, Riverside, [[Chelmer Village]], Clocktower Retail Park, The Army & Navy, Moulsham Lodge Retail Park and the smaller Homelands Retail Park housing a Flagship [[B&Q]] Store, Wyvale Garden Centre (part of the Garden centre Group) and Pets Corner. The High Street is full of independent and chain stores. As well as the leading High Street names, there is also a wide variety of specialist retailers, especially in Baddow Road and Moulsham Street which are located at the end of the pedestrianised High Street. On 29 September 2016 a new retail development opened anchored by [[John Lewis & Partners|John Lewis]].

E. B. Crompton|Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton]]. Crompton as he was better known was a leading authority of electrical engineering and was a pioneer of electric street lighting and electric traction motors within the [[United Kingdom]]. Crompton installed electric street lights around the town centre to celebrate the incorporation of the Borough of Chelmsford in 1888. Although this made Chelmsford one of the earliest towns to receive electric street lighting, the Council later decided to have it removed because gas was cheaper and the Council owned the gasworks. Crompton supplied the traction motors for the first electric trains on [[Southend Pier]]. The company also manufactured electrical switchgear, alternators and generators for many [[power stations]] in the UK and worldwide.\n\nCrompton set up his original factory known as the 'Arc Works' in Queen Street in 1878.

The \u00a334.8m nine-mile (14&nbsp;km) bypass opened in November 1986. It is a very important route, linking London and the M25 motorway with the docks at Harwich and Felixstowe, and the East Coast. Despite being notorious for frequent congestion, poor road surfaces and potholes, as well as accidents, many people move to Chelmsford for it being so well connected by not only rail services, but roads. The A414 trunk road, running from Hemel Hempstead to nearby Maldon, is a main road into the city, just off the A12, and also links the city to the M11 motorway at J7 near Harlow. The A130 provides an important link down to the A127 and A13, while the A131 passes through smaller towns and villages. The nearest motorway is the M25 London Orbital at J11 on the A12, 14 miles away.\n\nChelmsford is around 25 to 30 minutes' drive from [[Stansted Airport]] (via A130/A120), and [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]], [[London City Airport|London City]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[Southend Airport|Southend]] airports are all within reach.\n\nIn the southwest of the city centre, the A138 meets the A414 at The Army and Navy roundabout which is notorious for its traffic congestion, even though the north\u2013south road at this point is no longer part of the [[A12 road (Great Britain)|A12]]. Until 1986, when the Chelmsford bypass was opened, the roundabout was in an even worse state. Traffic lights were tried to improve matters in the early 2000s but that scheme was abandoned after a short while however some of the lights where recommissioned for early morning and evening part-time use in 2009. The recently built bus lane on the A1114 Great Baddow Bypass and priority to traffic using it has meant traffic queues approaching the roundabout can now be over {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} long during peak periods. The roundabout is still called \"The Army and Navy\" even though the public house from which the junction got its name has long been demolished.\n\nThe junction was until 2019 unusual for its flyover, in a similar manner to the [[Hogarth Roundabout]] in [[Chiswick]], London. The flyover was bi-directional, being open where traffic goes one way into city (westerly) until 2.30&nbsp;pm each day and one way (easterly) out of the city after 2.30&nbsp;pm.\n\nThe Army and Navy roundabout flyover was condemned as unsafe and permanently closed in September 2019 by [[Essex County Council]] with demolition works taking place in February/March 2020.<ref>https://www.essexhighways.org/highway-schemes/a1060-a1114-army-and-navy-flyover-chelmsford.aspx</ref>\n\nConstruction of the \u00a332 million replacement A138 'Chelmer Viaduct' road which connects Chelmer Village Way roundabout to the Army and Navy roundabout began in February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/a138-chelmsford-replacement-of-chelmer-viaduct/|title=A138 Chelmsford - Replacement of Chelmer Viaduct|work=highways.gov.uk|access-date=19 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004201001/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/road-projects/a138-chelmsford-replacement-of-chelmer-viaduct|archive-date=4 October 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The new bridge replaced the previous 1932 built structure which was demolished in 2016.\n\nSince 2 September 2013 in order to save money and reduce carbon emissions, many streets lights in the Chelmsford district switched over to Essex County Council's part-night street lighting scheme.

This was completed early in 2009. Recently, plans were revealed for 'Waterside', a large development of shops, bars and restaurants on the banks of the [[River Chelmer]] on derelict land near the [[Essex Records Office]] at the end of Wharf Road. If this development goes ahead, High Bridge Road connecting Parkway and Springfield Road would be demolished along with the adjacent [[gasometers]] and a new central link road would be built.\n\nThe former [[Anglia Ruskin University]] central campus off Park Road was demolished in January/February 2010 and has been redeveloped by social housing provider Genesis as a mixed use development of housing for social rent, alongside other new housing for private sale and several retail units, new squares, streets and plazas. The new development has been given the name ' City Park West'.\n\nHigh Chelmer Shopping Centre underwent a refit during 2008/2009 with new flooring, lighting with a new front entrance and logo re-brand. Further work is being carried out in the shopping centre; an old portion was demolished in Spring 2011.  The work was completed in early 2012.\n\nIn January 2011, John Lewis announced together with development partner Aquila House Holdings that it was to anchor a brand new {{convert|119,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} department store as part of a {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} retail development at Bond Street. There will also be 2 other large-format shops included in the development. The main anchor store will be complemented by a further 33 shops and 7 restaurants.

Much damaged by fire and vandalism by the time of the sale, the house has now been completely restored by Chelmsford City Council. The house dates from 1730, and the park, {{convert|574|acre|km2}}, was landscaped by [[Humphry Repton]]. It is open to the public and used for a wide range of community events, including the annual music festival [[V Festival]]. It is also available for weddings and other private hires including conferences etc. The 21st [[World Scout Jamboree 2007]] was held at Hylands Park from 27 July to 8 August 2007.

Consequently, gravel deposits are frequently found in the area and current and former [[gravel pit]]s in the district are common.\n\nChelmsford has two rivers, the [[River Can]] and the [[River Chelmer]]. Although often confused to be the same river in the city centre, they are quite separate until they join together towards the east of the city to form the [[Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation]] which heads out towards [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] before flowing into [[tidal]] waters at the [[Blackwater Estuary]]. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near [[Thaxted]] while the Can comes from the West from [[Writtle]] where it separates from the River Wid.\n\nUp to the 1960s, these rivers were extremely prone to flooding the city centre area including two disastrous floods in August 1888 (known locally as 'The Great Flood') and in September 1958 (which also badly affected nearby [[Wickford]]) causing widespread damage. Flood prevention schemes in the 1960s on both rivers have largely prevented any further incidents here although the natural floodplains to the north and east such as The 'Baddow Meads' and The 'Chelmer Valley' continue to see flooding on a regular basis especially after prolonged heavy rainfall.\n\n===Climate===\nAs with the large majority of the UK, Chelmsford has a [[maritime climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]). Being in the southeast of England, the city enjoys a warmer climate than most of the United Kingdom; it is also one of the drier areas in the country.
