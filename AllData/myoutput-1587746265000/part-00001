Peralta shows \"class clown\" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although \"the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.\" As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.<ref name=\"Unsolvable\">{{Cite episode|title=Unsolvable|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 18, 2014|season=1|number=21}}</ref>\n\nHis father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie trilogy, ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]''. In \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\" it is revealed that Jake is Jewish, having lost his childhood sweetheart Jenny Gildenhorn to Eddie Fung at his [[Bar Mitzvah]].\n\nPeralta's best friend is Charles Boyle, who works along with him at the precinct and admires Peralta and encourages his eventual romance with Santiago. Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood friends, which resulted in him helping Gina get a job at the precinct. Diaz and Peralta were classmates at the police academy.\n\nJake began his career as a patrol officer with the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Stevie Schillens and the two nicknamed themselves the \"Beatsie Boys\"; in 2016, Jake was forced to arrest Stevie, now a detective with the neighboring 98th Precinct for planting evidence.<ref name=\"The 9-8\">{{Cite episode|title=The 9-8|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 9, 2016|season=3|number=15}}</ref> \n\nWhile Jake doesn't initially approve of Captain Holt's strict management, he eventually matures under Holt's supervision and comes to see Holt as a father-figure; even calling him \"Dad\" on many occasions. In \"The Oolong Slayer\", Jake achieves his lifelong dream to catch a serial killer, the Oolong Slayer, but gives up the credit for the arrest to the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives in exchange for effecting Holt's transfer back to the 99th Precinct.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\">{{Cite episode|title=The Oolong Slayer|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 18, 2015|season=3|number=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of season four, Jake and Rosa Diaz are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Although he is eager to return to work, his time in prison left him with post-traumatic stress and newfound empathy that affects his job performance.\n\nPeralta continuously pranks and teases his partner Amy Santiago, masking his secret romantic feelings for her. Peralta confesses his feelings to her in \"[[Charges and Specs]]\" before going undercover for a mafia operation. His romantic feelings for her develop further throughout season two and they share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]].<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\">{{Cite episode|title=Johnny and Dora|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=May 17, 2015|season=2|number=23}}</ref> Jake and Amy start dating in \"[[New Captain]]\" and decide to move in together in the \"[[Greg and Larry]]\", but don't make it official until season four's \"[[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]\".

She attended [[parochial school]], later studied [[ballet]], and was a classmate of Jake's in the police academy.<ref name=\"castlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/brooklyn-nine-nine/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine (FOX)|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> When she was younger, the pressure for her to succeed at ballet school eventually led her to commit several crimes before landing in juvenile detention. Her parents provided little support, leaving Rosa to turn her life around by herself. \n\nThough Diaz is a loyal and effective member of the squad, her anger management issues and lack of empathy terrify most of her coworkers. She is highly secretive about her personal life \u2013 should anyone discover a secret of hers, she normally threatens them with death should they disclose it. It is also made clear that she does not stay in her apartments for long periods of time, and her neighbors know her by both a different name and a completely different personality. As revealed in \"Cop-Con\", she and Amy are younger than most of the other precinct members as they are hurt by a device that emits a loud noise to those under 35, whereas Jake and Boyle only pretend to be affected by it. In \"White Whale\", she reveals to Amy that she's attended medical school, business school, and has a pilot's license. Rosa also briefly mentions in \"Greg and Larry\" that her name \"Rosa Diaz\" may be an alias to cover up her real name from the rest of the 9-9.\n\nIn season two, Rosa dates Captain Holt's nephew, Marcus, but breaks up with him in season three. Later in the season, she finds love with former undercover detective Adrian Pimento; the two get engaged in \"Paranoia\" while chasing a drug dealer through an alley, but their wedding is delayed when Pimento is targeted by Figgis and forced to leave the state. Once he returns, they try to have their wedding the next day but decide to go steady after realizing they were rushing their relationship.\n\nAt the end of season four, Rosa and Jake are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Following her months of isolation, she starts spending more time with her family and ends her relationship with Pimento. Later in the season, she comes out as bisexual to the precinct and her family, and has a brief relationship with an unseen woman that the squad never meet or learn the name of, nicknamed \"Becky\". She has a brief flirtation with one of Gina's friends, but this does not lead anywhere. On the day of Jake and Amy's wedding, she and Terry meet a cab driver named Alicia that she becomes interested in. The two begin a relationship off-screen. However, it's short-lived, as Rosa mentions in \"The Tattler\" that they broke up because Alicia was moving to London. \n\nIn season six, Rosa begins dating a cosmetologist named Jocelyn and begins to patch up her relationship with her mother, who was initially disapproving of her bisexuality. In season seven, Rosa and Jocelyn broke up prior to the season's Jimmy Jab Games. In the episode \"Valloweaster,\" she becomes the first three-time Halloween Heist Champion.\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Diaz.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", she received a commendation for her work as the leader of a drug task force.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Terry Jeffords ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Terry Jeffords\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Sergeant {{small|(seasons 1\u20136)}}|[[Lieutenant]] {{small|(season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Terry Crews]]|Theodore Barnes (child)}}\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Terrence Vincent Jeffords\n| family      = \n| spouse      = [[#Sharon Jeffords|Sharon Jeffords]] (wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Chiaki|Chiaki]] (ex-girlfriend)|[[#Veronica Hopkins|Veronica Hopkins]] (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = {{ubl|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Cagney Jeffords]] (daughter)|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Lacey Jeffords]] (daughter)|Ava Jeffords (daughter)}}\n| relatives   = {{ubl|Lawrence Jeffords (brother)|[[#Zeke|Zeke]] (brother-in-law)|Unnamed father (deceased)|Unnamed grandmother (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Terry Crews by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Terry Crews]]]]\n[[Terry Crews]] portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) '''Terrence \"Terry\" Vincent Jeffords''', the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid [[bodybuilder]] who stands at more than six feet tall, with a [[linebacker]]'s build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his caring, protective nature and paternal instincts. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the [[Cagney & Lacey|1980s TV series]]), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.\n\nA running gag throughout the series is for Terry to break things (examples include a Magic 8 Ball, a phone and Captain Holt's office) because of his incredible strength. He has been a detective since 1995 and used to be assigned to the 65th Precinct (as seen in \"Terry Kitties\"), where he was constantly mocked for a botched case which he and Jake later proved he was correct in. In S1.Ep.1. Holt mentions that he and Terry have worked together in the 18th Precinct years prior. In 2005, he was the senior detective at the 9-9 (the position Jake now holds since Terry's promotion). He was a linebacker at [[Syracuse University]], where he graduated ''magna cum laude'', as revealed in \"The Swedes\". He also studied abroad in Japan while in college and dated a Japanese student named Chiaki who broke his heart. He speaks Japanese infrequently throughout the show.\n\nIn season two, Terry nearly gets a [[vasectomy]] at his wife's request, but Jake convinces him not to when he finds out Terry secretly wants to have more kids. His wife becomes pregnant later in the season and gives birth to their third daughter, Ava, in season three. He entrusts Jake to be Ava's godfather.\n\nWhile Terry was satisfied with his role as Sergeant, he aimed to become a Lieutenant during the first six seasons. As revealed in \"The Honeypot\", he brought a new pair of suspenders that he planned to put on after he passed the Lieutenant's Exam but kept them in the box when he ended up failing and held onto them as a reminder of his higher goals. In \"Moo Moo\", he attempted to apply to be a city council liaison to take on more responsibilities but was rejected after reporting that another cop racially profiled him. In season six, Terry revealed to the group that he passed the Lieutenant's Exam weeks before the annual Halloween Heist (which they hosted on Cinco de Mayo).\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Jeffords.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd bronze.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Commendation or Commendation\u2014Integrity\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD Unit Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD Unit Citation\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Amy Santiago===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Amy Santiago\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Detective {{small|(seasons 1\u20135)}} \n* Sergeant {{small|(season 5\u2013present)}}\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Melissa Fumero]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| alias              = Isabel Cortez (undercover alias)\n| family             = \n| spouse             = [[#Jake Peralta|Jake Peralta]]\n| significant_other  = {{ubl|[[#Teddy Wells|Teddy Wells]] (ex-boyfriend)|[[#Constantine Kane|Constantine Kane]] (ex-boyfriend)|Luke Mueller (ex-boyfriend)}}\n| children           = Mac Peralta (son)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Victor Santiago|Victor Santiago]] (father)|[[#Camila Santiago|Camila Santiago]] (mother)|Tony Santiago (brother)|[[#David Santiago|David Santiago]] (brother)|Mason Santiago (nephew)|[[#Roger Peralta|Roger Peralta]] (father-in-law)|[[#Karen Peralta|Karen Peralta]] (mother-in-law)|[[#Kate Peralta|Kate Peralta]] (half sister-in-law)|Five unnamed brothers|Two unnamed half sisters-in-law|An unknown number of half brothers-in-law|Unnamed niece}}\n| religion           = \n| nationality        = Cuban-American\n}}\n[[File:Melissa Fumero May 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Melissa Fumero]]]]\n[[Melissa Fumero]] portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) '''Amy Santiago''', Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following [[Cuban-American]] partner, and later wife.<ref name=castlist/> A self-acknowledged [[Type A and Type B personality theory|type A personality]] and neurotic overachiever, she continually tried to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry cites Amy's competitiveness to Holt as a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command respect from others. \n\nAmy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in \"He Said, She Said\". \n\nIn [[Charges and Specs]], the season one finale, Jake confessed that he wishes something romantic could happen between them. She confessed to having feelings for Jake in \"[[The Road Trip (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Road Trip]]\", which instigated issues in Amy and Teddy Wells' relationship and was shown to still have feelings for Jake in \"[[Det. Dave Majors]]\". The two shared their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]]<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> and began dating in [[New Captain]], although their working relationship did not change at all. They decided to move in together in the season three finale [[Greg and Larry]], but don't make it official until season four's [[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]. Jake proposed to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in [[HalloVeen]] and the two eventually marry in [[Jake & Amy]]. In season 7, Amy became pregnant with Jake's child and gave birth to their son, McClane \"Mac\" Peralta in the season finale.\n\nNear the end of season three, Amy went undercover as a pregnant inmate in a women's prison in Texas to obtain information from Maura Figgis. This was done to cover Melissa Fumero's actual pregnancy at the time without making her character pregnant. Amy's actual pregnancy in season seven occurred when Fumero was pregnant with her second child.\n\nAfter some uncertainty in taking the Sergeant's Exam as depicted in \"[[Chasing Amy (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Chasing Amy]]\", she passed the exam and began wearing her Sergeant's uniform as well as commanding her own uniformed officers in \"[[NutriBoom]]\".\n\nIn season six's \"Casecation\", she was revealed to be 36 years old. In \"The Golden Child\", it is revealed that Amy had a relatively strained relationship with her brother and fellow NYPD Lieutenant David Santiago, chiding her mother for glorifying David's accomplishments over Amy's. Amy enjoys solving crosswords and attending trivia sessions, to the expense of Jake, who often embarrasses himself when attempting to participate or becomes awkwardly excluded in conversation. \n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Sergeant Santiago.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|-this is wrong.

He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic [[foodie]], maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. \n\nFor saving Detective Diaz's life during \"Christmas\" (during which he was shot in the buttocks), he was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]] in \"The Bet\", though he was overshadowed by a revered and heroic NYPD horse named Sergeant Peanut Butter. He continued to have a one-sided rivalry with Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Peanut Butter until he seeks his help in getting Jake to the precinct in the season 7 finale. In \"The Swedes\", it is revealed that Boyle is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Charles had a crush on Rosa, but he eventually got over her when he started dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refused to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start to see each other in season two, and their brief relationship resulted in his father and Gina's mother's marriage. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief. They eventually move in together and adopt a son from Latvia named Nikolaj. \n\nIn season five, Charles started his own food truck business called \"The One Thing\", which specialized in meatball subs. The truck was burned down by one of Charles' ex-employees, but he's thankful it happened as running the food truck made him spend less time with his family and built up a large debt.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Boyle.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation 1.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:Fictional Police Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar\n|}\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Gina Linetti ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gina Linetti\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| last               = \"Return of the King\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{ubl|[[Administrator (business)|Administrator]] {{small|(Seasons 1\u20136)}}|Internet personality {{small|(Season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer          = [[Chelsea Peretti]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name          = Regina Linetti\n| significant_other   = {{ubl|[[#Charles Boyle|Charles Boyle]] (ex-lover)|[[#Milton Boyle|Milton Boyle]] (lover, father of her child)|Eight unnamed ex-fianc\u00e9s}}\n| children           = The Enigma \"Iggy\" Boyle (daughter)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Darlene Linetti|Darlene Linetti]] (mother)|[[#Lynn Boyle|Lynn Boyle]] (stepfather)|Charles Boyle (stepbrother)|Susan Grapecoat (great-aunt)|Anthony (nephew)|Unnamed sibling|Unnamed father}}\n| nationality        = American\n}}\n[[File:Chelsea Peretti at Meltdown (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chelsea Peretti]]]]\n[[Chelsea Peretti]] portrays '''Regina \"Gina\" Linetti''', the 99th Precinct's sardonic and egomaniacal civilian administrator and Captain Holt's assistant.<ref name=castlist/> Despite maintaining a clueless and dimwitted disposition most of the time, she can be surprisingly observant and has demonstrated traits of being more intelligent than she likes to show. Gina is obsessed with social media and is constantly on her phone. It is a running gag to try to pry her from her phone, to the point where Captain Holt becomes involved. She is extremely narcissistic and constantly praises and exalts herself, such as claiming to be a better dancer than [[Britney Spears]] in the episode \"Karen Peralta\". As the only civilian in the precinct, Gina often uses her outsider's perspective to assist the other detectives. In the episode \"The Party\", to prevent the mostly [[working class]] detectives from embarrassing themselves in front of a crowd of [[academia|academics]], Rosa tricks Gina into talking to a group of psychology professors at Holt's birthday party, who then take copious notes about her narcissistic personality. They conclude that she has a complete overlap of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], a condition previously thought to be purely theoretical.\n\nShe casually admits on myriad occasions that she doesn't value her colleagues \u2013 except for Jake \u2013 as people. She was also childhood friends with Jake, who got her the job at the precinct. Gina also ruined Jake's senior year of high school by framing him as \"The Tattler\", though she did it to avoid Jake getting involved with the wrong crowd. She transferred to the Public relations Division with Captain Holt in \"Johnny and Dora\", and returns to the 9-9 with him in \"The Oolong Slayer\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/><ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> In the episode \"The Apartment\", it is revealed that she has been engaged eight times, but never married. At the end of \"The Fugitive Pt. 2\", she gets hit by a bus after receiving a text from Charles. The penultimate episode of season four reveals she has become pregnant following a relationship with Charles' cousin, Milton (which coincided with Chelsea Peretti's actual pregnancy). She is absent for the first half of season five on maternity leave after giving birth to a girl she nicknames \"Iggy\" (short for Enigma). \n\nIn the episode \"Halloween IV\", Gina reveals that in the fourth grade at a classmate's birthday party, a bowling ball fell onto her face. This incident knocked out her two front teeth; she's been wearing false teeth since.\n\nIn season six, Jake helps Gina realize that her talents would be better spent elsewhere and she quits her job. She becomes an internet celebrity and hosts a web show called \"The G-Hive,\" in which she gives her viewers life advice. Her work has made it too busy to spend time with her former coworkers, but she is aiming to improve after Jake confronts her for not talking to them for months. \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Raymond Holt ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Raymond Holt\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Commanding Officer, NYPD 99th Precinct {{small|(seasons 1\u20136; season 7-present)}} \n<br>Head of NYPD public relations {{small| (season 3)}}|Patrol officer {{small|(season 6\u20137)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Andre Braugher]]|Seth Carr (child)}}\n| alias       = Greg Stickney ([[WITSEC]] alias)\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Raymond Jacob Holt\n| spouse      = [[#Kevin Cozner|Kevin Cozner]]\n| significant_other = [[#Frederick|Frederick]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives   = {{ubl|[[#Laverne Holt|Laverne Holt]] (mother)|Unnamed father (deceased)|[[#Debbie|Debbie]] (sister)| [[#Marcus|Marcus]] (nephew)<br>Geoffrey Holt (uncle)<br>Martin Cozner (brother-in-law)<br>Carol Wilg (goddaughter)<br>Gary (ex-brother-in-law)<br>Unnamed uncle (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Andre Braugher 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andre Braugher]]]]\n[[Andre Braugher]] portrays Captain '''Raymond Jacob Holt''', the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer. Holt is known for his cold, calm and robotic manner of speaking, overly formal demeanor and lack of outwardly visible emotion, although his non-work friends frequently refer to him having a much more fun persona that is very rarely seen by either the Nine-Nine members or the viewer. He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[homosexuality]]. He came out in 1987 and until recently led a group that supported LGBT African-American NYPD members, which he himself created.<ref name=castlist/> He was a homicide detective in the 1980s, and spent twelve years in the Community Affairs Bureau immediately prior to commanding the Nine-Nine. \n\nHolt is married to Kevin Cozner, the Chair of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Classics]] Department,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Party|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 4, 2014|season=1|number=16}}</ref> and has a longstanding professional rivalry with Madeline Wuntch, with whom he came up through the ranks; while his career stalled, she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior. After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in \"The Chopper\", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City.<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> He owned a burgundy [[Chevrolet Corvair]] named Gertie which was his prized possession until it was stolen in \"The Fugitive\". Doug Judy purchased him a new identical one and named it Sexarella.\n\nAt the end of season three, Holt is forced to go into witness protection in Florida with Jake when they are threatened by crime boss Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He worked at a family entertainment center called the Fun Zone under the alias of Greg until he and Jake baited Figgis into coming to Florida and took the criminal down with the Nine-Nine. In season five, his life and career are put at risk when he makes a deal with mobster Seamus Murphy in exchange for information to clear Jake and Rosa's names from Lt. Hawkins.\n\nDuring season five, Holt learns that the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] is retiring at the end of the year and that he is on the shortlist of candidates to replace him. He spends the rest of the season campaigning to win the Commissioner title but ends up losing to John Kelly.\n\nIn season six, Holt is encouraged by Jake and Amy to stand up to Kelly's regressive policies, leading the Commissioner to retaliate against the Nine-Nine. However, Peralta and Wuntch team up, without Holt's knowledge, to take Kelly down, resulting in Wuntch being named interim Commissioner. This detente becomes short-lived as Holt is demoted to a uniformed officer by Commissioner Wuntch after she realized he was promoted to detective too soon earlier in his career. Shortly after Wuntch's death, however, he is quickly promoted back to captain in the middle of the seventh season.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Captain Holt.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Meritorious Police Duty (with numeral \"10\")\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", he received a commendation for his supervision of Det.

Despite their inept nature, Hitchcock and Scully have both shown on occasion to be competent and even good detectives, though their laziness tends to keep them from demonstrating this most of the time. As revealed in \"Hitchcock and Scully\", the two were excellent detectives in their youths and had well-built bodies, but their careers and their physiques went downhill after they tried the wings at their eventual favorite restaurant, Wing Slutz.\n\nThe majority of the precinct tends to be disgusted by Hitchcock's more perverted nature and attitude towards women. It's revealed in \"The Last Ride\" (Season 4) that Hitchcock held the all-time record for closed cases at the 99th Precinct, one more than Sgt. Jeffords as of that episode. This is mainly due to Hitchcock being at the 99th twenty years longer than Terry.

He also displayed an uncanny ability to reassemble shredded documents in one episode. Scully routinely discloses disgusting medical issues like the entire bottom of his foot being a wart or having various strains of [[fungi]]. He claims to constantly have medical emergencies, and despite having a [[pacemaker]] fitted, he frequently suffers from [[heart attack]]s. He often embarrasses himself either unintentionally or willingly and admits to being indifferent to the judgment of others (most frequently, the fellow members of his squad.) In the early seasons, Scully is married and has a dog. The team are unsure which one of them is called Kelly, though it is later revealed in season 7 that both of them were named Kelly.

Wuntch constantly went out of her way to undermine the 99th Precinct, and appeared to take great pleasure in its and Holt's failures; Holt, in turn, gleefully insulted and belittled Wuntch every time their paths cross.  In \"The Chopper\" and \"Johnny and Dora\", she culminated her victory over Holt when she makes him head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, where she humiliated him by making him do menial jobs, although he is eventually transferred back to the 99 thanks to Jake.

Peralta shows \"class clown\" traits, constantly pulling pranks and making immature jokes at the expense of his colleagues, particularly his partner, Amy Santiago. He is fun-loving and sarcastic but is often motivated by his emotions more than his colleagues. Despite his goofy traits, Peralta is extremely smart, perceptive and quick thinking, and as such has the best arrest rate in the precinct. In the pilot, Terry Jeffords explains to Captain Holt that Peralta is his best detective, that he likes putting away bad guys, and that he loves puzzles, although \"the only puzzle he hasn't solved is how to grow up.\" As of season seven, he is 38 years old and has been a detective with the 9-9 since 2005.<ref name=\"Unsolvable\">{{Cite episode|title=Unsolvable|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=March 18, 2014|season=1|number=21}}</ref>\n\nHis father left his family during his childhood and, as a result, he feels a strong tie to memories involving his father, such as his favorite Brooklyn pizza joint. He also initially refuses to celebrate Thanksgiving, since he associates the holiday with his father's absenteeism. He has a strong emotional tie to his muscle car, a 1967 Ford Mustang, which he bought outright on his first day as a cop and always carries a positive association for him (until he sold it to help pay for Terry's new child). He often quotes and makes references to his favorite movie trilogy, ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]''. In \"Boyle-Linetti Wedding\" it is revealed that Jake is Jewish, having lost his childhood sweetheart Jenny Gildenhorn to Eddie Fung at his [[Bar Mitzvah]].\n\nPeralta's best friend is Charles Boyle, who works along with him at the precinct and admires Peralta and encourages his eventual romance with Santiago. Peralta and Gina Linetti are childhood friends, which resulted in him helping Gina get a job at the precinct. Diaz and Peralta were classmates at the police academy.\n\nJake began his career as a patrol officer with the 74th Precinct and was partnered with Stevie Schillens and the two nicknamed themselves the \"Beatsie Boys\"; in 2016, Jake was forced to arrest Stevie, now a detective with the neighboring 98th Precinct for planting evidence.<ref name=\"The 9-8\">{{Cite episode|title=The 9-8|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 9, 2016|season=3|number=15}}</ref> \n\nWhile Jake doesn't initially approve of Captain Holt's strict management, he eventually matures under Holt's supervision and comes to see Holt as a father-figure; even calling him \"Dad\" on many occasions. In \"The Oolong Slayer\", Jake achieves his lifelong dream to catch a serial killer, the Oolong Slayer, but gives up the credit for the arrest to the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives in exchange for effecting Holt's transfer back to the 99th Precinct.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\">{{Cite episode|title=The Oolong Slayer|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=October 18, 2015|season=3|number=4}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of season four, Jake and Rosa Diaz are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Although he is eager to return to work, his time in prison left him with post-traumatic stress and newfound empathy that affects his job performance.\n\nPeralta continuously pranks and teases his partner Amy Santiago, masking his secret romantic feelings for her. Peralta confesses his feelings to her in \"[[Charges and Specs]]\" before going undercover for a mafia operation. His romantic feelings for her develop further throughout season two and they share their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]].<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\">{{Cite episode|title=Johnny and Dora|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=May 17, 2015|season=2|number=23}}</ref> Jake and Amy start dating in \"[[New Captain]]\" and decide to move in together in the \"[[Greg and Larry]]\", but don't make it official until season four's \"[[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]\".

She attended [[parochial school]], later studied [[ballet]], and was a classmate of Jake's in the police academy.<ref name=\"castlist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/devwatch/brooklyn-nine-nine/|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine (FOX)|work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}</ref> When she was younger, the pressure for her to succeed at ballet school eventually led her to commit several crimes before landing in juvenile detention. Her parents provided little support, leaving Rosa to turn her life around by herself. \n\nThough Diaz is a loyal and effective member of the squad, her anger management issues and lack of empathy terrify most of her coworkers. She is highly secretive about her personal life \u2013 should anyone discover a secret of hers, she normally threatens them with death should they disclose it. It is also made clear that she does not stay in her apartments for long periods of time, and her neighbors know her by both a different name and a completely different personality. As revealed in \"Cop-Con\", she and Amy are younger than most of the other precinct members as they are hurt by a device that emits a loud noise to those under 35, whereas Jake and Boyle only pretend to be affected by it. In \"White Whale\", she reveals to Amy that she's attended medical school, business school, and has a pilot's license. Rosa also briefly mentions in \"Greg and Larry\" that her name \"Rosa Diaz\" may be an alias to cover up her real name from the rest of the 9-9.\n\nIn season two, Rosa dates Captain Holt's nephew, Marcus, but breaks up with him in season three. Later in the season, she finds love with former undercover detective Adrian Pimento; the two get engaged in \"Paranoia\" while chasing a drug dealer through an alley, but their wedding is delayed when Pimento is targeted by Figgis and forced to leave the state. Once he returns, they try to have their wedding the next day but decide to go steady after realizing they were rushing their relationship.\n\nAt the end of season four, Rosa and Jake are framed by their idol Lt. Melanie Hawkins and are arrested. After months in prison at the beginning of season five, the two are freed thanks to the precinct exposing Hawkins' crimes. Following her months of isolation, she starts spending more time with her family and ends her relationship with Pimento. Later in the season, she comes out as bisexual to the precinct and her family, and has a brief relationship with an unseen woman that the squad never meet or learn the name of, nicknamed \"Becky\". She has a brief flirtation with one of Gina's friends, but this does not lead anywhere. On the day of Jake and Amy's wedding, she and Terry meet a cab driver named Alicia that she becomes interested in. The two begin a relationship off-screen. However, it's short-lived, as Rosa mentions in \"The Tattler\" that they broke up because Alicia was moving to London. \n\nIn season six, Rosa begins dating a cosmetologist named Jocelyn and begins to patch up her relationship with her mother, who was initially disapproving of her bisexuality. In season seven, Rosa and Jocelyn broke up prior to the season's Jimmy Jab Games. In the episode \"Valloweaster,\" she becomes the first three-time Halloween Heist Champion.\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Diaz.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", she received a commendation for her work as the leader of a drug task force.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Terry Jeffords ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Terry Jeffords\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Sergeant {{small|(seasons 1\u20136)}}|[[Lieutenant]] {{small|(season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Terry Crews]]|Theodore Barnes (child)}}\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Terrence Vincent Jeffords\n| family      = \n| spouse      = [[#Sharon Jeffords|Sharon Jeffords]] (wife)\n| significant_other = {{ubl|[[#Chiaki|Chiaki]] (ex-girlfriend)|[[#Veronica Hopkins|Veronica Hopkins]] (ex-girlfriend)}}\n| children    = {{ubl|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Cagney Jeffords]] (daughter)|[[#Cagney & Lacey|Lacey Jeffords]] (daughter)|Ava Jeffords (daughter)}}\n| relatives   = {{ubl|Lawrence Jeffords (brother)|[[#Zeke|Zeke]] (brother-in-law)|Unnamed father (deceased)|Unnamed grandmother (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Terry Crews by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Terry Crews]]]]\n[[Terry Crews]] portrays Lieutenant (previously Sergeant) '''Terrence \"Terry\" Vincent Jeffords''', the supervisor of the 9-9's Detective Squad. An avid [[bodybuilder]] who stands at more than six feet tall, with a [[linebacker]]'s build, Terry's intimidating size and appearance is contrasted by his caring, protective nature and paternal instincts. Jeffords is devoted to his wife and three young daughters Cagney, Lacey (named after the [[Cagney & Lacey|1980s TV series]]), and Ava. He fears the danger of police work because of the possibility that he could leave his children fatherless. Following a panic attack prior to the show's beginning, Terry was removed from field work, but he has since cautiously returned. He is high-strung, prone to nervous excitement, loves yogurt, and has a tendency to refer to himself in the third person. He is an effective and caring leader to the detective squad, often having to play the mature adult in order to keep them in line.\n\nA running gag throughout the series is for Terry to break things (examples include a Magic 8 Ball, a phone and Captain Holt's office) because of his incredible strength. He has been a detective since 1995 and used to be assigned to the 65th Precinct (as seen in \"Terry Kitties\"), where he was constantly mocked for a botched case which he and Jake later proved he was correct in. In S1.Ep.1. Holt mentions that he and Terry have worked together in the 18th Precinct years prior. In 2005, he was the senior detective at the 9-9 (the position Jake now holds since Terry's promotion). He was a linebacker at [[Syracuse University]], where he graduated ''magna cum laude'', as revealed in \"The Swedes\". He also studied abroad in Japan while in college and dated a Japanese student named Chiaki who broke his heart. He speaks Japanese infrequently throughout the show.\n\nIn season two, Terry nearly gets a [[vasectomy]] at his wife's request, but Jake convinces him not to when he finds out Terry secretly wants to have more kids. His wife becomes pregnant later in the season and gives birth to their third daughter, Ava, in season three. He entrusts Jake to be Ava's godfather.\n\nWhile Terry was satisfied with his role as Sergeant, he aimed to become a Lieutenant during the first six seasons. As revealed in \"The Honeypot\", he brought a new pair of suspenders that he planned to put on after he passed the Lieutenant's Exam but kept them in the box when he ended up failing and held onto them as a reminder of his higher goals. In \"Moo Moo\", he attempted to apply to be a city council liaison to take on more responsibilities but was rejected after reporting that another cop racially profiled him. In season six, Terry revealed to the group that he passed the Lieutenant's Exam weeks before the annual Halloween Heist (which they hosted on Cinco de Mayo).\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Lieutenant Jeffords.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd bronze.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Commendation or Commendation\u2014Integrity\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD Unit Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD Unit Citation\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Amy Santiago===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Amy Santiago\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{Plainlist|\n* Detective {{small|(seasons 1\u20135)}} \n* Sergeant {{small|(season 5\u2013present)}}\n}}\n| portrayer          = [[Melissa Fumero]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| alias              = Isabel Cortez (undercover alias)\n| family             = \n| spouse             = [[#Jake Peralta|Jake Peralta]]\n| significant_other  = {{ubl|[[#Teddy Wells|Teddy Wells]] (ex-boyfriend)|[[#Constantine Kane|Constantine Kane]] (ex-boyfriend)|Luke Mueller (ex-boyfriend)}}\n| children           = Mac Peralta (son)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Victor Santiago|Victor Santiago]] (father)|[[#Camila Santiago|Camila Santiago]] (mother)|Tony Santiago (brother)|[[#David Santiago|David Santiago]] (brother)|Mason Santiago (nephew)|[[#Roger Peralta|Roger Peralta]] (father-in-law)|[[#Karen Peralta|Karen Peralta]] (mother-in-law)|[[#Kate Peralta|Kate Peralta]] (half sister-in-law)|Five unnamed brothers|Two unnamed half sisters-in-law|An unknown number of half brothers-in-law|Unnamed niece}}\n| religion           = \n| nationality        = Cuban-American\n}}\n[[File:Melissa Fumero May 2018.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Melissa Fumero]]]]\n[[Melissa Fumero]] portrays Sergeant (previously Detective) '''Amy Santiago''', Jake's uptight, by-the-book, rule-following [[Cuban-American]] partner, and later wife.<ref name=castlist/> A self-acknowledged [[Type A and Type B personality theory|type A personality]] and neurotic overachiever, she continually tried to ingratiate herself with Captain Holt, and any authority figure in arm's reach of her. In the pilot, Terry cites Amy's competitiveness to Holt as a result of her having seven brothers. Amy is a stickler for department protocol and is frequently exasperated by Jake's childishness, as well as the ease with which he succeeds as a detective. She is initially seen as Holt's teacher's pet, but over time is shown to command respect from others. \n\nAmy was originally a patrol officer at the 64th precinct but requested a transfer to the 99th when her captain almost sexually assaulted her shortly after her promotion to detective. She didn't tell anyone for years out of fear for what it would do to her career until she revealed it to Jake when they were investigating a sexual assault case in \"He Said, She Said\". \n\nIn [[Charges and Specs]], the season one finale, Jake confessed that he wishes something romantic could happen between them. She confessed to having feelings for Jake in \"[[The Road Trip (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Road Trip]]\", which instigated issues in Amy and Teddy Wells' relationship and was shown to still have feelings for Jake in \"[[Det. Dave Majors]]\". The two shared their first kiss in [[Johnny and Dora]]<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> and began dating in [[New Captain]], although their working relationship did not change at all. They decided to move in together in the season three finale [[Greg and Larry]], but don't make it official until season four's [[The Fugitive (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|The Fugitive]]. Jake proposed to Amy at the end of their annual Halloween heist in [[HalloVeen]] and the two eventually marry in [[Jake & Amy]]. In season 7, Amy became pregnant with Jake's child and gave birth to their son, McClane \"Mac\" Peralta in the season finale.\n\nNear the end of season three, Amy went undercover as a pregnant inmate in a women's prison in Texas to obtain information from Maura Figgis. This was done to cover Melissa Fumero's actual pregnancy at the time without making her character pregnant. Amy's actual pregnancy in season seven occurred when Fumero was pregnant with her second child.\n\nAfter some uncertainty in taking the Sergeant's Exam as depicted in \"[[Chasing Amy (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Chasing Amy]]\", she passed the exam and began wearing her Sergeant's uniform as well as commanding her own uniformed officers in \"[[NutriBoom]]\".\n\nIn season six's \"Casecation\", she was revealed to be 36 years old. In \"The Golden Child\", it is revealed that Amy had a relatively strained relationship with her brother and fellow NYPD Lieutenant David Santiago, chiding her mother for glorifying David's accomplishments over Amy's. Amy enjoys solving crosswords and attending trivia sessions, to the expense of Jake, who often embarrasses himself when attempting to participate or becomes awkwardly excluded in conversation. \n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Sergeant Santiago.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD Baby Delivery Citation.jpg|100px]]\n|Citation bar for delivering a baby\n|-this is wrong.

He is divorced from his wife Eleanor, who had numerous affairs during their marriage, to the point where she has to pay alimony to him. He is also a huge, unapologetic [[foodie]], maintaining a weekly Brooklyn pizza-ranking email and often relishing bizarre foreign cuisine that disgusts his coworkers. \n\nFor saving Detective Diaz's life during \"Christmas\" (during which he was shot in the buttocks), he was awarded the [[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]] in \"The Bet\", though he was overshadowed by a revered and heroic NYPD horse named Sergeant Peanut Butter. He continued to have a one-sided rivalry with Sergeant (later Lieutenant) Peanut Butter until he seeks his help in getting Jake to the precinct in the season 7 finale. In \"The Swedes\", it is revealed that Boyle is a graduate of [[Sarah Lawrence College]].\n\nIn the show's first season, Charles had a crush on Rosa, but he eventually got over her when he started dating Vivian Ludley, whom he met at Captain Holt's birthday party. They get engaged but break up after Charles refused to move to Canada with her. He and Gina start to see each other in season two, and their brief relationship resulted in his father and Gina's mother's marriage. In season three, he starts dating Genevieve Mirren-Carter after he and Jake clear her name from an art thief. They eventually move in together and adopt a son from Latvia named Nikolaj. \n\nIn season five, Charles started his own food truck business called \"The One Thing\", which specialized in meatball subs. The truck was burned down by one of Charles' ex-employees, but he's thankful it happened as running the food truck made him spend less time with his family and built up a large debt.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Detective Boyle.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[File:Police Unidentified Citation 1.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:Fictional Police Citation.jpg|100px|]]\n|Unidentified award\n|-\n|[[File:NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar.jpg|100px|]]\n|NYPD 150th Commemorative Breast Bar\n|}\n \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Gina Linetti ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Gina Linetti\n| first              = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| last               = \"Return of the King\"\n| gender             = Female\n| occupation         = {{ubl|[[Administrator (business)|Administrator]] {{small|(Seasons 1\u20136)}}|Internet personality {{small|(Season 6\u2013present)}}}}\n| portrayer          = [[Chelsea Peretti]]\n| creator            = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name          = Regina Linetti\n| significant_other   = {{ubl|[[#Charles Boyle|Charles Boyle]] (ex-lover)|[[#Milton Boyle|Milton Boyle]] (lover, father of her child)|Eight unnamed ex-fianc\u00e9s}}\n| children           = The Enigma \"Iggy\" Boyle (daughter)\n| relatives          = {{ubl|[[#Darlene Linetti|Darlene Linetti]] (mother)|[[#Lynn Boyle|Lynn Boyle]] (stepfather)|Charles Boyle (stepbrother)|Susan Grapecoat (great-aunt)|Anthony (nephew)|Unnamed sibling|Unnamed father}}\n| nationality        = American\n}}\n[[File:Chelsea Peretti at Meltdown (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Chelsea Peretti]]]]\n[[Chelsea Peretti]] portrays '''Regina \"Gina\" Linetti''', the 99th Precinct's sardonic and egomaniacal civilian administrator and Captain Holt's assistant.<ref name=castlist/> Despite maintaining a clueless and dimwitted disposition most of the time, she can be surprisingly observant and has demonstrated traits of being more intelligent than she likes to show. Gina is obsessed with social media and is constantly on her phone. It is a running gag to try to pry her from her phone, to the point where Captain Holt becomes involved. She is extremely narcissistic and constantly praises and exalts herself, such as claiming to be a better dancer than [[Britney Spears]] in the episode \"Karen Peralta\". As the only civilian in the precinct, Gina often uses her outsider's perspective to assist the other detectives. In the episode \"The Party\", to prevent the mostly [[working class]] detectives from embarrassing themselves in front of a crowd of [[academia|academics]], Rosa tricks Gina into talking to a group of psychology professors at Holt's birthday party, who then take copious notes about her narcissistic personality. They conclude that she has a complete overlap of [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] and [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]], a condition previously thought to be purely theoretical.\n\nShe casually admits on myriad occasions that she doesn't value her colleagues \u2013 except for Jake \u2013 as people. She was also childhood friends with Jake, who got her the job at the precinct. Gina also ruined Jake's senior year of high school by framing him as \"The Tattler\", though she did it to avoid Jake getting involved with the wrong crowd. She transferred to the Public relations Division with Captain Holt in \"Johnny and Dora\", and returns to the 9-9 with him in \"The Oolong Slayer\".<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/><ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> In the episode \"The Apartment\", it is revealed that she has been engaged eight times, but never married. At the end of \"The Fugitive Pt. 2\", she gets hit by a bus after receiving a text from Charles. The penultimate episode of season four reveals she has become pregnant following a relationship with Charles' cousin, Milton (which coincided with Chelsea Peretti's actual pregnancy). She is absent for the first half of season five on maternity leave after giving birth to a girl she nicknames \"Iggy\" (short for Enigma). \n\nIn the episode \"Halloween IV\", Gina reveals that in the fourth grade at a classmate's birthday party, a bowling ball fell onto her face. This incident knocked out her two front teeth; she's been wearing false teeth since.\n\nIn season six, Jake helps Gina realize that her talents would be better spent elsewhere and she quits her job. She becomes an internet celebrity and hosts a web show called \"The G-Hive,\" in which she gives her viewers life advice. Her work has made it too busy to spend time with her former coworkers, but she is aiming to improve after Jake confronts her for not talking to them for months. \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Raymond Holt ===\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Raymond Holt\n| first       = \"[[Pilot (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|Pilot]]\"\n| gender      = Male\n| occupation  = {{ubl|Commanding Officer, NYPD 99th Precinct {{small|(seasons 1\u20136; season 7-present)}} \n<br>Head of NYPD public relations {{small| (season 3)}}|Patrol officer {{small|(season 6\u20137)}}}}\n| portrayer   = {{ubl|[[Andre Braugher]]|Seth Carr (child)}}\n| alias       = Greg Stickney ([[WITSEC]] alias)\n| creator     = {{ubl|[[Dan Goor]]|[[Michael Schur]]}}\n| full_name    = Raymond Jacob Holt\n| spouse      = [[#Kevin Cozner|Kevin Cozner]]\n| significant_other = [[#Frederick|Frederick]] (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives   = {{ubl|[[#Laverne Holt|Laverne Holt]] (mother)|Unnamed father (deceased)|[[#Debbie|Debbie]] (sister)| [[#Marcus|Marcus]] (nephew)<br>Geoffrey Holt (uncle)<br>Martin Cozner (brother-in-law)<br>Carol Wilg (goddaughter)<br>Gary (ex-brother-in-law)<br>Unnamed uncle (deceased)}}\n| religion    = \n| nationality = American\n}}\n[[File:Andre Braugher 2011 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andre Braugher]]]]\n[[Andre Braugher]] portrays Captain '''Raymond Jacob Holt''', the 99th Precinct's strict Commanding Officer. Holt is known for his cold, calm and robotic manner of speaking, overly formal demeanor and lack of outwardly visible emotion, although his non-work friends frequently refer to him having a much more fun persona that is very rarely seen by either the Nine-Nine members or the viewer. He has sophisticated and cultured interests, enjoying classical music, opera and attending dinner parties with his husband's academic friends, amongst other things. The Nine-Nine is Holt's first command despite many years of outstanding service, and he attributes the delay to prejudice against both his [[race (human classification)|race]] and [[homosexuality]]. He came out in 1987 and until recently led a group that supported LGBT African-American NYPD members, which he himself created.<ref name=castlist/> He was a homicide detective in the 1980s, and spent twelve years in the Community Affairs Bureau immediately prior to commanding the Nine-Nine. \n\nHolt is married to Kevin Cozner, the Chair of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Classics]] Department,<ref>{{Cite episode|title=The Party|episodelink=|series=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|serieslink=Brooklyn Nine-Nine|airdate=February 4, 2014|season=1|number=16}}</ref> and has a longstanding professional rivalry with Madeline Wuntch, with whom he came up through the ranks; while his career stalled, she kept advancing and is now his immediate superior. After he and Peralta successfully solved a major case in \"The Chopper\", Bureau Chief Wuntch nominated him for a promotion to head of the NYPD Public Affairs Division, a promotion he accepted lest Wuntch transfer his staff to horrible posts around New York City.<ref name=\"Johnny and Dora\"/> During the number of weeks he was in charge of Public Affairs, Holt was unable to accomplish anything significant thanks to Chief Wuntch's constant micromanaging. After helping Peralta solve a serial killer case, Holt found himself transferred back to command of the 9-9 by the Chief of Brooklyn Detectives.<ref name=\"The Oolong Slayer\"/> He owned a burgundy [[Chevrolet Corvair]] named Gertie which was his prized possession until it was stolen in \"The Fugitive\". Doug Judy purchased him a new identical one and named it Sexarella.\n\nAt the end of season three, Holt is forced to go into witness protection in Florida with Jake when they are threatened by crime boss Jimmy \"The Butcher\" Figgis. He worked at a family entertainment center called the Fun Zone under the alias of Greg until he and Jake baited Figgis into coming to Florida and took the criminal down with the Nine-Nine. In season five, his life and career are put at risk when he makes a deal with mobster Seamus Murphy in exchange for information to clear Jake and Rosa's names from Lt. Hawkins.\n\nDuring season five, Holt learns that the [[New York City Police Commissioner]] is retiring at the end of the year and that he is on the shortlist of candidates to replace him. He spends the rest of the season campaigning to win the Commissioner title but ends up losing to John Kelly.\n\nIn season six, Holt is encouraged by Jake and Amy to stand up to Kelly's regressive policies, leading the Commissioner to retaliate against the Nine-Nine. However, Peralta and Wuntch team up, without Holt's knowledge, to take Kelly down, resulting in Wuntch being named interim Commissioner. This detente becomes short-lived as Holt is demoted to a uniformed officer by Commissioner Wuntch after she realized he was promoted to detective too soon earlier in his career. Shortly after Wuntch's death, however, he is quickly promoted back to captain in the middle of the seventh season.\n\n====Awards and decorations====\nThe following are the medals and service awards fictionally worn by Captain Holt.\n\n{|\n|[[File:American Flag Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|American Flag Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[File:WTC Breast Bar.jpg|100px]]\n|World Trade Center Breast Bar\n|-\n|[[Image:Blueribbon.jpg|100px]]\n|[[New York City Police Department Medal for Valor|NYPD Medal for Valor]]\n|-\n|[[Image:Mpd.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Meritorious Police Duty (with numeral \"10\")\n|-\n|[[Image:NYPD EPD.jpg|100px]]\n|NYPD Excellent Police Duty\n|-\n|[[File:SCSO - Pistol Expert.png|100px]]\n|NYPD Firearms Proficiency Bar\n|}\n\nIn \"Stakeout\", he received a commendation for his supervision of Det.

As revealed in \"Hitchcock and Scully\", the two were excellent detectives in their youths and had well-built bodies, but their careers and their physiques went downhill after they tried the wings at their eventual favorite restaurant, Wing Slutz.\n\nThe majority of the precinct tends to be disgusted by Hitchcock's more perverted nature and attitude towards women. It's revealed in \"The Last Ride\" (Season 4) that Hitchcock held the all-time record for closed cases at the 99th Precinct, one more than Sgt. Jeffords as of that episode. This is mainly due to Hitchcock being at the 99th twenty years longer than Terry.

He also displayed an uncanny ability to reassemble shredded documents in one episode. Scully routinely discloses disgusting medical issues like the entire bottom of his foot being a wart or having various strains of [[fungi]]. He claims to constantly have medical emergencies, and despite having a [[pacemaker]] fitted, he frequently suffers from [[heart attack]]s. He often embarrasses himself either unintentionally or willingly and admits to being indifferent to the judgment of others (most frequently, the fellow members of his squad.) In the early seasons, Scully is married and has a dog. The team are unsure which one of them is called Kelly, though it is later revealed in season 7 that both of them were named Kelly.
