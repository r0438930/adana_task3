was conceived by 17 [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] business, political, and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the [[Midwest]]. Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|203x203px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university.<ref name=founding>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |title=The Founding of Washington University |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=Washington University in St. Louis Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130512/http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to \"Washington Institute\" in honor of [[George Washington]], and because the charter was coincidentally passed on Washington\u2019s birthday, February 22.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.wustl.edu/wustl-faq/washington|title=Research Guides: WU History FAQ: Origin of Washington University's Name|last=Rectenwald|first=Miranda|website=libguides.wustl.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Naming the university after the nation's first president, only seven years before the [[American Civil War]] and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|195x195px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

It is the location of all the freshman buildings as well as several sophomore buildings, which are set up in the traditional [[residential college]] system. All of the residential halls are co-ed. The dormitories on the South 40 have grown national recognition for their large size and large number of amenities.<ref name=\":1\" /> The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment wherein residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp. Bear's Den (the largest dining hall on campus), the Habif Health and Wellness Center (Student Health Services), the Residential Life Office, [[University police]] Headquarters, various student-owned businesses (e.g. the laundry service, Wash U Wash), and the baseball, softball, and intramural fields are also located on the South 40.\n\nAnother group of residences, known as the Village, is located in the northwest corner of [[Danforth Campus]]. Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars, the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments, The Village, Village East on-campus apartments, and all fraternity houses except the Zeta Beta Tau house, which is off campus and located just northwest of the South 40. Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord. The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24, known as BLOCs, to live together in clustered suites along with non-BLOCs. Like the South 40, the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn.\n\nIn addition to South 40 and North Side residence halls, Washington University owns several apartment buildings within walking distance to Danforth Campus, which are open to upperclassmen.\n\n===Student media===\nWashington University supports four major student-run media outlets. The university's [[student newspaper]], [[Student Life (newspaper)|''Student Life'']], is available for students. [[KWUR]] (90.3 FM) serves as the students' official radio station; the station also attracts an audience in the immediately surrounding community due to its eclectic and free-form musical programming. WUTV is the university's [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] [[television channel]]. The university's main student-run political publication is the Washington University Political Review (nicknamed \"WUPR\"), a self-described \"multipartisan\" monthly magazine. Washington University undergraduates publish two literary and art journals, The Eliot Review and Spires Intercollegiate Arts and Literary Magazine. A variety of other publications also serve the university community, ranging from in-house [[academic journal]]s to glossy alumni magazines to ''WUnderground'', the student-run satirical newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/|title=WUnderground \u2013 WashU's Premier (and only) satirical newspaper!|website=Wunderground.wustl.edu|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505144307/http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/|archive-date=May 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\n{{Main|Washington University Bears}}\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|266x266px|[[Francis Olympic Field]] during the [[1904 St. Louis Olympics]]|alt=|left]]\nWashington University's sports teams are called the Bears.

was conceived by 17 [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] business, political, and religious leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the [[Midwest]]. Missouri State Senator [[Wayman Crow]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[William Greenleaf Eliot]], grandfather of the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], led the effort.\n\nThe university's first chancellor was [[Joseph Gibson Hoyt]]. Crow secured the university charter from the [[Missouri General Assembly]] in 1853, and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees. Early on, Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community, including [[John O'Fallon]], but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment. Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment. The institution had no backing of a religious organization, single wealthy patron, or earmarked government support.\n[[File:WGEliot.jpg|203x203px|left|thumb|William Greenleaf Eliot, first president of the Board of Trustees]]\n\nDuring the three years following its inception, the university bore three different names. The board first approved \"Eliot Seminary,\" but William Eliot was uncomfortable with naming a university after himself and objected to the establishment of a seminary, which would implicitly be charged with teaching a religious faith. He favored a nonsectarian university.<ref name=founding>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |title=The Founding of Washington University |accessdate=January 8, 2009 |work=Washington University in St. Louis Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725130512/http://magazine.wustl.edu/Summer03/FoundingOfWashU.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 }}</ref> In 1854, the Board of Trustees changed the name to \"Washington Institute\" in honor of [[George Washington]], and because the charter was coincidentally passed on Washington\u2019s birthday, February 22.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.wustl.edu/wustl-faq/washington|title=Research Guides: WU History FAQ: Origin of Washington University's Name|last=Rectenwald|first=Miranda|website=libguides.wustl.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Naming the university after the nation's first president, only seven years before the [[American Civil War]] and during a time of bitter national division, was no coincidence. During this time of conflict, Americans universally admired George Washington as the father of the United States and a symbol of national unity. The Board of Trustees believed that the university should be a force of unity in a strongly divided Missouri. In 1856, the university amended its name to \"Washington University.\" The university amended its name once more in 1976, when the Board of Trustees voted to add the suffix \"in St. Louis\" to distinguish the university from the over two dozen other universities bearing Washington's name.<ref name=\"george\" />[[File:Robert S.

Owing to limited financial resources, Washington University initially used public buildings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, at the Benton School building. At first the university paid for the evening classes, but as their popularity grew, their funding was transferred to the [[St. Louis Public Schools]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210162946/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3464:12:4.lincoln | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 10, 2009 | title=Washington University | accessdate=January 8, 2009 | work=Northern Illinois University Libraries Digitization Projects }}</ref> Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings. Later the university divided into three departments: the Manual Training School, Smith Academy, and the [[Mary Institute]].\n\nIn 1867, the university opened the first private nonsectarian [[Washington University School of Law|law school]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. By 1882, Washington University had expanded to numerous departments, which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis. Medical classes were first held at Washington University in 1891 after the St. Louis Medical College decided to affiliate with the university, establishing the [[Washington University School of Medicine|School of Medicine]]. During the 1890s, [[Robert S. Brookings|Robert Sommers Brookings]], the president of the Board of Trustees, undertook the tasks of reorganizing the university's finances, putting them onto a sound foundation, and buying land for a new campus.\n\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what would become the basis for the modern day university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, and the symbol of [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]], whom the city is named after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wustl.edu/about/history-traditions/|title=History and Traditions|website=Washington University in St. Louis|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era (1900\u20131955)===\n[[File:WUFranGat.JPG|right|thumb|195x195px|The Washington University crest at the entrance to [[Francis Field (St. Louis)|Francis Field]]]]\nWashington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave., Lucas Place, and Locust Street. By the 1890s, owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings, the university began to move west. The university board of directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm [[Olmsted Brothers|Olmsted, Olmsted & Eliot]] of Boston. A committee of Robert S. Brookings, [[Henry Ware Eliot]], and William Huse found a site of {{convert|103|acre|ha|1}} just beyond [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], located west of the city limits in [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]. The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] and inspired the nickname of \"Hilltop\" campus, renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor [[William Henry Danforth|William H.

The construction of [[Brookings Hall]], Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the [[1904 World's Fair]] and [[1904 Summer Olympics|Olympics]]. The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned. This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus; Cope & Stewardson's original plan and its choice of building materials have, with few exceptions, guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day.<ref name=\"Architecture of Danforth Campus\" />\nBy 1915, construction of a new medical complex was completed on Kingshighway in what is now St. Louis's Central West End.

It is the location of all the freshman buildings as well as several sophomore buildings, which are set up in the traditional [[residential college]] system. All of the residential halls are co-ed. The dormitories on the South 40 have grown national recognition for their large size and large number of amenities.<ref name=\":1\" /> The South 40 is organized as a pedestrian-friendly environment wherein residences surround a central recreational lawn known as the Swamp. Bear's Den (the largest dining hall on campus), the Habif Health and Wellness Center (Student Health Services), the Residential Life Office, [[University police]] Headquarters, various student-owned businesses (e.g. the laundry service, Wash U Wash), and the baseball, softball, and intramural fields are also located on the South 40.\n\nAnother group of residences, known as the Village, is located in the northwest corner of [[Danforth Campus]]. Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars, the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments, The Village, Village East on-campus apartments, and all fraternity houses except the Zeta Beta Tau house, which is off campus and located just northwest of the South 40. Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord. The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24, known as BLOCs, to live together in clustered suites along with non-BLOCs. Like the South 40, the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn.\n\nIn addition to South 40 and North Side residence halls, Washington University owns several apartment buildings within walking distance to Danforth Campus, which are open to upperclassmen.\n\n===Student media===\nWashington University supports four major student-run media outlets. The university's [[student newspaper]], [[Student Life (newspaper)|''Student Life'']], is available for students. [[KWUR]] (90.3 FM) serves as the students' official radio station; the station also attracts an audience in the immediately surrounding community due to its eclectic and free-form musical programming. WUTV is the university's [[closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]] [[television channel]]. The university's main student-run political publication is the Washington University Political Review (nicknamed \"WUPR\"), a self-described \"multipartisan\" monthly magazine. Washington University undergraduates publish two literary and art journals, The Eliot Review and Spires Intercollegiate Arts and Literary Magazine. A variety of other publications also serve the university community, ranging from in-house [[academic journal]]s to glossy alumni magazines to ''WUnderground'', the student-run satirical newspaper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/|title=WUnderground \u2013 WashU's Premier (and only) satirical newspaper!|website=Wunderground.wustl.edu|accessdate=May 20, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505144307/http://www.wunderground.wustl.edu/|archive-date=May 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Athletics===\n{{Main|Washington University Bears}}\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|266x266px|[[Francis Olympic Field]] during the [[1904 St. Louis Olympics]]|alt=|left]]\nWashington University's sports teams are called the Bears.
