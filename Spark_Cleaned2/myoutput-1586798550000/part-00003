The association also selects pizzerias all around the world to produce and spread the verace pizza napoletana philosophy and method.\n\nThere are many famous pizzerias in Naples where these traditional pizzas can be found such as Da Michele, Port'Alba, Brandi, Di Matteo, Sorbillo, Trianon, and Umberto. Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias follow even stricter standards than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.\n\nThe pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base. Another popular form of pizza in Italy is \"[[pizza al taglio]]\", which is pizza baked in rectangular trays with a wide variety of toppings and sold by weight.\n\nIn 1962, the \"Hawaiian\" pizza, a pizza topped with pineapple and ham, was invented in Canada by restaurateur Sam Panopoulis at the Satellite Restaurant in [[Chatham-Kent|Chatham, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Nosowitz |title=Meet the 81-Year-Old Greek-Canadian Inventor of the Hawaiian Pizza|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-inventor-of-hawaiian-pizza |work=[[Atlas Obscura]] |location=Unknown |date=November 4, 2015 |access-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2009, the pizza napoletana was granted [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO) status by the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Hooper |title=Pizza napoletana awarded special status by EU |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/09/italian-pizza-wins-protected-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=December 9, 2009 |access-date=December 9, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the world's largest pizza was made in Rome and it was measured to be 1261.65 square metres in area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-pizza|title=Largest pizza|newspaper=Guinness World Records|access-date=January 13, 2017}} From the given area, the circular pizza had a diameter of approximately 40.08&nbsp;m, or 131.5&nbsp;ft.</ref>\n\nIn 2016, robotics company [[BeeHex]], widely covered in the media, was building robots that 3D-printed pizza.<ref name = digitaltrends>{{cite web | url = http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/beehex-3d-printed-pizza/ | title = NASA wants astronauts to have 3D printed pizza, and this startup is building a printer to make it happen | publisher = [[Digital Trends]] | access-date = January 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, the pizza napoletana was inscribed on the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Naples' pizza twirling wins Unesco 'intangible' status |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/07/naples-pizza-twirling-wins-unesco-intangible-status |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |date=December 7, 2017 |access-date=December 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Pizza in Canada==\n[[Canada]]'s first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in [[Montreal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/life/From+archives+Montreal+pizzerias+labour+doughy+love/5974279/story.html|date=April 22, 2014|title=From the archives: Montreal pizzerias, the labour of doughy love|publisher=montrealgazzette.com}}</ref> Starting in the late 1950s, the first pizza ovens started entering the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1 |title=Bringing the first pizza ovens to Canada in the 1950s|publisher=Canada.com |date= |accessdate=February 20, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318171146/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=02f306cd-5f68-4472-82d8-af9524003ec1|archivedate=March 18, 2016}}</ref> It gained popularity throughout the 1960s, with many pizzerias and restaurants opening across the country.

Most pizza restaurants across Canada also serve popular Italian cuisine in addition to pizza, such as pasta, salad, soups and sandwiches. Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzone]]s. [[Pizza Pops]] are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.\n\nThe most distinct pizza in Canada is the \"Canadian\" pizza. A \"Canadian\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \"[[Canadian bacon]]\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.\n\nIn Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer's choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.\n\nIn the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese\n\nSome of Canada's successful pizza brands include: [[Boston Pizza]], [[Pizza Pizza]], and Vanelli's.

Most of them are in the ancient historical centre of Naples. These pizzerias follow even stricter standards than the specified rules by, for example, using only [[San Marzano tomato]]es grown on the slopes of [[Mount Vesuvius]] and drizzling the olive oil and adding tomato topping in only a clockwise direction.\n\nThe pizza bases in Naples are soft and pliable. In Rome they prefer a thin and crispy base.

Fast-food pizza chains also provide other side options for customers to choose from, in addition to ordering pizza, including chicken wings, fries and [[poutine]], salad, and [[calzone]]s. [[Pizza Pops]] are a Canadian calzone-type snack introduced in the 1960s. Pizza chains across Canada can be found in shopping centres, schools, and neighbourhood plazas, with the majority of these chains offering a sit-and-dine facility for customers.\n\nThe most distinct pizza in Canada is the \"Canadian\" pizza. A \"Canadian\" pizza is usually prepared with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and bacon. Many variations of this pizza exist, but the two standout ingredients that make this pizza distinctly Canadian are bacon and mushrooms. Pizzas in Canada are almost never served with \"[[Canadian bacon]]\", or back bacon as it's referred to in Canada. Rather, side bacon is the standard pork topping on pizza.\n\nIn Canada, pizza is served on a variety of crust types, including a traditional-style pan crust, a thin crust, multi-grain crust, whole-grain crust, and a gluten-free crust. Stuffed-crust pizza is also a popular pizza alternative for Canadian customers. It contains pizza toppings of the customer's choice on a mozzarella-filled crust.\n\nIn the province of Quebec [[Pizza-ghetti]] is a combination meal commonly found in fast food or family restaurants. It consists of a pizza, sliced in half, accompanied by a small portion of spaghetti with a tomato based sauce. Although both pizza and spaghetti are considered staples of Italian cuisine, combining them in one dish is completely unknown in Italy. A popular variant involves using spaghetti as a pizza topping, under the pizza's mozzarella cheese\n\nSome of Canada's successful pizza brands include: [[Boston Pizza]], [[Pizza Pizza]], and Vanelli's.
