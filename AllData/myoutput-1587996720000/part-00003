Jefferson believed that libraries and books were so integral to individual and institutional education that he designed the university around its library.\n\nIn 1779 in \"A Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge,\" Jefferson proposed a system of public education to be tax-funded for 3 years for \"all the free children, male and female,\" which was an unusual perspective for the time period. They were allowed to attend longer if their parents, friends, or family could pay for it independently.\n\nIn his book ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785), Jefferson had scribed his ideas for public education at the elementary level.  In 1817 he proposed a plan for a system of limited state public education for males only, in keeping with the times.  It depended on public grammar schools, and further education of a limited number of the best students, and those whose parents wanted to pay for them. The university was to be the capstone, available to only the best selected students.  [[Virginia]] did not establish free public education in the primary grades until after the [[American Civil War]] under the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] legislature.\n\n== Jefferson's education ==\n[[File:Wren3.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Jefferson lodged and boarded in the [[Wren Building]] at The College of William & Mary. Jefferson drew plans to complete the building as a quadrangle, but construction was halted due to the Revolutionary War.]]\n\nIn 1752, Jefferson began attending a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister. At the age of nine, Jefferson began studying Latin, Greek, and French; he learned to ride horses, and began to appreciate the study of nature. He studied under the Reverend [[James Maury]] from 1758 to 1760 near [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]], Virginia. While boarding with Maury's family, he studied history, science and the classics.{{sfn|Peterson|1970|pp=7\u20139}}\n\nIn 1760 Jefferson entered [[The College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] at the age of 16; he studied there for two years. At William & Mary, he enrolled in the philosophy school and studied mathematics, [[metaphysics]], and philosophy under Professor [[William Small]], who introduced Jefferson to the writings of the [[empiricism|British Empiricists]], including [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>Merrill D. Peterson, ''Thomas Jefferson: Writings'', p. 1236</ref> He also perfected his French, carried his Greek grammar book wherever he went, practiced the violin, and read [[Tacitus]] and [[Homer]]. Jefferson displayed an avid curiosity in all fields and, according to the family tradition, frequently studied fifteen hours a day.<ref>[Randolph, Sarah N., The Domestic Life of Thomas Jefferson (Cambridge, MA: University Press, 1939), p15.]</ref> \nHis closest college friend, John Page of Rosewell, reported that Jefferson \"could tear himself away from his dearest friends to fly to his studies.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nWhile in college, Jefferson was a member of a secret organization called the [[Flat Hat Club]],{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} now the namesake of the William & Mary student newspaper. He lodged and boarded at the College in the building known today as the Sir Christopher [[Wren Building]], attending communal meals in the Great Hall, and morning and evening prayers in the Wren Chapel. Jefferson often attended the lavish parties of royal governor [[Francis Fauquier]], where he played his violin and developed an early love for wines.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/chapters/1203-1st-hail.html John Hailman, \"Thomas Jefferson on Wine\"], ''New York Times'', 3 December 2006</ref> After graduation, he studied law with [[George Wythe]] and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767.\n\n==Libraries==\n\nThroughout his life, Jefferson depended on books for his education. He collected and accumulated thousands of books for his library at Monticello. A significant portion of Jefferson's library was also bequeathed to him in the will of George Wythe, who had an extensive collection. Always eager for more knowledge, Jefferson continued learning throughout most of his life. Jefferson once said, \"I cannot live without books.\"<ref name=\"Jefferson, LOC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/jefferson/jefflib.html |title= Jefferson's Library |publisher=Library of Congress|date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref>\n\nBy 1815, Jefferson's library included 6,487 books, which he sold to the [[Library of Congress]] for $23,950 to replace the smaller collection destroyed in the [[War of 1812]].

Jefferson's responses to Marbois' \"Queries\" would become known as ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785). Scientifically trained, Jefferson was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], which had been founded in Philadelphia in 1743. He had extensive knowledge of western lands from Virginia to Illinois. In a course of 5 years, Jefferson enthusiastically devoted his intellectual energy to the book; he included a discussion of contemporary scientific knowledge, and Virginia's history, politics, and [[ethnography]]. Jefferson was aided by [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker]], [[George Rogers Clark|George R. Clark]], and U.S. geographer [[Thomas Hutchins]]. The book was first published in France in 1785 and in England in 1787.<ref>Shuffelton (1999, June 2001), ''Notes on the State of Virginia Thomas Jefferson'', Introduction</ref>\n\t\nIt has been ranked as the most important American book published before 1800. The book is Jefferson's vigorous and often eloquent argument about the nature of the good society, which he believed was incarnated by Virginia. In it he expressed his beliefs in the separation of church and state, constitutional government, checks and balances, and individual liberty. He also compiled extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy.\n\n==Presidency==\n{{further|Presidency of Thomas Jefferson}}\n\n===Military Academy at West Point===\n{{further|United States Military Academy}}\nIdeas for a national institution for military education were circulated during the American Revolution. It wasn't until 1802 when Jefferson, following the advice of George Washington, John Adams and others,{{sfn|McDonald|2004|p=194}} finally convinced Congress to authorize the funding and building of the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point on the Hudson River in New York. On March 16, 1802, Jefferson signed the Military Peace Establishment Act, directing that a corps of engineers be established and \"stationed at West Point in the state of New York, and shall constitute a Military Academy.\"<ref name=\"Monticello, West Point\">{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/united-states-military-academy-west-point |title=United States Military Academy at West Point|publisher=Monticello.org |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> The Act would provide well-trained officers for a professional army. The officers would be reliable republicans rather than a closed elite as in Europe, for the cadets were to be appointed by Congressmen, and thus exactly reflect the nation's politics. In May 1801 Secretary of War [[Henry Dearborn]] announced that the president had \"decided in favor of the immediate establishment of a military school at West Point and also on the appointment of Major Jonathan Williams\", grandnephew of Benjamin Franklin, to direct \"the necessary arrangements, at that place for the commencement of the school.\"{{sfn|McDonald|2004|pp=120-121}} On July 4, 1802, the US Military Academy at West Point formally commenced its role as an institution for scientific and military learning.<ref name=\"Monticello, West Point\"/>\n\n==Later years==\n\n=== Plan for systematic education===\nIn 1785, Jefferson proposed a system of public schools for the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] in the interest of \"diffus[ing] knowledge more generally through the mass of the people\".<ref name=NSV/> According to Jefferson, \"The ultimate result of the whole scheme of education would be the teaching all the children of the state reading, writing, and common arithmetic: turning out [several] annually of superior genius, well taught in Greek, Latin, geography, and the higher branches of arithmetic: turning out...others annually, of still superior parts, who, to those branches of learning, shall have added such of the sciences as their genius shall have led them to.\"<ref name=NSV/> As a byproduct, this plan would furnish \"to the wealthier part of the people convenient schools, at which their children may be educated, at their own expense.\"<ref name=NSV/>\n\nThe plan was for education of children in three successive stages corresponding with three types of schools: primary schools, which all children, regardless of their parents' financial ability, would be able to attend for at least three years; intermediate schools, for students who excelled in primary school, as well as for children whose parents are willing and able to pay for it; and the university, for students whose parents were willing to pay.<ref name=NSV/><ref>Thomas Jefferson to A.

Correa de Serra, 1817. ME 15:155</ref> as well as Grecian, Roman, European and American history. It was important that all children learn history because \"apprising them of the past will enable them to judge of the future.\" According to Jefferson, \"the principal foundations of future order will be laid here\" and \"the first elements of morality too may be instilled into [the children's] minds\".\n\nJefferson opposed providing children in these schools religious texts, since he believed the children would be \"at an age when their judgments are not sufficiently matured for religious enquiries\". However, he was in favor of showing the children that happiness \"does not depend on the condition of life in which chance has placed them, but is always the result of a good conscience, good health, occupation, and freedom in all just pursuits.\"\n\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = There is a certain period of life, say from eight to fifteen or sixteen years of age, when the mind, like the body, is not yet firm enough for laborious and close operations.

This half would include future grammar school masters. The other half, \"chosen for the superiority of their parts and disposition,\" would continue studying three more years at the university, \"in the study of such sciences as they shall chuse\". Jefferson considered the university to be the capstone of the educational system. To accommodate the influx of students, Jefferson proposed that the [[College of William and Mary]] be enlarged \"and extended to all the useful sciences\".\n\n===Father of a university===\n:''Seen also: [[University of Virginia#History|History of the University of Virginia]]''\n[[File:Lawn.jpg|thumb|180px|The Lawn, University of Virginia]]\n\nAfter leaving the presidency, Jefferson continued to be active in public affairs. He also became increasingly concerned with founding a new institution of higher learning, specifically one free of church influences, where students could specialize in [[University of Virginia#History|many new areas]] not offered at other universities. Jefferson believed educating people was a good way to establish an organized society, and also felt schools should be paid for by the general public, so less wealthy people could obtain student membership as well.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/jefferson/quotations/jeff1370.htm Jefferson on Politics & Government: Publicly Supported Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], in January, 1800, indicated that he had been planning the University for decades before its establishment.\n\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = We fondly hope that the instruction which may flow from this institution, kindly cherished, by advancing the minds of our youth with the growing science of the times, and elevating the views of our citizens generally to the practice of the social duties and the functions of self-government, may ensure to our country the reputation, the safety and prosperity, and all the other blessings which experience proves to result from the cultivation and improvement of the general mind.\n | source =-- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Board of Visitors Minutes (1821), ME 19:407\n | width  = 33%\n | align  = right\n}}\n\nHis dream was realized in 1819 with the founding of the [[University of Virginia]]. Upon its opening in 1825, it was then the first university to offer a full slate of elective courses to its students. Closely involved in the university until his death, Jefferson invited students and faculty of the school to his home; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] was among those students.\n\nOne of the largest construction projects to that time in [[North America]], the university was notable for being centered about a library rather than a church.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Jefferson did not include a campus chapel in his original plans.\n\nJefferson is widely recognized for his architectural planning of the [[University of Virginia]] and its grounds.  His innovative design was a powerful representation of his aspirations for both state sponsored education and an agrarian democracy in the new Republic.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} His educational idea of creating specialized units of learning is physically expressed in the configuration of his campus plan, which he called the \"[[The Lawn|Academical Village]].\" Individual academic units are designed as distinct structures, represented by Pavilions, facing a grassy quadrangle, with each Pavilion housing classroom, faculty office, and residences. Though unique, each is visually equal in importance, and they are linked together with a series of open-air arcades that are the front facades of student accommodations. Gardens and vegetable plots are placed behind surrounded by [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] walls, affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nJefferson's highly ordered site plan establishes an ensemble of buildings surrounding a central rectangular quadrangle, named The Lawn, which is lined on either side with the academic teaching units and their linking arcades. The quad is enclosed at one end with the library, the repository of knowledge, at the head of the table. The remaining side opposite the library remained open-ended for future growth. The lawn rises gradually as a series of stepped terraces, each a few feet higher than the last, rising up to the library, which was set in the most prominent position at the top.\n\nJefferson was a proponent of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] architectural styles, which he believed to be most representative of American democracy by historical association. These were popular during the federal period across the United States. Each academic unit is designed with a two-story temple front facing the quadrangle, while the library is modeled on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]]. The ensemble of buildings surrounding the quad is a statement of the importance of secular public education, while the exclusion of religious structures reinforces the principal of separation of church and state. The campus planning and architectural treatment is considered a paradigm of the ordering of man-made structures to express intellectual ideas and aspirations.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} A survey of members of the [[American Institute of Architects]] identified Jefferson's campus as the most significant work of architecture in America.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nThe University was designed as the capstone of the educational system of Virginia. In Jefferson's vision, any young white male citizen of the [[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|commonwealth]] could attend the school if he had the required ability and achievement as an earlier student.\n\n==Jefferson's views on education of citizens==\nJefferson was an advocate of public education. In a 1786 letter to [[George Wythe]], he remarked that \"the most important bill in our whole code, is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people.\"<ref name=TJGW1>Thomas Jefferson to George Wythe, 1786. ME 5:396</ref> He believed that \"no other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness\" and that failing to provide public education would \"leave the people in ignorance.\"<ref name=TJGW1/> But,  Jefferson did not believe in forcing parents to place their children in school, positing that \"it is better to tolerate the rare instance of a parent refusing to let his child be educated, than to shock the common feelings and ideas by the forcible asportation [removal] and education of the infant against the will of the father.\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson: Note to Elementary School Act, 1817. ME 17:423</ref>\n\n==Views on classical learning==\n\"For classical learning I have ever been a zealous advocate.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Cooper, 1814. ME 14:200\n\n\"When we advert that the ancient classical languages are considered as the foundation preparatory for all the sciences; that we have always had schools scattered over the country for teaching these languages, which often were the ultimate term of education; that these languages are entered on at the age of nine or ten years, at which age parents would be unwilling to send their children from every part of the State to a central and distant university, and when we observe that... there are to be a plurality of them, we may well conclude that the Greek and Latin are the objects of these colleges... and that they are intended as the portico of entry to the university.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Wilson C. Nicholas, 1816. ME 14:452\n\n\"To whom are these [classical languages] useful? Certainly not to all men. There are conditions of life to which they must be forever estranged, and there are epochs of life, too, after which the endeavor to attain them would be a great misemployment of time. Their acquisition should be the occupation of our early years only, when the memory is susceptible of deep and lasting impressions, and reason and judgment not yet strong enough for abstract speculations.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to John Brazier, 1819. ME 15:209\n\n\"[The Latin and Greek] languages... constitute the basis of good education, and are indispensable to fill up the character of a 'well-educated man.'\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson: Virginia Board of Visitors Minutes, 1824. ME 19:444\n\n\"[As to] the extent to which classical learning should be carried in our country... The utilities we derive from the remains of the Greek and Latin languages are, first, as models of pure taste in writing. To these we are certainly indebted for the rational and chaste style of modern composition which so much distinguishes the nations to whom these languages are familiar... Second. Among the values of classical learning, I estimate the luxury of reading the Greek and Roman authors in all the beauties of their originals. And why should not this innocent and elegant luxury take its preeminent stand ahead of all those addressed merely to the sense?... Third. A third value is in the stores of real science deposited and transmitted us in these languages, to wit: in history, ethics, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, natural history, etc.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to John Brazier, 1819. ME 15:208\n\n\"[Greece was] the first of civilized nations [which] presented example of what man should be.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to A. Coray, 1823. ME 15:481\n\n\"I think the Greeks and Romans have left us the present models which exist of fine composition, whether we examine them as works of reason, or of style and fancy; and to them we probably owe these characteristics of modern composition. I know of no composition of any other ancient people which merits the least regard as a model for its matter or style. To all this I add, that to read the Latin and Greek authors in their original is a sublime luxury; and I deem luxury in science to be at least as justifiable as in architecture, painting, gardening, or the other arts.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Joseph Priestley, 1800. ME 10:146\n\n\"It may be truly said that the classical languages are a solid basis for most, and an ornament to all the sciences.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to John Brazier, 1819. ME 15:211\n\n\"I make it a rule never to read translations where I can read the original.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Edmund Randolph, 1794.

ME 13:14\n\n\"I have not, however, carried so far as [some] do my ideas of the importance of a hypercritical knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages. I have believed it sufficient to possess a substantial understanding of their authors.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Cooper, 1814. ME 14:200\n\n== Views on textbooks ==\nJefferson was not opposed to textbooks, and believed that in most cases an individual professor, not school trustees, should be the one to choose which particular texts should be used in that professor's course. One exception would be a case in which a professor desired to teach using a text that advocated [[federalism]]. In such a case, Jefferson believed the trustees would be justified in overruling the professor in order \"to guard against such principles being disseminated among our youth.\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to -----, 1825. ME 16:103. \"In most public seminaries textbooks are prescribed to each of the several schools, as the norma docendi in that school; and this is generally done by authority of the trustees. I should not propose this generally in our University, because I believe none of us are so much at the heights of science in the several branches as to undertake this, and therefore that it will be better left to the professors until occasion of interference shall be given. But there is one branch in which we are the best judges, in which heresies may be taught of so interesting a character to our own State and to the United States, as to make it a duty in us to lay down the principles which are to be taught. It is that of government... [A new professor may be] one of that school of quondam federalism, now consolidation. It is our duty to guard against such principles being disseminated among our youth and the diffusion of that poison, by a previous prescription of the texts to be followed in their discourses.\"</ref>\n\n==Views on professors==\nJefferson was in favor of students learning from professors, and believed that professors should have \"the talent of communicating...knowledge with facility\".<ref>Thomas Jefferson to Dugald Stewart, 1824. ME 18:333</ref> In addition, Jefferson believed that professors should have a knowledge not just of their own profession, but \"should be otherwise well-educated as to the sciences generally; able to converse understandingly with the scientific men with whom he is associated, and to assist in the councils of the faculty on any subject of science on which they may have occasion to deliberate.\" A professor not so educated would \"incur...contempt, and bring disreputation on the institution.\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to Joseph C. Cabell, 1824. ME 16:6</ref> Jefferson was also in favor of selecting professors based on their political leanings.<ref>Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, 1826. ME 16:156. \"In the selection of our Law Professor, we must be rigorously attentive to his political principles... It is in our seminary that that vestal flame [of republicanism] is to be kept alive.\"</ref>\n\n==Views on structuring content==\n\"I hope the necessity will, at length, be seen of establishing institutions here, as in Europe, where every branch of science, useful at this day, may be taught in its highest degree.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, 1814.

Jefferson believed that libraries and books were so integral to individual and institutional education that he designed the university around its library.\n\nIn 1779 in \"A Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge,\" Jefferson proposed a system of public education to be tax-funded for 3 years for \"all the free children, male and female,\" which was an unusual perspective for the time period. They were allowed to attend longer if their parents, friends, or family could pay for it independently.\n\nIn his book ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785), Jefferson had scribed his ideas for public education at the elementary level.  In 1817 he proposed a plan for a system of limited state public education for males only, in keeping with the times.  It depended on public grammar schools, and further education of a limited number of the best students, and those whose parents wanted to pay for them. The university was to be the capstone, available to only the best selected students.  [[Virginia]] did not establish free public education in the primary grades until after the [[American Civil War]] under the [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction era]] legislature.\n\n== Jefferson's education ==\n[[File:Wren3.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Jefferson lodged and boarded in the [[Wren Building]] at The College of William & Mary.

At the age of nine, Jefferson began studying Latin, Greek, and French; he learned to ride horses, and began to appreciate the study of nature. He studied under the Reverend [[James Maury]] from 1758 to 1760 near [[Gordonsville, Virginia|Gordonsville]], Virginia. While boarding with Maury's family, he studied history, science and the classics.{{sfn|Peterson|1970|pp=7\u20139}}\n\nIn 1760 Jefferson entered [[The College of William & Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] at the age of 16; he studied there for two years. At William & Mary, he enrolled in the philosophy school and studied mathematics, [[metaphysics]], and philosophy under Professor [[William Small]], who introduced Jefferson to the writings of the [[empiricism|British Empiricists]], including [[John Locke]], [[Francis Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>Merrill D. Peterson, ''Thomas Jefferson: Writings'', p. 1236</ref> He also perfected his French, carried his Greek grammar book wherever he went, practiced the violin, and read [[Tacitus]] and [[Homer]].

He lodged and boarded at the College in the building known today as the Sir Christopher [[Wren Building]], attending communal meals in the Great Hall, and morning and evening prayers in the Wren Chapel. Jefferson often attended the lavish parties of royal governor [[Francis Fauquier]], where he played his violin and developed an early love for wines.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/books/chapters/1203-1st-hail.html John Hailman, \"Thomas Jefferson on Wine\"], ''New York Times'', 3 December 2006</ref> After graduation, he studied law with [[George Wythe]] and was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767.\n\n==Libraries==\n\nThroughout his life, Jefferson depended on books for his education. He collected and accumulated thousands of books for his library at Monticello. A significant portion of Jefferson's library was also bequeathed to him in the will of George Wythe, who had an extensive collection. Always eager for more knowledge, Jefferson continued learning throughout most of his life.

Jefferson's responses to Marbois' \"Queries\" would become known as ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1785). Scientifically trained, Jefferson was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], which had been founded in Philadelphia in 1743. He had extensive knowledge of western lands from Virginia to Illinois. In a course of 5 years, Jefferson enthusiastically devoted his intellectual energy to the book; he included a discussion of contemporary scientific knowledge, and Virginia's history, politics, and [[ethnography]]. Jefferson was aided by [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker]], [[George Rogers Clark|George R. Clark]], and U.S. geographer [[Thomas Hutchins]]. The book was first published in France in 1785 and in England in 1787.<ref>Shuffelton (1999, June 2001), ''Notes on the State of Virginia Thomas Jefferson'', Introduction</ref>\n\t\nIt has been ranked as the most important American book published before 1800. The book is Jefferson's vigorous and often eloquent argument about the nature of the good society, which he believed was incarnated by Virginia. In it he expressed his beliefs in the separation of church and state, constitutional government, checks and balances, and individual liberty. He also compiled extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy.\n\n==Presidency==\n{{further|Presidency of Thomas Jefferson}}\n\n===Military Academy at West Point===\n{{further|United States Military Academy}}\nIdeas for a national institution for military education were circulated during the American Revolution. It wasn't until 1802 when Jefferson, following the advice of George Washington, John Adams and others,{{sfn|McDonald|2004|p=194}} finally convinced Congress to authorize the funding and building of the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point on the Hudson River in New York. On March 16, 1802, Jefferson signed the Military Peace Establishment Act, directing that a corps of engineers be established and \"stationed at West Point in the state of New York, and shall constitute a Military Academy.\"<ref name=\"Monticello, West Point\">{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/united-states-military-academy-west-point |title=United States Military Academy at West Point|publisher=Monticello.org |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> The Act would provide well-trained officers for a professional army. The officers would be reliable republicans rather than a closed elite as in Europe, for the cadets were to be appointed by Congressmen, and thus exactly reflect the nation's politics. In May 1801 Secretary of War [[Henry Dearborn]] announced that the president had \"decided in favor of the immediate establishment of a military school at West Point and also on the appointment of Major Jonathan Williams\", grandnephew of Benjamin Franklin, to direct \"the necessary arrangements, at that place for the commencement of the school.\"{{sfn|McDonald|2004|pp=120-121}} On July 4, 1802, the US Military Academy at West Point formally commenced its role as an institution for scientific and military learning.<ref name=\"Monticello, West Point\"/>\n\n==Later years==\n\n=== Plan for systematic education===\nIn 1785, Jefferson proposed a system of public schools for the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] in the interest of \"diffus[ing] knowledge more generally through the mass of the people\".<ref name=NSV/> According to Jefferson, \"The ultimate result of the whole scheme of education would be the teaching all the children of the state reading, writing, and common arithmetic: turning out [several] annually of superior genius, well taught in Greek, Latin, geography, and the higher branches of arithmetic: turning out...others annually, of still superior parts, who, to those branches of learning, shall have added such of the sciences as their genius shall have led them to.\"<ref name=NSV/> As a byproduct, this plan would furnish \"to the wealthier part of the people convenient schools, at which their children may be educated, at their own expense.\"<ref name=NSV/>\n\nThe plan was for education of children in three successive stages corresponding with three types of schools: primary schools, which all children, regardless of their parents' financial ability, would be able to attend for at least three years; intermediate schools, for students who excelled in primary school, as well as for children whose parents are willing and able to pay for it; and the university, for students whose parents were willing to pay.<ref name=NSV/><ref>Thomas Jefferson to A.

The other half, \"chosen for the superiority of their parts and disposition,\" would continue studying three more years at the university, \"in the study of such sciences as they shall chuse\". Jefferson considered the university to be the capstone of the educational system. To accommodate the influx of students, Jefferson proposed that the [[College of William and Mary]] be enlarged \"and extended to all the useful sciences\".\n\n===Father of a university===\n:''Seen also: [[University of Virginia#History|History of the University of Virginia]]''\n[[File:Lawn.jpg|thumb|180px|The Lawn, University of Virginia]]\n\nAfter leaving the presidency, Jefferson continued to be active in public affairs. He also became increasingly concerned with founding a new institution of higher learning, specifically one free of church influences, where students could specialize in [[University of Virginia#History|many new areas]] not offered at other universities. Jefferson believed educating people was a good way to establish an organized society, and also felt schools should be paid for by the general public, so less wealthy people could obtain student membership as well.<ref>[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/jefferson/quotations/jeff1370.htm Jefferson on Politics & Government: Publicly Supported Education<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A letter to [[Joseph Priestley]], in January, 1800, indicated that he had been planning the University for decades before its establishment.\n\n{{Quote box\n | quote  = We fondly hope that the instruction which may flow from this institution, kindly cherished, by advancing the minds of our youth with the growing science of the times, and elevating the views of our citizens generally to the practice of the social duties and the functions of self-government, may ensure to our country the reputation, the safety and prosperity, and all the other blessings which experience proves to result from the cultivation and improvement of the general mind.\n | source =-- Thomas Jefferson, Virginia Board of Visitors Minutes (1821), ME 19:407\n | width  = 33%\n | align  = right\n}}\n\nHis dream was realized in 1819 with the founding of the [[University of Virginia]]. Upon its opening in 1825, it was then the first university to offer a full slate of elective courses to its students. Closely involved in the university until his death, Jefferson invited students and faculty of the school to his home; [[Edgar Allan Poe]] was among those students.\n\nOne of the largest construction projects to that time in [[North America]], the university was notable for being centered about a library rather than a church.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Jefferson did not include a campus chapel in his original plans.\n\nJefferson is widely recognized for his architectural planning of the [[University of Virginia]] and its grounds.  His innovative design was a powerful representation of his aspirations for both state sponsored education and an agrarian democracy in the new Republic.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} His educational idea of creating specialized units of learning is physically expressed in the configuration of his campus plan, which he called the \"[[The Lawn|Academical Village]].\" Individual academic units are designed as distinct structures, represented by Pavilions, facing a grassy quadrangle, with each Pavilion housing classroom, faculty office, and residences. Though unique, each is visually equal in importance, and they are linked together with a series of open-air arcades that are the front facades of student accommodations. Gardens and vegetable plots are placed behind surrounded by [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] walls, affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nJefferson's highly ordered site plan establishes an ensemble of buildings surrounding a central rectangular quadrangle, named The Lawn, which is lined on either side with the academic teaching units and their linking arcades. The quad is enclosed at one end with the library, the repository of knowledge, at the head of the table. The remaining side opposite the library remained open-ended for future growth. The lawn rises gradually as a series of stepped terraces, each a few feet higher than the last, rising up to the library, which was set in the most prominent position at the top.\n\nJefferson was a proponent of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] architectural styles, which he believed to be most representative of American democracy by historical association. These were popular during the federal period across the United States. Each academic unit is designed with a two-story temple front facing the quadrangle, while the library is modeled on the [[Pantheon, Rome|Roman Pantheon]]. The ensemble of buildings surrounding the quad is a statement of the importance of secular public education, while the exclusion of religious structures reinforces the principal of separation of church and state. The campus planning and architectural treatment is considered a paradigm of the ordering of man-made structures to express intellectual ideas and aspirations.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} A survey of members of the [[American Institute of Architects]] identified Jefferson's campus as the most significant work of architecture in America.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nThe University was designed as the capstone of the educational system of Virginia. In Jefferson's vision, any young white male citizen of the [[Commonwealth (United States)|commonwealth]] could attend the school if he had the required ability and achievement as an earlier student.\n\n==Jefferson's views on education of citizens==\nJefferson was an advocate of public education. In a 1786 letter to [[George Wythe]], he remarked that \"the most important bill in our whole code, is that for the diffusion of knowledge among the people.\"<ref name=TJGW1>Thomas Jefferson to George Wythe, 1786. ME 5:396</ref> He believed that \"no other sure foundation can be devised for the preservation of freedom and happiness\" and that failing to provide public education would \"leave the people in ignorance.\"<ref name=TJGW1/> But,  Jefferson did not believe in forcing parents to place their children in school, positing that \"it is better to tolerate the rare instance of a parent refusing to let his child be educated, than to shock the common feelings and ideas by the forcible asportation [removal] and education of the infant against the will of the father.\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson: Note to Elementary School Act, 1817. ME 17:423</ref>\n\n==Views on classical learning==\n\"For classical learning I have ever been a zealous advocate.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Cooper, 1814. ME 14:200\n\n\"When we advert that the ancient classical languages are considered as the foundation preparatory for all the sciences; that we have always had schools scattered over the country for teaching these languages, which often were the ultimate term of education; that these languages are entered on at the age of nine or ten years, at which age parents would be unwilling to send their children from every part of the State to a central and distant university, and when we observe that... there are to be a plurality of them, we may well conclude that the Greek and Latin are the objects of these colleges... and that they are intended as the portico of entry to the university.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Wilson C. Nicholas, 1816. ME 14:452\n\n\"To whom are these [classical languages] useful? Certainly not to all men. There are conditions of life to which they must be forever estranged, and there are epochs of life, too, after which the endeavor to attain them would be a great misemployment of time. Their acquisition should be the occupation of our early years only, when the memory is susceptible of deep and lasting impressions, and reason and judgment not yet strong enough for abstract speculations.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to John Brazier, 1819. ME 15:209\n\n\"[The Latin and Greek] languages... constitute the basis of good education, and are indispensable to fill up the character of a 'well-educated man.'\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson: Virginia Board of Visitors Minutes, 1824. ME 19:444\n\n\"[As to] the extent to which classical learning should be carried in our country... The utilities we derive from the remains of the Greek and Latin languages are, first, as models of pure taste in writing. To these we are certainly indebted for the rational and chaste style of modern composition which so much distinguishes the nations to whom these languages are familiar... Second. Among the values of classical learning, I estimate the luxury of reading the Greek and Roman authors in all the beauties of their originals. And why should not this innocent and elegant luxury take its preeminent stand ahead of all those addressed merely to the sense?... Third. A third value is in the stores of real science deposited and transmitted us in these languages, to wit: in history, ethics, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, natural history, etc.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to John Brazier, 1819. ME 15:208\n\n\"[Greece was] the first of civilized nations [which] presented example of what man should be.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to A. Coray, 1823. ME 15:481\n\n\"I think the Greeks and Romans have left us the present models which exist of fine composition, whether we examine them as works of reason, or of style and fancy; and to them we probably owe these characteristics of modern composition. I know of no composition of any other ancient people which merits the least regard as a model for its matter or style. To all this I add, that to read the Latin and Greek authors in their original is a sublime luxury; and I deem luxury in science to be at least as justifiable as in architecture, painting, gardening, or the other arts.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Joseph Priestley, 1800. ME 10:146\n\n\"It may be truly said that the classical languages are a solid basis for most, and an ornament to all the sciences.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to John Brazier, 1819. ME 15:211\n\n\"I make it a rule never to read translations where I can read the original.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Edmund Randolph, 1794. ME 9:280\n\n\"Indeed, no translation can be [an adequate representation of the excellences of the original].\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to [[A. L. C. Destutt de Tracy]], 1811. ME 13:14\n\n\"I have not, however, carried so far as [some] do my ideas of the importance of a hypercritical knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages. I have believed it sufficient to possess a substantial understanding of their authors.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Cooper, 1814. ME 14:200\n\n== Views on textbooks ==\nJefferson was not opposed to textbooks, and believed that in most cases an individual professor, not school trustees, should be the one to choose which particular texts should be used in that professor's course. One exception would be a case in which a professor desired to teach using a text that advocated [[federalism]]. In such a case, Jefferson believed the trustees would be justified in overruling the professor in order \"to guard against such principles being disseminated among our youth.\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to -----, 1825. ME 16:103. \"In most public seminaries textbooks are prescribed to each of the several schools, as the norma docendi in that school; and this is generally done by authority of the trustees. I should not propose this generally in our University, because I believe none of us are so much at the heights of science in the several branches as to undertake this, and therefore that it will be better left to the professors until occasion of interference shall be given. But there is one branch in which we are the best judges, in which heresies may be taught of so interesting a character to our own State and to the United States, as to make it a duty in us to lay down the principles which are to be taught. It is that of government... [A new professor may be] one of that school of quondam federalism, now consolidation. It is our duty to guard against such principles being disseminated among our youth and the diffusion of that poison, by a previous prescription of the texts to be followed in their discourses.\"</ref>\n\n==Views on professors==\nJefferson was in favor of students learning from professors, and believed that professors should have \"the talent of communicating...knowledge with facility\".<ref>Thomas Jefferson to Dugald Stewart, 1824. ME 18:333</ref> In addition, Jefferson believed that professors should have a knowledge not just of their own profession, but \"should be otherwise well-educated as to the sciences generally; able to converse understandingly with the scientific men with whom he is associated, and to assist in the councils of the faculty on any subject of science on which they may have occasion to deliberate.\" A professor not so educated would \"incur...contempt, and bring disreputation on the institution.\"<ref>Thomas Jefferson to Joseph C. Cabell, 1824. ME 16:6</ref> Jefferson was also in favor of selecting professors based on their political leanings.<ref>Thomas Jefferson to James Madison, 1826.

It is in our seminary that that vestal flame [of republicanism] is to be kept alive.\"</ref>\n\n==Views on structuring content==\n\"I hope the necessity will, at length, be seen of establishing institutions here, as in Europe, where every branch of science, useful at this day, may be taught in its highest degree.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to John Adams, 1814. ME 14:151\n\n\"What are the objects of an useful American [college] education?

ME 15:265\n\n\"Agriculture... is a science of the very first order. It counts among its handmaids the most respectable sciences, such as Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mechanics, Mathematics generally, Natural History, Botany. In every College and University, a professorship of agriculture, and the class of its students, might be honored as the first.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to David Williams, 1803. ME 10:429\n\n\"In my view, no knowledge can be more satisfactory to a man than that of his own frame, its parts, their functions and actions. And Botany I rank with the most valuable sciences, whether we consider its subjects as furnishing the principal subsistence of life to man and beast, delicious varieties for our tables, refreshments from our orchards, the adornments of our flower-borders, shade and perfume of our groves, materials for our buildings, or medicaments for our bodies. To the gentleman it is certainly more interesting than Mineralogy (which I by no means, however, undervalue), and is more at hand for his amusement; and to a country family it constitutes a great portion of their social entertainment. No country gentleman should be without what amuses every step he takes into his fields.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Thomas Cooper, 1814. ME 14:201\n\n\"In the [elementary schools] will be taught reading, writing, common arithmetic, and general notions of geography.

ME 15:155\n\n\"I am not fully informed of the practices at Harvard, but there is one from which we shall certainly vary, although it has been copied, I believe, by nearly every college and academy in the United States. That is, the holding the students all to one prescribed course of reading, and disallowing exclusive application to those branches only which are to qualify them for the particular vocations to which they are destined. We shall, on the contrary, allow them uncontrolled choice in the lectures they shall choose to attend, and require elementary qualification only, and sufficient age.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to George Ticknor, 1823.

When this poison infects the mind, it destroys its tone and revolts it against wholesome reading. Reason and fact, plain and unadorned, are rejected. Nothing can engage attention unless dressed in all the figments of fancy, and nothing so bedecked comes amiss. The result is a bloated imagination, sickly judgment, and disgust towards all the real businesses of life. This mass of trash, however, is not without some distinction; some few modeling their narratives, although fictitious, on the incidents of real life, have been able to make them interesting and useful vehicles of a sound morality... For a like reason, too, much poetry should not be indulged. Some is useful for forming style and taste. Pope, Dryden, Thompson, Shakespeare, and of the French, Moliere, Racine, the Corneilles, may be read with pleasure and improvement.\"\u2014Thomas Jefferson to Nathaniel Burwell, 1818.
