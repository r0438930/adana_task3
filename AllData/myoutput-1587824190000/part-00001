The qibla is the direction of the building of [[Ka'bah]] in the [[Great Mosque|Sacred Mosque]], [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia, which Muslims believe to be a sacred site built by the prophets [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]. According to the Islamic belief, this direction was ordained by God in the Quran, in chapter [[Al-Baqarah]] verses 144, 149, and 150, revealed to Muhammad in the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]]; prior to this revelation Muhammad and his followers in [[Medina]] faced [[Jerusalem]] for prayers. Other than for the ritual prayer, it is also the direction for entering the state of [[ihram]] for the [[hajj]] pilgrimage, where animals are turned to in an [[dhabihah|Islamic slaughter]], for the dead when buried, the recommended direction to make [[dua|supplications]], and the avoided direction when relieving nature and spitting. Most mosque contains a ''[[mihrab]]'' or a wall niche indicating the direction of the qibla. In practice, there are two manners of observing the qibla: ''ayn al-ka'bah'' which faces the Ka'ba exactly, and ''jihat al-ka'bah'' which faces only its general direction. Most Islamic authorities believe that the more precise ''ayn al-ka'bah'' is only required when possible (for example, inside the Sacred Mosque or in its surroundings), and otherwise ''jihat al-ka'bah'' can be used.\n\nThe most common technical definition used by Muslim astronomers is the direction shown by the [[great circle]]\u2014in the [[Spherical Earth|Earth's sphere]]\u2014passing through the Ka'bah and one's location. This direction shows the shortest possible path from one's place to Ka'bah, and allows for the exact calculation (''hisab'') of the qibla using a [[spherical trigonometry|spherical trigonometric]] formula taking the coordinates of one's place and the Ka'bah as inputs.  The method is applied to develop [[Mobile app|mobile applications]] and websites for Muslims, and to compile qibla tables used in instruments such as the [[qibla compass]]. In addition, the qibla can also be determined by observing the shadow of a vertical rod at or around two times of the year when the sun is directly overhead in Mecca\u2014on 28 May at 12:18 [[Saudi Arabia Standard Time]] or 9:18 UTC and on 16 July at 12:27 SAST/9:27 UTC).\n\nBefore the development of astronomy in the Islamic world, Muslims used traditional methods to determine the qibla; these includes following the customs of the [[companions of the Prophet]] in one's place, using the setting and rising points of celestial objects, the direction of the wind, or using due south\u2014Muhammad's qibla in Medina\u2014everywhere. Early Islamic astronomy were built on its Indian and Greek counterparts\u2014especially the works of [[Ptolemy]], and soon Muslim astronomers developed methods to calculate approximate directions of the qibla, starting from mid-9th century. In the late 9th century and in the 10th century, Muslim astronomers developed methods to find the exact direction of the qibla that are equivalent to the modern formula. Initially, this \"qibla of the astronomers\" were used alongside various traditionally determined qiblas, resulting in a diversity of qiblas in medieval Muslim cities. In addition, the accurate geographic data necessary for the astronomical methods to yield an accurate result were only available in the 18th and 19th centuries, resulting in further diversity of the qibla. Historical mosques with differing qiblas still stand today throughout the Islamic world. The spaceflight of a devout Muslim [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] on October 2007 generated a discussion with regards to qibla from the outer space. On Sheikh Muszaphar's request, the Islamic authority of his home country Malaysia issued a detailed guidance, suggesting a determination \"based on what is possible\" for the astronaut, in line with recommendations from other Islamic scholars.\n\n==Location==\n{{main|Ka'bah|al-Masjid al-Haram}}\n{{Location map+|Middle East2| relief = yes |float=right|caption=Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem|places=\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=21.4228714|long=39.823546 |label=[[Mecca]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=24.4672105|long=39.6089423|label=[[Medina]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=31.7760692|long=35.2335915|label=[[Jerusalem]]}}\n}}\nThe qibla is the direction of the [[Ka'bah]], a cube-like building at the centre of the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Mosque]] (''al-Masjid al-Haram'') in Mecca, in the [[Hejaz]] region of Saudi Arabia. Other than its role as qibla, it is a [[Holiest sites in Islam|sacred site]] for Muslims, known as the House of God (''Bait Allah'') and where the [[tawaf]] is performed during the [[hajj]] and [[umra]] pilgrimages. The Ka'bah has an approximately rectangular ground plan with its four corners pointing close to the four [[cardinal direction]]s.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=317}} According to the [[Quran]], it was built by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]]\u2014both are prophets in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}} Not much historical records remain about the history of the Ka'bah prior to the rise of Islam, but in the generations before [[Muhammad]], the building had been used as a shrine of the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabic religion]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}}\n\nThe religious status of Ka'bah (or the Sacred Mosque in which it is located) as the qibla is based on the verses 144, 149, and 150 of the Quran's chapter of [[Surat al-Baqara|al-Baqarah]], each of which contains a command to \"turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque\" (''fawalli wajhaka shatr al-Masjid il-Haram'').{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=97\u201398}} According to the Islamic tradition, these verses were revealed on the month of [[Rajab]] or [[Shaban]] on the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]] (624 [[Common Era|CE]]), or about 15 or 16 months after Muhammad's [[Hegira|migration to Medina]].{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=104}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Prior to these revelations, Muhammad and the Muslims in Medina had prayed toward [[Jerusalem]] as qibla, the same direction [[Mizrah|used]] by the Jews of Medina for their prayers. Islamic traditions say that these verses were revealed during a prayer congregation; Muhammad and his followers immediately turned their directions from Jerusalem to Mecca in the middle of the prayer ritual. The location of this event now becomes [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] (\"the Mosque of the Two Qiblas\").{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nThere are different reports about the qibla direction when Muhammad was in Mecca (before his migration to Medina). According to one report, cited by historian [[al-Tabari]] and exegete [[al-Baydawi]], Muhammad prayed towards the Ka'bah. Another report, cited by [[al-Baladhuri]] and also by al-Tabari, says that Muhammad prayed towards Jerusalem while in Mecca. Another report, mentioned by [[Ibn Hisham]]'s [[Prophetic biography|biography of Muhammad]], says that Muhammad prayed in such a way as to simultaneously face the Ka'bah and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Today Muslims of all branches, including the Sunni and the Shia, all toward the Ka'bah. Historically, one major exception was the [[Qarmatians]], a now-defunct syncretic Shia sect which rejected the Ka'bah as the qibla; in 930, they sacked Mecca, took Ka'bah's [[Black Stone]] to their centre of power in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]], with the intention of starting a new era in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=321}}{{sfn|Daftary|2007|p=149}}{{efn|This act was condemned both by the Sunni [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] and the Shia [[Fatimid caliphate|Fatimid one]].

In a congregational prayer, the [[imam]] (worship leader) stands in it or close to it, in front of the rest of the congregation.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}} The ''mihrab'' started became part of a mosque during the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad period]] and its form is standardised during the [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid period]]; before that, the qibla of a mosque is known from the orientation of one of its walls, called the qibla wall. The term ''mihrab'' itself is only attested once in the Quran, but it refers to a place of prayer of the [[Israelites]] rather than a part of a mosque.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}}{{efn|This reference occurs in {{Cite Quran|19|11|style=nosup}}}}  The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]], Egypt, one of the oldest mosques, is known to have been originally built without a ''mihrab'', even though now one has been added.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=4}}\n\n===''Ayn al-ka'bah'' and ''jihat al-ka'bah''===\n''Ayn al-ka'bah'' is facing the qibla so that an imaginary line extending from the person's line of sight would pass through the Ka'bah. This manner of observing the qibla is easily done inside the Great Mosque of Mecca and its surroundings, but given that the Ka'bah is less than {{conv|20|m|ft}} wide, this is virtually impossible from further locations.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=104\u2013105}} For example, from Medina\u2014with a {{conv|338|km|mi}} straight-line distance from the Ka'bah\u2014a 1\u00b0 deviation from the precise imaginary line\u2014an error hardly noticeable when setting one's prayer mat or assuming one's posture\u2014results in some {{convert|5.9|km|mi}} shift from the site of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=137}} This effect is amplified when further than Mecca:{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=134}} from [[Jakarta]], Indonesia\u2014some {{conv|7900|km|mi}} away, a 1\u00b0 deviation causes more than {{conv|100|km|mi}} shift, and even an [[arc second]]'s deviation\u2014{{nowrap|({{frac|1|3600}} of a degree)}}\u2014 causes more than {{conv|100|m|ft}} of shift from the location of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} In comparison, the construction process of a mosque can easily introduce up to 5\u00b0 error from the calculated qibla, and the installation of prayer rugs inside the mosque as indicators for worshippers can add up to a further 5\u00b0 deviation from the mosque's orientation.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}\n\nA minority of Islamic religious scholars\u2014for example [[Ibn Arabi]]\u2014considers ''ayn al-ka'bah'' to be obligatory during the ritual prayer, while others consider it only obligatory when one is able. For locations further than Mecca, scholars such as [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Al-Qurtubi]] argue that it is permissible to assume ''jihat al-ka'bah'', facing only the general direction of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=92, 95}}  Some further argues that the ritual condition of facing the qibla is already fulfilled simply when the imaginary line to the Ka'bah is within one's field of vision.{{sfn|King|1996|p=134}} Therefore, for instance, there are legal opinions that accept the entire southeastern quadrant in [[Al-Andalus]] (historical Spain and Portugal), and the southwestern quadrant in [[Central Asia]], to be valid qibla.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}} Arguments for the validity of ''jihat al-Ka'bah'' include the wording of the Quran which only commands Muslims to \"turn [one's] face\" toward the Great Mosque, and to avoid the impossible requirement which would result if ''ayn al-Ka'bah'' were to be obligatory in all places.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=95}} The [[Shafi'i school]] of Islamic law, as codified in [[Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi]]'s ''Kitab al-Tanbih fi'l-Fiqh'', argues that one must follow the qibla indicated by the local mosque when one is not near Mecca or, when not near a mosque, ask a trustworthy person.

For example, all lines of [[longitude]] are great circles of the Earth, while the [[equator]] is the only line of [[latitude]] that is also a great circle (other lines of latitude are centered north or south of the centre of the Earth).{{sfn|Abo-Zahhad|Ahmed|Mourad|2013|p=172}} One of the properties of a great circle is that it indicates the shortest path connecting any pair of points along the circle\u2014this is the basis of its use to determine the qibla. The great circle is similarly used to find the shortest flight path connecting two locations\u2014therefore the qibla calculated using the great circle method is generally close to the direction of a direct flight from the locality to Mecca.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} As the [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] is a more accurate [[figure of the Earth]] than a perfect sphere, modern researchers have looked into using ellipsoidal models to calculate the qibla, replacing the great circle by the [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]]. This results in greatly more complicated calculations, while the improvement in accuracy falls well within the typical precision of the setting out of a mosque or the placement of a mat.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|pp=132\u2013134}} For example, calculations using the [[Geodetic Reference System 1980|GRS 80]] ellipsoidal model yields the qibla of 18\u00b047\u203206\u2033 for a location in [[San Francisco]] while the great circle method yields 18\u00b051\u203205\u2033.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=35}}\n\n=== Calculations with spherical trigonometry ===\nThe great circle model is applied to calculate the qibla using [[spherical trigonometry]]\u2014a branch of [[geometry]] that deals with the mathematical relations between the sides and angles of triangles formed by three great circles of a sphere (as opposed to the conventional [[trigonometry]] which deals with those of a two-dimensional triangle). In the following figure, a location <math>O</math>, the Ka'bah <math>Q</math>, and the north pole <math>N</math> form a triangle on the sphere of the earth.

At this point, any vertical rod would cast a shadow oriented in the north\u2013south direction. The result of this observation is very accurate but it requires an accurate determination of the local time of culmination as well as making the observation at that exact moment.{{sfn|Ilyas|1984|pp=171\u2013172}} Another common method is using the compass, which is more practical because it can be done at any time; the disadvantage is that the north indicated by a magnetic compass differs from the true north.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}{{sfn|Ilyas|1984|p=172}} This [[magnetic declination]] can measure up to 20\u00b0, varies in different places on Earth and [[polar wandering|changes over time]].{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}\n\n=== Shadow observation ===\n[[File:Direction of qibla using shadow.svg|thumb|left|Twice a year, the sun passes directly above the Ka'ba, allowing the observation of its direction from the shadow of a vertical rod.]]\nAs observed from Earth, the sun appears to \"[[Sun path|shift]]\" between the [[Tropic of Cancer|Northern]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Southern]] Tropics seasonally; additionally, it [[Diurnal motion|appears to move]] from east to west daily as a consequence of the earth's rotation.

Such directions were used by some Muslims in the following centuries, side by side with other directions, even after Muslim astronomers used calculations to find more accurate directions to Mecca. Directions described as the qiblas of the companions include due south in Syria and Palestine,{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}} the direction of the winter sunrise in Egypt, and the direction of the winter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} The direction of the winter sunrise and sunset are also traditionally favoured because they are parallel to the walls of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132, also figure 4.2 in p. 131}}\n\n== Development of methods ==\n=== Pre-astronomy ===\nThe determination of qibla is an important problems for Muslim communities throughout history. Muslims are required to know the qibla in order to perform their daily prayers, and it is also needed to determine the orientation of mosques.{{sfn|King|1996|p=128}} When Muhammad lived among the Muslims in Medina (which, like Mecca, is also in the [[Hejaz]] region), he prayed due south, according to the known direction of Mecca. Within the few generations after Muhammad's death in 632, Muslims have reached places far away from Mecca, presenting the problem of determining the qibla in new places.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013132}} Mathematical methods based on astronomy would only develop at the end of the eighth century or the beginning of the ninth and even then they were not initially popular. Therefore, early Muslims relied on non-astronomical methods.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nThere is a wide range of traditional methods in determining the qibla in the early Islamic period, resulting in different directions even from the same place. In addition to due south (used because it was the direction to which Muhammad prayed from Medina) and directions known as the qiblas of the companions (varies by place), the Arabs also knew a form of \"folk\" astronomy\u2014called so by [[David A. King (historian)|David A. King]] to distinguish it from conventional astronomy which is an exact science\u2014originating from pre-Islamic traditions.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} It used natural phenomenon, including the observation of the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and wind, without any basis in mathematics. These methods yields specific directions in individual localities, often using the fixed setting and rising points of a specific star, the sunrise or sunset at the [[equinoxes]] or at the [[summer solstice|summer]] or the [[winter solstice]]s.{{sfn|King|1996|p=133}} Such qibla directions recorded in historical sources include: sunrise at the equinoxes (due west) in [[the Maghreb]], sunset at the equinoxes (due east) in India, the origin of the [[north wind]] or the fixed location of the [[North Star]] in Yemen, the rising point of the star ''Suhayl'' ([[Canopus]]) in Syria, and the midwinter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=133}} Such directions appear in texts of ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence) and texts of folk astronomy. Astronomers (aside from folk astronomers) typically do not comment on these methods, but they were not opposed by Islamic legal scholars.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132\u2013133}} The traditional directions were still in use when mathematical methods later developed and found different directions to Mecca, and they still appear in some surviving medieval mosques today.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\n=== With astronomy ===\n[[File:Al-Khalili qibla table, Damascus copy 15th-16th century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A portion of the qibla table compiled by the astronomer and ''[[muwaqqit]]'' [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] of [[Damascus]] in the fourteenth-century CE. The qibla directions are listed in the Arabic [[sexagesimal]] notation.]]\nThe study of astronomy\u2014known as ''ilm al-falaq'' in the Islamic intellectual tradition\u2014began to appear in the Islamic World in the second half of the eighth century, centered in [[Baghdad]], the principal city of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Initially, the science was introduced through the works if Indian authors, but since the ninth century the works of Greek astronomers such as [[Ptolemy]] were translated to Arabic and became the main reference in the field.{{sfn|Morelon|1996b|p=20\u201321}} Muslim astronomers preferred Greek astronomy because they consider it to be better supported by theoretical explanations and therefore can be developed as an exact science; however, the influence of Indian astronomy survives especially on the compilation of astronomical tables.{{sfn|Morelon|1996b|p=21}} This new science is applied to develop new methods of determining the qibla, making use of the concept of [[Latitude|latitudes]] and [[Longitude|longitudes]] introduced in Ptolemy's ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' as well as trigonometric formulae developed by Muslim scholars.{{sfn|King|1996|p=141}} Most textbooks of astronomy written in the medieval Islamic World contain a chapter on the determination of qibla, considered one of the many things connecting astronomy with the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] (''sharia'').{{sfn|King|1986|p=83}}{{sfn|Morelon|1996a|p=15}} According to David A. King, various medieval solutions for the determination of qibla \"bear witness to the development of mathematical methods from the 3rd/9th to the 8th/14th centuries and to the level of sophistication in trigonometry and computational techniques attained by these scholars.\"{{sfn|King|1986|p=83}}\n\nThe first mathematical methods developed in the early ninth century were approximate solutions to the mathematical problem, usually using a flat map or two-dimensional geometry. Because in reality the earth is spherical, the directions found were not exact, but they were sufficient for locations relatively close to Mecca (including as far as Egypt and Iran) because the errors were only less than 2\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=142-143}}\n\nExact solutions based on three-dimensional geometry and spherical trigometry began to appear in middle of 9th century. [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi|Habash al-Hasib]] (fl. c. 850 M in Baghdad and Damascus) wrote an early example of such solutions, using an \"[[Orthographic projection|analemma]]\", or a two-dimensional procedure to derive formulas in spherical trigonometry. His procedure involves working with a circle and a series of points and lines drawn in a specific manner to find a direction now known to be equivalent to the solution obtained from the modern formula.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}{{efn|The details of this method and its proof are provided in {{harvnb|King|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}}} Another group of solution uses trigonometric formulas, for example [[Al-Nayrizi]] from Baghdad (fl. c. 900) developed a mathematical procedure using a four-step application of [[Menelaus's theorem]].{{sfn|King|1996|pp=145\u2013146}}{{efn|The details of this method and its proof are provided in {{harvnb|King|1996|pp=145\u2013146}}}} Subsequent scholars, including Ibn Yunus, Abu al-Wafa, Ibn al-Haitham and Al-Biruni, proposers other methods which are confirmed to be accurate from the viewpoint of modern astronomy, using either analemmas or direct application of formulas.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}\n\nMuslim astronomers subsequently used these methods to compile tables showing qibla from a list of locations, grouped by their latitude and longitude differences from Mecca. The oldest known example was written in Baghdad ca. 9th century CE containing entries for each degrees and [[arc minute]]s up to 20\u00b0.{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}} In the fourteenth century, [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]], an astronomer who serves as a ''[[muwaqqit]]'' (timekeeper) in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of Damascus, compiled a table of qibla for 2,880 coordinates with longitude difference of up to 60\u00b0 from Mecca, and with latitudes ranging from 10\u00b0 to 50\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}} King opined that among the medieval qibla tables, al-Khalili's work is \"the most impressive from the view of its scope and its accuracy\".{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}}\n\nThe accuracy of applying these methods to actual locations depend on the accuracy of its input parameters\u2014the local latitude and the latitude of Mecca, and the longitude difference. At the time of the development of these methods, the latitude of a location can be determined to several arc minutes' accuracy, but there was no accurate method to determine a location's longitude.{{sfn|King|1996|p=153}} Common approximate methods used to determine the longitude difference include comparing the local timing of [[lunar eclipse]] versus the timing in Mecca, or measuring the distance of caravan routes;{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|King|1986|p=86}} the Central Asian scholar Al-Biruni made his estimate by averaging various approximate methods.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}} Because the longitude inaccuracy, medieval qibla calculations (including those using mathematically accurate methods) differ from the modern values. For example, while the [[Al-Azhar Mosque]] in Cairo was built using the \"qibla of the astronomers\", but the mosque's qibla (127\u00b0) somewhat differs from the result of modern calculations (135\u00b0) because the longitude difference used was off by 3\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nAccurate longitude values in the Islamic world were only available after the application of [[cartography|cartographic]] [[surveying|surveys]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Modern coordinates, along with new technologies such as [[GPS satellite]]s and electronic instruments, resulted in the development of practical instruments to calculate the qibla.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}} Qibla found using modern instruments might differ from the direction of mosques, because a mosque might be built before the advent of modern data, and orientation inaccuracies might have been introduced during the building process of modern mosques.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}} When this is known, sometimes the direction of the mosque's ''mihrab'' is still observers, and sometimes a marker is added (such as lines drawn in the mosque) that can be followed instead of the ''mihrab''.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}}\n\n== Instruments ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = QiblaMat.jpg\n | image2 = Turkish and Islamic Museum 0951.jpg\n | footer = A [[prayer mat]] with a modern [[qibla compass]] (''left''); an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman-era]] qibla compass dated 1738 (''right'').}}\nMuslims use various instrument to find the qibla when not near a mosque. The [[qibla compass]] is a magnetic compass which include a table or a list of qibla angle from major settlements. An electronic version could use satellite coordinates in order to calculate and indicate the qibla automatically.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}} Qibla compasses have existed since around 1300, supplemented by the list of qibla angles often written on the instruments themselves.{{sfn|King|2004|p=171}} Hotel rooms with Muslim guests may use a sticker showing the qibla on the ceiling or a drawer.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} With the advent of computing, various [[mobile app]]s and websites use formulae to calculate the qibla for their users.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|MacGregor|2018|p=130}}\n\n==Diversity ==\n=== Early Islamic world===\n[[File:Mosques in Cairo showing different direction.png|thumb|left|A map of parts of Cairo showing mosques with different qiblas.]]\nBecause varying methods have been used to determine the qibla, mosques are built throughout history in different directions, including some mosques that still stand today.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=29}} Methods based on astronomy and mathematics were not always used,{{sfn|King|2004|p=175}} and the same determination method can yield different qibla due to difference in the accuracy of data and calculation.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=32}} Egyptian historian [[Al-Maqrizi]] (d. 1442) recorded various qibla used in Cairo of his time: 90\u00b0 (due east), 117\u00b0 (winter sunrise, \"qibla of the sahaba\"), 127\u00b0 (calculated by astronomers, such as [[Ibn Yunus]]), 141\u00b0 ([[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]]), 156\u00b0 (the rising point of Suhayl/Canopus), 180\u00b0 (due south, emulating the qibla of Muhammad in Medina), and 204\u00b0 (the setting point of Canopus). The modern qibla for Cairo is 135\u00b0, which was not known at the time.{{sfn|King|2004|pp=175\u2013176}} This diversity also result in the non-uniform layout in Cairo's districts, because the streets are often oriented according to the orientation of the mosques. Muslim historical records also indicate the diversity of qibla in other major cities, including [[Cordoba, Spain|Cordoba]] (113\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 150\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 were recorded in the 12th century) and [[Samarkand]] (180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 230\u00b0, 240\u00b0, and 270\u00b0 were recorded in the 11th century).{{sfn|King|2004|pp=175\u2013176}} According to the doctrine of ''jihat al-ka'bah'', the diverse directions of qibla are still valid as long as they are still in the same broad direction.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:01 05 Street WDC 8jul05.jpg|thumb|The [[Islamic Center of Washington]] (founded 1953), one of the early mosques in the United States, the qibla of which faces northeast in line with astronomical calculations.{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} ]]\nPlaces long settled by Muslim populations tend to have resolved the question of the direction of qibla over time. Other places, like the United States and Canada, have only had large Muslim communities in the past several decades, and the determination of qibla can be a matter of debate.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} The [[Islamic Center of Washington|Islamic Center of Washington, D.C.]] was built in 1953 facing slightly north of east and initially puzzled some observers, including Muslims, because [[Washington, D.C.]]'s latitude is 17\u00b030\u2032 more northerly than that of Mecca. Even though line drawn on world maps\u2014such as those using the Mercator projection\u2014would suggest a southeastern direction to Mecca, astronomical calculations using the great circle method do yield a north-of-east direction (56\u00b033\u2032).{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} Nevertheless, most early mosques in the United States face east or southeast, following the apparent direction in world maps.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} As the Muslim community grew and the number of mosque increased, in 1978 an American Muslim scientist S. Kamal Abdali, wrote an article arguing that the correct qibla from North America was north or northeast as calculated by the great circle method, which identifies the shortest path to Mecca.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=54\u201355}}{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Abdali's conclusion was widely circulated and then  accepted by the Muslim community, and mosques were subsequently reoriented as a result.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} In 1990, two religious scholars Riad Nachef and Samir Kadi published a book arguing for a southeastern qibla, writing that the north/northeast qibla was invalid and resulted from a lack of religious knowledge.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} The two opinions resulted in a period of debate about the correct qibla,{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}} and eventually most North American Muslims accepted the north/northeast qibla with a minority following the east/southeast qibla.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=57}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nVariation of the qibla also occurs in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest world Muslim population. The astronomically calculated qibla ranges from 291\u00b0\u2014295\u00b0 (21\u00b0\u201425\u00b0 north of west) depending on the exact location in the archipelago.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=59\u201360}} However, the qibla is often traditionally known as simply 'the west', resulting in mosques built oriented due west or to the direction of sunset\u2014which slightly varies throughout the year. Different opinions exist among Indonesian Islamic astronomers: Tono Saksono ''et al.'' argues that facing the qibla during prayers is more of a \"spiritual prerequisite\" than a precise physical one, and that an exact direction to the Ka'bah itself from thousands of kilometres away requires an extreme precision impossible to achieve when building a mosque or when standing for prayers.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} On the other hands, Muhammad Hadi Bashori opined that \"correcting the qibla is indeed a very urgent thing,\" and can be guided by simple methods such as observing the shadow.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=60\u201361}} In the history of the region, disputes about the qibla has also occurred in the then-[[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1890s. When the Indonesian scholar and future founder of [[Muhammadiyah]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] returned from his Islamic and astronomy studies in Mecca he found that mosques in the royal capital of [[Yogyakarta]] had inaccurate qiblas, including the [[Kauman Great Mosque]] which faced due west. His efforts in adjusting the qibla was opposed by the traditional ulama of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], and a new mosque built by Dahlan using his calculations was demolished by a mob. Dahlan rebuilt his mosque in the 1900s and later the Kauman Great Mosque too would be reoriented using the astronomically calculated qibla.{{sfn|Kersten|2017|p=130}}{{sfn|Nashir|2015|p=77}}\n\n=== Outer space ===\n[[File:ISS Aug2005.jpg|thumb|The spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] started discussion about Islamic religious practices in space, including the determination of qibla.]]\nThe issue of qibla from outer space publicly arose before the spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]], a Malaysian surgeon who is a devout Muslim, to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) on October 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} The ISS orbits the earth in high speed so that the direction to Mecca changes significantly in matters of seconds.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before his departure, Sheikh Muzsaphar requested guidance from Malaysian religious authorities about the performance of Islamic practices in space, including how to pray, fast, and determine the qibla. In its response, the Malaysian National Fatwa Council recommended four options in regard to the qibla, in order of priority: 1) the Ka'bah itself 2) the projection of the Ka'bah into space 3) the Earth 4) \"wherever\".{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} The authors of the fatwa intended that it will also be used as guidelines for future Muslim astronauts, and it has been translated into multiple languages.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} In line with the Malaysian fatwa council, other Muslim scholars argue for the importance of flexibility and adapting the qibla requirement to what an astronaut is capable of fulfilling. Khaleel Muhammad of the [[San Diego State University]] opined \"God does not take a person to task for that which is beyond his/her ability to work with\" and Abdali argued that concentration during a prayer is more important than the exact orientation, and suggest keeping the qibla direction at the start of a prayer instead of \"worrying about possible changes in position\".{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before Sheikh Muszaphar's mission, at least eight Muslims had flown to space, but none of them publicly discussed issues relating to worship in space.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=109}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Black Stone]]\n*[[Craig retroazimuthal projection]]\n*[[Haram (site)#Holy site|Holy site]]\n**[[Holiest sites in Islam]]\n*''[[Mizrah|Mizr\u00e2\u1e25]]'', the [[Judaism|Jewish]] equivalent of the Qiblah\n*''[[Qiblih]]'', the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] equivalent\n*[[List of Muslim astronauts#Praying towards Mecca in space|Praying towards Mecca in space]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n==References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{cite journal|title=Services and Applications Based on Mobile User's Location Detection and Prediction|first1=Mohammed|last1=Abo-Zahhad|first2=Sabah M.|last2=Ahmed|first3=Mohamed|last3=Mourad|journal=International Journal of Communications, Network and System Sciences|volume=6|issue=4|year=2013|doi=10.4236/ijcns.2013.64020|issn=1913-3723 |ref=harv|publisher=Scientific Research Publishing|pages=167\u2013175|doi-access=free}}\n* {{cite journal|title=Calculating an Azimuth from One Location to Another A Case Study in Determining the Qibla to Makkah|first1=Ghazy|last1=Almakky|first2=John|last2=Snyder|journal=Cartographica: The International Journal for Geographic Information and Geovisualization | volume =33| issue =2 | year = 1996 | publisher = [[University of Toronto Press]] | issn=0317-7173 | pages = 29\u201336 | ref=harv |doi = 10.3138/C567-3003-1225-M204}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bilici|first=Mucahit|title=Finding Mecca in America: How Islam Is Becoming an American Religion|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-GLAV-KTtQ0C|year=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-92287-4}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Daftary|first=Farhad|title=The Isma'ilis: Their History and Doctrines|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cSO9zh61AGEC|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46578-6}}\n* {{cite magazine | title = A Muslim Astronaut's Dilemma: How to Face Mecca From Space | magazine = [[WIRED (magazine)|WIRED]] | first=Patrick | last=Di Justo | year = 2007  | url = https://www.wired.com/2007/09/mecca-in-orbit/ | publisher = [[Cond\u00e9 Nast]] | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hadi Bashori|first=Muhammad|title=Penanggalan Islam|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9YhKDwAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Elex Media Komputindo|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-602-02-3675-9|language=id}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Hadi Bashori|first=Muhammad|title=Pengantar Ilmu Falak|url=https://books.google.com/?id=erLqDAAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Pustaka Al Kautsar|location=Jakarta|isbn=978-979-592-701-3|language=id}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first=Mohammad |last=Ilyas|title=A modern guide to astronomical calculations of Islamic calendar, times & qibla|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4mrvAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|location=Kuala Lumpur|publisher=Berita Publishing|oclc=13512629|isbn=9789679690095}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kersten|first=Carool |title=History of Islam in Indonesia: Unity in Diversity|year=2017|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-8187-7}}\n* {{Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition|volume=5|title=\u1e32ibla: Astronomical Aspects |page=83\u201388|first=David A.|last=King|authorlink=David A.

The qibla is the direction of the building of [[Ka'bah]] in the [[Great Mosque|Sacred Mosque]], [[Mecca]], Saudi Arabia, which Muslims believe to be a sacred site built by the prophets [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]] and [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]. According to the Islamic belief, this direction was ordained by God in the Quran, in chapter [[Al-Baqarah]] verses 144, 149, and 150, revealed to Muhammad in the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]]; prior to this revelation Muhammad and his followers in [[Medina]] faced [[Jerusalem]] for prayers. Other than for the ritual prayer, it is also the direction for entering the state of [[ihram]] for the [[hajj]] pilgrimage, where animals are turned to in an [[dhabihah|Islamic slaughter]], for the dead when buried, the recommended direction to make [[dua|supplications]], and the avoided direction when relieving nature and spitting. Most mosque contains a ''[[mihrab]]'' or a wall niche indicating the direction of the qibla. In practice, there are two manners of observing the qibla: ''ayn al-ka'bah'' which faces the Ka'ba exactly, and ''jihat al-ka'bah'' which faces only its general direction. Most Islamic authorities believe that the more precise ''ayn al-ka'bah'' is only required when possible (for example, inside the Sacred Mosque or in its surroundings), and otherwise ''jihat al-ka'bah'' can be used.\n\nThe most common technical definition used by Muslim astronomers is the direction shown by the [[great circle]]\u2014in the [[Spherical Earth|Earth's sphere]]\u2014passing through the Ka'bah and one's location. This direction shows the shortest possible path from one's place to Ka'bah, and allows for the exact calculation (''hisab'') of the qibla using a [[spherical trigonometry|spherical trigonometric]] formula taking the coordinates of one's place and the Ka'bah as inputs.  The method is applied to develop [[Mobile app|mobile applications]] and websites for Muslims, and to compile qibla tables used in instruments such as the [[qibla compass]]. In addition, the qibla can also be determined by observing the shadow of a vertical rod at or around two times of the year when the sun is directly overhead in Mecca\u2014on 28 May at 12:18 [[Saudi Arabia Standard Time]] or 9:18 UTC and on 16 July at 12:27 SAST/9:27 UTC).\n\nBefore the development of astronomy in the Islamic world, Muslims used traditional methods to determine the qibla; these includes following the customs of the [[companions of the Prophet]] in one's place, using the setting and rising points of celestial objects, the direction of the wind, or using due south\u2014Muhammad's qibla in Medina\u2014everywhere. Early Islamic astronomy were built on its Indian and Greek counterparts\u2014especially the works of [[Ptolemy]], and soon Muslim astronomers developed methods to calculate approximate directions of the qibla, starting from mid-9th century. In the late 9th century and in the 10th century, Muslim astronomers developed methods to find the exact direction of the qibla that are equivalent to the modern formula. Initially, this \"qibla of the astronomers\" were used alongside various traditionally determined qiblas, resulting in a diversity of qiblas in medieval Muslim cities. In addition, the accurate geographic data necessary for the astronomical methods to yield an accurate result were only available in the 18th and 19th centuries, resulting in further diversity of the qibla. Historical mosques with differing qiblas still stand today throughout the Islamic world. The spaceflight of a devout Muslim [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] on October 2007 generated a discussion with regards to qibla from the outer space. On Sheikh Muszaphar's request, the Islamic authority of his home country Malaysia issued a detailed guidance, suggesting a determination \"based on what is possible\" for the astronaut, in line with recommendations from other Islamic scholars.\n\n==Location==\n{{main|Ka'bah|al-Masjid al-Haram}}\n{{Location map+|Middle East2| relief = yes |float=right|caption=Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem|places=\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=21.4228714|long=39.823546 |label=[[Mecca]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=24.4672105|long=39.6089423|label=[[Medina]]}}\n{{Location map~|Middle East2|lat=31.7760692|long=35.2335915|label=[[Jerusalem]]}}\n}}\nThe qibla is the direction of the [[Ka'bah]], a cube-like building at the centre of the [[Great Mosque of Mecca|Sacred Mosque]] (''al-Masjid al-Haram'') in Mecca, in the [[Hejaz]] region of Saudi Arabia. Other than its role as qibla, it is a [[Holiest sites in Islam|sacred site]] for Muslims, known as the House of God (''Bait Allah'') and where the [[tawaf]] is performed during the [[hajj]] and [[umra]] pilgrimages. The Ka'bah has an approximately rectangular ground plan with its four corners pointing close to the four [[cardinal direction]]s.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=317}} According to the [[Quran]], it was built by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]]\u2014both are prophets in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}} Not much historical records remain about the history of the Ka'bah prior to the rise of Islam, but in the generations before [[Muhammad]], the building had been used as a shrine of the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabic religion]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=318}}\n\nThe religious status of Ka'bah (or the Sacred Mosque in which it is located) as the qibla is based on the verses 144, 149, and 150 of the Quran's chapter of [[Surat al-Baqara|al-Baqarah]], each of which contains a command to \"turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque\" (''fawalli wajhaka shatr al-Masjid il-Haram'').{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=97\u201398}} According to the Islamic tradition, these verses were revealed on the month of [[Rajab]] or [[Shaban]] on the second [[Hijri calendar|Hijri year]] (624 [[Common Era|CE]]), or about 15 or 16 months after Muhammad's [[Hegira|migration to Medina]].{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=104}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Prior to these revelations, Muhammad and the Muslims in Medina had prayed toward [[Jerusalem]] as qibla, the same direction [[Mizrah|used]] by the Jews of Medina for their prayers. Islamic traditions say that these verses were revealed during a prayer congregation; Muhammad and his followers immediately turned their directions from Jerusalem to Mecca in the middle of the prayer ritual. The location of this event now becomes [[Masjid al-Qiblatayn]] (\"the Mosque of the Two Qiblas\").{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nThere are different reports about the qibla direction when Muhammad was in Mecca (before his migration to Medina). According to one report, cited by historian [[al-Tabari]] and exegete [[al-Baydawi]], Muhammad prayed towards the Ka'bah. Another report, cited by [[al-Baladhuri]] and also by al-Tabari, says that Muhammad prayed towards Jerusalem while in Mecca. Another report, mentioned by [[Ibn Hisham]]'s [[Prophetic biography|biography of Muhammad]], says that Muhammad prayed in such a way as to simultaneously face the Ka'bah and Jerusalem.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} Today Muslims of all branches, including the Sunni and the Shia, all toward the Ka'bah. Historically, one major exception was the [[Qarmatians]], a now-defunct syncretic Shia sect which rejected the Ka'bah as the qibla; in 930, they sacked Mecca, took Ka'bah's [[Black Stone]] to their centre of power in [[Al-Ahsa Oasis|Al-Ahsa]], with the intention of starting a new era in Islam.{{sfn|Wensinck|1978|p=321}}{{sfn|Daftary|2007|p=149}}{{efn|This act was condemned both by the Sunni [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid caliph]] and the Shia [[Fatimid caliphate|Fatimid one]].

In Islamic ritual and law, it refers to a special direction faced by Muslims during prayers and other religious contexts.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} [[Ulama|Islamic religious scholars]] agree that facing the qibla is a necessary condition for the validity of [[salah]]\u2014the Islamic ritual prayer\u2014in normal conditions;{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=103}} exceptions include prayers during the state of fear or of war, as well as non-obligatory prayers during travel.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=91}}  In addition, the [[hadith]] also prescribed Muslims to face the qibla when entering the state of [[ihram]] for hajj, as after the middle ''[[Stoning of the Devil|jamrah]]'' (stone-throwing ritual) during the pilgrimage.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}  The [[Adab (Islam)|Islamic etiquette]] (''adab'') calls for Muslim to turn the head of the animal when [[Dhabihah|slaughtered]], and the faces of the dead when buried, toward the qibla.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}} The qibla is the preferred direction when making a [[dua|supplication]] and is to be avoided when [[defecation|defecating]], [[urination|urinating]], and [[spitting]].{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=82}}\n\nInside a [[mosque]], the qibla is usually indicated by a ''[[mihrab]]'', a [[niche (architecture)|niche]] in its qibla-facing wall. In a congregational prayer, the [[imam]] (worship leader) stands in it or close to it, in front of the rest of the congregation.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}} The ''mihrab'' started became part of a mosque during the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad period]] and its form is standardised during the [[Abbasid caliphate|Abbasid period]]; before that, the qibla of a mosque is known from the orientation of one of its walls, called the qibla wall. The term ''mihrab'' itself is only attested once in the Quran, but it refers to a place of prayer of the [[Israelites]] rather than a part of a mosque.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=3}}{{efn|This reference occurs in {{Cite Quran|19|11|style=nosup}}}}  The [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As]] in [[Fustat]], Egypt, one of the oldest mosques, is known to have been originally built without a ''mihrab'', even though now one has been added.{{sfn|Kuban|1974|p=4}}\n\n===''Ayn al-ka'bah'' and ''jihat al-ka'bah''===\n''Ayn al-ka'bah'' is facing the qibla so that an imaginary line extending from the person's line of sight would pass through the Ka'bah. This manner of observing the qibla is easily done inside the Great Mosque of Mecca and its surroundings, but given that the Ka'bah is less than {{conv|20|m|ft}} wide, this is virtually impossible from further locations.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=104\u2013105}} For example, from Medina\u2014with a {{conv|338|km|mi}} straight-line distance from the Ka'bah\u2014a 1\u00b0 deviation from the precise imaginary line\u2014an error hardly noticeable when setting one's prayer mat or assuming one's posture\u2014results in some {{convert|5.9|km|mi}} shift from the site of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=137}} This effect is amplified when further than Mecca:{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=134}} from [[Jakarta]], Indonesia\u2014some {{conv|7900|km|mi}} away, a 1\u00b0 deviation causes more than {{conv|100|km|mi}} shift, and even an [[arc second]]'s deviation\u2014{{nowrap|({{frac|1|3600}} of a degree)}}\u2014 causes more than {{conv|100|m|ft}} of shift from the location of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} In comparison, the construction process of a mosque can easily introduce up to 5\u00b0 error from the calculated qibla, and the installation of prayer rugs inside the mosque as indicators for worshippers can add up to a further 5\u00b0 deviation from the mosque's orientation.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}\n\nA minority of Islamic religious scholars\u2014for example [[Ibn Arabi]]\u2014considers ''ayn al-ka'bah'' to be obligatory during the ritual prayer, while others consider it only obligatory when one is able. For locations further than Mecca, scholars such as [[Abu Hanifa]] and [[Al-Qurtubi]] argue that it is permissible to assume ''jihat al-ka'bah'', facing only the general direction of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|pp=92, 95}}  Some further argues that the ritual condition of facing the qibla is already fulfilled simply when the imaginary line to the Ka'bah is within one's field of vision.{{sfn|King|1996|p=134}} Therefore, for instance, there are legal opinions that accept the entire southeastern quadrant in [[Al-Andalus]] (historical Spain and Portugal), and the southwestern quadrant in [[Central Asia]], to be valid qibla.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}} Arguments for the validity of ''jihat al-Ka'bah'' include the wording of the Quran which only commands Muslims to \"turn [one's] face\" toward the Great Mosque, and to avoid the impossible requirement which would result if ''ayn al-Ka'bah'' were to be obligatory in all places.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=95}} The [[Shafi'i school]] of Islamic law, as codified in [[Abu Ishaq al-Shirazi]]'s ''Kitab al-Tanbih fi'l-Fiqh'', argues that one must follow the qibla indicated by the local mosque when one is not near Mecca or, when not near a mosque, ask a trustworthy person. When this is not possible, one is to [[ijtihad|make one's own determination]] by means available in one's disposal.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}}{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=94}}\n\n==Determination==\n=== Theoretical basis: the great circle ===\n[[File:Great circle passing through two points.svg|thumb|The great circle passing through two points on a sphere indicates the shortest path between those two. In this picture, the red circle indicates the great circle connecting A and B, and the shortest path between them is indicated in bold.]]\nThe [[great circle]] is the theoretical basis in most models that seek to scientifically determine the direction of qibla from a locality\u2014in such models, the qibla is defined as direction of the great circle passing through the locality and the Ka'bah.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|King|2004|p=166}} A great circle, also called the orthodrome, is any circle on a sphere whose centre is identical to the centre of the sphere. For example, all lines of [[longitude]] are great circles of the Earth, while the [[equator]] is the only line of [[latitude]] that is also a great circle (other lines of latitude are centered north or south of the centre of the Earth).{{sfn|Abo-Zahhad|Ahmed|Mourad|2013|p=172}} One of the properties of a great circle is that it indicates the shortest path connecting any pair of points along the circle\u2014this is the basis of its use to determine the qibla. The great circle is similarly used to find the shortest flight path connecting two locations\u2014therefore the qibla calculated using the great circle method is generally close to the direction of a direct flight from the locality to Mecca.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} As the [[Earth ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] is a more accurate [[figure of the Earth]] than a perfect sphere, modern researchers have looked into using ellipsoidal models to calculate the qibla, replacing the great circle by the [[geodesics on an ellipsoid]]. This results in greatly more complicated calculations, while the improvement in accuracy falls well within the typical precision of the setting out of a mosque or the placement of a mat.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|pp=132\u2013134}} For example, calculations using the [[Geodetic Reference System 1980|GRS 80]] ellipsoidal model yields the qibla of 18\u00b047\u203206\u2033 for a location in [[San Francisco]] while the great circle method yields 18\u00b051\u203205\u2033.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=35}}\n\n=== Calculations with spherical trigonometry ===\nThe great circle model is applied to calculate the qibla using [[spherical trigonometry]]\u2014a branch of [[geometry]] that deals with the mathematical relations between the sides and angles of triangles formed by three great circles of a sphere (as opposed to the conventional [[trigonometry]] which deals with those of a two-dimensional triangle). In the following figure, a location <math>O</math>, the Ka'bah <math>Q</math>, and the north pole <math>N</math> form a triangle on the sphere of the earth. The qibla is indicated by <math>OQ</math>, which is the direction of a great circle passing through both <math>O</math> and <math>Q</math>. The qibla can also be expressed as an angle, <math>\\angle NOQ</math> (or <math>\\angle q</math>), of the qibla with respect to the north, also called the ''inhiraf al-qibla''.

The city's coordinates, <math>\\Phi</math>, are 7.801389\u00b0S, 110.364444\u00b0E, while the Ka'bah's coordinates, <math>\\Phi_Q</math>, are 21.422478\u00b0N, 39.825183\u00b0E.

They were developed by various Muslim scholars, including [[Habash al-Hasib]] (active in Damascus and Baghdad ca. 850 CE), [[Al-Nayrizi]] (Baghdad, ca. 900 CE), {{sfn|King|1986|pp=85\u201386}} [[Ibn Yunus]] (10th/11th century CE),{{sfn|King|1986|p=85}} [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (11th century CE),{{sfn|King|1986|p=85}} and [[Al-Biruni]] (11th century CE).{{sfn|King|1986|p=86}} Today spherical trigonometry also underly nearly all application or websites which calculate the qibla.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}\n\nWhen the qibla angle with respect to the north, <math>\\angle q</math>, is known, the [[true north]] needs to be known in order to find the qibla in practice. The methods to do this include observing the shadow of a vertical rod at the [[culmination]] of the sun\u2014when the sun exactly crosses the [[local meridian]]. At this point, any vertical rod would cast a shadow oriented in the north\u2013south direction. The result of this observation is very accurate but it requires an accurate determination of the local time of culmination as well as making the observation at that exact moment.{{sfn|Ilyas|1984|pp=171\u2013172}} Another common method is using the compass, which is more practical because it can be done at any time; the disadvantage is that the north indicated by a magnetic compass differs from the true north.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}{{sfn|Ilyas|1984|p=172}} This [[magnetic declination]] can measure up to 20\u00b0, varies in different places on Earth and [[polar wandering|changes over time]].{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}}\n\n=== Shadow observation ===\n[[File:Direction of qibla using shadow.svg|thumb|left|Twice a year, the sun passes directly above the Ka'ba, allowing the observation of its direction from the shadow of a vertical rod.]]\nAs observed from Earth, the sun appears to \"[[Sun path|shift]]\" between the [[Tropic of Cancer|Northern]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Southern]] Tropics seasonally; additionally, it [[Diurnal motion|appears to move]] from east to west daily as a consequence of the earth's rotation. The combination of these two apparent motions means that every day the sun crosses the meridian once, usually not precisely overhead but to the north or to the south of the observer.

A straight line shown by the world map in using the [[Mercator projection]] is called the [[rhumb line]] or the loxodrome, which is used to indicate the qibla by a minority of Muslims.{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|pp=31\u201332}}{{efn|For an example of the loxodrome used to find qibla, see [[#North America]].}} It can result in a dramatic differences in some places, for example in some of North America the flat map shows Mecca in the southeast while the great circle calculation shows northeast,{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} and in Japan the map shows southwest while the great circle shows northwest.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2015|p=110}} The majority of Muslims, however, follow the great circle method.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}\n\n=== Traditional methods ===\n\nHistorical records and surviving old mosques show that throughout history the qibla was often determined by simple methods based on tradition or \"folk science\" not based on mathematical astronomy. Some early Muslims uses due south everywhere as qibla, following Muhammad's instruction to face south while he was in Medina (Mecca is due south of Medina) in a literal manner. Some mosques in as far as al-Andalus to the west and Central Asia to the east faces south even though Mecca is nowhere near that direction.{{sfn|King|1996|p=130}} In various places, there is also the \"qiblas of the companion\" (''qiblat al-sahaba''), those which were used in those places by the [[Companions of the Prophet]]\u2014the first generation of Muslims, who are considered role models in Islam. Such directions were used by some Muslims in the following centuries, side by side with other directions, even after Muslim astronomers used calculations to find more accurate directions to Mecca. Directions described as the qiblas of the companions include due south in Syria and Palestine,{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}} the direction of the winter sunrise in Egypt, and the direction of the winter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} The direction of the winter sunrise and sunset are also traditionally favoured because they are parallel to the walls of the Ka'bah.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132, also figure 4.2 in p. 131}}\n\n== Development of methods ==\n=== Pre-astronomy ===\nThe determination of qibla is an important problems for Muslim communities throughout history. Muslims are required to know the qibla in order to perform their daily prayers, and it is also needed to determine the orientation of mosques.{{sfn|King|1996|p=128}} When Muhammad lived among the Muslims in Medina (which, like Mecca, is also in the [[Hejaz]] region), he prayed due south, according to the known direction of Mecca. Within the few generations after Muhammad's death in 632, Muslims have reached places far away from Mecca, presenting the problem of determining the qibla in new places.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013132}} Mathematical methods based on astronomy would only develop at the end of the eighth century or the beginning of the ninth and even then they were not initially popular. Therefore, early Muslims relied on non-astronomical methods.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nThere is a wide range of traditional methods in determining the qibla in the early Islamic period, resulting in different directions even from the same place. In addition to due south (used because it was the direction to which Muhammad prayed from Medina) and directions known as the qiblas of the companions (varies by place), the Arabs also knew a form of \"folk\" astronomy\u2014called so by [[David A. King (historian)|David A. King]] to distinguish it from conventional astronomy which is an exact science\u2014originating from pre-Islamic traditions.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132}} It used natural phenomenon, including the observation of the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and wind, without any basis in mathematics. These methods yields specific directions in individual localities, often using the fixed setting and rising points of a specific star, the sunrise or sunset at the [[equinoxes]] or at the [[summer solstice|summer]] or the [[winter solstice]]s.{{sfn|King|1996|p=133}} Such qibla directions recorded in historical sources include: sunrise at the equinoxes (due west) in [[the Maghreb]], sunset at the equinoxes (due east) in India, the origin of the [[north wind]] or the fixed location of the [[North Star]] in Yemen, the rising point of the star ''Suhayl'' ([[Canopus]]) in Syria, and the midwinter sunset in Iraq.{{sfn|King|1996|p=133}} Such directions appear in texts of ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence) and texts of folk astronomy. Astronomers (aside from folk astronomers) typically do not comment on these methods, but they were not opposed by Islamic legal scholars.{{sfn|King|1996|p=132\u2013133}} The traditional directions were still in use when mathematical methods later developed and found different directions to Mecca, and they still appear in some surviving medieval mosques today.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=130\u2013131}}\n\n=== With astronomy ===\n[[File:Al-Khalili qibla table, Damascus copy 15th-16th century.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A portion of the qibla table compiled by the astronomer and ''[[muwaqqit]]'' [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]] of [[Damascus]] in the fourteenth-century CE. The qibla directions are listed in the Arabic [[sexagesimal]] notation.]]\nThe study of astronomy\u2014known as ''ilm al-falaq'' in the Islamic intellectual tradition\u2014began to appear in the Islamic World in the second half of the eighth century, centered in [[Baghdad]], the principal city of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Initially, the science was introduced through the works if Indian authors, but since the ninth century the works of Greek astronomers such as [[Ptolemy]] were translated to Arabic and became the main reference in the field.{{sfn|Morelon|1996b|p=20\u201321}} Muslim astronomers preferred Greek astronomy because they consider it to be better supported by theoretical explanations and therefore can be developed as an exact science; however, the influence of Indian astronomy survives especially on the compilation of astronomical tables.{{sfn|Morelon|1996b|p=21}} This new science is applied to develop new methods of determining the qibla, making use of the concept of [[Latitude|latitudes]] and [[Longitude|longitudes]] introduced in Ptolemy's ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' as well as trigonometric formulae developed by Muslim scholars.{{sfn|King|1996|p=141}} Most textbooks of astronomy written in the medieval Islamic World contain a chapter on the determination of qibla, considered one of the many things connecting astronomy with the [[Sharia|Islamic law]] (''sharia'').{{sfn|King|1986|p=83}}{{sfn|Morelon|1996a|p=15}} According to David A. King, various medieval solutions for the determination of qibla \"bear witness to the development of mathematical methods from the 3rd/9th to the 8th/14th centuries and to the level of sophistication in trigonometry and computational techniques attained by these scholars.\"{{sfn|King|1986|p=83}}\n\nThe first mathematical methods developed in the early ninth century were approximate solutions to the mathematical problem, usually using a flat map or two-dimensional geometry. Because in reality the earth is spherical, the directions found were not exact, but they were sufficient for locations relatively close to Mecca (including as far as Egypt and Iran) because the errors were only less than 2\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=142-143}}\n\nExact solutions based on three-dimensional geometry and spherical trigometry began to appear in middle of 9th century. [[Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi|Habash al-Hasib]] (fl. c. 850 M in Baghdad and Damascus) wrote an early example of such solutions, using an \"[[Orthographic projection|analemma]]\", or a two-dimensional procedure to derive formulas in spherical trigonometry. His procedure involves working with a circle and a series of points and lines drawn in a specific manner to find a direction now known to be equivalent to the solution obtained from the modern formula.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}{{efn|The details of this method and its proof are provided in {{harvnb|King|1996|pp=144\u2013145}}}} Another group of solution uses trigonometric formulas, for example [[Al-Nayrizi]] from Baghdad (fl. c. 900) developed a mathematical procedure using a four-step application of [[Menelaus's theorem]].{{sfn|King|1996|pp=145\u2013146}}{{efn|The details of this method and its proof are provided in {{harvnb|King|1996|pp=145\u2013146}}}} Subsequent scholars, including Ibn Yunus, Abu al-Wafa, Ibn al-Haitham and Al-Biruni, proposers other methods which are confirmed to be accurate from the viewpoint of modern astronomy, using either analemmas or direct application of formulas.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}\n\nMuslim astronomers subsequently used these methods to compile tables showing qibla from a list of locations, grouped by their latitude and longitude differences from Mecca. The oldest known example was written in Baghdad ca. 9th century CE containing entries for each degrees and [[arc minute]]s up to 20\u00b0.{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}} In the fourteenth century, [[Shams al-Din al-Khalili]], an astronomer who serves as a ''[[muwaqqit]]'' (timekeeper) in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] of Damascus, compiled a table of qibla for 2,880 coordinates with longitude difference of up to 60\u00b0 from Mecca, and with latitudes ranging from 10\u00b0 to 50\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}} King opined that among the medieval qibla tables, al-Khalili's work is \"the most impressive from the view of its scope and its accuracy\".{{sfn|King|2004|p=170}}\n\nThe accuracy of applying these methods to actual locations depend on the accuracy of its input parameters\u2014the local latitude and the latitude of Mecca, and the longitude difference. At the time of the development of these methods, the latitude of a location can be determined to several arc minutes' accuracy, but there was no accurate method to determine a location's longitude.{{sfn|King|1996|p=153}} Common approximate methods used to determine the longitude difference include comparing the local timing of [[lunar eclipse]] versus the timing in Mecca, or measuring the distance of caravan routes;{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}}{{sfn|King|1986|p=86}} the Central Asian scholar Al-Biruni made his estimate by averaging various approximate methods.{{sfn|King|1996|p=147}} Because the longitude inaccuracy, medieval qibla calculations (including those using mathematically accurate methods) differ from the modern values. For example, while the [[Al-Azhar Mosque]] in Cairo was built using the \"qibla of the astronomers\", but the mosque's qibla (127\u00b0) somewhat differs from the result of modern calculations (135\u00b0) because the longitude difference used was off by 3\u00b0.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\nAccurate longitude values in the Islamic world were only available after the application of [[cartography|cartographic]] [[surveying|surveys]] in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Modern coordinates, along with new technologies such as [[GPS satellite]]s and electronic instruments, resulted in the development of practical instruments to calculate the qibla.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}} Qibla found using modern instruments might differ from the direction of mosques, because a mosque might be built before the advent of modern data, and orientation inaccuracies might have been introduced during the building process of modern mosques.{{sfn|King|2004|p=177}}{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}} When this is known, sometimes the direction of the mosque's ''mihrab'' is still observers, and sometimes a marker is added (such as lines drawn in the mosque) that can be followed instead of the ''mihrab''.{{sfn|Wensinck|1986|p=83}}\n\n== Instruments ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = QiblaMat.jpg\n | image2 = Turkish and Islamic Museum 0951.jpg\n | footer = A [[prayer mat]] with a modern [[qibla compass]] (''left''); an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman-era]] qibla compass dated 1738 (''right'').}}\nMuslims use various instrument to find the qibla when not near a mosque.

The modern qibla for Cairo is 135\u00b0, which was not known at the time.{{sfn|King|2004|pp=175\u2013176}} This diversity also result in the non-uniform layout in Cairo's districts, because the streets are often oriented according to the orientation of the mosques. Muslim historical records also indicate the diversity of qibla in other major cities, including [[Cordoba, Spain|Cordoba]] (113\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 135\u00b0, 150\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 were recorded in the 12th century) and [[Samarkand]] (180\u00b0, 225\u00b0, 230\u00b0, 240\u00b0, and 270\u00b0 were recorded in the 11th century).{{sfn|King|2004|pp=175\u2013176}} According to the doctrine of ''jihat al-ka'bah'', the diverse directions of qibla are still valid as long as they are still in the same broad direction.{{sfn|King|1996|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\n=== North America ===\n[[File:01 05 Street WDC 8jul05.jpg|thumb|The [[Islamic Center of Washington]] (founded 1953), one of the early mosques in the United States, the qibla of which faces northeast in line with astronomical calculations.{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} ]]\nPlaces long settled by Muslim populations tend to have resolved the question of the direction of qibla over time. Other places, like the United States and Canada, have only had large Muslim communities in the past several decades, and the determination of qibla can be a matter of debate.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} The [[Islamic Center of Washington|Islamic Center of Washington, D.C.]] was built in 1953 facing slightly north of east and initially puzzled some observers, including Muslims, because [[Washington, D.C.]]'s latitude is 17\u00b030\u2032 more northerly than that of Mecca. Even though line drawn on world maps\u2014such as those using the Mercator projection\u2014would suggest a southeastern direction to Mecca, astronomical calculations using the great circle method do yield a north-of-east direction (56\u00b033\u2032).{{sfn|May|1953|p=367}} Nevertheless, most early mosques in the United States face east or southeast, following the apparent direction in world maps.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} As the Muslim community grew and the number of mosque increased, in 1978 an American Muslim scientist S. Kamal Abdali, wrote an article arguing that the correct qibla from North America was north or northeast as calculated by the great circle method, which identifies the shortest path to Mecca.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=54\u201355}}{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Abdali's conclusion was widely circulated and then  accepted by the Muslim community, and mosques were subsequently reoriented as a result.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=54}} In 1990, two religious scholars Riad Nachef and Samir Kadi published a book arguing for a southeastern qibla, writing that the north/northeast qibla was invalid and resulted from a lack of religious knowledge.{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}}{{sfn|Almakky|Snyder|1996|p=31}} The two opinions resulted in a period of debate about the correct qibla,{{sfn|Bilici|2012|pp=55\u201356}} and eventually most North American Muslims accepted the north/northeast qibla with a minority following the east/southeast qibla.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}}{{sfn|Bilici|2012|p=57}}\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nVariation of the qibla also occurs in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest world Muslim population. The astronomically calculated qibla ranges from 291\u00b0\u2014295\u00b0 (21\u00b0\u201425\u00b0 north of west) depending on the exact location in the archipelago.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=59\u201360}} However, the qibla is often traditionally known as simply 'the west', resulting in mosques built oriented due west or to the direction of sunset\u2014which slightly varies throughout the year. Different opinions exist among Indonesian Islamic astronomers: Tono Saksono ''et al.'' argues that facing the qibla during prayers is more of a \"spiritual prerequisite\" than a precise physical one, and that an exact direction to the Ka'bah itself from thousands of kilometres away requires an extreme precision impossible to achieve when building a mosque or when standing for prayers.{{sfn|Saksono|Fulazzaky|Sari|2018|p=136}} On the other hands, Muhammad Hadi Bashori opined that \"correcting the qibla is indeed a very urgent thing,\" and can be guided by simple methods such as observing the shadow.{{sfn|Hadi Bashori|2014|pp=60\u201361}} In the history of the region, disputes about the qibla has also occurred in the then-[[Dutch East Indies]] in the 1890s. When the Indonesian scholar and future founder of [[Muhammadiyah]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] returned from his Islamic and astronomy studies in Mecca he found that mosques in the royal capital of [[Yogyakarta]] had inaccurate qiblas, including the [[Kauman Great Mosque]] which faced due west. His efforts in adjusting the qibla was opposed by the traditional ulama of the [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]], and a new mosque built by Dahlan using his calculations was demolished by a mob. Dahlan rebuilt his mosque in the 1900s and later the Kauman Great Mosque too would be reoriented using the astronomically calculated qibla.{{sfn|Kersten|2017|p=130}}{{sfn|Nashir|2015|p=77}}\n\n=== Outer space ===\n[[File:ISS Aug2005.jpg|thumb|The spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]] to the [[International Space Station]] started discussion about Islamic religious practices in space, including the determination of qibla.]]\nThe issue of qibla from outer space publicly arose before the spaceflight of [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]], a Malaysian surgeon who is a devout Muslim, to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) on October 2007.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=114}} The ISS orbits the earth in high speed so that the direction to Mecca changes significantly in matters of seconds.{{sfn|Di Justo|2007}} Before his departure, Sheikh Muzsaphar requested guidance from Malaysian religious authorities about the performance of Islamic practices in space, including how to pray, fast, and determine the qibla.
