Its stems are terete and hairy and are without glands. The leaves (phylloclades) are simple and alternate with entire margins, and 8-11 mm long by 1.5-2.5 mm wide, on hairy stalks which are 3-6 mm long. There are no apparent stipules even on the youngest leaves. The bracteoles are 8-10 mm  long and hairy and persistent.  The calyx is hairy with simple hairs, and has no ribs, pustules, or glands.  The corolla is 14 to 16 mm long and has no claws. The standard is 11-16 mm long, with no indumentum. The wings are 11-12 mm long, and the keel which is not beaked is 12-13 mm long. There are ten stamens, and the anthers  are 0.8 to 1 mm long with the filaments being alternately long and short (6-7.5 mm long). The ovary is hairy or glandular. The style is hairy or glandular towards the base and 10--11 mm long, and circular in cross-section.
