Critics have observed that while Japan announced the first case of infection on 28 January, it took until 17 February for the Health Ministry to inform the public on how to reach public screening centers and 25 February, for the government to issue a \"basic policy\" on outbreak response. The overdue response times of the government has led critics to accuse Abe of \"callous indifference in the face of an unfolding disaster\" and the government as a whole as being \"out of touch with the lives of ordinary people that they seem genuinely uninterested in their plight\".<ref name=\"AutoDW-224\" /><ref name=\"AutoDW-225\" />\n\nThe strict constraints on testing for the virus by Japanese health authorities have drawn accusations from critics such as Masahiro Kami, a [[Hematology|hematologist]] and director of the Medical Governance Research Institute, towards Abe of wanting to \"downplay the number of infections or patients because of the upcoming Olympics.\" Reports that only a small select number of public health facilities were authorized to test for the virus, after which the results could only be processed by five government-approved companies, has created a bottleneck where clinics have been forced to turn away even patients who had high fevers. This has led some experts to question Japan's official case numbers, with Tobias Harris, of [[Teneo]] Intelligence in Washington, D.C. stating \"You wonder, if they were testing nearly as much as South Korea is testing, what would the actual number be?

Critics have observed that while Japan announced the first case of infection on 28 January, it took until 17 February for the Health Ministry to inform the public on how to reach public screening centers and 25 February, for the government to issue a \"basic policy\" on outbreak response. The overdue response times of the government has led critics to accuse Abe of \"callous indifference in the face of an unfolding disaster\" and the government as a whole as being \"out of touch with the lives of ordinary people that they seem genuinely uninterested in their plight\".<ref name=\"AutoDW-224\" /><ref name=\"AutoDW-225\" />\n\nThe strict constraints on testing for the virus by Japanese health authorities have drawn accusations from critics such as Masahiro Kami, a [[Hematology|hematologist]] and director of the Medical Governance Research Institute, towards Abe of wanting to \"downplay the number of infections or patients because of the upcoming Olympics.\" Reports that only a small select number of public health facilities were authorized to test for the virus, after which the results could only be processed by five government-approved companies, has created a bottleneck where clinics have been forced to turn away even patients who had high fevers. This has led some experts to question Japan's official case numbers, with Tobias Harris, of [[Teneo]] Intelligence in Washington, D.C. stating \"You wonder, if they were testing nearly as much as South Korea is testing, what would the actual number be?
