He was part of the Chelsea team that won the League championship in the [[1954\u201355 in English football|1954\u201355 season]]. In 1958 he joined Crystal Palace, whom he captained to promotion from the Fourth Division, and finished his on-field career in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] as [[player-manager]] of [[Tunbridge Wells Rangers F.C.|Tunbridge Wells Rangers]]. He then spent 25 years working on the commercial side of football with two of his previous clubs.\n\n==Early life and career==\nMcNichol was born in [[Kilmarnock]], [[Ayrshire]]. His father, Danny, died when he was five, so McNichol and seven siblings were raised by their mother, Catherine. He attended St Joseph's School in Kilmarnock, and started work as a messenger boy for a local draper's shop when he left school. His shop work stopped him playing football on Saturdays, but he was able to play some midweek football for [[Scottish Junior Football Association|Junior]] club [[Hurlford United F.C.|Hurlford United]]. When he was taken on at the local bus garage as an apprentice motor mechanic, he became available on Saturdays as well. Hurlford paid him [[\u00a3sd|ten shillings]] a game, nearly as much as his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] as a mechanic, but was able to play [[friendly match]]es for [[Inverness]]-based club [[Clachnacuddin F.C.|Clachnacuddin]]. Because of the number of professional players stationed around the country, such matches were played at a fairly high standard.<ref name=P&J>{{cite news |url=http://www.mychelseafc.com/chelsea_news/championship_season/scott_was_chelsea_rising_star_in.htm |title=Scot was Chelsea rising star in Lampard mould |newspaper=Aberdeen Press & Journal |date=5 May 2005 |accessdate=4 March 2016 |via=MyChelsea.com}}</ref>\n\n==Newcastle United==\nAfter the war, McNichol returned to Hurlford, but, amid interest from other clubs, he accepted a trial with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].

Hurlford paid him [[\u00a3sd|ten shillings]] a game, nearly as much as his apprentice's wages. During the Second World War, McNichol was called up to the [[Fleet Air Arm]] as a mechanic, but was able to play [[friendly match]]es for [[Inverness]]-based club [[Clachnacuddin F.C.|Clachnacuddin]].
