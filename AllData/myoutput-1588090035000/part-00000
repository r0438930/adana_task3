The first million cars were produced by 1&nbsp;February 1966, less than four and a half years after launch;<ref name=Autocar196602>{{cite journal |title=News and Views: 1M Renault 4 |volume=124 | journal=Autocar |issue=2651 |page=248 |date=4 February 1966}}</ref> eventually over eight million were built, making the Renault 4 a commercial success because of the timing of its introduction and the merits of its design.\n\n==Origins and strategy==\nThe Renault 4 was Renault's response to the 1948 [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]]. Renault was able to review the advantages and disadvantages of the 2CV design. The Citro\u00ebn had made motoring available to low-income people in France, and especially to farmers and other people in rural areas, for whom the car was as much a working tool as personal transport. The 2CV had been designed in the 1930s for use in the French countryside where the road network was poor - speed was not a requirement but a good ride, useful rough-terrain ability, a versatile body for load carrying and economy and simplicity of operation were its key considerations. But by the late 1950s the 2CV was becoming outdated. Rural roads in France were improved and the national system of [[Controlled-access highway|autoroutes]] were being developed. Agriculture was becoming more mechanised with fewer [[Smallholding|smallholdings]] and family farms for which the 2CV was designed. The Citro\u00ebn had also proved popular with people living in towns and cities as affordable, economical transport but the 2CV's rural design brief made it less than ideal as a [[A-segment|city car]] and, despite improvements, the late-1950s 2CV had a top speed of just {{cvt|70|km/h|mph}}. Its air-cooled two-cylinder engine was reliable and economical but noisy and offered poor performance. The 2CV's suspension gave it an excellent ride and good grip and handling but was mechanically complex with many moving parts that required regular maintenance and lubrication at intervals as low as every 1000 miles (1600km). With its roots in the 1930s the 2CV's styling was also outdated and, with its separate [[Fender (vehicle)|wing/fenders]], had a relatively narrow and cramped body for its overall footprint. While the Citro\u00ebn had been designed during the [[Great Depression]] when money was tight and living standards were relatively low, by the 1960s the French economy was growing and people would be able to afford a more modern, refined and less utilitarian small car.\n\nIn early 1956, [[Renault]] Chairman [[Pierre Dreyfus]] launched this new project: designing a new model to replace the [[rear engine]]d [[Renault 4CV|4CV]] and compete against the Citro\u00ebn 2CV that would become an everyman's car, capable of satisfying the needs of most consumers. It would be a family car, a woman's car, a farmer's car, or a city car.\n\nThe Renault 4 shared many design traits with the older Citro\u00ebn 2CV to allow it fulfil the same role as a versatile utility car, especially for people in rural France and other parts of the world with poor roads. It had a large structural platform with a separate body. It had [[front-wheel drive]], long-travel fully independent suspension and [[Rack and pinion]] steering. It had a simple body with minimal equipment, a large space for cargo or luggage and 'deckchair' seats which could be easily removed. However the Renault 4 updated this basic concept with a larger four-cylinder water-cooled engine with a sealed cooling system offering much better refinement and performance than the contemporary 2CV, with a top speed of over {{cvt|104|km/h|mph}}. The suspension consisted of [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] which required no regular maintenance. The boxy full-width body offered more space for both passengers and luggage than the similar-sized 2CV and the car boasted an early [[hatchback]] body for greater practicality.\n\n[[File:R3 1.jpg|left|thumb|1961\u20131962 Renault 3: installing windows into the thick [[Pillar (car)|c-pillars]] added weight and cost which, initially, customers could avoid on entry level versions of the R3 and R4]]\n[[File:Renault R4 BW 2016-07-17 13-45-32.jpg|left|thumb|1961\u20131967 Renault 4]]\n[[File:Renault 4 R 1123 1968.jpg|left|thumb|1967\u20131974 Renault 4L: For 1968 the car received a more modern aluminium grille that it would retain until 1974]]\n[[File:R4 3 v sst.jpg|left|thumb|1974\u20131978 Renault 4L: In 1974 a plastic grille replaced the metal one]]\n[[File:Renault 4 Aardenburg April 2008.JPG|left|thumb|1978 Renault 4GTL: a further mild facelift followed, on European market cars, in 1978]]\n\n==Launch of the R3 and R4==\nRenault launched the Renault 3 and the Renault 4 simultaneously in July 1961.<ref name=Autocar1966>{{cite journal|title = Used Cars on test: 1962 Renault 4L|volume=125| journal=Autocar | issue=3678| pages=372\u2013373 |date=12 August 1966}}</ref> The cars shared the same body and most mechanical components, but the R3 was powered by a 603&nbsp;cc version of the engine while the R4 featured a 747&nbsp;cc engine.<ref name=Automobilia1962>{{cite journal| first=Ren\u00e9 |last=Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1962 (salon Paris oct 1961)| issue=19| page=48|year=2001|publisher=Histoire & collections|language=French}}</ref> This placed the R3 in the 3CV [[tax horsepower|taxation class]] while the R4 was in the 4CV class.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Actual maximum power output was claimed by Renault as 22.5&nbsp;hp for the R3, and 26.5 or 32&nbsp;hp for the R4, depending on price level and the type of carburettor fitted.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Initially the base versions of the R3 and R4 came with a thick C-pillar behind each of the rear doors. [[Quarter glass]] was a 400 [[franc]]s option for the basic R4. The extra visibility increased the weight of the vehicle, but these windows soon became standard for all R4s.<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nThe R3 and R4 were targeted at the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] that employed soft springs and long wheel travel to absorb bumps on poorly maintained roads. The Renault 3/4 applied the same approach and two models appeared at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in 1961 on a specialized demonstration display that incorporated an irregular rolling road. Visitors could sit inside a car, which remained undisturbed while the suspension absorbed the erratic bumps of the rolling road.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> In 1962 Renault employed the same display at the [[Turin Motor Show]].<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nThe basic version of the R3 was priced 40 francs below the lowest priced version of the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] in 1961<ref name=Automobilia1962/> and featured painted bumpers and grill, a simplified instrument panel, a single sun visor, no windshield washer, and no interior door panels.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> This trim was also offered in the more powerful R4. The R4L with six side windows, chrome coloured bumper and grill, as well as a less spartan interior cost 400 francs (roughly 8%) more than the R4 with its four side windows.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> However, as with the [[Renault 4CV#Broadening the range downmarket|Renault 4CV \u201cService\u201d]] in 1953, customers shunned the basic model and in October 1962, the Renault R3 was discontinued, along with the most basic version of the Renault 4.<ref name=Autocar1966/>\n\nA \"super\" version (branded \"de luxe\" in some export markets) with opening rear quarter-light windows and extra trim was also offered.<ref name=Autocar1966/> The de luxe and super versions of the R4L received a version of the engine from the [[Renault Dauphine]] giving them an engine capacity of 845&nbsp;cc.<ref name=Autocar1966/> After the withdrawal of the 603&nbsp;cc engined R3, the 747&nbsp;cc R4 model continued to be listed with an entry level recommended retail price, but the slightly larger-engined L versions were more popular. By 1965, Renault had removed the extra \"R\" from their model names: the Renault R4L had become the Renault 4L.\n\n==Engines== \n{{sources|date=April 2020}}\nEarly versions of the Renault R4 used engines and transmissions from the [[Renault 4CV]]. The original design brief called for an engine size between 600 cc and 700 cc, but there was no consensus as to whether to use a four-cylinder unit or to follow Citro\u00ebn with a two-cylinder unit. With [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]] rapidly growing market share across Europe and North America, Renault also gave serious consideration to an air-cooled boxer motor option for the forthcoming R3/R4.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> However, using the existing water-cooled unit from the [[Renault 4CV|4CV]] was a solution, especially in view of the extended period of teething troubles encountered by the [[Renault Fregate]], which was then Renault's most recent attempt to develop an innovative powerplant.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> The existing engines were larger than that specified by management for the new 4CV, but the automaker addressed this by reducing the bore so that the overall capacity of the base engine for the new R3 worked out to be 603 cc, comfortably at the lower end of the required 600\u2013700 cc range. However, since Renault already produced the 747 cc version of the engine that was well proven in the 4CV, it made sense to use this as well in what would in many respects be the older car's successor. Therefore, in 1961, the R3 had a 49&nbsp;mm bore and 80&nbsp;mm stroke, while the R4 received the 54.5&nbsp;mm \u00d7 80&nbsp;mm existing engine.<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nMoving the engine from the rear of the 4CV to the front of the new model involved significant planning: design changes to the unit were introduced as part of the process. The inlet manifold was now a steel casting whereas on the 4CV it had been constructed of a light-weight alloy: this was driven by cost considerations now that aluminium was not so inexpensive as it had been fifteen years earlier.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Renault also took the opportunity to introduce a feature which subsequently became mainstream. Renault also designed a \u201csealed-for-life\u201d cooling system, supported by a small expansion tank on the right side of the engine bay. The cooling system contained [[antifreeze]] intended to enable operation without topping up or other intervention throughout a car's life provided ambient temperatures below minus 40 degrees were avoided.<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nThe engines were larger than the small 425&nbsp;cc (later 602&nbsp;cc and 29&nbsp;hp), engines in the 2CV. The R4 always had a four-cylinder [[watercooled]] engine. The original Renault R4\u2019s engine capacity of 747&nbsp;cc served to differentiate the model from the more powerful [[Renault Dauphine]], but the Dauphine\u2019s 845&nbsp;cc engine was used in the 4 itself from 1963 onwards: for most markets at this stage the Dauphine engine now came as standard in the top of the range Renault R4 Super, and was available in some other versions only as an optional extra.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Given that Renault\u2019s 603, 747, and 845&nbsp;cc engines all shared the same cylinder stroke and were all of the same basic design, it is likely that there was very little difference between the manufacturing costs of the basic engine block between the three. From the perspective of the sales and marketing department, they did fall within different taxation classes (respectively 3CV, 4CV and 5CV) but at this end of the market tax level differences were by now less of an issue even in those European countries that still taxed cars according to engine size.\n\nWith time, the increasing trend to production of Renault 4s in a wide range of countries reduces the validity of generalised statements as to which engines were fitted when: in French built cars the old 845&nbsp;cc engine soldiered on in the more lowly versions until the mid-1980s, but in 1978 the top end Renault 4 GTLs received the new 1108&nbsp;cc engine: this engine was not new to Renault, however, being the five-bearing \u201cSierra\u201d engine, first installed in the [[Renault Estafette|Estafette van]] and [[Renault 8|R8]] in the summer of 1962. A smaller version (956&nbsp;cc) of this new engine finally replaced the by now venerable 845&nbsp;cc engine in the 4 in 1986. Unlike the original \"Billancourt\" engine from the 4CV, Renault's \u201cSierra\u201d engine rotated in a clockwise direction, so fitting it required reversing the direction of the differential in the gear box in order to avoid producing a car with one forward speed and four reverse speeds.\n[[File:Pope Francis Renault 4 1984.jpg|right|thumb|As of September 2013 [[Pope Francis]] owns a 1984 Renault 4.

Ironically the new Renault 4 did not inherit its transmission from the Renault 4CV nor from anyone else: the transmission was newly developed for the car.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> The dash-mounted [[gear lever]] was linked via a straight horizontal rod that passed over the longitudinally mounted engine and clutch directly to the gearbox right at the front. The resulting absence of any linkage at floor level permitted a flat floor across the full width of the car's cabin. Synchromesh featured only on the top two ratios, even though the low power of the engine required frequent gear changes by any driver using normal roads and wishing to make reasonable progress.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> On this point Renault quickly acknowledged their error and cars produced from 1962 featured synchromesh on all three ratios.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> In 1968 the Renault 4 finally received a four-speed transmission.\n\n==Structure and running gear==\n[[Image:Chassisroulant.JPG|thumb|Renault 4 [[rolling chassis]] showing the car's [[Vehicle frame#Platform Frame|platform frame]] structure.]]\nThe three principal new models introduced by Renault since the [[Second World War|war]]<ref>The three principal new models already introduced by Renault since the [[Second World War|war]] were the [[Renault 4CV]], the [[Renault Fr\u00e9gate]] and the [[Renault Dauphine]].</ref>  had all featured [[monocoque]] \"chassisless\" construction<ref name=Automobilia1962/> which was believed to save cost in the manufacturing process and to cut running costs by reducing vehicle weight. The Renault R3/R4 design defied this by now widely accepted mantra, employing a separate platform to which the body shell was then attached.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> The body's structural role in maintaining the overall rigidity of the car body was thereby reduced, placing less stress on the roof and allowing for thinner window pillars.  Although the use made of a separate platform resembled, in some respects, the use that pre-war designs would have made of a chassis, the outcome was a structure described as semi-[[monocoque]], and it would later allow Renault to use the R4 platform, with very little modification, to build new models such as the [[Renault 6]] and Rodeo.  (Later, the successful [[Renault 5]] used the R4 running gear but in a monocoque shell).\n\n==Suspension==\n[[File:Axle - Trailing arm 41.gif|thumb|Because the rear torsion bars are located one behind the other, the wheelbase is longer on the right side than on the left.]]\nThe R3 and R4 had four-wheel torsion-bar [[independent suspension]]. This was an innovation which would be copied on a succession of subsequent front-engined Renaults introduced during the 1960s and 70s.\n\nThe car features a shorter wheelbase on the left than on the right because the rear wheels are not mounted directly opposite one another.<ref name=\"wheelbase1\">{{cite web| title =Renault 4 \u2013 unbelievable truth!?| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeKsbHhJFzY| accessdate =2008-07-22}}</ref> This concept allowed a very simple design of the rear suspension using transverse torsion bars located one behind the other without affecting handling. The front torsion bars were longitudinal.\nThe fixed end of the torsion bars is mounted on quadrants that can be adjusted via a holes/fixing bolt arrangement. This enables the suspension to be \"beefed up\" and the ground clearance increased. With specialist tools provided by Renault it is done in a matter of minutes, and gives the light 4L a good amount of off-road capabilities. This feature, along with the installation of a thick protecting aluminium plate under the engine, has been widely used either by globe trotters and off-road racers and is still favoured with present-day student 4L Trophy entrants. Damping was provided by hydraulic telescopic shock absorbers on all four wheels.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Those at the rear were mounted virtually horizontally which avoided the intrusion of rear suspension componentry into the flat floored passenger cabin.<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nThe longitudinal layout of the front-wheel drive engine and transmission with engine behind the front axle, and gearbox/differential in front is identical to the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]]. The suspension is also very similar, the only difference being the deletion of the Citro\u00ebn's flexible beam between the rear wheels, to give the Renault 4 fully independent rear suspension. This is ironic as [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], the company's founder had been the harshest critic of the Traction at the time of its launch in the 1930s.\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:Colombian R4.jpg|right|thumb|Renault 4R Plus 25 (in [[Colombia]])]]\n[[File:Renault R4 BW 2016-07-17 13-45-17.jpg|right|thumb|Renault 4]]\n[[File:Renault R4 GTL 1982.jpg|thumb|1982 Renault R4 GTL built in [[Wexford]], Ireland]]\n*In [[Colombia]], the Renault 4 was one of the highest selling vehicles. Many Colombians nicknamed it '''\"{{lang|es|Amigo fiel}}\"''' (Faithful friend) due to its popularity. The vehicle was manufactured at the [[SOFASA]] plant in [[Envigado]] ([[Medell\u00edn]]) from 1970 to 1992. Two of the most popular versions included the Master (1,022&nbsp;cc) and the L\u00edder (Leader), which had a more powerful 1,300&nbsp;cc engine. The first Renault 4 was actually called \"Azul Pastrana\", named after President [[Misael Pastrana]] inaugurated the Renault plant in Envigado, Colombia.\n*In [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] the 4 van (Fourgonette) is known as '''\"Renoleta\"''', following the nickname given to the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] van, '''\"Citroneta\"'''. Due to heavy taxation on passenger vehicles in the late 1950s, the first 2CVs were imported unfinished, only up to the front doors and completed with an Argentine-made pickup truck bed. The Spanish word for pickup truck is \"camioneta\", hence \"Renoleta\".\n*In Italy the 4 was produced by the [[Alfa Romeo]] factory in [[Milan]] under license from 1962 to 1964. 41,809 R4s were built there\n*In Australia the car was produced between 1962 and 1966 in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]] but ceased production to make way for other models\n*In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]  the car was known as ''Mali div'' (Little giant) or \"\u010detvorka\"\n*In [[Finland]], the car was known as ''Tipparellu'' (Drop-Rellu) from the marketing slogan ''No grease, no water, just a drop of fuel'' and as it had excellent [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. ''Rellu'' is the common nickname for Renault cars in Finland.\n*In Mexico, the Renault 4 was produced in [[Ciudad Sahag\u00fan]], an industrial city created by [[Diesel Nacional|DINA]] and [[Renault]] in the fifties. Renault production ceased in 1976.\n*In Ireland the car was produced in a plant established in 1962 in [[Naas]], and one established in [[Wexford]] in 1972, production running until 1984.\n*In [[Slovenia]] (formerly part of [[Yugoslavia]]) the Renault 4, nicknamed '''\"Katrca\"''' or \"\u0161tirica\" (from French ''quatre'', four), was produced in the [[Industrija motornih vozil]] (IMV) plant from 1973 to 1992. 575,960 R4s were built there. In 1989 the plant was sold to Group Renault and renamed [[REVOZ]] d.d.\n*In Portugal it had an CKD assembly line in Guarda from 1964 to 1989 where more than 190,000 units were assembled. It was known as \"Quatro L\" (four L) .\n*In Spain the Renault 4L is known as '''\"Cuatro latas\"''' (four tins).\n*In East Africa it became known as the \"Roho\".  In [[Swahili_language|Swahili]] Roho means spirit, soul or character perhaps reflecting the affection the vehicle gained. \n*On September 7, 2013 [[Pope Francis]] accepted a white 1984 4L which had done 300,000&nbsp;km, offered to him by father Renzo Zocca from Verona.<ref>[http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/vaticano/dettaglio-articolo/articolo/papa-pope-el-papa-renault-4-27699/ La Renault 4 di Papa Francesco] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n{{original research|date=October 2012}}\nThe Renault 4 was a basic car with a simple dashboard and sliding windows. Suspension and seats were designed for comfort, and ventilation and the heater were effective.\n\nThe Renault 4 was produced for many years, but was not significantly changed. Exterior chrome trim was eventually phased out on all models, and [[aluminium]] grilles were replaced with [[plastic]] ones. There were three different dashboard designs. On the right side of the car at the back the position of the fuel filler was raised by approximately 15&nbsp;cm (6 inches)<ref name=Automobilia1962/> less than a year after the car's launch, presumably for safety reasons, but apart from this, changes to the body panels were limited to a slightly altered hood and hinges.\n\nRenault developed small cars, the [[Renault 6]] and the [[Renault 5]], while the Renault 4 was still selling well. The Renault 5 competed in a different sector (three-and five-door [[supermini car|supermini]]). The Renault 4 is intermediate between the small utility vehicle (2CV) and the supermini design (R5, [[Peugeot 205]]).\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Renault 4 Plein-Air 001.JPG|right|thumb|Plein-Air]]\n[[File:R4van.JPG|right|thumb|Renault 4 Fourgonnette (van)]]\nThere were many different 'special edition' Renault 4s. Some (including the Safari, Sixties and Jogging) were sold in special colour schemes, upholstery and other details, while others (Clan, Savane) were standard models with special decals.\n\nThere were also special models which were not solely a marketing exercise, such as the Renault 4 [[Sinpar]] 4x4, the Plein Air, a [[pickup truck]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] versions and electric versions.\n\nThe '''Plein Air''' was a doorless and roofless version originally developed to meet a 1964 request by the [[French Army]].<ref name=BivPin34>{{cite magazine | title = Wo ist der Strand? | trans-title = Where's the Beach? | language = de | last = Schneider | first = B\u00e9r\u00e9nice | page = 34 | magazine = Motor Klassik | date = June 2017 | ref = MK617 | publisher = Motor Presse Stuttgart | issn = 0177-8862 }}</ref> Sinpar's version, called the Sinpar 4x4 Torpedo, was first shown as a prototype at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1968|1968 Geneva Salon]], equipped with Sinpar's four-wheel-drive system. Sinpar was quickly given a contract to build a front-wheel-drive version at their works in [[Colombes]] near Paris; it appeared in May 1968. Called the Plein Air (meaning \"Open Air\"), it had no doors, with only a chain protecting the passengers. A military contract did not materialize but Renault and Sinpar attempted to ride the late sixties/early seventies [[Dune buggy|buggy]] wave in marketing it as a fun beach car.<ref name=BivPin34/> Being more expensive and less capable than the [[Citro\u00ebn M\u00e9hari]] it did not catch on and was discontinued in March 1970, after only 563 had been built. In 1989, Colombian SOFASA produced the variants ''Brisa'' (Breeze) which was based on the French ''Plein Air'' and ''Jogging'', which was marketed as a sportier version of the car and featured red accessories.\n\nIn 1978, the ''R4 GTL'' arrived. It had the 1108&nbsp;cc engine from the [[Renault 6]] TL, albeit with the performance reduced for better economy, and bigger drum brakes. The GTL was identifiable by its grey front grille, grey bumpers, and grey plastic strips along the bottoms of the doors. It also had an extra air intake below the front grille (as a result, the registration plate was moved down to the bumper), and 12&nbsp;inch (304.8&nbsp;mm) wiper blades instead of the original 10&nbsp;inch (254&nbsp;mm) ones. For the 1983 model year, the GTL got front disc brakes, the handbrake now working on the rear wheels, and there were a modified dashboard and cloth seats. The Renault 4 was the last French automobile to be sold with drum brakes on all four wheels, after the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] received disc brakes in 1981.<ref name=\"salon81\">{{Cite journal | editor = Costa, Andr\u00e9 & Georges-Michel Fraichard | date = September 1981 | title = l'\u00c9ditorial de G.G. | last = Guerithault | first = Gilles | issue = 14 & 15 | department = Salon 1981: Toutes les Voitures du Monde | page = 19 | work = l'Auto Journal | publisher = Homme N\u00b01 | location = Paris | language = french }}</ref> The very first 1983 models had the handbrake lever moved from left to right under the steering wheel before it was moved to the floor like in almost any other car by then.\n\nThere was also a [[panel van]] (Fourgonette) version of the R4, which with its \"high cube\" bodyshell and the unique 'giraffon' (giraffe hatch) at the rear became the idiosyncratic French \"Boulangerie\" van.

[[Volkswagen]] had switched [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] production from [[West Germany]] to [[Mexico]] in 1978 (where it was made until 2003), with the new [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] proving hugely popular in Europe. [[Citro\u00ebn]] kept its [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] in production until 1990 but did not directly replace it, with the [[Citro\u00ebn AX|AX]] (launched in 1986) taking its place as the entry-level model in the Citro\u00ebn range.

However, the continuing success of the Renault 4, the need to replace the more popular [[Renault 5]] during the early 1980s, the difficulties coming up with a suitable replacement (and the idea that the Renault 4's market would die with it) all meant that a new entry-level Renault (the Twingo) did not appear until 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecole.org/2/VA041292.pdf|format=PDF|title=l'\u00c9cole de Paris du management \u2013 Recherche|publisher=Ecole.org|date=2009-04-16|accessdate=2009-04-20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040114121531/http://www.ecole.org/2/VA041292.pdf|archivedate=2004-01-14}}</ref> To conclude production, a series of 1000 examples marketed as \"Bye-Bye\" was released, each with a numbered plaque.\n\nTo mark the end of Renault 4 production, a retrospective series of ten black-and-white photographs by [[:fr:Thierry des Ouches|Thierry des Ouches]] was published in [[Lib\u00e9ration]] in early December 1992, when R4 production finally finished after 31 years.

Renault was able to review the advantages and disadvantages of the 2CV design. The Citro\u00ebn had made motoring available to low-income people in France, and especially to farmers and other people in rural areas, for whom the car was as much a working tool as personal transport. The 2CV had been designed in the 1930s for use in the French countryside where the road network was poor - speed was not a requirement but a good ride, useful rough-terrain ability, a versatile body for load carrying and economy and simplicity of operation were its key considerations. But by the late 1950s the 2CV was becoming outdated. Rural roads in France were improved and the national system of [[Controlled-access highway|autoroutes]] were being developed. Agriculture was becoming more mechanised with fewer [[Smallholding|smallholdings]] and family farms for which the 2CV was designed. The Citro\u00ebn had also proved popular with people living in towns and cities as affordable, economical transport but the 2CV's rural design brief made it less than ideal as a [[A-segment|city car]] and, despite improvements, the late-1950s 2CV had a top speed of just {{cvt|70|km/h|mph}}. Its air-cooled two-cylinder engine was reliable and economical but noisy and offered poor performance. The 2CV's suspension gave it an excellent ride and good grip and handling but was mechanically complex with many moving parts that required regular maintenance and lubrication at intervals as low as every 1000 miles (1600km). With its roots in the 1930s the 2CV's styling was also outdated and, with its separate [[Fender (vehicle)|wing/fenders]], had a relatively narrow and cramped body for its overall footprint. While the Citro\u00ebn had been designed during the [[Great Depression]] when money was tight and living standards were relatively low, by the 1960s the French economy was growing and people would be able to afford a more modern, refined and less utilitarian small car.\n\nIn early 1956, [[Renault]] Chairman [[Pierre Dreyfus]] launched this new project: designing a new model to replace the [[rear engine]]d [[Renault 4CV|4CV]] and compete against the Citro\u00ebn 2CV that would become an everyman's car, capable of satisfying the needs of most consumers. It would be a family car, a woman's car, a farmer's car, or a city car.\n\nThe Renault 4 shared many design traits with the older Citro\u00ebn 2CV to allow it fulfil the same role as a versatile utility car, especially for people in rural France and other parts of the world with poor roads. It had a large structural platform with a separate body. It had [[front-wheel drive]], long-travel fully independent suspension and [[Rack and pinion]] steering. It had a simple body with minimal equipment, a large space for cargo or luggage and 'deckchair' seats which could be easily removed. However the Renault 4 updated this basic concept with a larger four-cylinder water-cooled engine with a sealed cooling system offering much better refinement and performance than the contemporary 2CV, with a top speed of over {{cvt|104|km/h|mph}}. The suspension consisted of [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] which required no regular maintenance. The boxy full-width body offered more space for both passengers and luggage than the similar-sized 2CV and the car boasted an early [[hatchback]] body for greater practicality.\n\n[[File:R3 1.jpg|left|thumb|1961\u20131962 Renault 3: installing windows into the thick [[Pillar (car)|c-pillars]] added weight and cost which, initially, customers could avoid on entry level versions of the R3 and R4]]\n[[File:Renault R4 BW 2016-07-17 13-45-32.jpg|left|thumb|1961\u20131967 Renault 4]]\n[[File:Renault 4 R 1123 1968.jpg|left|thumb|1967\u20131974 Renault 4L: For 1968 the car received a more modern aluminium grille that it would retain until 1974]]\n[[File:R4 3 v sst.jpg|left|thumb|1974\u20131978 Renault 4L: In 1974 a plastic grille replaced the metal one]]\n[[File:Renault 4 Aardenburg April 2008.JPG|left|thumb|1978 Renault 4GTL: a further mild facelift followed, on European market cars, in 1978]]\n\n==Launch of the R3 and R4==\nRenault launched the Renault 3 and the Renault 4 simultaneously in July 1961.<ref name=Autocar1966>{{cite journal|title = Used Cars on test: 1962 Renault 4L|volume=125| journal=Autocar | issue=3678| pages=372\u2013373 |date=12 August 1966}}</ref> The cars shared the same body and most mechanical components, but the R3 was powered by a 603&nbsp;cc version of the engine while the R4 featured a 747&nbsp;cc engine.<ref name=Automobilia1962>{{cite journal| first=Ren\u00e9 |last=Bellu  | title =Automobilia| journal = Toutes les voitures fran\u00e7aises 1962 (salon Paris oct 1961)| issue=19| page=48|year=2001|publisher=Histoire & collections|language=French}}</ref> This placed the R3 in the 3CV [[tax horsepower|taxation class]] while the R4 was in the 4CV class.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Actual maximum power output was claimed by Renault as 22.5&nbsp;hp for the R3, and 26.5 or 32&nbsp;hp for the R4, depending on price level and the type of carburettor fitted.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Initially the base versions of the R3 and R4 came with a thick C-pillar behind each of the rear doors. [[Quarter glass]] was a 400 [[franc]]s option for the basic R4. The extra visibility increased the weight of the vehicle, but these windows soon became standard for all R4s.<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nThe R3 and R4 were targeted at the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] that employed soft springs and long wheel travel to absorb bumps on poorly maintained roads. The Renault 3/4 applied the same approach and two models appeared at the [[Paris Motor Show]] in 1961 on a specialized demonstration display that incorporated an irregular rolling road. Visitors could sit inside a car, which remained undisturbed while the suspension absorbed the erratic bumps of the rolling road.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> In 1962 Renault employed the same display at the [[Turin Motor Show]].<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nThe basic version of the R3 was priced 40 francs below the lowest priced version of the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] in 1961<ref name=Automobilia1962/> and featured painted bumpers and grill, a simplified instrument panel, a single sun visor, no windshield washer, and no interior door panels.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> This trim was also offered in the more powerful R4. The R4L with six side windows, chrome coloured bumper and grill, as well as a less spartan interior cost 400 francs (roughly 8%) more than the R4 with its four side windows.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> However, as with the [[Renault 4CV#Broadening the range downmarket|Renault 4CV \u201cService\u201d]] in 1953, customers shunned the basic model and in October 1962, the Renault R3 was discontinued, along with the most basic version of the Renault 4.<ref name=Autocar1966/>\n\nA \"super\" version (branded \"de luxe\" in some export markets) with opening rear quarter-light windows and extra trim was also offered.<ref name=Autocar1966/> The de luxe and super versions of the R4L received a version of the engine from the [[Renault Dauphine]] giving them an engine capacity of 845&nbsp;cc.<ref name=Autocar1966/> After the withdrawal of the 603&nbsp;cc engined R3, the 747&nbsp;cc R4 model continued to be listed with an entry level recommended retail price, but the slightly larger-engined L versions were more popular. By 1965, Renault had removed the extra \"R\" from their model names: the Renault R4L had become the Renault 4L.\n\n==Engines== \n{{sources|date=April 2020}}\nEarly versions of the Renault R4 used engines and transmissions from the [[Renault 4CV]]. The original design brief called for an engine size between 600 cc and 700 cc, but there was no consensus as to whether to use a four-cylinder unit or to follow Citro\u00ebn with a two-cylinder unit. With [[Volkswagen Type 1|Volkswagen]] rapidly growing market share across Europe and North America, Renault also gave serious consideration to an air-cooled boxer motor option for the forthcoming R3/R4.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> However, using the existing water-cooled unit from the [[Renault 4CV|4CV]] was a solution, especially in view of the extended period of teething troubles encountered by the [[Renault Fregate]], which was then Renault's most recent attempt to develop an innovative powerplant.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> The existing engines were larger than that specified by management for the new 4CV, but the automaker addressed this by reducing the bore so that the overall capacity of the base engine for the new R3 worked out to be 603 cc, comfortably at the lower end of the required 600\u2013700 cc range. However, since Renault already produced the 747 cc version of the engine that was well proven in the 4CV, it made sense to use this as well in what would in many respects be the older car's successor. Therefore, in 1961, the R3 had a 49&nbsp;mm bore and 80&nbsp;mm stroke, while the R4 received the 54.5&nbsp;mm \u00d7 80&nbsp;mm existing engine.<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nMoving the engine from the rear of the 4CV to the front of the new model involved significant planning: design changes to the unit were introduced as part of the process. The inlet manifold was now a steel casting whereas on the 4CV it had been constructed of a light-weight alloy: this was driven by cost considerations now that aluminium was not so inexpensive as it had been fifteen years earlier.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Renault also took the opportunity to introduce a feature which subsequently became mainstream. Renault also designed a \u201csealed-for-life\u201d cooling system, supported by a small expansion tank on the right side of the engine bay. The cooling system contained [[antifreeze]] intended to enable operation without topping up or other intervention throughout a car's life provided ambient temperatures below minus 40 degrees were avoided.<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nThe engines were larger than the small 425&nbsp;cc (later 602&nbsp;cc and 29&nbsp;hp), engines in the 2CV. The R4 always had a four-cylinder [[watercooled]] engine. The original Renault R4\u2019s engine capacity of 747&nbsp;cc served to differentiate the model from the more powerful [[Renault Dauphine]], but the Dauphine\u2019s 845&nbsp;cc engine was used in the 4 itself from 1963 onwards: for most markets at this stage the Dauphine engine now came as standard in the top of the range Renault R4 Super, and was available in some other versions only as an optional extra.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Given that Renault\u2019s 603, 747, and 845&nbsp;cc engines all shared the same cylinder stroke and were all of the same basic design, it is likely that there was very little difference between the manufacturing costs of the basic engine block between the three. From the perspective of the sales and marketing department, they did fall within different taxation classes (respectively 3CV, 4CV and 5CV) but at this end of the market tax level differences were by now less of an issue even in those European countries that still taxed cars according to engine size.\n\nWith time, the increasing trend to production of Renault 4s in a wide range of countries reduces the validity of generalised statements as to which engines were fitted when: in French built cars the old 845&nbsp;cc engine soldiered on in the more lowly versions until the mid-1980s, but in 1978 the top end Renault 4 GTLs received the new 1108&nbsp;cc engine: this engine was not new to Renault, however, being the five-bearing \u201cSierra\u201d engine, first installed in the [[Renault Estafette|Estafette van]] and [[Renault 8|R8]] in the summer of 1962. A smaller version (956&nbsp;cc) of this new engine finally replaced the by now venerable 845&nbsp;cc engine in the 4 in 1986. Unlike the original \"Billancourt\" engine from the 4CV, Renault's \u201cSierra\u201d engine rotated in a clockwise direction, so fitting it required reversing the direction of the differential in the gear box in order to avoid producing a car with one forward speed and four reverse speeds.\n[[File:Pope Francis Renault 4 1984.jpg|right|thumb|As of September 2013 [[Pope Francis]] owns a 1984 Renault 4.

Ironically the new Renault 4 did not inherit its transmission from the Renault 4CV nor from anyone else: the transmission was newly developed for the car.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> The dash-mounted [[gear lever]] was linked via a straight horizontal rod that passed over the longitudinally mounted engine and clutch directly to the gearbox right at the front. The resulting absence of any linkage at floor level permitted a flat floor across the full width of the car's cabin. Synchromesh featured only on the top two ratios, even though the low power of the engine required frequent gear changes by any driver using normal roads and wishing to make reasonable progress.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> On this point Renault quickly acknowledged their error and cars produced from 1962 featured synchromesh on all three ratios.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> In 1968 the Renault 4 finally received a four-speed transmission.\n\n==Structure and running gear==\n[[Image:Chassisroulant.JPG|thumb|Renault 4 [[rolling chassis]] showing the car's [[Vehicle frame#Platform Frame|platform frame]] structure.]]\nThe three principal new models introduced by Renault since the [[Second World War|war]]<ref>The three principal new models already introduced by Renault since the [[Second World War|war]] were the [[Renault 4CV]], the [[Renault Fr\u00e9gate]] and the [[Renault Dauphine]].</ref>  had all featured [[monocoque]] \"chassisless\" construction<ref name=Automobilia1962/> which was believed to save cost in the manufacturing process and to cut running costs by reducing vehicle weight. The Renault R3/R4 design defied this by now widely accepted mantra, employing a separate platform to which the body shell was then attached.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> The body's structural role in maintaining the overall rigidity of the car body was thereby reduced, placing less stress on the roof and allowing for thinner window pillars.  Although the use made of a separate platform resembled, in some respects, the use that pre-war designs would have made of a chassis, the outcome was a structure described as semi-[[monocoque]], and it would later allow Renault to use the R4 platform, with very little modification, to build new models such as the [[Renault 6]] and Rodeo.  (Later, the successful [[Renault 5]] used the R4 running gear but in a monocoque shell).\n\n==Suspension==\n[[File:Axle - Trailing arm 41.gif|thumb|Because the rear torsion bars are located one behind the other, the wheelbase is longer on the right side than on the left.]]\nThe R3 and R4 had four-wheel torsion-bar [[independent suspension]]. This was an innovation which would be copied on a succession of subsequent front-engined Renaults introduced during the 1960s and 70s.\n\nThe car features a shorter wheelbase on the left than on the right because the rear wheels are not mounted directly opposite one another.<ref name=\"wheelbase1\">{{cite web| title =Renault 4 \u2013 unbelievable truth!?| url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeKsbHhJFzY| accessdate =2008-07-22}}</ref> This concept allowed a very simple design of the rear suspension using transverse torsion bars located one behind the other without affecting handling. The front torsion bars were longitudinal.\nThe fixed end of the torsion bars is mounted on quadrants that can be adjusted via a holes/fixing bolt arrangement. This enables the suspension to be \"beefed up\" and the ground clearance increased. With specialist tools provided by Renault it is done in a matter of minutes, and gives the light 4L a good amount of off-road capabilities. This feature, along with the installation of a thick protecting aluminium plate under the engine, has been widely used either by globe trotters and off-road racers and is still favoured with present-day student 4L Trophy entrants. Damping was provided by hydraulic telescopic shock absorbers on all four wheels.<ref name=Automobilia1962/> Those at the rear were mounted virtually horizontally which avoided the intrusion of rear suspension componentry into the flat floored passenger cabin.<ref name=Automobilia1962/>\n\nThe longitudinal layout of the front-wheel drive engine and transmission with engine behind the front axle, and gearbox/differential in front is identical to the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]]. The suspension is also very similar, the only difference being the deletion of the Citro\u00ebn's flexible beam between the rear wheels, to give the Renault 4 fully independent rear suspension. This is ironic as [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], the company's founder had been the harshest critic of the Traction at the time of its launch in the 1930s.\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:Colombian R4.jpg|right|thumb|Renault 4R Plus 25 (in [[Colombia]])]]\n[[File:Renault R4 BW 2016-07-17 13-45-17.jpg|right|thumb|Renault 4]]\n[[File:Renault R4 GTL 1982.jpg|thumb|1982 Renault R4 GTL built in [[Wexford]], Ireland]]\n*In [[Colombia]], the Renault 4 was one of the highest selling vehicles. Many Colombians nicknamed it '''\"{{lang|es|Amigo fiel}}\"''' (Faithful friend) due to its popularity. The vehicle was manufactured at the [[SOFASA]] plant in [[Envigado]] ([[Medell\u00edn]]) from 1970 to 1992. Two of the most popular versions included the Master (1,022&nbsp;cc) and the L\u00edder (Leader), which had a more powerful 1,300&nbsp;cc engine. The first Renault 4 was actually called \"Azul Pastrana\", named after President [[Misael Pastrana]] inaugurated the Renault plant in Envigado, Colombia.\n*In [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] the 4 van (Fourgonette) is known as '''\"Renoleta\"''', following the nickname given to the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] van, '''\"Citroneta\"'''. Due to heavy taxation on passenger vehicles in the late 1950s, the first 2CVs were imported unfinished, only up to the front doors and completed with an Argentine-made pickup truck bed. The Spanish word for pickup truck is \"camioneta\", hence \"Renoleta\".\n*In Italy the 4 was produced by the [[Alfa Romeo]] factory in [[Milan]] under license from 1962 to 1964. 41,809 R4s were built there\n*In Australia the car was produced between 1962 and 1966 in [[Heidelberg, Victoria]] but ceased production to make way for other models\n*In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Croatia]]  the car was known as ''Mali div'' (Little giant) or \"\u010detvorka\"\n*In [[Finland]], the car was known as ''Tipparellu'' (Drop-Rellu) from the marketing slogan ''No grease, no water, just a drop of fuel'' and as it had excellent [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]]. ''Rellu'' is the common nickname for Renault cars in Finland.\n*In Mexico, the Renault 4 was produced in [[Ciudad Sahag\u00fan]], an industrial city created by [[Diesel Nacional|DINA]] and [[Renault]] in the fifties. Renault production ceased in 1976.\n*In Ireland the car was produced in a plant established in 1962 in [[Naas]], and one established in [[Wexford]] in 1972, production running until 1984.\n*In [[Slovenia]] (formerly part of [[Yugoslavia]]) the Renault 4, nicknamed '''\"Katrca\"''' or \"\u0161tirica\" (from French ''quatre'', four), was produced in the [[Industrija motornih vozil]] (IMV) plant from 1973 to 1992. 575,960 R4s were built there. In 1989 the plant was sold to Group Renault and renamed [[REVOZ]] d.d.\n*In Portugal it had an CKD assembly line in Guarda from 1964 to 1989 where more than 190,000 units were assembled. It was known as \"Quatro L\" (four L) .\n*In Spain the Renault 4L is known as '''\"Cuatro latas\"''' (four tins).\n*In East Africa it became known as the \"Roho\".  In [[Swahili_language|Swahili]] Roho means spirit, soul or character perhaps reflecting the affection the vehicle gained. \n*On September 7, 2013 [[Pope Francis]] accepted a white 1984 4L which had done 300,000&nbsp;km, offered to him by father Renzo Zocca from Verona.<ref>[http://vaticaninsider.lastampa.it/vaticano/dettaglio-articolo/articolo/papa-pope-el-papa-renault-4-27699/ La Renault 4 di Papa Francesco] {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n\n==Design==\n{{original research|date=October 2012}}\nThe Renault 4 was a basic car with a simple dashboard and sliding windows. Suspension and seats were designed for comfort, and ventilation and the heater were effective.\n\nThe Renault 4 was produced for many years, but was not significantly changed. Exterior chrome trim was eventually phased out on all models, and [[aluminium]] grilles were replaced with [[plastic]] ones. There were three different dashboard designs. On the right side of the car at the back the position of the fuel filler was raised by approximately 15&nbsp;cm (6 inches)<ref name=Automobilia1962/> less than a year after the car's launch, presumably for safety reasons, but apart from this, changes to the body panels were limited to a slightly altered hood and hinges.\n\nRenault developed small cars, the [[Renault 6]] and the [[Renault 5]], while the Renault 4 was still selling well. The Renault 5 competed in a different sector (three-and five-door [[supermini car|supermini]]). The Renault 4 is intermediate between the small utility vehicle (2CV) and the supermini design (R5, [[Peugeot 205]]).\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:Renault 4 Plein-Air 001.JPG|right|thumb|Plein-Air]]\n[[File:R4van.JPG|right|thumb|Renault 4 Fourgonnette (van)]]\nThere were many different 'special edition' Renault 4s. Some (including the Safari, Sixties and Jogging) were sold in special colour schemes, upholstery and other details, while others (Clan, Savane) were standard models with special decals.\n\nThere were also special models which were not solely a marketing exercise, such as the Renault 4 [[Sinpar]] 4x4, the Plein Air, a [[pickup truck]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]] versions and electric versions.\n\nThe '''Plein Air''' was a doorless and roofless version originally developed to meet a 1964 request by the [[French Army]].<ref name=BivPin34>{{cite magazine | title = Wo ist der Strand? | trans-title = Where's the Beach? | language = de | last = Schneider | first = B\u00e9r\u00e9nice | page = 34 | magazine = Motor Klassik | date = June 2017 | ref = MK617 | publisher = Motor Presse Stuttgart | issn = 0177-8862 }}</ref> Sinpar's version, called the Sinpar 4x4 Torpedo, was first shown as a prototype at the [[Geneva Motor Show#1968|1968 Geneva Salon]], equipped with Sinpar's four-wheel-drive system. Sinpar was quickly given a contract to build a front-wheel-drive version at their works in [[Colombes]] near Paris; it appeared in May 1968. Called the Plein Air (meaning \"Open Air\"), it had no doors, with only a chain protecting the passengers. A military contract did not materialize but Renault and Sinpar attempted to ride the late sixties/early seventies [[Dune buggy|buggy]] wave in marketing it as a fun beach car.<ref name=BivPin34/> Being more expensive and less capable than the [[Citro\u00ebn M\u00e9hari]] it did not catch on and was discontinued in March 1970, after only 563 had been built. In 1989, Colombian SOFASA produced the variants ''Brisa'' (Breeze) which was based on the French ''Plein Air'' and ''Jogging'', which was marketed as a sportier version of the car and featured red accessories.\n\nIn 1978, the ''R4 GTL'' arrived. It had the 1108&nbsp;cc engine from the [[Renault 6]] TL, albeit with the performance reduced for better economy, and bigger drum brakes. The GTL was identifiable by its grey front grille, grey bumpers, and grey plastic strips along the bottoms of the doors. It also had an extra air intake below the front grille (as a result, the registration plate was moved down to the bumper), and 12&nbsp;inch (304.8&nbsp;mm) wiper blades instead of the original 10&nbsp;inch (254&nbsp;mm) ones. For the 1983 model year, the GTL got front disc brakes, the handbrake now working on the rear wheels, and there were a modified dashboard and cloth seats. The Renault 4 was the last French automobile to be sold with drum brakes on all four wheels, after the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] received disc brakes in 1981.<ref name=\"salon81\">{{Cite journal | editor = Costa, Andr\u00e9 & Georges-Michel Fraichard | date = September 1981 | title = l'\u00c9ditorial de G.G. | last = Guerithault | first = Gilles | issue = 14 & 15 | department = Salon 1981: Toutes les Voitures du Monde | page = 19 | work = l'Auto Journal | publisher = Homme N\u00b01 | location = Paris | language = french }}</ref> The very first 1983 models had the handbrake lever moved from left to right under the steering wheel before it was moved to the floor like in almost any other car by then.\n\nThere was also a [[panel van]] (Fourgonette) version of the R4, which with its \"high cube\" bodyshell and the unique 'giraffon' (giraffe hatch) at the rear became the idiosyncratic French \"Boulangerie\" van. For many years, this was surely the most successful vehicle of its type and for many people it represents their idea of a Renault 4 more than the passenger version. It remained on sale in Europe until 1993 and was replaced by the [[Renault Express]] (called Extra in UK and Ireland, Rapid in Germany), which was based on the second generation [[Renault 5]] 'Supercinq'.\n\n==End of the R4==\n\nThough reasons such as emissions and safety legislation are often given for the Renault 4's demise in Europe during the 1980s, it would appear that its popularity would not have lasted anyway.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://bjorndal.online.no/r4e/R4-historien_e.htm | title = R4 Story | work = Norwegian Renault 4 Web | first = Bj\u00f8rn | last = Bjerkeskaug | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060501021948/http://bjorndal.online.no/r4e/R4-historien_e.htm | archivedate=2006-05-01 }}</ref> Outmoded production methods, more advanced competition and the reasons outlined above meant that the Renault 4's days were numbered, at least as a mainstream product. And Renault was already enjoying huge sales success with the far more modern R5, which was only slightly more expensive. Comparable products had already been discontinued in Europe or had their production scaled back, as more modern designs enjoyed the strongest sales. [[British Leyland|British Leyland's]] [[Mini]] had been produced in smaller figures since the launch of the [[Austin Metro]] in 1980 with production continuing until 2000. [[Volkswagen]] had switched [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]] production from [[West Germany]] to [[Mexico]] in 1978 (where it was made until 2003), with the new [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] and [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] proving hugely popular in Europe. [[Citro\u00ebn]] kept its [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] in production until 1990 but did not directly replace it, with the [[Citro\u00ebn AX|AX]] (launched in 1986) taking its place as the entry-level model in the Citro\u00ebn range. It had also produced the earlier [[Citro\u00ebn Dyane|Dyane]] and [[Citro\u00ebn Visa|Visa]] as more modern and only marginally more expensive alternatives to 2CV. \n\nThere were several projects to replace the Renault 4, starting from the early 1970s. However, the continuing success of the Renault 4, the need to replace the more popular [[Renault 5]] during the early 1980s, the difficulties coming up with a suitable replacement (and the idea that the Renault 4's market would die with it) all meant that a new entry-level Renault (the Twingo) did not appear until 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecole.org/2/VA041292.pdf|format=PDF|title=l'\u00c9cole de Paris du management \u2013 Recherche|publisher=Ecole.org|date=2009-04-16|accessdate=2009-04-20 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040114121531/http://www.ecole.org/2/VA041292.pdf|archivedate=2004-01-14}}</ref> To conclude production, a series of 1000 examples marketed as \"Bye-Bye\" was released, each with a numbered plaque.\n\nTo mark the end of Renault 4 production, a retrospective series of ten black-and-white photographs by [[:fr:Thierry des Ouches|Thierry des Ouches]] was published in [[Lib\u00e9ration]] in early December 1992, when R4 production finally finished after 31 years.
