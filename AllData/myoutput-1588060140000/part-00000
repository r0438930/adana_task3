The cab was designed by [[Marcello Gandini]]. Engines at launch were the AE 380 with a 6-cylinder turbodiesel offering 374&nbsp;hp, and the AE500 with a 503&nbsp;hp [[Mack Trucks|Mack]] V8 diesel. It was voted Truck of the Year 1991. Since 1997 the truck was marketed as Renault Magnum and the cab was redesigned, and new engines became available. In 1995, the VE 20 prototype was presented, giving a preview of the second generation Magnum.\n\nIn 2001, the major facelift was presented, with a new cab designed by [[Xavier Allard]],  keeping its characteristic boxed shape and separate engine-cab model.\n\nA few days after the presentation of its totally renewed range, in Lyon, Renault Trucks was getting ready to turn the page on the Renault Magnum.
