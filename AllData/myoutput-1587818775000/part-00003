One of the last acts of the Benfleet Parish Council was to purchase 30 acres of The Downs in 1929, with a view to it becoming a public open space. \n\nOn 14th July 1934 \u00a0Sir Edgar Bonham Carter, K.C.M.G., Vice Chairman of the Open Spaces Preservation Society officially opened the Downs making it an official public space. At the official opening of the Downs a hope was expressed in the programme by Walter Bingham:\n\n\u2018To \u00a0have lost to posterity this beautiful place would have been a tragedy indeed its closing or otherwise would have extinguished the eyes of Benfleet. \u00a0A pious hope has often been expressed that at some time in the future, the authorities concerned may get possession of the whole of the slopes from Benfleet to Leigh and thus preserve for ever to the people a vista unrivalled anywhere in Europe...'.\n\nOver time the area in public ownership increased and the park was a long time in gestating. Much of the drive for its establishment came from Councillor Dennis Nisbet, at the opening ceremony. The park covering some 458 acres was officially opened on 18th May 1987 at this event by Sir Derek Barber, chairman of the Countryside Commission and a commemorative stone in honour of him was laid to celebrate the event.\n\n==Facilities==\nThe park is home to an [[iron age]] roundhouse, mountain biking trails, horse riding, a reservoir, conservation area, walking routes, a visitor centre and natural habitats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hadleigh-park.co.uk/|title=Hadleigh Park - Home of the 2012 Olympic Mountain Biking|website=Hadleigh Park}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation area==\nThe park incorporates a wetland conservation area and salt marsh that is home to [[dragonflies]].<ref>http://www.visitparks.co.uk/media/1238/hadleigh-park-map-compressed.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jG9UAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT109&dq=Hadleigh+Country+Park&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPpI3L04ThAhU6QxUIHYhYCkMQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&q=Hadleigh+Country+Park&f=false|title=A Field Guide to the Damselflies and Dragonflies of Britain and Ireland|first1=Dave|last1=Smallshire|first2=Andy|last2=Swash|date=22 May 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\nThe park was the venue for mountain biking in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].
