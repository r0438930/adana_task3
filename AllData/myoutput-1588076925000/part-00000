Compared to the other residents who own big houses, Katie and her family are renters of a more modest home. She lives with Greg, her level-headed husband who is a university professor of history, and their three children. Taylor is their athletic, headstrong, but somewhat dimwitted oldest daughter who wants to fit in with her peers; Oliver, their savvy, ambitious, and snarky son, is the middle child; and Anna-Kat, sweet but obsessive-compulsive, is the youngest and Katie's blatant favorite. Katie frequently vents her frustration to and seeks advice from her two closest friends: Doris, whose strict parenting style sharply contrasts with Katie's; and Angela, a divorced lesbian mother and lawyer with a calm parenting style.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of American Housewife episodes}}\n{{:List of American Housewife episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Katy Mixon]] as Kate \"Katie\" Otto\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Greg Otto, Katie's husband\n* [[Meg Donnelly]] as Taylor \u201cSweetheart\u201d Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage daughter; <small>the role was portrayed by [[Johnny Sequoyah]] in the televised pilot<!-- SHE WAS CREDITED AS MAIN CAST IN THE PILOT --></small><ref name=\"DonnellyRecasting\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/american-housewife-meg-donnelly-cast-abc-comedy-recasting-1201793752/ |title='American Housewife': Meg Donnelly Added To New ABC Comedy In Recasting |last=Petski |first=Denise |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel DiMaggio]] as Oliver Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage son and middle child\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Anna-Kat Otto, Katie and Greg's youngest daughter\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Doris, one of Katie's best friends\n* Carly Hughes as Angela, one of Katie's best friends\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Viv, Katy's neighbor who was originally introduced as Two-Fitbit Lady\n* [[Jessica St. Clair]] as Chloe Brown Mueller, Katie's arch nemesis\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Kathryn, Katie's mother\n* Logan Pepper as Cooper Bradford, Oliver's uber-wealthy best friend whose parents are almost always out of town; Cooper adores Katie as a mother figure\n* Amarr M.

Before this incident, there were various other episodes in which Norwalk was mocked: The characters refused to swim in a Norwalk swimming pool, acting like the pool water was diseased because of Norwalk people; one of the children took bets on how many of the girlfriends of Norwalk\u2019s basketball team would be pregnant post season; and Oliver Otto used a neighbor's Hispanic housekeeper to alter flawed Polo shirts and sell them to Norwalk students, believing that no Westport resident would buy them; Oliver ended up earning a lot of money. This brought condemnation from residents, school officials, and politicians of Norwalk. After a petition calling for the producers to stop \"bullying\" Norwalk garnered over 500 signatures and received media coverage, a Disney spokesperson released a statement saying \"As a comedy, ''American Housewife'' isn\u2019t intended to offend anyone. We\u2019ve heard the concerns of the people of Norwalk and have made the decision to omit any mentions of the city from future episodes\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehour.com/news/article/American-Housewife-to-omit-Norwalk-from-future-12390310.php|title=Following outcry, \"American Housewife\" to omit Norwalk from future episodes|author=Kaitlyn Krasselt|date=29 November 2017|accessdate=30 November 2017|newspaper=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:ELMINOFFICIAL]], choose one official website only -->\n* {{Official website|http://abc.go.com/shows/american-housewife}}\n* {{IMDb title|5396394}}\n\n{{ABCNetwork Shows (current and upcoming)}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American single-camera sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2020s American single-camera sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2010s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2016 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related sitcoms]]\n[[Category:Television productions suspended due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by ABC Studios]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Connecticut]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American comedy television series}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name          = American Housewife\n| image              = File:American_Housewife_Logo.svg\n| caption            = \n| genre              = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Sitcom]]\n* Family comedy\n}}\n| creator            = [[Sarah Dunn (author)|Sarah Dunn]]\n| starring           = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Katy Mixon]]\n* [[Diedrich Bader]]\n* [[Meg Donnelly]]\n* [[Daniel DiMaggio]]\n* [[Julia Butters]]\n* [[Ali Wong]]\n* Carly Hughes\n}}\n| narrated           = Katy Mixon \n| composer           = {{Plainlist|\n* Erica Weis\n* Orr Rebhun\n* Jonathan Sadoff {{small|(pilot)}}\n}}\n| country            = United States\n| language           = English\n| num_seasons        = 4\n| num_episodes       = 88\n| list_episodes      = List of American Housewife episodes\n| executive_producer = {{Plainlist|\n* Sarah Dunn\n* Aaron Kaplan \n* Kenny Schwartz \n* Rick Wiener\n* [[Ruben Fleischer]] (pilot only)\n}}\n| producer           = \n| editor             = David L.

Compared to the other residents who own big houses, Katie and her family are renters of a more modest home. She lives with Greg, her level-headed husband who is a university professor of history, and their three children. Taylor is their athletic, headstrong, but somewhat dimwitted oldest daughter who wants to fit in with her peers; Oliver, their savvy, ambitious, and snarky son, is the middle child; and Anna-Kat, sweet but obsessive-compulsive, is the youngest and Katie's blatant favorite. Katie frequently vents her frustration to and seeks advice from her two closest friends: Doris, whose strict parenting style sharply contrasts with Katie's; and Angela, a divorced lesbian mother and lawyer with a calm parenting style.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of American Housewife episodes}}\n{{:List of American Housewife episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n\n===Main===\n* [[Katy Mixon]] as Kate \"Katie\" Otto\n* [[Diedrich Bader]] as Greg Otto, Katie's husband\n* [[Meg Donnelly]] as Taylor \u201cSweetheart\u201d Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage daughter; <small>the role was portrayed by [[Johnny Sequoyah]] in the televised pilot<!-- SHE WAS CREDITED AS MAIN CAST IN THE PILOT --></small><ref name=\"DonnellyRecasting\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/07/american-housewife-meg-donnelly-cast-abc-comedy-recasting-1201793752/ |title='American Housewife': Meg Donnelly Added To New ABC Comedy In Recasting |last=Petski |first=Denise |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=September 9, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Daniel DiMaggio]] as Oliver Otto, Katie and Greg's teenage son and middle child\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Anna-Kat Otto, Katie and Greg's youngest daughter\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Doris, one of Katie's best friends\n* Carly Hughes as Angela, one of Katie's best friends\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Leslie Bibb]] as Viv, Katy's neighbor who was originally introduced as Two-Fitbit Lady\n* [[Jessica St. Clair]] as Chloe Brown Mueller, Katie's arch nemesis\n* [[Wendie Malick]] as Kathryn, Katie's mother\n* Logan Pepper as Cooper Bradford, Oliver's uber-wealthy best friend whose parents are almost always out of town; Cooper adores Katie as a mother figure\n* Amarr M.

Before this incident, there were various other episodes in which Norwalk was mocked: The characters refused to swim in a Norwalk swimming pool, acting like the pool water was diseased because of Norwalk people; one of the children took bets on how many of the girlfriends of Norwalk\u2019s basketball team would be pregnant post season; and Oliver Otto used a neighbor's Hispanic housekeeper to alter flawed Polo shirts and sell them to Norwalk students, believing that no Westport resident would buy them; Oliver ended up earning a lot of money.

After a petition calling for the producers to stop \"bullying\" Norwalk garnered over 500 signatures and received media coverage, a Disney spokesperson released a statement saying \"As a comedy, ''American Housewife'' isn\u2019t intended to offend anyone. We\u2019ve heard the concerns of the people of Norwalk and have made the decision to omit any mentions of the city from future episodes\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thehour.com/news/article/American-Housewife-to-omit-Norwalk-from-future-12390310.php|title=Following outcry, \"American Housewife\" to omit Norwalk from future episodes|author=Kaitlyn Krasselt|date=29 November 2017|accessdate=30 November 2017|newspaper=[[The Hour (newspaper)|The Hour]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- Per [[WP:ELMINOFFICIAL]], choose one official website only -->\n* {{Official website|http://abc.go.com/shows/american-housewife}}\n* {{IMDb title|5396394}}\n\n{{ABCNetwork Shows (current and upcoming)}}\n\n[[Category:2010s American single-camera sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2020s American single-camera sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2010s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2020s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2016 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:American Broadcasting Company original programming]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:American LGBT-related sitcoms]]\n[[Category:Television productions suspended due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]\n[[Category:Television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by ABC Studios]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Connecticut]]\n", "name_user": "Howenstein115", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDevelopment", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Housewife"}
