It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture which survives today. The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], early Maldive [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|scripts]], architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.<ref>Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands.'' Orient Longman</ref>\n\nBuddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BC at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century AD. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.\n\nBuddhist (and Hindu) temples were [[Mandala]] shaped. They are oriented according to the four cardinal points with the main gate facing east. Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted as many as 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites in a provisional list he published in 1990.\n\n===Islamic period===\n\n{{See also|History of the Maldives#Islamic Period|Islam in Maldives|List of sultans of the Maldives}}\nThe importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives, [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]], converted to [[Islam]] in the year 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdullah, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.\n\n[[Somalis|Somali]] Muslim Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, also known as [[Aw Barkhadle]], is traditionally credited for this conversion.

Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.\n\nCompared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Q\u0101sim]] had converted large swathes of [[Sindh]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sindh\u2014perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.\n\nMiddle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]\u2014widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast\u2014and coir fiber. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal\u2013Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ|title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History|first=P.|last=Boomgaard|date=1 January 2008|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9789004253995}}</ref>\n\nThe other essential product of the Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese presence]] in the Maldives was established in 1558, by order of [[Constantino of Braganza]], Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]].]]\n[[File:Codice Casanatense Maldivans.jpg|thumb|16th-century Portuguese illustration from the [[C\u00f3dice Casanatense]], depicting workers]]\n[[File:18th-century Maldives map by Pierre Mortier.jpg|thumb|18th-century map by [[Pierre Mortier]] from the [[Netherlands]], depicting with detail the islands of the Maldives]]\nIn 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a ''Viador'' (''Viyazoru''), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'u\u1e93am]] and his two brothers, that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National Day.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.\n\nThe British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[Protected state|British protected area]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].\n\nIn the British period, the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.\n\nMaldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Muhammad Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalized the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Mal\u00e9 eventually ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.\n\n[[File:Royal Air Force Operations in the Far East, 1941-1945 CF620.jpg|thumb|An [[RAF]] [[Short Sunderland]] moored in the lagoon at Addu Atoll, during WWII]]\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands. In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost [[Addu Atoll]], employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Seenu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afif]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital. One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Mal\u00e9 with government police, and Abdulla Afif went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period, with the payment of \u00a3750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently-stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.<ref name=\"gan.philliptsmall.me.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Independence and republic===\n\n[[File:Flag of the Sultan of the Maldives.png|thumb|Flag of the [[List of sultans of the Maldives|Sultan of the Maldives]]]]\n\nIn line with the broader British policy of decolonisation, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in [[Colombo]]. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi|Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King upon independence.\n\nOn 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, 40 voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.\n\n[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was [[Kurumba Maldives]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in the Maldives.<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives \u2013 Population\". Library of Congress Country Studies]</ref>\n\nPolitical infighting during the 1970s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export.  With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.\n\n[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.<ref name=\"cnn_sinking\">{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT</ref>\n\nA series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80 strong mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] who seized the airport and caused Maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1600 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian troops]] airlifted into [[Mal\u00e9]] restored order.\n\nA November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, a small-businessman.

It lies between latitudes [[1st parallel south|1\u00b0S]] and [[8th parallel north|8\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian east|72\u00b0]] and [[74th meridian east|74\u00b0E]]. The atolls are composed of live [[coral reef]]s and [[sand bar]]s, situated atop a submarine ridge {{convert|960|km}} long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.\n\nOnly near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes, the Maldivian government organised these atolls into 21 [[Administrative divisions of the Maldives|administrative divisions]].

Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms.\n\nThe shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of November. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages {{convert|254|cm}} in the north and {{convert|381|cm}} in the south.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maldives \u2013 Atlapedia

The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.\n\nAs a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints. In 2019, Maldives signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters. The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner. Maritime pollution control exercises are conducted regularly on an annual basis for familiarisation and handling of such hazardous situations.\n\n===Human rights===\n{{main|Human rights in the Maldives}}\nHuman rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue.

The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.\n\nIn addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"[[Haa Alif]]\" for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo.  Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee</ref>\n\nThe introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name.

The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as [[coir]] rope, [[ambergris]] (Maavaharu), and [[coco de mer]] (Tavakkaashi) with neighboring countries and [[East Asian]] countries.\n\nThe Maldivian government began a largely successful [[economic reform]] programme in the 1980s, initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At the time [[tourism]] sector which would play a significant role in the nation's development was at its infant stage.\n\nAgriculture and manufacturing continue to play lesser roles in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in the Maldives|Diving in the Maldives|List of mosques in the Maldives}}\n\n[[File:Filitheyo bar.jpg|thumb|left|Filitheyo island beach with tall palm trees and blue fresh lagoons]]\n\nThe Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s.

Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.\n\nThe development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the [[Economy of the Maldives|country's economy]]. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/coup-what-coup-tourists-ignore-maldives-turmoil-20120213-1t0wi.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Coup?

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.\n\nThe [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Maldives}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Male-total.jpg|thumb|[[Mal\u00e9]], the capital of the Maldives]]\n\n[[File:Population estimates of Maldives.png|thumb|Demographics of the Maldives, from 2000 to 2012]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\" |Population{{UN_Population|ref}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Census population by Sex and Sex ratio, 1911 \u2013 2014 |url=http://statisticsmaldives.gov.mv/yearbook/statisticalarchive/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/table2.1.pdf |publisher=National Bureau of Statistics, Maldives.}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Thousands\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1911 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|72\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1966 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|100\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|270\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2019 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|533\n|}\n\nThe largest ethnic group is [[Dhivehis|Dhivehin]], i.e. the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India.

Members of the social elite are concentrated in Mal\u00e9.\n\nThe population doubled by 1978, and the [[population growth]] rate peaked at 3.4% in 1985.

Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century. The islands have had a long history of [[Sufi]]c orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried [[saint]]s. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of Maldives's [[cultural heritage]].\n\nOther aspects of [[tassawuf]], such as ritualised [[dhikr]] ceremonies called Maul\u016bdu ([[Mawlid]])\u2014the [[liturgy]] of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodical tone\u2014existed until very recent times. These Maul\u016bdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.\n\nAccording to Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, sailing from [[Morocco]]. He is also referred to as [[Tabrizugefaanu]]. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, across the street from the Friday Mosque, or [[Mal\u00e9 Friday Mosque|Hukuru Miskiy]], in Mal\u00e9. Built in 1656, this is the country's oldest mosque.\n\n===Languages===\n{{main|Maldivian language}}\n\n[[File:Dhivehiscript.svg|thumb|Thaana script]]\n\nThe official and common language is [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] closely related to the [[Sinhala language]] of Sri Lanka. The first known script used to write Dhivehi is the ''[[eveyla akuru]]'' script, which is found in historical recording of kings (''raadhavalhi''). Later a script called ''[[dhives akuru]]'' was used for a long period. The present-day script is called [[Thaana]] and is written from right to left. Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Mohamed Thakurufaanu]].\n\nEnglish is widely spoken by the locals of the Maldives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maldives.tourism-srilanka.com/travel-tips/language.html|title=Maldives Languages \u2013 Languages of Maldives \u2013 Language Spoken In Maldives|website=maldives.tourism-srilanka.com}}</ref> Following the nation's opening to the outside world, the introduction of English as a medium of instruction at secondary and tertiary level of education, and its government's recognition of the opportunities offered through tourism, English has now firmly established itself in the country. As such, the Maldives are quite similar to the countries in the Gulf region (cf. Randall & Samimi, 2010; Boyle, 2012). The nation is undergoing vast societal change, and English is part of this.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meierkord|first=Christiane|date=March 2018|title=English in paradise: the Maldives: English is rapidly establishing itself as a second language in a society transforming from fishing to tourism and trade|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-today/article/english-in-paradise-the-maldives/84E0B35287213D3E1A7645FFD32BC16D|journal=English Today|volume=34|issue=1|pages=2\u201311|doi=10.1017/S0266078417000475|issn=0266-0784}}</ref>\n\n===Population by locality===\n{{Largest cities of the Maldives}}\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of the Maldives}}\n\n{{see also|Maldivian cuisine|Maldivian folklore}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2011}}\n\n[[File:Maahefun Fuvahmulah.JPG|thumb|Maahefun Festival in [[Fuvahmulah]]]]\n\nThe culture of the Maldives is influenced by the cultures of the people of different ethnicities who have settled on the islands\u00a0throughout the times.\n\nSince the 12th century AD there were also influences from [[Arabia]] in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean. This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east.\n\nReflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesised, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.<ref>Marcus, Anthony. 2012.

International travel is available on Government owned [[Island Aviation Services]] (branded as Maldivian) operates to nearly all Maldives domestic airports with several [[Bombardier Dash 8]] aircraft and one [[A320]] with international service to India, Bangladesh, China and Thailand.\n\nIn Maldives there are three main ways to travel between islands: by domestic flight, by [[seaplane]] or by boat.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131218100252/http://www.elitedivingagency.com/maldives/ Maldives \u2013 \u00c9lite Diving Agency].

Retrieved on 29 January 2014.</ref> For several years there were two seaplane companies operating: TMA ([[Trans Maldivian Airways]]) and [[Maldivian Air Taxi]], but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA. The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s. There is also another airline, [[Flyme (Villa Air)|Flyme]], which operates using [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] planes to domestic airports, principally [[Villa International Airport|Maamigili]], [[Dharavandhoo Airport|Dharavandhoo]] and some others. [[Manta Air]] begins its first scheduled seaplane service. Its seaplane fleet is made up of [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]] aircraft. In addition to the seaplane service, [[Manta Air]] utilizes [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR 72-600]] aircraft to operate domestic flights to [[Dhaalu Airport]], [[Dharavandhoo Airport]] and [[Kooddoo Airport]] from the main [[Velana International Airport]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Manta Air begins its first scheduled seaplane service |url=https://corporatemaldives.com/manta-air-begins-its-first-scheduled-seaplane-service/ |website=corporatemaldives.com |accessdate=14 December 2019}}</ref> Depending on the distance of the destination island from the airport, resorts organise [[speedboat]] transfers or [[seaplane]] flights directly to the resort island jetty for their guests. Several daily flights operate from [[Velana International Airport]] to the 12 domestic and international airports in the country. Scheduled ferries also operate from [[Mal\u00e9]] to many of the atolls. The traditional Maldivian boat is called [[dhoni]]. Speedboats and seaplanes tend to be more expensive, while travel by dhoni, although slower, is relatively cheaper and convenient.\n\n==Education==\nThe [[Maldives National University]] is one of the country's three institutions of higher education. Its mission statement is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>To create, discover, preserve and disseminate knowledge that are necessary to enhance the lives and livelihoods of people and essential for the cultural, social and economic development of the society so that this nation shall remain free and Islamic forever.<ref name=MNU>{{cite web|url=http://mnu.edu.mv/vision-mission/|title=The Maldives National University|website=mnu.edu.mv}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1973, the Allied Health Services Training Centre (the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences) was established by the Ministry of Health. The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades. In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry. In 1991, the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services. In 1998, the Maldives College of Higher Education was founded. The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999. In 2000 the college launched its first degree programme: Bachelor of Arts. On 17 January 2011 the Maldives National University Act was passed by the President of the Maldives; The Maldives National University was named on 15 February 2011.<ref name=MNU />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Index of Maldives-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Maldives]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* ''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''.

The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], early Maldive [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|scripts]], architecture, ruling institutions, customs, and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.<ref>Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands.''

The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, originate from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.\n\nBuddhist (and Hindu) temples were [[Mandala]] shaped. They are oriented according to the four cardinal points with the main gate facing east.

Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad ibn Abdullah, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective.

Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.\n\nCompared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Q\u0101sim]] had converted large swathes of [[Sindh]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sindh\u2014perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.\n\nMiddle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]\u2014widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast\u2014and coir fiber. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal\u2013Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ|title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History|first=P.|last=Boomgaard|date=1 January 2008|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9789004253995}}</ref>\n\nThe other essential product of the Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].\n\n===Colonial period===\n[[File:ConstantinoBraganca.jpg|thumb|left|[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese presence]] in the Maldives was established in 1558, by order of [[Constantino of Braganza]], Viceroy of [[Portuguese India]].]]\n[[File:Codice Casanatense Maldivans.jpg|thumb|16th-century Portuguese illustration from the [[C\u00f3dice Casanatense]], depicting workers]]\n[[File:18th-century Maldives map by Pierre Mortier.jpg|thumb|18th-century map by [[Pierre Mortier]] from the [[Netherlands]], depicting with detail the islands of the Maldives]]\nIn 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a ''Viador'' (''Viyazoru''), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'u\u1e93am]] and his two brothers, that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National Day.\n\nIn the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.\n\nThe British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[Protected state|British protected area]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].\n\nIn the British period, the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.\n\nMaldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Muhammad Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalized the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Mal\u00e9 eventually ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.\n\n[[File:Royal Air Force Operations in the Far East, 1941-1945 CF620.jpg|thumb|An [[RAF]] [[Short Sunderland]] moored in the lagoon at Addu Atoll, during WWII]]\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands. In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost [[Addu Atoll]], employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Seenu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afif]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital. One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Mal\u00e9 with government police, and Abdulla Afif went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period, with the payment of \u00a3750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently-stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.<ref name=\"gan.philliptsmall.me.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===Independence and republic===\n\n[[File:Flag of the Sultan of the Maldives.png|thumb|Flag of the [[List of sultans of the Maldives|Sultan of the Maldives]]]]\n\nIn line with the broader British policy of decolonisation, on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, Prime Minister, and on behalf of the British government by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador-designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in [[Colombo]]. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi|Sir Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King upon independence.\n\nOn 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, 40 voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.\n\n[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was [[Kurumba Maldives]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 people living in the Maldives.<ref>\"[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives \u2013 Population\". Library of Congress Country Studies]</ref>\n\nPolitical infighting during the 1970s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export.  With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.\n\n[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Maumoon's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Maumoon's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Maumoon was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.<ref name=\"cnn_sinking\">{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT</ref>\n\nA series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80 strong mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] who seized the airport and caused Maumoon to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1600 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian troops]] airlifted into [[Mal\u00e9]] restored order.\n\nA November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, a small-businessman.

Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season associated with the southwest monsoon which brings strong winds and storms.\n\nThe shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of November. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages {{convert|254|cm}} in the north and {{convert|381|cm}} in the south.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maldives \u2013 Atlapedia Online|url=http://www.atlapedia.com/online/countries/maldives.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe monsoonal influence is greater in the north of the Maldives than in the south, more influenced by the [[Equatorial Counter Current|equatorial currents]].\n\nThe average high temperature is 31.5 degree Celsius and the average low temperature is 26.4 degree Celsius.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n{{Weather box|location = Mal\u00e9

The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.\n\nAs a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints. In 2019, Maldives signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters. The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner. Maritime pollution control exercises are conducted regularly on an annual basis for familiarisation and handling of such hazardous situations.\n\n===Human rights===\n{{main|Human rights in the Maldives}}\nHuman rights in the Maldives is a contentious issue.

Natural atolls are labelled in light blue. [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Atolls_of_the_maldives.png Full view of the map].]]\nThe Maldives has twenty-six natural [[Atolls of the Maldives|atolls]] and few island groups on isolated reefs, all of which have been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions (17 administrative atolls and cities of [[Mal\u00e9]], [[Addu City|Addu]], [[Fuvahmulah]] and [[Kulhudhuffushi]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/umv.html |title=Maldives Atolls|publisher=Statoids.com|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nEach atoll is administered by an elected Atoll Council. The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.\n\nIn addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as \"[[Haa Alif]]\" for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo.  Since most atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">''Divehiraajjege J\u014dgraf\u012bge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee</ref>\n\nThe introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name. Under such circumstances it is hard to know which is the correct name to use.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Economy==\n{{main|Economy of the Maldives}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:The western side (382669110).jpg|thumb|left|Mal\u00e9 harbour]]\n\n[[File:Maldives treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Maldives's product exports in 28 color-coded categories]]\n\nHistorically, the Maldives provided enormous quantities of [[cowry]] shells, [[history of money|an international currency of the early ages]].

The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as [[coir]] rope, [[ambergris]] (Maavaharu), and [[coco de mer]] (Tavakkaashi) with neighboring countries and [[East Asian]] countries.\n\nThe Maldivian government began a largely successful [[economic reform]] programme in the 1980s, initiated by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to the private sector. At the time [[tourism]] sector which would play a significant role in the nation's development was at its infant stage.\n\nAgriculture and manufacturing continue to play lesser roles in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{main|Tourism in the Maldives|Diving in the Maldives|List of mosques in the Maldives}}\n\n[[File:Filitheyo bar.jpg|thumb|left|Filitheyo island beach with tall palm trees and blue fresh lagoons]]\n\nThe Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s. Only 189 islands are home to its 447,137 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web |title=Discover the islands |url=https://islands.mv/ |website=islands.mv}}</ref> The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.\n\nThe development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the [[Economy of the Maldives|country's economy]]. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/coup-what-coup-tourists-ignore-maldives-turmoil-20120213-1t0wi.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Coup?

In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP. {{As of|2008}}, 89 resorts in the Maldives offered over 17,000 beds and hosted over 600,000 tourists annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.mv/ |title=Ministry of Tourism.

Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.\n\nThe [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.\n\n{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{main|Demographics of the Maldives}}\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2012}}\n\n[[File:Male-total.jpg|thumb|[[Mal\u00e9]], the capital of the Maldives]]\n\n[[File:Population estimates of Maldives.png|thumb|Demographics of the Maldives, from 2000 to 2012]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\" |Population{{UN_Population|ref}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Census population by Sex and Sex ratio, 1911 \u2013 2014 |url=http://statisticsmaldives.gov.mv/yearbook/statisticalarchive/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/table2.1.pdf |publisher=National Bureau of Statistics, Maldives.}}</ref>\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Thousands\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1911 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|72\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1966 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|100\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|270\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2019 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|533\n|}\n\nThe largest ethnic group is [[Dhivehis|Dhivehin]], i.e. the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India.

Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century. The islands have had a long history of [[Sufi]]c orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried [[saint]]s. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of Maldives's [[cultural heritage]].\n\nOther aspects of [[tassawuf]], such as ritualised [[dhikr]] ceremonies called Maul\u016bdu ([[Mawlid]])\u2014the [[liturgy]] of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodical tone\u2014existed until very recent times. These Maul\u016bdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.\n\nAccording to Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari, sailing from [[Morocco]]. He is also referred to as [[Tabrizugefaanu]]. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Medhu Ziyaaraiy, across the street from the Friday Mosque, or [[Mal\u00e9 Friday Mosque|Hukuru Miskiy]], in Mal\u00e9.

This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east.\n\nReflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades.
