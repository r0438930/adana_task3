It is the home stadium of two [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchises, the [[New York Giants]] and the [[New York Jets]], as well as the [[New York Guardians]] of the [[XFL (2020)|XFL]]. Originally known as '''New Meadowlands Stadium''' upon opening in 2010, its naming rights were acquired in 2011 by New York City-based insurance company [[MetLife]]. The stadium is owned by the MetLife Stadium Company, a joint venture of the Giants and Jets, which privately financed the construction of the venue on land belonging to the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]]. At an approximate cost of $1.6&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive stadium ever built at the time that it opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalprosports.com/2011/10/27/11-most-expensive-stadiums-in-the-world/|title=11 Most Expensive Stadiums In The World|author=Esteban|date=October 27, 2011|publisher=Total Pro Sports|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAs [[Giants Stadium]] approached 30 years of age, it was becoming one of the older stadiums in the NFL. The Jets, who had been the tenants at the stadium, sought to have their own stadium built in [[Manhattan]] proper, the proposed [[West Side Stadium]]. Originally intended to be the 85,000-seat main stadium for [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|New York's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics]], it was designed to be downsized to 75,000 seats for the Jets. However, the West Side Stadium would have required significant public funding; progress halted in 2005 due to opposition from a number of sources, including [[Cablevision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ny.curbed.com/2015/1/30/9997132/how-the-new-york-jets-very-nearly-got-a-west-side-stadium|title=How the New York Jets Very Nearly Got a West Side Stadium|date=2015-01-30|website=Curbed NY|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref> The Jets then entered into a joint venture with the Giants to build a new stadium in which the two teams would be equal partners.\n\nMetLife Stadium is the only current NFL stadium shared by two clubs. In 2020, it will be joined by [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California]] which will be home to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and [[Los Angeles Chargers]]. Los Angeles' [[Staples Center]], which is home to the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] and the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), is the only other facility to currently house two teams from the same sports league in the United States. Additionally, it is the fourth building in the New York metropolitan area to be home to multiple teams from the same sports league, after the [[Polo Grounds]], which was home to [[San Francisco Giants|the baseball Giants]] and [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] from 1903 to 1922, and [[Shea Stadium]], which housed both the Yankees and [[New York Mets|Mets]] during the 1974 and 1975 seasons.\n\n==Design==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Newmeadowlands1207.jpg|image2=Giant's Stadium Old and New.jpg|width=200|caption2=Construction on MetLife Stadium, as seen in 2007 (top) and 2008 (bottom) near Giants Stadium}}\nThe architects were tasked with designing a neutral stadium that would still embody the distinct personalities of both franchises. The Giants favored a traditional look of exposed steel framework and rusticated stone while the Jets wanted a sleek and modern look highlighted by metal and glass. With those features in mind the designers used the column/tower dynamic seen in many of Manhattan's [[skyscrapers]] as inspiration for the stadium's design.<ref name=\"New Meadowlands Stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2010/10/new-meadowlands-stadium/|title=New Meadowlands Stadium|last=|first=|date=October 15, 2010|website=The Architects Newspaper|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe base of the stadium's facade is clad in [[limestone]]-like stonework while the rest of the stadium is distinguished by an outer skin of [[aluminum]] [[louver]]s and glass and by interior lighting capable of switching colors, depending on which team is currently playing\u2013blue for the Giants and green for the Jets.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=Kaleidoscope of Colors Coming to New Stadium|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 5, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/sports/football/05stadium.html|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref> This idea originated at the [[Allianz Arena]] in [[Munich]], Germany; which was previously shared between the city's two major [[association football|soccer]] clubs, [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen|1860 Munich]].

The panels generate about 350 KW, nearly 25 times the amount of electricity that's actually needed to power the LED display system.

The two teams leased the parcel of land on which the stadium stands from the NJSEA for a 25-year term, with options to extend it which could eventually reach 97 years. After the 15th year of the lease, and every five years, hence; one of the two teams may opt out of the lease after giving the state 12 months notice. The first such opportunity to opt out will occur in 2025 with a notice date of 2024. There will then be an opportunity to opt out in 2030, 2035, 2040, etc... However, if one team leaves for a new stadium, the other team would have to remain for the remainder of the lease. However, the high cost of building and relocating to a stadium makes it very unlikely. The teams also get parking revenue from the Meadowlands' western parking lots year round, even when there are no events at the stadium (this would occur when other parts of the Meadowlands host events).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/sports/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports-0%2F1166680667100530.xml&coll=1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918023654/http://www.nj.com/sports/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports-0%2F1166680667100530.xml&coll=1 |archive-date=September 18, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Naming rights===\n[[Allianz]], a financial services and insurance company based in [[Munich]], Germany, expressed interest in purchasing naming rights to the stadium.

The agreement includes strategies to reduce air pollution, conserve water and energy, improve waste management, and reduce the environmental impact of construction. The goal of the agreement is to save the emission of nearly 1.68&nbsp;million metric tons of carbon dioxide during the stadium's construction and its first year of operation. Under this agreement, the stadium construction must use around 40,000 tons of recycled steel, recycle 20,000 tons of steel from Giants Stadium, install seating made from recycled plastic and scrap iron, and reduce air pollution from construction vehicles by using cleaner diesel fuel, diesel engine filters, and minimizing engine idle times. Other goals of this agreement include providing mass transit options for fans and replacing traditional concession plates, cups and carries with compostable alternatives.

It is the home stadium of two [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchises, the [[New York Giants]] and the [[New York Jets]], as well as the [[New York Guardians]] of the [[XFL (2020)|XFL]]. Originally known as '''New Meadowlands Stadium''' upon opening in 2010, its naming rights were acquired in 2011 by New York City-based insurance company [[MetLife]]. The stadium is owned by the MetLife Stadium Company, a joint venture of the Giants and Jets, which privately financed the construction of the venue on land belonging to the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]]. At an approximate cost of $1.6&nbsp;billion, it was the most expensive stadium ever built at the time that it opened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalprosports.com/2011/10/27/11-most-expensive-stadiums-in-the-world/|title=11 Most Expensive Stadiums In The World|author=Esteban|date=October 27, 2011|publisher=Total Pro Sports|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAs [[Giants Stadium]] approached 30 years of age, it was becoming one of the older stadiums in the NFL. The Jets, who had been the tenants at the stadium, sought to have their own stadium built in [[Manhattan]] proper, the proposed [[West Side Stadium]]. Originally intended to be the 85,000-seat main stadium for [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics|New York's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics]], it was designed to be downsized to 75,000 seats for the Jets. However, the West Side Stadium would have required significant public funding; progress halted in 2005 due to opposition from a number of sources, including [[Cablevision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ny.curbed.com/2015/1/30/9997132/how-the-new-york-jets-very-nearly-got-a-west-side-stadium|title=How the New York Jets Very Nearly Got a West Side Stadium|date=2015-01-30|website=Curbed NY|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref> The Jets then entered into a joint venture with the Giants to build a new stadium in which the two teams would be equal partners.\n\nMetLife Stadium is the only current NFL stadium shared by two clubs. In 2020, it will be joined by [[SoFi Stadium]] in [[Inglewood, California]] which will be home to the [[Los Angeles Rams]] and [[Los Angeles Chargers]]. Los Angeles' [[Staples Center]], which is home to the [[Los Angeles Clippers|Clippers]] and the [[Los Angeles Lakers|Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), is the only other facility to currently house two teams from the same sports league in the United States. Additionally, it is the fourth building in the New York metropolitan area to be home to multiple teams from the same sports league, after the [[Polo Grounds]], which was home to [[San Francisco Giants|the baseball Giants]] and [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] from 1903 to 1922, and [[Shea Stadium]], which housed both the Yankees and [[New York Mets|Mets]] during the 1974 and 1975 seasons.\n\n==Design==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Newmeadowlands1207.jpg|image2=Giant's Stadium Old and New.jpg|width=200|caption2=Construction on MetLife Stadium, as seen in 2007 (top) and 2008 (bottom) near Giants Stadium}}\nThe architects were tasked with designing a neutral stadium that would still embody the distinct personalities of both franchises. The Giants favored a traditional look of exposed steel framework and rusticated stone while the Jets wanted a sleek and modern look highlighted by metal and glass. With those features in mind the designers used the column/tower dynamic seen in many of Manhattan's [[skyscrapers]] as inspiration for the stadium's design.<ref name=\"New Meadowlands Stadium\">{{cite web|url=https://archpaper.com/2010/10/new-meadowlands-stadium/|title=New Meadowlands Stadium|last=|first=|date=October 15, 2010|website=The Architects Newspaper|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=July 10, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe base of the stadium's facade is clad in [[limestone]]-like stonework while the rest of the stadium is distinguished by an outer skin of [[aluminum]] [[louver]]s and glass and by interior lighting capable of switching colors, depending on which team is currently playing\u2013blue for the Giants and green for the Jets.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=Kaleidoscope of Colors Coming to New Stadium|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 5, 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/sports/football/05stadium.html|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}</ref> This idea originated at the [[Allianz Arena]] in [[Munich]], Germany; which was previously shared between the city's two major [[association football|soccer]] clubs, [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[TSV 1860 M\u00fcnchen|1860 Munich]].

The Solar Ring consists of 1,350 building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) [[solar panels]] assembled into 47 individual frames. The BIPV panels are illuminated with LED lighting and programmed to display the signature blue and green colors of the Giants and the Jets along with other hues for events such as concerts, soccer matches and college sports. The panels generate about 350 KW, nearly 25 times the amount of electricity that's actually needed to power the LED display system. The excess power generated can go into the general stadium use or back to the grid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dlrgroup.com/work/metlife-stadium-solar-ring/|title=MetLife Stadium Solar Ring|publisher=DLR Group|date=2012|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nrg.com/renewables/projects/business/metlife-stadium/|title=MetLife Stadium Solar Ring lighted with a programmable, customizable multi-color LED array|publisher=NRG Energry|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Technical agreements==\n\n===Lease terms===\n[[File:Meadowlands Sports Complex - kingsley - 04-JUL-09.JPG|thumb|right|View of MetLife Stadium (under construction) and Giants Stadium (on right) in July 2009]]\nThe two teams formed the New Meadowlands Stadium Company, LLC (now MetLife Stadium Company), a 50/50 joint venture, to build and operate the stadium. The two teams leased the parcel of land on which the stadium stands from the NJSEA for a 25-year term, with options to extend it which could eventually reach 97 years. After the 15th year of the lease, and every five years, hence; one of the two teams may opt out of the lease after giving the state 12 months notice. The first such opportunity to opt out will occur in 2025 with a notice date of 2024. There will then be an opportunity to opt out in 2030, 2035, 2040, etc... However, if one team leaves for a new stadium, the other team would have to remain for the remainder of the lease. However, the high cost of building and relocating to a stadium makes it very unlikely. The teams also get parking revenue from the Meadowlands' western parking lots year round, even when there are no events at the stadium (this would occur when other parts of the Meadowlands host events).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nj.com/sports/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports-0%2F1166680667100530.xml&coll=1 |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 1, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918023654/http://www.nj.com/sports/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports-0%2F1166680667100530.xml&coll=1 |archive-date=September 18, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Naming rights===\n[[Allianz]], a financial services and insurance company based in [[Munich]], Germany, expressed interest in purchasing naming rights to the stadium.

The agreement includes strategies to reduce air pollution, conserve water and energy, improve waste management, and reduce the environmental impact of construction. The goal of the agreement is to save the emission of nearly 1.68&nbsp;million metric tons of carbon dioxide during the stadium's construction and its first year of operation. Under this agreement, the stadium construction must use around 40,000 tons of recycled steel, recycle 20,000 tons of steel from Giants Stadium, install seating made from recycled plastic and scrap iron, and reduce air pollution from construction vehicles by using cleaner diesel fuel, diesel engine filters, and minimizing engine idle times. Other goals of this agreement include providing mass transit options for fans and replacing traditional concession plates, cups and carries with compostable alternatives. The New Meadowlands Stadium Corporation is to report the progress on its goals to EPA every six months. Based on the reports, the EPA has stated it will quantify the benefits of the venue's environmental efforts.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|date=June 1, 2009|title=EPA, New York Giants and New York Jets Team Up to Make New Meadowlands Stadium a Beacon of \"Green\"|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/EB8BD7874DB85F38852575C8005452A8|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=EPA, New Meadowlands Stadium Developers Lay Green Groundwork|url=http://concreteproducts.com/architectural-structural-prestressed/meadowlands-stadium-groundwork-20090701/|work=Concrete Products|date=July 1, 2009|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Accessibility and transportation==\n[[File:Meadowlands Station Terminus.jpg|thumb|right|Meadowlands station provides New Jersey Transit rail service to MetLife Stadium on game days]]\nMetLife Stadium is accessible by car via Exit 16W on the western spur of the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) and is also located adjacent to [[New Jersey Route 3|NJ Route 3]] and [[New Jersey Route 120|NJ Route 120]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metlifestadium.com/getting-here/directions|title=Directions|website=metlifestadium.com|accessdate=August 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Coach USA]] provides the [[List of NJ Transit bus routes (300\u2013399)|351 Meadowlands Express Bus]] service between MetLife Stadium and the [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coachusa.com/info/coachusa/ss.351express.asp|title=351 Meadowlands Express|work=Coach USA|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030090206/http://www.coachusa.com/info/coachusa/ss.351express.asp|archive-date=October 30, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[New Jersey Transit Bus Operations|New Jersey Transit]] provides the [[List of NJ Transit bus routes (300\u2013399)|353 Bus]] service for select events between MetLife Stadium and [[Secaucus Junction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njtransit.com/sf/sf_servlet.srv?hdnPageAction=MeadowlandsTo|title=Shuttle Bus Access to the Meadowlands Sports Complex from Secaucus|publisher=NJ Transit|accessdate=July 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Meadowlands Rail Line]] operates on event days between [[Meadowlands station]] and [[Hoboken Terminal]] via Secaucus Junction, where there is connecting service to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)]], [[Pennsylvania Station (Newark)]], and other [[New Jersey Transit rail operations]].
