Walker]] to explain patterns of behavior in an [[abusive]] relationship. The phrase is also used more generally to describe any set of conditions which perpetuate abusive and dysfunctional relationships, such as in poor child rearing practices which tend to get passed down. Walker used the term more narrowly, to describe the cycling patterns of calm, violence, and reconciliation within an abusive relationship. Critics suggest the theory was based on inadequate research criteria, and cannot therefore be generalized upon. \n\n==Overview==\n[[Lenore E. Walker]] interviewed 1,500 women who had been subject to [[domestic violence]] and found that there was a similar pattern of abuse, called the \"cycle of abuse\".<ref>Bonnie S. Fisher; Steven P. Lab. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8kHrWPLLX54C&pg=PA257 Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention]''. SAGE Publications; 2 February 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-6047-2}}. p. 257.</ref> Initially, Walker proposed that the cycle of abuse described the controlling [[patriarchal]] behavior of men who felt entitled to abuse their wives to maintain control over them. Her terms \"the battering cycle\" and \"battered woman syndrome\" has since been largely eclipsed by \"cycle of abuse\" and \"[[battered person syndrome]]\", respectively, for many reasons: to maintain objectivity; because the cycle of abuse doesn't always lead to physical abuse; because symptoms of the syndrome have been observed in men and women, and are not confined to marriage and dating. Similarly, Dutton (1994) writes, \"The prevalence of violence in homosexual relationships, which also appear to go through abuse cycles is hard to explain in terms of men dominating women.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dutton |first=Donald G. |year=1994 |title=Patriarchy And Wife Assault: The Ecological Fallacy |journal=Violence and Victims |volume=9 |number=2 |pages=167\u2013182 |url=http://lab.drdondutton.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DUTTON.-1994.-PATRIARCHY-AND-WIFE-ASSAULT-THE-ECOLOGICAL-FALLACY..pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141229141744/http://lab.drdondutton.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/DUTTON.-1994.-PATRIARCHY-AND-WIFE-ASSAULT-THE-ECOLOGICAL-FALLACY..pdf |archivedate=2014-12-29 |doi=10.1891/0886-6708.9.2.167 |pmid=7696196}}</ref>\n\nThe cycle of abuse concept is widely used in [[domestic violence]] programs, particularly in the United States. Critics have argued the theory is flawed as it does not apply as universally as Walker suggested, does not accurately or completely describe all abusive relationships, and may emphasize ideological presumptions rather than empirical data.<ref name=\"Dutton&Golant\">Dutton, Donald G. and Susan Golant. 1997.

It also builds as the result of illness, legal or financial problems, unemployment, or catastrophic events, like floods, rape or war.<ref name=\"Newman p. 9\" /> During this period, the abuser feels ignored, threatened, annoyed or wronged.

Alternatively, the victim may provoke the abuser to get the abuse over with, prepare for the violence or lessen the degree of injury. However, the abuser is never justified in engaging in violent or abusive behavior.<ref name=\"Johnson p. 31\" />\n\n===2: Acute violence===\nDuring this stage the abuser attempts to dominate their victim.  Outbursts of violence and abuse occur which may include [[verbal abuse]]<ref name=\"Newman p. 9\" /> and [[psychological abuse]].<ref name=\"Johnson p. 31\" />\n\nIn [[intimate partner violence]], children are negatively affected by having witnessed the violence, and the partner's relationship degrades as well. The release of energy reduces the tension, and the abuser may feel or express that the victim \"had it coming\" to them.<ref name=\"Newman p. 9\" />\n\n===3: Reconciliation/honeymoon===\nThe perpetrator may begin to feel remorse, guilty feelings, or fear that their partner will leave or call the police. The victim feels pain, fear, humiliation, disrespect, confusion, and may mistakenly feel responsible.<ref name=\"Newman p. 9\" />\n\nCharacterized by affection, apology, or, alternatively, ignoring the incident, this phase marks an apparent end of violence, with assurances that it will never happen again, or that the abuser will do their best to change. During this stage the abuser may feel or claim to feel overwhelming remorse and sadness. Some abusers walk away from the situation with little comment, but most will eventually [[Love bombing|shower the survivor with love and affection]]. The abuser may use [[Victim playing|self-harm or threats of suicide to gain sympathy]] and/or prevent the survivor from leaving the relationship. Abusers are frequently so convincing, and survivors so eager for the relationship to improve, that survivors (who are often worn down and confused by longstanding abuse) stay in the relationship.<ref name=\"Walker\" /><ref>Brewster, Susan ''Helping her get free'' Seal Press 2006 {{ISBN|1-58005-167-7}}</ref>\n\n===4: Calm===\nDuring this phase (which is often considered an element of the honeymoon/reconciliation phase), the relationship is relatively calm and peaceful. During this period the abuser may agree to engage in counselling, ask for forgiveness, and create a normal atmosphere. In intimate partner relationships, the perpetrator may buy presents or the couple may engage in passionate sex.<ref name=\"Newman p. 9\" /> Over time, the abuser's apologies and requests for forgiveness become less sincere and are generally stated to prevent separation or intervention.<ref name=\"Johnson p. 31\" /> However, interpersonal difficulties will inevitably arise, leading again to the tension building phase.<ref name=\"Newman p. 9\" /> The effect of the continual cycle may include loss of love, contempt, distress, and/or physical disability. Intimate partners may separate, divorce or, at the extreme, someone may be killed.<ref name=\"Newman p. 9\" />\n\n==Critiques==\nWalker's cycle of abuse theory was regarded as a revolutionary and important concept in the study of abuse and interpersonal violence,<ref name=\"Dutton&Golant\"/> which is a useful model, but may be simplistic. For instance, Scott Allen Johnson developed a 14-stage cycle that broke down the tension-building, acting-out and calm stages further. For instance, there are six stages in the \"escalation\" or tension building stage, which includes triggers, the victim feeling victimized, angry and depressed, isolation and revenge planning. These lead up to the assault by acting out the revenge plan, self-destructive behavior, victim grooming and the actual physical and/or sexual assault. This is followed by a sense of relief, fear of consequences, distraction, and rationalization of abuse.<ref>Scott Allen Johnson.

In some areas of psychological research, violence is thought rarely to be only a one-time event. When abuse occurs in a relationship, it is said that the odds of re-occurrence increase dramatically.\n\n'''Phase 1''': In this phase, tension is mounting within a home or situation. This is when minor conflicts occur and threats of violence may escalate.   The duration of this phase may last from a few hours to sometimes months.\n\n'''Phase 2''': In this phase, the actual hands on abuse often occurs. The abuser may slap, kick, choke, or even commit worse bodily harm to the victim. The use of sexual acts or the use of weapons may occur. It is in this phase that there are usually no witnesses and there is little the victim can do to stop the violence.\n\n'''Phase 3:''' The is often called the apology phase or the \"Honeymoon\" phase. The abuser may apologize and show great signs of remorse and beg for forgiveness. Often, the abuser will present gifts and tokens so that the victim will excuse the abuse. The abuser may even promise to seek treatment for the behavior and promise it will never happen again.\n\n'''Phase 4''': Phase 1 starts all over again in a vicious cycle. Unfortunately, the abuse begins again and most often the abuser is more violent and terrorizing in his/her acts. The victim is often injured to the point of hospitalization or worse and often can not find an escape out of the situation.\n\nThis cycle is seen as 'never ending', unless 'the victim' finds a way to physically leave the situation.\n\nCriticisms have been raised about the methodological limitations of the research from which this theory arises. While the theory 'fits' the anecdotal experience of many partners in abusive relationships, there are questions about its universal and determinist application as a prognostic tool. Coverage of this theory in the media and in popular self-help books is said to have distorted public perception of the complexity & diversity of relationship breakdown, and also contributed to the design of unsatisfactory interventions by the state in relationships.-->\n\n\n{{abuse}}\n{{Domestic violence}}\n\n[[Category:Abuse]]\n[[Category:Interpersonal relationships]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the cycle of violence within one person's pattern of abuse|a broader pattern of violence and intergenerational cycle of violence|Cycle of violence}}\n{{Lead too short|date=April 2020}}\n[[Image:Cycle of Abuse.png|thumb|400px|The four phases of the Cycle of Abuse]]\nThe '''cycle of abuse''' is a [[social cycle theory]] developed in 1979 by [[Lenore E.

The victim is often injured to the point of hospitalization or worse and often can not find an escape out of the situation.\n\nThis cycle is seen as 'never ending', unless 'the victim' finds a way to physically leave the situation.\n\nCriticisms have been raised about the methodological limitations of the research from which this theory arises. While the theory 'fits' the anecdotal experience of many partners in abusive relationships, there are questions about its universal and determinist application as a prognostic tool. Coverage of this theory in the media and in popular self-help books is said to have distorted public perception of the complexity & diversity of relationship breakdown, and also contributed to the design of unsatisfactory interventions by the state in relationships.-->\n\n\n{{abuse}}\n{{Domestic violence}}\n\n[[Category:Abuse]]\n[[Category:Interpersonal relationships]]\n", "name_user": "Elmo Twinge", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_of_abuse"}
