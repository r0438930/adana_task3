For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.\n\n== Airway ==\n{{main article|airway management}}\n\n=== Unconscious patients ===\nIn the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  Common problems with the airway of patient with a seriously reduced level of consciousness involve blockage of the [[human pharynx|pharynx]] by the [[tongue]], a [[foreign body]], or [[vomiting|vomit]].\n\nAt a basic level, opening of the airway is achieved through manual movement of the head using [[basic airway management|various techniques]], with the most widely taught and used being the \"head tilt \u2014 chin lift\", although other methods such as the \"modified [[jaw thrust]]\" can be used, especially where spinal injury is suspected,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement|title=Airway Management|accessdate=2008-12-19| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021030909/http://www.parasolemt.com.au/manual.php?subpage=airwaymanagement| archivedate= 21 October 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref> although in some countries, its use is not recommended for lay rescuers for safety reasons.<ref name=rsukbls>{{cite journal|url=http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|title=Adult Basic Life Support|journal=Resuscitation UK Guidelines|publisher=Resuscitaton Council (UK)|page=14|accessdate=2008-12-19|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051202034805/http://www.resus.org.uk/pages/bls.pdf|archivedate=2 December 2005}}</ref>\n\nHigher level practitioners such as [[emergency medical service]] personnel may use more [[invasive airway management|advanced techniques]], from [[oropharyngeal airway]]s to [[intubation]], as deemed necessary.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Grande, Christopher M. |author2=S\u00f8reide, Eldar |title=Prehospital trauma care |publisher=Marcel Dekker |location=New York, N.Y |year=2001 |pages=211 |isbn=978-0-8247-0537-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Conscious patients===\nIn the conscious patient, other signs of airway obstruction that may be considered by the rescuer include paradoxical chest movements, use of accessory muscles for breathing, tracheal deviation, noisy air entry or exit, and [[cyanosis]].<ref name=rsukils>{{cite book|title=Immediate Life Support|publisher=Resuscitation Council(UK)|author1=Soar, J |author2=Nolan, J|author3= Perkins, G|author4= Scott, M|author5= Goodman, N|author6= Mitchell, S|year=2006|isbn=978-1-903812-12-9}}</ref>\n\n== Breathing ==\n\n===Unconscious patients===\nIn the unconscious patient, after the airway is opened the next area to assess is the patient's breathing,<ref name=rsukbls/> primarily to find if the patient is making normal respiratory efforts.

Clinicians may be able to get a working diagnosis from abnormal movement or shape of the chest in cases such as [[pneumothorax]] or [[haemothorax]]\n* Listening to external breath sounds a short distance from the patient can reveal dysfunction such as a rattling noise (indicative of secretions in the airway) or [[stridor]] (which indicates airway obstruction)\n* Checking for [[surgical emphysema]] which is air in the subcutaneous layer which is suggestive of a [[pneumothorax]]\n* [[Auscultation]] and [[Percussion (medicine)|percussion]] of the chest by using a [[stethoscope]] to listen for normal chest sounds or any abnormalities\n* Pulse oximetry may be useful in assessing the amount of oxygen present in the blood, and by inference the effectiveness of the breathing\n\n== Circulation ==\nOnce oxygen can be delivered to the lungs by a clear airway and efficient breathing, there needs to be a circulation to deliver it to the rest of the body.\n\n===Non-breathing patients===\nCirculation is the original meaning of the \"C\" as laid down by Jude, Knickerbocker & Safar, and was intended to suggest assessing the presence or absence of circulation, usually by taking a [[carotid]] [[pulse]], before taking any further treatment steps.\n\nIn modern protocols for lay persons, this step is omitted as it has been proven that lay rescuers may have difficulty in accurately determining the presence or absence of a pulse, and that, in any case, there is less risk of harm by performing chest compressions on a beating heart than failing to perform them when the heart is not beating.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cjstudios.com/Aquatics/new_cpr_standards.htm|title=New CPR Standards|accessdate=2008-12-19}}</ref> For this reason, lay rescuers proceed directly to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, starting with chest compressions, which is effectively artificial circulation.

This can be performed peripherally, usually on a fingernail bed, or centrally, usually on the sternum or forehead\n* Pulse checks, both centrally and peripherally, assessing rate (normally 60-80 beats per minute in a resting adult), regularity, strength, and equality between different pulses\n* Blood pressure measurements can be taken to assess for signs of shock\n* Auscultation of the heart can be undertaken by medical professionals\n* Observation for secondary signs of circulatory failure such as edema or frothing from the mouth (indicative of congestive heart failure)\n* ECG monitoring will allow the healthcare professional to help diagnose underlying heart conditions, including [[myocardial infractions]]\n\n== Variations ==\nNearly all first aid organisations use \"ABC\" in some form, but some incorporate it as part of a larger initialism, ranging from the simple 'ABCD' (designed for training lay responders in defibrillation) to 'AcBCDEEEFG'{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} (the UK ambulance service version for patient assessment).\n\n===ABCD===\nThere are several protocols taught which add a D to the end of the simpler ABC (or DR ABC).

For this reason, maintaining circulation is vital to moving oxygen to the tissues and carbon dioxide out of the body.\n\nAirway, breathing, and circulation, therefore work in a cascade; if the patient's [[airway]] is blocked, [[breath]]ing will not be possible, and [[oxygen]] cannot reach the [[lungs]] and be transported around the body in the [[blood]], which will result in hypoxia and cardiac arrest. Ensuring a clear airway is therefore the first step in treating any patient; once it is established that a patient's airway is clear, rescuers must evaluate a patient's breathing, as many other things besides a blockage of the airway could lead to an absence of breathing.\n\n===CPR===\nThe basic application of the ABC principle is in [[first aid]], and is used in cases of [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] patients to start treatment and assess the need for, and then potentially deliver, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]].\n\nIn this simple usage, the rescuer is required to open the [[airway]] (using a technique such as ''\"head tilt - chin lift\"''), then check for normal [[breath]]ing.<ref name=rsukbls/>  These two steps should provide the initial assessment of whether the patient will require CPR or not.\n\nIn the event that the patient is not breathing normally, the current international guidelines (set by the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] or ILCOR) indicate that chest compressions should be started.\n\nPreviously, the guidelines indicated that a pulse check should be performed after the breathing was assessed, and this made up the 'circulation' part of the initialism, but this pulse check is no longer recommended for lay rescuers.  Some trainers continue to use circulation as the label for the third step in the process, since performing chest compressions is effectively artificial circulation, and when assessing patients who are breathing, assessing 'circulation' is still important.  However, some trainers now use the C to mean Compressions in their basic first aid training.\n\n== Airway ==\n{{main article|airway management}}\n\n=== Unconscious patients ===\nIn the unconscious patient, the priority is [[airway management]], to avoid a preventable cause of [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].
