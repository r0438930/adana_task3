Shackleton had originally intended to go to the [[Arctic]] and explore the [[Beaufort Sea]], but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. ''Quest'', smaller than any recent [[List of Antarctic expeditions|Antarctic exploration]] vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]].\nThe major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, [[Frank Wild]]. The shortcomings of [[Quest]] were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than [[20th meridian east|longitude 20\u00b0E]], well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the [[pack ice]]. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting [[Elephant Island]] where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']], during Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] six years earlier.\nWild had thoughts of a second, more productive season in the ice, and took the ship to [[Cape Town]] for a [[refit]]. Here, in June 1922, he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. The ''Quest'' voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, due to the event that defines it in public memory, overshadowing its other activities, Shackleton's untimely death.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Shackleton after the ''Endurance''===\nShackleton returned to Britain from the ''Endurance'' expedition in late May 1917, while [[World War I]] was under way. Many of his men enlisted promptly upon their return.  Too old to enlist, Shackleton nevertheless sought an active role in the war effort,<ref>Huntford, p. 649</ref> and eventually departed for [[Murmansk]] with the temporary army rank of [[major (United Kingdom)|major]], as part of a military mission to North Russia. Shackleton expressed his dissatisfaction with this role in letters home: \"I feel I am no use to anyone unless I am outfacing the storm in wild lands.\"<ref>Fisher, p. 435</ref> He returned to England in February 1919 and began plans to set up a company that would, with the cooperation of the [[White movement|North Russian Government]], develop the natural resources of the region.<ref>Fisher, p. 437</ref> This scheme came to nothing, as the [[Red Army]] took control of that part of Russia during the [[Russian Civil War]]; to provide himself with an income, Shackleton had to rely on the lecture circuit. During the winter of 1919\u201320 he lectured twice a day, six days a week, for five months.<ref name=Fisher441>Fisher, p. 441</ref>\n\n=== Canadian proposal ===\n[[File:Sea ice terrain.jpg|thumb|alt=Panoramic view of a field of ridged ice stretching towards the horizon|Dense pack ice in the [[Beaufort Sea]]]]\nDespite the large debts still outstanding from the ''Endurance'' expedition, Shackleton's mind turned towards another exploration venture.<ref name=Fisher441/> He decided to turn away from the Antarctic, go northwards and, as he put it, \"fill in this great blank now called the [[Beaufort Sea]]\".<ref name=Fisher442>Fisher, pp. 442\u2013445.</ref> This area of the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the north of [[Alaska]] and west of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], was largely unexplored; Shackleton believed, on the basis of tidal records, that it contained large undiscovered land masses that \"would be of the greatest scientific interest to the world, apart from the possible economic value\".<ref name=Fisher442/>\n\nShackleton also hoped to reach the northern [[pole of inaccessibility]], the most remote point in the Arctic regions.<ref>Wild, p. 2.</ref> In March 1920, his plans received the general approval of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and were supported by the Canadian government. On this basis Shackleton set about acquiring the necessary funding, which he estimated at \u00a350,000.<ref name=Fisher442/><ref>Over \u00a32&nbsp;million at 2016 values.{{cite web|title=Measuring Worth|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/|publisher=Institute for the Measurement of Worth|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, Shackleton met by chance an old school-friend, [[John Quiller Rowett]], who agreed to put up a nucleus of cash to get Shackleton started. With this money, in January 1921, Shackleton purchased the wooden Norwegian [[whaler]] ''Foca I'' together with other equipment, and began the process of hiring of a crew.<ref name=Fisher442/>\n\nIn May 1921, the policy of the Canadian government towards Arctic expeditions changed with the advent of a new prime minister, [[Arthur Meighen]], who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal.<ref name=Huntford680>Huntford, pp. 680\u2013682.</ref> Shackleton was required to rethink his plans, and decided to sail for the Antarctic instead. A varied programme of exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in the [[Southern Ocean]] would replace the abandoned Beaufort Sea venture.<ref name=Fisher442/>\n\n==Antarctic preparation==\n===Objectives===\n[[File:Shack-endurance.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Head and shoulders of a dark-haired man looking directly to camers. The straps of a harness over his shoulders are visible.|Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]], the expedition's leader]]\nEven before his problems with the Canadian government, Shackleton had been considering a southern expedition as a possible alternative to the Beaufort Sea. According to the RGS librarian [[Hugh Robert Mill]], as early as March 1920 Shackleton had talked about two possible schemes\u2014the Beaufort Sea exploration, and \"an oceanographical expedition with the object of visiting all the little-known islands of the [[Borders of the oceans#South Atlantic|South Atlantic]] and [[Borders of the oceans#South Pacific|South Pacific]]\".<ref>Mills, p. 287</ref> By June 1921, the latter plan had expanded to include a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and the mapping of around 2,000&nbsp;miles (3,200&nbsp;km) of uncharted coastline. It would also encompass a search for \"lost\" or wrongly charted sub-Antarctic islands (including [[Dougherty Island]], [[Tuanaki]], and the [[Nimrod Islands]]),<ref>Harrington, p. 1</ref><ref name=\"Spokesman-Review\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FrFXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uPMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6442,621950&dq=quest+south+georgia&hl=en|title=Shackleton, Antarctic Explorer, is Dead|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|location=Spokane, Washington|accessdate=2012-03-17|format=}}</ref> and would investigate possible mineral resources to be exploited in these rediscovered lands.

As the result of publicity organised by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper, these two had been selected to join the expedition out of around 1,700&nbsp;Scouts who had applied to go.<ref>Fisher, p.&nbsp;454.</ref> Mooney, who was from the [[Orkney Islands]], dropped out during the voyage south, leaving the ship at [[Madeira]] after suffering chronic seasickness.<ref name=Wild32>Wild, p.&nbsp;32.</ref> Marr, an 18-year-old from [[Aberdeen]], remained throughout, winning plaudits from Shackleton and Wild for his application to the tasks at hand.

Marr wrote in his diary that it was as though \"all London had conspired together to bid us a heartening farewell\".<ref name=Fisher460/>\n\nShackleton's original intention was to sail down to [[Cape Town]], visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, ''Quest'' would head for the [[Enderby Land]] coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards [[Coats Land]] in the [[Weddell Sea]]. At the end of the summer season the ship would visit [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] before returning to Cape Town for [[refit]]ting and preparation for the second year's work.<ref name=Fisher460/> The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in [[Lisbon]], and further stops in Madeira and the [[Cape Verde Islands]].<ref name=Leif292>Mills, pp. 292\u201393</ref> These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards [[Rio de Janeiro]], where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. ''Quest'' reached Rio on 22 November 1921.<ref name=Leif292/>\n\nThe engine overhaul, and the replacement of a damaged topmast,<ref>Wild, p. 44</ref> delayed the party in Rio for four weeks. This meant that it was no longer practical to proceed to Cape Town and then on to the ice. Shackleton decided to sail directly to [[Grytviken]] harbour in South Georgia.<ref name=Fisher466>Fisher, pp. 466\u201367</ref> Equipment and stores that had been sent on to Cape Town would have to be sacrificed, but Shackleton hoped that this shortfall could be made up in South Georgia.<ref name=Fisher466/> He was vague about the direction the expedition should take after South Georgia; Macklin wrote in his diary, \"The Boss says...quite frankly that he does not know what he will do.\"<ref name=Fisher471>Fisher, pp. 471\u201373</ref><ref>Huntford, p. 688</ref>\n\n=== Death of Shackleton ===\n[[File:1989 shackleton-grave hg.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A tall stone column stands over a grave on which rest various memorabilia including a bunch of flowers.

He also began drinking [[champagne]] each morning, \"to deaden the pain\", contrary to his normal rule of not allowing liquor at sea.<ref name=Fisher471/>\n\nA severe storm ruined the expedition's proposed Christmas celebrations, and a new problem with the engine's steam furnace slowed progress and caused Shackleton further stress.<ref>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;473\u2013476.</ref> By 1 January 1922, the weather had abated: \"Rest and calm after the storm&nbsp;\u2013 the year has begun kindly for us\", wrote Shackleton in his diary.<ref name=Shackdiary>{{cite web|last=Shackleton|first=Ernest|title=Diary of the ''Quest'' Expedition 1921\u20131922|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/archives/shackleton/articles/1537,3,9.html|publisher=[[Scott Polar Research Institute]]|location=Cambridge|accessdate=3 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 January, South Georgia was sighted, and late that morning ''Quest'' anchored at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton returned to the ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 294\"/><ref name=Fisher476>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;476\u2013477.</ref> \"The old smell of dead whale permeates everything\", he wrote. \"It is a strange and curious place&nbsp;... A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay.\"<ref name=Shackdiary/> Later he slept and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty.<ref name=Fisher476/>\n\nShortly after 02:00 on the morning of 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial [[neuralgia]], and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: \"You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?\" Macklin replied, \"Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you.\" Immediately afterwards Shackleton \"had a very severe [[paroxysmal attack|paroxysm]], during which he died\".<ref>Macklin diary, quoted by Fisher, p.&nbsp;477.</ref><ref>Huntford, p.&nbsp;690.</ref>\n\nThe death certificate, signed by Macklin, gave the cause as \"Atheroma of the Coronary arteries and Heart failure\"\u2014in modern terms, [[coronary thrombosis]].<ref name=Fisher478/> Later that morning, Wild, now in command, gave the news to the shocked crew, and told them that the expedition would carry on.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;66.</ref> The body was brought ashore for embalming before its return to England. On 19 January, Leonard Hussey accompanied the body on board a steamer bound for [[Montevideo]], but on arrival there he found a message from [[Emily Shackleton]], requesting that the body be returned to South Georgia for burial.<ref name=Fisher478/>\n\nHussey brought the body back to Grytviken,<ref name=Fisher478>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;478\u2013481.</ref> where Shackleton was buried on 5 March in the Norwegian cemetery. ''Quest'' had meantime sailed, so only Hussey of Shackleton's former comrades was present at the interment.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;69.</ref> A rough cross marked the burial site, until it was replaced by a tall granite column six years later.<ref>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;480\u2013481.</ref>\n\n=== Voyage to the ice ===\n[[File:Quest Antarctica.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Chart of an area of sea in which an irregular line shows the passage of Quest|''Quest''{{'}}s route from 3 to 24&nbsp;February 1922 shows their repeated attempts to penetrate the [[pack ice]]<ref>Based on Wild, pp.&nbsp;98\u2013137.</ref>]]\nAs leader, Wild had to arrange where the expedition should now go. Kerr reported that a longstanding problem with the ship's furnace was manageable and, after supplementing stores and equipment, Wild decided to proceed generally in accordance with Shackleton's original intentions. He would take the ship eastward towards [[Bouvet Island]] and then beyond, before turning south to enter the ice as close as possible to Enderby Land, and begin coastal survey work there. The expedition would also investigate an appearance of land in the mouth of the Weddell Sea, reported by [[James Clark Ross]] in 1842, but not seen since. Ultimately, progress would depend on weather, ice conditions, and the capabilities of the ship.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;73\u201375, 78\u201379.</ref>\n\n''Quest'' left South Georgia on 18 January, heading south-east towards the [[South Sandwich Islands]]. There was a heavy [[swell (ocean)|swell]], such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its [[gunwale]]s below the waves, filling the [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|waist]] with water.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;82\u201387.</ref> As they proceeded, Wild wrote that ''Quest'' rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan at the end of January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them to the edge of the [[pack ice]] on 4&nbsp;February.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;88\u201391, 98.</ref>\n\n\"Now the little ''Quest'' can really try her mettle\", wrote Wild, as the ship entered the loose pack.<ref name=Wild98>Wild, pp.&nbsp;98\u201399.</ref> He noted that ''Quest'' was the smallest ship ever to attempt to penetrate the heavy Antarctic ice, and pondered on the fate of others. \"Shall we escape, or will the ''Quest'' join the ships in Davy Jones's Locker?\"<ref name=Wild98/> During the days that followed, as they moved southward in falling temperatures, the ice thickened. On 12 February, they reached the most southerly latitude they would attain, [[69th parallel south|69\u00b017'S]], and their most easterly longitude, [[17th meridian east|17\u00b09'E]], well short of Enderby Land. Noting the state of the sea ice and fearing being frozen in, Wild retreated to the north and west.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;115\u2013121.</ref>\n\nHe still hoped to tackle the heavy ice, and if possible, break through to the hidden land beyond. On 18 February, he turned the ship south again for another try, but was no more successful than before.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;132.</ref> On 24 February, after a series of further efforts had failed, Wild set a course westward across the mouth of the Weddell Sea towards [[Elephant Island]], where Wild and 21&nbsp;others had been stranded during Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] six years earlier. They would then return to South Georgia before the onset of winter.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;136.</ref>\n\nFor the most part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea proceeded uneventfully. There was a growing level of unrest among the crew, perhaps provoked by disappointment with the apparent aimlessness of the voyage; Worsley in particular was critical of Wild's leadership.<ref>Mills, pp.&nbsp;302\u2013303.</ref> Wild, in his own account, dealt with this discontent by the threat of \"the most drastic treatment\".<ref>Wild, pp. &nbsp;137\u2013139.</ref> On 12 March, they reached [[64th parallel south|64\u00b011'S]], [[46th meridian west|46\u00b04'W]], which was the area where Ross had recorded an appearance of land in 1842, but there was no sign of it, and a depth sounding of over {{convert|2300|fathom}} indicated no likelihood of land nearby.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;144.</ref> From 15 to 21 March, ''Quest'' was frozen into the ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. Wild hoped that the diminished fuel supply could be supplemented by [[blubber]] from the seals at Elephant Island.<ref>Mills, p.&nbsp;304.</ref>\n\nOn 25 March, the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, the site of the old ''Endurance'' expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this.

Shackleton had originally intended to go to the [[Arctic]] and explore the [[Beaufort Sea]], but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. ''Quest'', smaller than any recent [[List of Antarctic expeditions|Antarctic exploration]] vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]].\nThe major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, [[Frank Wild]]. The shortcomings of ''Quest'' were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than [[20th meridian east|longitude 20\u00b0E]], well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the [[pack ice]]. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting [[Elephant Island]] where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship [[Endurance (1912 ship)|''Endurance'']], during Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] six years earlier.\nWild had thoughts of a second, more productive season in the ice, and took the ship to [[Cape Town]] for a [[refit]]. Here, in June 1922, he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. The ''Quest'' voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, due to the event that defines it in public memory, overshadowing its other activities: Shackleton's untimely death.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Shackleton after the ''Endurance''===\nShackleton returned to Britain from the ''Endurance'' expedition in late May 1917, while [[World War I]] was under way. Many of his men enlisted promptly upon their return.  Too old to enlist, Shackleton nevertheless sought an active role in the war effort,<ref>Huntford, p. 649</ref> and eventually departed for [[Murmansk]] with the temporary army rank of [[major (United Kingdom)|major]], as part of a military mission to North Russia. Shackleton expressed his dissatisfaction with this role in letters home: \"I feel I am no use to anyone unless I am outfacing the storm in wild lands.\"<ref>Fisher, p. 435</ref> He returned to England in February 1919 and began plans to set up a company that would, with the cooperation of the [[White movement|North Russian Government]], develop the natural resources of the region.<ref>Fisher, p. 437</ref> This scheme came to nothing, as the [[Red Army]] took control of that part of Russia during the [[Russian Civil War]]; to provide himself with an income, Shackleton had to rely on the lecture circuit. During the winter of 1919\u201320 he lectured twice a day, six days a week, for five months.<ref name=Fisher441>Fisher, p. 441</ref>\n\n=== Canadian proposal ===\n[[File:Sea ice terrain.jpg|thumb|alt=Panoramic view of a field of ridged ice stretching towards the horizon|Dense pack ice in the [[Beaufort Sea]]]]\nDespite the large debts still outstanding from the ''Endurance'' expedition, Shackleton's mind turned towards another exploration venture.<ref name=Fisher441/> He decided to turn away from the Antarctic, go northwards and, as he put it, \"fill in this great blank now called the [[Beaufort Sea]]\".<ref name=Fisher442>Fisher, pp. 442\u2013445.</ref> This area of the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the north of [[Alaska]] and west of the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], was largely unexplored; Shackleton believed, on the basis of tidal records, that it contained large undiscovered land masses that \"would be of the greatest scientific interest to the world, apart from the possible economic value\".<ref name=Fisher442/>\n\nShackleton also hoped to reach the northern [[pole of inaccessibility]], the most remote point in the Arctic regions.<ref>Wild, p. 2.</ref> In March 1920, his plans received the general approval of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and were supported by the Canadian government. On this basis Shackleton set about acquiring the necessary funding, which he estimated at \u00a350,000.<ref name=Fisher442/><ref>Over \u00a32&nbsp;million at 2016 values.{{cite web|title=Measuring Worth|url=http://www.measuringworth.com/ppoweruk/|publisher=Institute for the Measurement of Worth|accessdate=23 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, Shackleton met by chance an old school-friend, [[John Quiller Rowett]], who agreed to put up a nucleus of cash to get Shackleton started. With this money, in January 1921, Shackleton purchased the wooden Norwegian [[whaler]] ''Foca I'' together with other equipment, and began the process of hiring of a crew.<ref name=Fisher442/>\n\nIn May 1921, the policy of the Canadian government towards Arctic expeditions changed with the advent of a new prime minister, [[Arthur Meighen]], who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal.<ref name=Huntford680>Huntford, pp. 680\u2013682.</ref> Shackleton was required to rethink his plans, and decided to sail for the Antarctic instead. A varied programme of exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in the [[Southern Ocean]] would replace the abandoned Beaufort Sea venture.<ref name=Fisher442/>\n\n==Antarctic preparation==\n===Objectives===\n[[File:Shack-endurance.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Head and shoulders of a dark-haired man looking directly to camers. The straps of a harness over his shoulders are visible.|Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]], the expedition's leader]]\nEven before his problems with the Canadian government, Shackleton had been considering a southern expedition as a possible alternative to the Beaufort Sea. According to the RGS librarian [[Hugh Robert Mill]], as early as March 1920 Shackleton had talked about two possible schemes\u2014the Beaufort Sea exploration, and \"an oceanographical expedition with the object of visiting all the little-known islands of the [[Borders of the oceans#South Atlantic|South Atlantic]] and [[Borders of the oceans#South Pacific|South Pacific]]\".<ref>Mills, p. 287</ref> By June 1921, the latter plan had expanded to include a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and the mapping of around 2,000&nbsp;miles (3,200&nbsp;km) of uncharted coastline. It would also encompass a search for \"lost\" or wrongly charted sub-Antarctic islands (including [[Dougherty Island]], [[Tuanaki]], and the [[Nimrod Islands]]),<ref>Harrington, p. 1</ref><ref name=\"Spokesman-Review\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FrFXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uPMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6442,621950&dq=quest+south+georgia&hl=en|title=Shackleton, Antarctic Explorer, is Dead|work=[[The Spokesman-Review]]|location=Spokane, Washington|accessdate=2012-03-17|format=}}</ref> and would investigate possible mineral resources to be exploited in these rediscovered lands.

[[Grytviken]] Harbour is indicated on the northern shore.]]\n''Quest'' sailed from [[St Katharine Docks]], London, on 17 September 1921, after inspection by King [[George V]].<ref>Huntford, p. 683</ref> Large crowds gathered on the banks of the river and on the bridges, to witness the event. Marr wrote in his diary that it was as though \"all London had conspired together to bid us a heartening farewell\".<ref name=Fisher460/>\n\nShackleton's original intention was to sail down to [[Cape Town]], visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, ''Quest'' would head for the [[Enderby Land]] coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards [[Coats Land]] in the [[Weddell Sea]]. At the end of the summer season the ship would visit [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] before returning to Cape Town for [[refit]]ting and preparation for the second year's work.<ref name=Fisher460/> The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in [[Lisbon]], and further stops in Madeira and the [[Cape Verde Islands]].<ref name=Leif292>Mills, pp. 292\u201393</ref> These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards [[Rio de Janeiro]], where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. ''Quest'' reached Rio on 22 November 1921.<ref name=Leif292/>\n\nThe engine overhaul, and the replacement of a damaged topmast,<ref>Wild, p. 44</ref> delayed the party in Rio for four weeks. This meant that it was no longer practical to proceed to Cape Town and then on to the ice. Shackleton decided to sail directly to [[Grytviken]] harbour in South Georgia.<ref name=Fisher466>Fisher, pp. 466\u201367</ref> Equipment and stores that had been sent on to Cape Town would have to be sacrificed, but Shackleton hoped that this shortfall could be made up in South Georgia.<ref name=Fisher466/> He was vague about the direction the expedition should take after South Georgia; Macklin wrote in his diary, \"The Boss says...quite frankly that he does not know what he will do.\"<ref name=Fisher471>Fisher, pp. 471\u201373</ref><ref>Huntford, p. 688</ref>\n\n=== Death of Shackleton ===\n[[File:1989 shackleton-grave hg.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A tall stone column stands over a grave on which rest various memorabilia including a bunch of flowers. The stone is inscribed: \"Ernest Henry Shackleton, Explorer, Born 15th February 1874. Died 5th January 1922\".|Shackleton's grave]]\nOn 17 December 1921, the day before ''Quest'' was due to leave Rio, Shackleton fell ill. He may have suffered a heart attack;<ref>Huntford, p.&nbsp;687.</ref> Macklin was called, but Shackleton refused to be examined and declared himself \"better\" the next morning.<ref name=Fisher471/><ref name=\"Mills, p. 294\">Mills, p.&nbsp;294,</ref> On the ensuing voyage to South Georgia he was, from the accounts of his shipmates, unusually subdued and listless. He also began drinking [[champagne]] each morning, \"to deaden the pain\", contrary to his normal rule of not allowing liquor at sea.<ref name=Fisher471/>\n\nA severe storm ruined the expedition's proposed Christmas celebrations, and a new problem with the engine's steam furnace slowed progress and caused Shackleton further stress.<ref>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;473\u2013476.</ref> By 1 January 1922, the weather had abated: \"Rest and calm after the storm&nbsp;\u2013 the year has begun kindly for us\", wrote Shackleton in his diary.<ref name=Shackdiary>{{cite web|last=Shackleton|first=Ernest|title=Diary of the ''Quest'' Expedition 1921\u20131922|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/archives/shackleton/articles/1537,3,9.html|publisher=[[Scott Polar Research Institute]]|location=Cambridge|accessdate=3 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 January, South Georgia was sighted, and late that morning ''Quest'' anchored at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton returned to the ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 294\"/><ref name=Fisher476>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;476\u2013477.</ref> \"The old smell of dead whale permeates everything\", he wrote. \"It is a strange and curious place&nbsp;... A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay.\"<ref name=Shackdiary/> Later he slept and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty.<ref name=Fisher476/>\n\nShortly after 02:00 on the morning of 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial [[neuralgia]], and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: \"You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?\" Macklin replied, \"Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you.\" Immediately afterwards Shackleton \"had a very severe [[paroxysmal attack|paroxysm]], during which he died\".<ref>Macklin diary, quoted by Fisher, p.&nbsp;477.</ref><ref>Huntford, p.&nbsp;690.</ref>\n\nThe death certificate, signed by Macklin, gave the cause as \"Atheroma of the Coronary arteries and Heart failure\"\u2014in modern terms, [[coronary thrombosis]].<ref name=Fisher478/> Later that morning, Wild, now in command, gave the news to the shocked crew, and told them that the expedition would carry on.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;66.</ref> The body was brought ashore for embalming before its return to England. On 19 January, Leonard Hussey accompanied the body on board a steamer bound for [[Montevideo]], but on arrival there he found a message from [[Emily Shackleton]], requesting that the body be returned to South Georgia for burial.<ref name=Fisher478/>\n\nHussey brought the body back to Grytviken,<ref name=Fisher478>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;478\u2013481.</ref> where Shackleton was buried on 5 March in the Norwegian cemetery. ''Quest'' had meantime sailed, so only Hussey of Shackleton's former comrades was present at the interment.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;69.</ref> A rough cross marked the burial site, until it was replaced by a tall granite column six years later.<ref>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;480\u2013481.</ref>\n\n=== Voyage to the ice ===\n[[File:Quest Antarctica.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Chart of an area of sea in which an irregular line shows the passage of Quest|''Quest''{{'}}s route from 3 to 24&nbsp;February 1922 shows their repeated attempts to penetrate the [[pack ice]]<ref>Based on Wild, pp.&nbsp;98\u2013137.</ref>]]\nAs leader, Wild had to arrange where the expedition should now go. Kerr reported that a longstanding problem with the ship's furnace was manageable and, after supplementing stores and equipment, Wild decided to proceed generally in accordance with Shackleton's original intentions. He would take the ship eastward towards [[Bouvet Island]] and then beyond, before turning south to enter the ice as close as possible to Enderby Land, and begin coastal survey work there. The expedition would also investigate an appearance of land in the mouth of the Weddell Sea, reported by [[James Clark Ross]] in 1842, but not seen since. Ultimately, progress would depend on weather, ice conditions, and the capabilities of the ship.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;73\u201375, 78\u201379.</ref>\n\n''Quest'' left South Georgia on 18 January, heading south-east towards the [[South Sandwich Islands]]. There was a heavy [[swell (ocean)|swell]], such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its [[gunwale]]s below the waves, filling the [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|waist]] with water.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;82\u201387.</ref> As they proceeded, Wild wrote that ''Quest'' rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan at the end of January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them to the edge of the [[pack ice]] on 4&nbsp;February.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;88\u201391, 98.</ref>\n\n\"Now the little ''Quest'' can really try her mettle\", wrote Wild, as the ship entered the loose pack.<ref name=Wild98>Wild, pp.&nbsp;98\u201399.</ref> He noted that ''Quest'' was the smallest ship ever to attempt to penetrate the heavy Antarctic ice, and pondered on the fate of others. \"Shall we escape, or will the ''Quest'' join the ships in Davy Jones's Locker?\"<ref name=Wild98/> During the days that followed, as they moved southward in falling temperatures, the ice thickened. On 12 February, they reached the most southerly latitude they would attain, [[69th parallel south|69\u00b017'S]], and their most easterly longitude, [[17th meridian east|17\u00b09'E]], well short of Enderby Land. Noting the state of the sea ice and fearing being frozen in, Wild retreated to the north and west.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;115\u2013121.</ref>\n\nHe still hoped to tackle the heavy ice, and if possible, break through to the hidden land beyond. On 18 February, he turned the ship south again for another try, but was no more successful than before.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;132.</ref> On 24 February, after a series of further efforts had failed, Wild set a course westward across the mouth of the Weddell Sea towards [[Elephant Island]], where Wild and 21&nbsp;others had been stranded during Shackleton's [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] six years earlier. They would then return to South Georgia before the onset of winter.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;136.</ref>\n\nFor the most part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea proceeded uneventfully. There was a growing level of unrest among the crew, perhaps provoked by disappointment with the apparent aimlessness of the voyage; Worsley in particular was critical of Wild's leadership.<ref>Mills, pp.&nbsp;302\u2013303.</ref> Wild, in his own account, dealt with this discontent by the threat of \"the most drastic treatment\".<ref>Wild, pp. &nbsp;137\u2013139.</ref> On 12 March, they reached [[64th parallel south|64\u00b011'S]], [[46th meridian west|46\u00b04'W]], which was the area where Ross had recorded an appearance of land in 1842, but there was no sign of it, and a depth sounding of over {{convert|2300|fathom}} indicated no likelihood of land nearby.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;144.</ref> From 15 to 21 March, ''Quest'' was frozen into the ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. Wild hoped that the diminished fuel supply could be supplemented by [[blubber]] from the seals at Elephant Island.<ref>Mills, p.&nbsp;304.</ref>\n\nOn 25 March, the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, the site of the old ''Endurance'' expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this. They viewed the site through binoculars, picking out the old landmarks, before landing on the western coast to hunt for elephant seals.<ref name=Leif305>Mills, p.&nbsp;305.</ref> They were able to obtain sufficient blubber to mix with the coal so that, aided by a favourable wind, they reached South Georgia on 6 April.<ref name=Leif305/>\n\n=== Return ===\n[[File:Tristan Map.png|thumb|[[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Inaccessible Island]], and [[Gough Island]]]]\n''Quest'' remained in South Georgia for a month, during which time Shackleton's old comrades erected a memorial cairn to their former leader, on a headland overlooking the entrance to Grytviken harbour.<ref>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;482\u2013483.</ref> On 8 May 1922, ''Quest'' sailed for Cape Town, where Wild hoped to arrange a refit in preparation for a more productive second season in the ice. The first port of call was [[Tristan da Cunha]], a remote inhabited island to the west and south of Cape Town. After a rough crossing of the \"[[Roaring Forties]]\", ''Quest'' arrived there on 20&nbsp;May.<ref name=Leif306/> Following orders from [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], Marr presented a flag to the local Scout Troop.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shackleton-Rowett Expedition 50th anniversary, Tristan da Cunha|url=http://www.sossi.org/articles/tristan.htm|publisher=Scouts on Stamps Society International|accessdate=28 November 2008}}</ref><ref name=Wild232/>\n\nDuring the five-day stay, with the help of some of the islanders, the expedition made brief landings on the small [[Inaccessible Island]], {{convert|20|mi}} south-west of Tristan, and visited the even smaller [[Nightingale Island]], collecting specimens.<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;206\u2013214.</ref> Wild's impressions of the stay at Tristan were not altogether favourable. He noted the appalling squalor and poverty, and said of the population: \"They are ignorant, shut off almost completely from the world, horribly limited in outlook.\"<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;207.</ref>\n\nAfter the Scout parade and flag presentation, ''Quest'' sailed on to [[Gough Island]], {{convert|200|mi}} to the east,<ref name=Wild232>Wild, p.&nbsp;232.</ref> where members of the expedition took geological and botanical samples.<ref name=Leif306>Mills, pp.&nbsp;306\u2013308.</ref> They arrived at Cape Town on 18&nbsp;June, to be greeted by enthusiastic crowds. South African Prime Minister [[Jan Smuts]] gave an official reception, and they were honoured at dinners and lunches by local organisations.<ref name=Leif306/>\n\nThey were also met by Rowett's agent, with the message that they should return to England.<ref>Fisher, p. 483</ref> Wild wrote: \"I should have liked one more season in the Enderby Quadrant&nbsp;... much might be accomplished by making Cape Town our starting point and setting out early in the season.\"<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;287.</ref> On 19&nbsp;July, they left Cape Town and sailed north. Their final visits were to [[Saint Helena]], [[Ascension Island]] and [[S\u00e3o Vicente, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Vicente]]. On 16 September, one year after departure, they arrived at [[Plymouth]] harbour.<ref name=\"Wild313\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Assessment ===\n[[File:Quest Diagram.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Drawing of Quest with side removed to show interior organisations of the ship's cabins and compartments|''Quest''{{'}}s interior]]\nAccording to Wild, the expedition ended quietly, although his biographer Leif Mills writes of enthusiastic crowds in Plymouth Sound.<ref name=Wild312>Wild, pp.&nbsp;312\u2013313.</ref><ref>Mills, p.&nbsp;308.</ref> At the end of his account, Wild expressed the hope that the information they had brought back might \"prove of value in helping to solve the great natural problems that still beset us\".<ref name=Wild312/>\n\nThese results were summarised in five brief appendices to Wild's book.<ref>Wild, pp. 321\u2013349.</ref> The summaries reflected the efforts of the scientific staff to collect data and specimens at each port of call,<ref name=\"Mills, p. 307\">Mills, p.&nbsp;307.</ref> and the geological and survey work carried out by Carr and Douglas on South Georgia, before the southern voyage.<ref>Wild, p.&nbsp;80.</ref> Eventually a few scientific papers and articles were developed from this material,<ref>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;516\u2013517.</ref> but it was, in Leif Mills's words, \"little enough to show for a year's work\".<ref name=\"Mills, p. 307\"/>\n\nThe lack of a clear, defined expedition objective<ref>Huntford, p.&nbsp;464.</ref><ref name=Leif330>Mills, p.&nbsp;330.</ref> was aggravated by the failure to call at Cape Town on the way south, which meant that important equipment was not picked up. On South Georgia, Wild found little that could make up for this loss&nbsp;\u2013 there were no dogs on the island, so no sledging work could be carried out, which eliminated Wild's preferred choice of a revised expedition goal, an exploration of [[Graham Land]] on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].<ref>Wild, pp.&nbsp;74\u201375.</ref>\n\nThe death of Shackleton before the beginning of serious work was a heavy blow, and questions were raised about the adequacy of Wild as his replacement. Some reports imply that Wild drank heavily&nbsp;\u2013 \"practically an alcoholic\", according to Huntford.<ref>Huntford, p.&nbsp;693.</ref><ref>Mills, p.&nbsp;297.</ref> Mills suggests that even if Shackleton had lived to complete the expedition, it is arguable whether under the circumstances it could have achieved more than it did under Wild's command.<ref name=Leif330/>\n\nThe non-use of the aeroplane was a disappointment; Shackleton had hoped to pioneer the use of air transport in Antarctic waters, and had discussed this issue with the British [[Air Ministry]].<ref>Fisher, pp.&nbsp;447\u2013448.</ref> According to Fisher's account, essential aeroplane parts had been sent on to Cape Town, but remained uncollected.<ref>Fisher, p.&nbsp;452.</ref> The long-range, 220-volt wireless equipment did not work properly, and was abandoned early on.
