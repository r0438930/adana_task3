Bow shapes vary according to the speed of the boat, the seas or waterways being navigated, and the vessel's function. Where sea conditions are likely to promote [[Pitch (aviation)|pitching]], it is useful if the bow provides [[bouyancy|reserve bouyancy]]; a flared bow (a raked stem with flared topsides) is ideal to reduce the amount af water shipped over the bow.<ref>Note: Aside from making the deck slippery, salt water may corrode metal decks.

Large commercial barges on inland waterways rarely meet big waves and may have remarkably little [[freeboard]] at the bow, whereas fast miltary vessels operating offshore must be able to cope with heavy seas. On slower ships like tankers and barges, a fuller bow shape is used to maximise the volume of the ship for a given length.
