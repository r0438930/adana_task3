One day while having a visit from his friend Doctor Herdal, Solness is visited by Hilda Wangel, a young woman of 23, whom Doctor Herdal recognizes from a recent trip that he had taken. The doctor leaves, Solness is alone with Hilda, and she reminds him that they are not strangers &ndash; they have previously met in her home town 10 years ago when she was 13 years old. When Solness does not respond immediately, she reminds him that at one point during their encounter he had made advances to her, had offered her a romantic interlude, and promised her \"a kingdom\", all of which she believed. He denies this. She gradually convinces him, however, that she can assist him with his household duties, and so he takes her into his home.\n\nSolness is also the manager of an architectural office in which he employs Knut Brovik, his son Ragnar Brovik, and Kaia Fosli. Kaia and Ragnar are romantically linked, and Ragnar has ambitions to become promoted in his architectural vocation, which Solness is reluctant to grant or support. Solness also has a complicated relationship with his wife Aline, and the two are revealed to have lost children some years ago as a result of a fire. During this time, Solness builds a closer tie with Hilda while she is in his home, and she supports his architectural vocation and new projects.\n\nDuring the construction of his most recent project which includes a towering steeple, Hilda learns that Solness suffers from [[acrophobia]], a morbid fear of extreme heights, but nonetheless she encourages him to climb the steeple to the top at the public opening of the newly completed building. Solness, inspired by her words, achieves the top of the tower, when he suddenly loses his footing and crashes to his death on the ground before the spectators who have arrived for the opening of the new building. Among the spectators standing aghast at the sight, only Hilda comes forward as if in silent triumph. She waves her shawl and cries out with wild intensity. \u201cMy\u2014my Master Builder!\u201d\n\n== Plot interpretation ==\nThe search for a meaning, or interpretation has engaged and often bewildered audiences and critics all over the world. It is seen as an exploration of the author\u2019s autobiographical history, or of issues dealing with youth versus maturity, or of issues of psychology, and other possible interpretations.<ref>Ibsen, Henrik.

He had previously conceived these fortunate coincidences in his mind, powerfully wished for them to come to pass, but never actually did anything about them. By the time his wife's ancestral home was destroyed by a fire in a clothes cupboard, he had already imagined how he could cause such an accident and then profit from it by dividing the land on which the house stood into plots and covering it with homes for sale. Between this fortuitous occurrence and some chance misfortunes of his competitors, Solness comes to believe that he only has to wish for something to happen in order for it to come about.<ref>''Master Builder'', Act 2: \"desiring...craving ...willing a thing...so persistently that it has to happen\"</ref> He rationalises this as a particular gift from God, bestowed so that, through his unnatural success, he can carry out God's ordained work of church building.<ref>Act 3: \"He...gave me leave to lord it just as [I] pleased...so that I might build all the more glorious churches for him\".</ref>\n\n==Realism fused with symbolism==\nThis play contains realistic and symbolic elements fused together. It represents a movement from his earlier realistic plays, such as ''A Doll's House'', into a more symbolic style. It begins with realistic characters being presented, and then as the story progresses, it shifts into the inner world of the mind of the leading character.<ref>Hornby, Richard.

It was Raff who told Ibsen the story of the architect of [[St. Michael's Church, Munich]], who had cast himself from the tower as soon as it was finished. Ibsen took this tale, a common legend at many German churches, as evidence of a pervasive human belief that a man could not achieve success without paying a price.<ref name=\"Meyer1967\">{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Michael L.|authorlink=Michael Meyer (translator)|title=Ibsen: a biography|year=1967|publisher=Hart-Davis|location=London|isbn=0-246-64001-4|page=699}}</ref> From Ibsen's inscription in the copy of the play he sent to Raff (he sent no copy to Bardach), she too can be regarded as an inspiration for the unequal affair between Hilda and Solness.<ref> Templeton, Joan (1997). ''Ibsen's women''. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. p. 248.</ref> An equally obvious influence is Ibsen's relationship with [[Hildur Andersen]], whom he met as the 10-year-old child of friends and who, when she had reached the age of 27, became his constant companion.<ref name=\"Knapp1986\">{{cite book|last=Knapp|first=Bettina Liebowitz|title=Archetype, architecture, and the writer|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IA|isbn=0-253-30857-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/archetypearchite00knap/page/2 2]|chapter=Ibsen, 'The Master Builder'|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/archetypearchite00knap/page/2}}</ref> He wrote of Hildur as \"his bird of the woods\", the phrase he initially uses to describe his character Hilda, but the character refuses this, accepting only that she is a \"bird of prey\", as was Bardach. The character of Hilda is a blend of all three women, but Hildur Andersen was the most significant.<ref>Templeton (1997: 262)</ref>\n\nThe autobiographical elements Ibsen includes go further than his relationships with Bardach, Raff and Andersen: In the character of Solness, Ibsen is drawing parallels with his own situation as the \"master playwright\" and the consequences in his own life. That Ibsen was offering a parable was noted in a review of the first London staging, when the joint translator, Edmund Gosse, was asked to explain the meaning of the work. \"An allegory of Dr Ibsen's literary career\", he replied.<ref name =Moy>{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=W.

The more charitable reviews took Solness at his own assessment, as a madman, and decided the other two protagonists were mad as well. Some transferred the conclusion to Ibsen, his translators and his director.<ref name=\"Egan1997\">{{cite book|last=Egan|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Egan (author)|title=Henrik Ibsen: the critical heritage|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-15950-4|page=20}}</ref> Even ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', a champion of Ibsen's work, offered sympathy to the \"daring\" actors whose mediocre talents were unable to relieve the tedium of this lapse on the part of the  \"northern genius\".<ref>{{cite journal|date=21 February 1893|title='The Master Builder' at the Trafalgar Square|journal=[[Pall Mall Gazette]]|location=London|issue=8712}}</ref> ''[[The Daily Graphic (UK)|The Daily Graphic]]'', however, found the performances of Waring and Robins the \"redeeming feature\" of the production.<ref name=\"Moy\" /> At the end of the run at the Trafalgar Theatre, the two principals engaged a new supporting cast and secured a transfer to the nearby [[Vaudeville Theatre]] but, again, reviews were hostile.<ref>{{cite journal|date=11 March 1893|title=The London Theatres: The Vaudeville|journal=[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]|location=London|issue=2842|page=9}}</ref>\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n''The Master Builder'' was the first work Ibsen wrote upon his return to [[Norway]] from Europe in July 1891. It is usually grouped with Ibsen's other works written during this late period of Ibsen's life such as ''[[Little Eyolf]]'', ''[[John Gabriel Borkman]]'', ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]''. Early reactions to the play by Ibsen's critics were mixed, possibly due its heightened ambiguities. Hilda, for example, seems to alternate roles between an inspiring force, urging Solness to temper his rampant ambition and so find real happiness, and a temptress, pushing Solness to commitments he cannot possibly fulfill. English critic William Archer (the play's original translator) suggests that the play is not as completely symbolic as some have maintained, interpreting it instead as \"a history of a sickly conscience, worked out in terms of pure psychology\". He notes that, in this regard, the play is similar to earlier works that deal mainly with a retrospective look at a character's psyche.<ref name=\"Archer 1893\"/>\n\n==Translations==\nThe authoritative translation in the English language for Ibsen remains the 1928 10-volume version of the ''Complete Works of Henrik Ibsen'' from Oxford University Press. Many other translations of individual plays by Ibsen have appeared since 1928 though none have purported to be a new version of the complete works of Ibsen.\n\nThe [[Kannada]] translation is titled ''Baalura Gudikaara'' written by B Suresh. It was performed by Vijayanagara Bimba in 2018(''Temple Builder of Baaluru'').{{cn|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nThe 2008 [[Malayalam language|Malayalam-language]] Indian film ''[[Aakasha Gopuram]]'' is an adaptation of the play. Directed by [[K.P. Kumaran]], the film starred [[Mohanlal]] as Albert Samson, the master builder, and [[Nithya Menen]] as his wife. Development of the film began in late-1980s but Kumaran wanted the role of the master builder to be done by Mohanlal, and he had to wait for nearly two decades for Mohanlal to get the matured look of Halvard Solness. The film started filming in early-2008 and was released in August.\n\nThe 2013 film ''[[A Master Builder]]'' (working title: ''Fear of Falling'') was directed by [[Jonathan Demme]]. It stars [[Wallace Shawn]] who previously had translated and adapted it for the stage in collaboration with [[Andre Gregory]]. This stage adaptation was the basis for the film.\n\nThe German director [[:de:Michael Klette|Michael Klette]] adapted this story for his movie ''[[:de:Solness|Solness]]'' (2015).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Americana Poster|Master Builder, The|The Master Builder}}\n* {{ibdb show|5941}}\n* {{gutenberg|no=4070|name=The Master Builder}}\n* {{gutenberg|no=19858|name=Konstruestro Solness}} {{in lang|eo}}\n* {{librivox book | title=The Master Builder | author=Henrik Ibsen}}\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357895/ Internet Movie Database] 1960 television version\n\n{{Henrik Ibsen}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Master Builder, The}}\n[[Category:1892 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Henrik Ibsen]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox play\n| name       = The Master Builder\n| image      = File:294 1Ibsenn.jpg\n| image_size = \n| caption    = \n| writer     = [[Henrik Ibsen]]\n| chorus     = \n| characters = \n| mute       = \n| setting    = \n| premiere   = 19 January 1893\n| place      = [[Lessing Theater|Lessing Theatre]]\n| orig_lang  =\n| series     = \n| subject    = \n| genre      = [[Drama]]\n| web        = \n}}\n\n'''''The Master Builder''''' ({{lang-no|'''Bygmester Solness'''}}) is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] by Norwegian [[playwright]] [[Henrik Ibsen]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gosse|first1=Edmund|authorlink1=Edmund Gosse|last2=Archer|first2=William|authorlink2=William Archer (critic)|title=The Master Builder, a play in three acts|year=1893|publisher=William Heinemann|location=London|oclc=8666013}}</ref>\n\nIt was first published in December [[1892 in literature|1892]] and is regarded as one of Ibsen's most significant and revealing works.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Beyer|first1=Harald |authorlink1=Harald Beyer (literary historian)|last2=Haugen|first2=Einar|authorlink2=Einar Haugen|title=A history of Norwegian literature|year=1956|publisher=New York University Press|page=267|oclc=771031}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bygmester Solness - Henrik Ibsen (1828-1906) - \u0152uvre - Ressources de la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|url=http://data.bnf.fr/13754243/henrik_ibsen_bygmester_solness|website=data.bnf.fr|date=1 January 1892}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nThe play was published by [[Gyldendal| Gyldendal AS]] in Copenhagen in 1892 and its first performance was on 19 January 1893 at the [[Lessing Theater|Lessing Theatre]] in Berlin, with [[Emanuel Reicher]] as Solness.

That Ibsen was offering a parable was noted in a review of the first London staging, when the joint translator, Edmund Gosse, was asked to explain the meaning of the work. \"An allegory of Dr Ibsen's literary career\", he replied.<ref name =Moy>{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=W.

The more charitable reviews took Solness at his own assessment, as a madman, and decided the other two protagonists were mad as well.

It is usually grouped with Ibsen's other works written during this late period of Ibsen's life such as ''[[Little Eyolf]]'', ''[[John Gabriel Borkman]]'', ''[[When We Dead Awaken]]'', and ''[[Hedda Gabler]]''. Early reactions to the play by Ibsen's critics were mixed, possibly due its heightened ambiguities. Hilda, for example, seems to alternate roles between an inspiring force, urging Solness to temper his rampant ambition and so find real happiness, and a temptress, pushing Solness to commitments he cannot possibly fulfill. English critic William Archer (the play's original translator) suggests that the play is not as completely symbolic as some have maintained, interpreting it instead as \"a history of a sickly conscience, worked out in terms of pure psychology\". He notes that, in this regard, the play is similar to earlier works that deal mainly with a retrospective look at a character's psyche.<ref name=\"Archer 1893\"/>\n\n==Translations==\nThe authoritative translation in the English language for Ibsen remains the 1928 10-volume version of the ''Complete Works of Henrik Ibsen'' from Oxford University Press. Many other translations of individual plays by Ibsen have appeared since 1928 though none have purported to be a new version of the complete works of Ibsen.\n\nThe [[Kannada]] translation is titled ''Baalura Gudikaara'' written by B Suresh. It was performed by Vijayanagara Bimba in 2018(''Temple Builder of Baaluru'').{{cn|date=April 2015}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nThe 2008 [[Malayalam language|Malayalam-language]] Indian film ''[[Aakasha Gopuram]]'' is an adaptation of the play. Directed by [[K.P. Kumaran]], the film starred [[Mohanlal]] as Albert Samson, the master builder, and [[Nithya Menen]] as his wife. Development of the film began in late-1980s but Kumaran wanted the role of the master builder to be done by Mohanlal, and he had to wait for nearly two decades for Mohanlal to get the matured look of Halvard Solness. The film started filming in early-2008 and was released in August.\n\nThe 2013 film ''[[A Master Builder]]'' (working title: ''Fear of Falling'') was directed by [[Jonathan Demme]]. It stars [[Wallace Shawn]] who previously had translated and adapted it for the stage in collaboration with [[Andre Gregory]]. This stage adaptation was the basis for the film.\n\nThe German director [[:de:Michael Klette|Michael Klette]] adapted this story for his movie ''[[:de:Solness|Solness]]'' (2015).\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Americana Poster|Master Builder, The|The Master Builder}}\n* {{ibdb show|5941}}\n* {{gutenberg|no=4070|name=The Master Builder}}\n* {{gutenberg|no=19858|name=Konstruestro Solness}} {{in lang|eo}}\n* {{librivox book | title=The Master Builder | author=Henrik Ibsen}}\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0357895/ Internet Movie Database] 1960 television version\n\n{{Henrik Ibsen}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Master Builder, The}}\n[[Category:1892 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by Henrik Ibsen]]\n", "name_user": "Ayenaee", "label": "safe", "comment": "Importing Wikidatashort description: \"Play by Henrik Ibsen\" (Shortdesc helper)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Builder"}
