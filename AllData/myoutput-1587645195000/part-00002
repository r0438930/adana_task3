It is buoyant, widely available and easily worked. It is a popular material for small boats (of e.g. {{convert|6|m|adj=on}} length; such as dinghies and sailboats). Its abrasion resistance varies according to the hardness and density of the wood and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisms are allowed to penetrate the wood. Woods such as [[Teak]], [[Podocarpus totara|Totara]] and some [[Cedrus|cedar]]s have natural chemicals which prevent rot whereas other woods, such as [[Pinus radiata]], will rot very quickly. The hull of a wooden boat usually consists of planking fastened to frames and a keel. Keel and frames are traditionally made of hardwoods such as [[oak]] while planking can be [[oak]] but is more often softwood such as [[pine]], [[larch]] or [[Cedrus|cedar]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chapelle|first=Howard Irving|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkCNFCYSl_EC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&dq=FAST+boat+construction&hl=en|title=Boatbuilding: A Complete Handbook of Wooden Boat Construction|date=1994|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=978-0-393-03554-4|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Plywood]] is especially popular for amateur construction but only marine ply using waterproof glues and even laminates should be used. Cheap construction plywood often has voids in the interior layers and is not suitable to boat building as the voids trap moisture and accelerate rot as well as physically weaken the plywood. No plywood is rot resistant and should be coated with epoxy resin and/or a good paint system. Varnish and Linseed oil should not be used on the exterior of a hull for waterproofing. Varnish has about 60% of the water resistance of a good paint system. Only boiled linseed oil should be used on a boat and only in the interior as it has very little water resistance but it is very easy to apply and has a pleasant smell. Note that used linseed rags should not be left in a pile as they can catch fire. A valuable 200-year-old waka (Maori canoe) caught fire in New Zealand in June 2014 when restorers left rags piled overnight. Raw linseed oil is not suited to boats as it stays damp and oily for a long time. Mildew will grow well on raw linseed oil treated timber but not on boiled linseed oil. More recently introduced tropical woods as [[mahogany]], [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoum\u00e9]], [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]], [[Dipterocarpus|Keruing]], [[Lophira alata|azob\u00e9]] and [[Intsia bijuga|merbau]].<ref>Zeilen:Van beginner tot gevorderde by Karel Heijnen</ref> are also used. With tropical species, extra attention needs to be taken to ensure that the wood is indeed [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/land/forests/woodguide.asp |title=FSC certification |publisher=Nrdc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Teak or [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]] is usually used to create the deck and any superstructure. [[Adhesive|Glue]], [[screw]]s, [[rivets]] and/or [[nail (fastener)|nails]] are used to join the wooden components. Before teak is glued the natural oil must be wiped off with a chemical cleaner, otherwise the joint will fail.\n\nSome types of wood construction include:\n*'''[[carvel (boat building)|Carvel]]''', in which a smooth hull is formed by edge joined planks attached to a frame. The planks may be curved in cross section like barrel staves. Carvel planks are generally caulked with oakum or cotton that is driven into the seams between the planks and covered with some waterproof substance. It takes its name from an archaic ship type and is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean. A number of boat building texts are available which describe the carvel planking method in detail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notablemath.weebly.com/carvel-planking.html |title=Carvel Planking for Boats, Sailboats: Richard Joyce Montana Tech |publisher=Notablemath.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n*'''[[Clinker (boat building)|Clinker]]''' is a technique originally identified with the [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavia]]ns and [[Ingveonic]] people in which [[wood]]en planks are fixed to each other with a slight overlap that is beveled for a tight fit. The planks may be mechanically connected to each other with copper rivets, bent over iron nails, screws or in modern boats with adhesives. Often, [[steam bending|steam bent]] wooden ribs are fitted inside the hull.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Oughtred|first=Iain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVTIRC2A5kAC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA2&dq=Clinker+boat+construction&hl=en|title=Clinker Plywood Boatbuilding Manual|date=2000|publisher=WoodenBoat Books|year=|isbn=978-0-937822-61-6|location=|pages=2|language=en}}</ref>\n*[[Strip planking]] is yet another type of wooden boat construction similar to carvel. It is a glued construction method which is very popular with amateur boatbuilders as it is quick, avoids complex temporary jig work and does not require shaping of the planks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gartsideboats.com/faq2.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123155407/http://gartsideboats.com/faq2.php |archivedate=2010-11-23 |title=Planking Methods Comparison |publisher=Gartsideboats.com |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n* [[Sheet plywood boat building]] uses sheets of '''[[plywood|plywood panel]]'''s usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (sheer clamps) or intermediate stringers which are all bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called [[Chine (boating)|Ply on Frame construction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.net/article.pl?sid=07/10/17/1655255 |title=Ply on Frame construction |publisher=Boatbuilding.net |accessdate=2012-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183809/http://www.boatbuilding.net/article.pl?sid=07%2F10%2F17%2F1655255 |archivedate=2012-03-05 }}</ref> A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method is known as the [[stitch and glue|stitch-and-glue]] method,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glen-l.com/resources/glossary.html |title=Stitch and glue subdivision of sheet plywood method |publisher=Glen-l.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boatbuilder.org/stitchandglue.htm |title=Benefits of stitch and glue |publisher=Boatbuilder.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated \"WBP\" (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}} minimum) or are very thin (less than {{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) or high-grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine Okoume (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be \"A\" quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at {{convert|570|kg/m3|lb/cuft|abbr=on|disp=or}} it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 Okoume). Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and Okoume ply F8. Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the [[Vaurien]], Cherub, [[Tolman Skiff|Tolman]], Moth and P class  (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and [[Kolibri (keelboat)|Kolibri]]s (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bearfacemedia.co.uk/European_Dinghies.aspx|title=European Dinghies build by amateur builders |publisher=Bearfacemedia.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsnautiques.com/vaurien/txt_angl.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502141046/http://www.clubsnautiques.com/vaurien/txt_angl.htm |archivedate=2009-05-02 |title=Vaurien amateur building |publisher=Clubsnautiques.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Another variation is tortured ply where very thin({{convert|3|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.\n* '''[[Cold moulding]]''' is a composite method of wooden boat building that uses two or more layers of thin wood, called veneers, oriented in different directions, resulting in a strong monocoque structure, similar to a fibreglass hull but substantially lighter. Sometimes composed of a base layer of strip planking followed by multiple veneers. Sometimes just veneers are used.<ref>\u2033The Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction, Wood and West System Materials\u2033</ref> Cold-moulding is popular in small, medium and very large, wooden super-yachts. Using different types of wood, the builder can lighten some areas such as bow and stern and strengthen other high-stress areas. Sometimes cold-moulded hulls are protected either inside or out or both with fibreglass or similar products for impact resistance, especially when lightweight, soft timber such as cedar is used. This method lends itself to great flexibility in hull shape.<ref>[http://wiki.dtonline.org/index.php/Cold_Moulding Cold moulding website]</ref>\n\nCold-moulded refers to a type of building one-off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at 45-degree angles to the centerline. This method is often called double-diagonal because a minimum of two layers is recommended, each occurring at opposing 45-degree angles. The \"hot-moulded\" method of building boats, which used ovens to heat and cure the resin, has not been widely used since World War II; and now almost all curing is done at room temperature.\n\n===Metal===\n====Iron and steel====\nEither used in sheet or alternatively, [[Sheet metal|plate]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/shipbuildingrepair/fabricating.html |title=Welding, hot-riveting or drilling of plates |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. It is strong, but heavy (despite the fact that the thickness of the hull can be less). It is generally about 30% heavier than aluminium and somewhat more heavy than [[polyester]]. The material rusts unless protected from water (this is usually done by means of a covering of paint). Modern steel components are [[welding|welded]] or [[Bolted joint|bolt]]ed together. As the welding can be done very easily (with common welding equipment), and as the material is very cheap, it is a popular material with amateur builders. Also, amateur builders which are not yet well established in building steel ships may opt for [[Do it yourself|DIY]] construction kits. If steel is used, a zinc layer is often applied to coat the entire hull. It is applied after [[sandblasting]] (which is required to have a cleaned surface) and before painting. The painting is usually done with [[lead paint]] (Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Optionally, the covering with the zinc layer may be left out, but it is generally not recommended. [[Zinc]] [[anode]]s also need to be placed on the ship's hull. Until the mid-1900s, steel sheets were [[rivet]]ed together.\n\n[[File:Punt-building-workshop-in-Oxford.jpg|thumb|A [[punt (boat)|punt]] under construction]]\n[[File:Lake Bennett boats.jpg|thumb|Wooden boats under construction during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\n====Aluminum====\nAluminum and aluminum alloys are used both in sheet form for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. Many sailing spars are frequently made of aluminium after 1960. The material requires special manufacturing techniques, construction tools and construction skills. It is the lightest material for building large boats (being 15-20% lighter than polyester and 30% lighter than steel). Aluminium is very expensive in most countries and it is usually not used by amateur builders. While it is easy to cut, aluminium is difficult to weld, and also requires heat treatments such as [[precipitation hardening|precipitation strengthening]] for most applications.  Galvanic [[corrosion]] below the waterline is a serious concern, particularly in marinas where there are other conflicting metals. Aluminium is most commonly found in yachts and power boats that are not kept permanently in the water. Aluminium yachts are particularly popular in France.\n\n====Cupronickel====\nA relatively expensive metal used only very occasionally in boatbuilding is [[cupronickel]]. Arguably the ideal metal for boat hulls, cupronickel is reasonably tough, highly resistant to corrosion in seawater, and is (because of its copper content) a very effective [[antifouling]] metal. Cupronickel may be found on the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s of premium [[tugboat]]s, [[fishing boat]]s and other working [[boat]]s; and may even be used for [[propeller]]s and  [[crankshaft|propeller shafts]].\n\n===Fiberglass===\n[[Fiberglass]] ([[glass-reinforced plastic]] or GRP) is typically used for production boats because of its ability to reuse a female mould as the foundation for the shape of the boat. The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin-saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness. GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof. These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich (cored) type, in which a core of [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]], [[foam]] or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mould, but before the inner skin is laid. This is similar to the next type, composite, but is not usually classified as composite, since the core material in this case does not provide much additional strength. It does, however, increase stiffness, which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight. Most fibreglass boats are currently made in an open mould, with fibreglass and resin applied by hand ([[hand-lay-up]] method). Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibres are laid out and resin is pulled into the mould by atmospheric pressure. This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin, but takes special materials and more technical knowledge. Older fibreglass boats before 1990 were often not constructed in controlled temperature buildings leading to the widespread problem of fibreglass pox, where seawater seeped through small holes and caused delamination. The name comes from the multiude of surface pits in the outer gelcoat layer which resembles smallpox. Sometimes the problem was caused by atmospheric moisture being trapped in the layup during construction in humid weather.\n\n===Composite material===\n\"Composite construction\" involves a variety of [[composite material]]s and methods: an early example was a timber carvel skin attached to a frame and deck beams made of iron. Sheet copper anti-fouling (\"copper=bottomed\") could be attached to a wooden hull provided the risk of galvanic corrosion was minimised. Fast cargo vessels once were copper-bottomed to prevent being slowed by marine fouling.  GRP and ferrocement hulls are classic composite hulls, the term \"composite\" applies also to plastics reinforced with fibers other than glass.  When a hull is being created in a female mould, the composite materials are applied to the mould in the form of a [[thermosetting plastic]] (usually [[epoxy]], polyester, or vinylester) and some kind of fiber cloth ([[fiberglass]], [[kevlar]], [[dynel]], [[carbon fiber]], etc.). These methods can give strength-to-weight ratios approaching that of aluminum, while requiring less specialized tools and construction skills.\n\n===Ferrocement===\n[[File:RHGib jpg.jpg|thumb|A 22-meter professionally built ferrocement staysail schooner]]\nFirst developed in the mid-19th century in both France and Holland, ferrocement was also used for the [[D-Day]] [[Mulberry harbour]]s. After a buzz of excitement among homebuilders in the 1960s, ferro building has since declined.\n\nFerrocement is a relatively cheap method to produce a hull, although unsuitable for commercial mass production. A steel and iron \"armature\" is built to the exact shape of the hull, ultimately being covered in galvanised chicken netting. Then, on a single day, the cement is applied by a team of plasterers. The cement:sand ratio is a very rich 4:1; do not call it concrete! As the hull thickness is typically 2.5 to 3 cms,  ferrocement is unsuitable for boats less than about 15 metres [[Length overall|LOA]] as there is a weight penalty; above that length there is no penalty. Properly plastered ferrocement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines, and amateur builders are advised to use professional plasterers to produce a smooth finish. In the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, the cheapness of ferro construction encouraged amateur builders to build hulls larger than they could afford, not anticipating that the fitting-out costs of a larger boat can be crippling.\n\nThe advantages of a ferro hull are:\n* cannot burn, rot, or rust; & no osmosis\n* good insulation: cool in summer, warm in winter\n* tougher than [[fiberglass|GRP]], and almost as tough as a steel vessel; (and if damaged, easily repaired almost anywhere in the world)\n* properly built, a ferro hull is as fair as a GRP hull.\n* they may be cheap to buy (see disadvantages, below)\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n* many home-built ferro boats are lumpy, overweight and ugly.\n* some early builders, realising that their creation proved to be disappointing, scuttled their vessels and fraudulently claimed insurance.\n* accordingly, ferro yachts may be difficult to sell and nigh impossible to insure.\n\n''See also'': [[concrete ship]], [[concrete canoe]].\n\n==Hull types==\n{{Further|Hull (watercraft)}}\n\nThere are many hull types, and a builder should choose the most appropriate one for the boat's intended purpose. For example, a sea-going vessel needs a hull which is more stable and robust than a hull used in rivers and canals. Hull types include:\n\n* [[Smooth curve hull]]: these are rounded and free of chines or corners.\n* [[Chine (boating)|Chined hulls]]: these are hulls have flat panels (typically plywood) which meet at a sharp angle known as the \"chine\". Chined hulls range from simple flat-bottomed boats where the topsides and bottom meet at about 110 degrees (such as [[Banks dory|banks dories]] and [[Sharpie (boat)|sharpie]]s) to skiffs where the bottom is arced rather than flat. Multi-chine hulls allow an approximation of a round hull shape.\n* [[Flat-bottomed boat|Flat-bottomed hull]]: flat-bottomed hulls are suitable for canals and non-tidal rivers. They are often shallow-draft, and may operate in shallower water. They are cheap  to build but, being less stable and having no keel to give directional stability, they are unsuitable for sea-going vessels. (However, large ships are almost always flat bottomed, having a suitably large draft to overcome the problems of small flat-bottomed boats).\n* [[Hull (watercraft)|Displacement hulls]]: a displacement hull always remains partly submerged. Such a hull has a maximum \"hull speed\" which is a function of its waterline length. An exception is the [[catamaran]], whose twin hulls are usually so fine that they do not engender a bow wave.\n* [[Planing (sailing)|Planing]] hulls: planing hulls have a shape that allows the boat to rise out of the water as the speed increases. Sail boats that plane are typical V-shaped at the bows and flat-bottomed aft. Hydroplanes are very light, flat bottomed, high powered speed boats that plane easily on flat water, but they become unstable in rough water. Powerboats designed for rough water are usually deep V-bottomed with a deadrise angle of about 20-23 degrees. The most common form is to have at least one chine to allow for stability when cornering and for a supportive surface on which to ride while planing. Planing hulls allow much higher speeds to be achieved, as they are not limited by the waterline length the way displacement hulls are. Planing hulls need sufficient power to \"reach the plane\", after which the lack of drag allows high speeds yet with reduced power consumption.\n\n==Glossary==\n{{main|Glossary of nautical terms}}\n[[File:Samos Agios Isidoros 001.jpg|thumb|Boat building in Greece]]\n[[File:Samos Agios Isidoros 002.jpg|thumb|Side view of the wooden frame]]\n<!-- ***PLEASE NOTE*** This is not a catch-all <ref></ref>of miscellaneous marine terms.  Please confine entries to objects and terms bearing on the ''construction'' of small vessels.-->\n\n*[[Anchor]]: a device for holding a boat to the seabed, typically with chain and rode.

Its sides are notched to receive the tapered forward ends of deck planking so that no end grain is exposed.\n*[[Knee (construction)|Knee]]: a short L shaped piece of wood that joins or strengthens the joint in boat parts that meet between roughly 60 and 120 degrees. It may be a natural crook from a suitable wood species, sawn from a larger piece of timber, or laminated to size. Commonly used on thwarts to join topsides or keelsons to join transoms. A hanging knee sits upright beneath a thwart to support it. Hanging knees often support carlins where a full frame would be inconvenient.\n*[[Locker (cabinet)|Locker]]: an enclosed storage space\n*[[Mast (sailing)|Mast]]: a large vertical spar which supports the sails. It may be supported by standing rigging, but some rigs (such a junks) have unstayed masted.\n*[[Mast step]]: a socket to take the downward thrust of the mast and hold it in position.

Ribs differ from frames or futtocks in being far smaller dimensions and bent in place compared to frames or futtocks, which are normally sawn to shape, or natural crooks that are shaped to fit with an adze, axe or chisel.\n*[[Rigging]]: standing rigging (either \"stays\" or shrouds\") are the wire cables or rods that support the mast(s).  Running rigging are the ropes (\"sheets\") to control the sails. \n*[[Rowlock]] (pronounced \"rollock\";(also \"oarlock\"): a 'U' shaped metal device that secures an oar and acts as a fulcrum during the motion of rowing. \n*[[Rudder]]: a hinged vertical plate at the stern for steering a craft. There may be more than one rudder.\n*[[Sampson post]]: a strong vertical post which supports a ship's [[windlass]] and the heel of its [[bowsprit]], also used to making off mooring lines.\n*[[Scupper]]s: gaps in the bulwarks permitting water to drain off the deck.\n*[[Shackle]]: a U-shaped fitting secured by a removable pin for securely connecting chains, lines, and other fittings.  Known as a \"snap shackle\" when fitted with a spring-loaded pin.\n*[[Sheave box]]: a plastic or stainless steel box that holds a pulley that is fixed in position as on a mast head.\n*[[Sheer (ship)|Sheer]]: the generally curved shape of the upper hull. It is traditionally lowest amidships to maximize freeboard at the ends of the hull. Sheer can be reverse, higher in the middle to maximize space inside, or straight or a combination of shapes.\n*[[Sheet (sailing)|Sheet]]: a line which controls the clew of a sail.\n*[[Skeg]]: a vertical blade beneath the hull, typically to support and protect the rudder and to promote the rudder's efficiency by preventing \"stalling\".\n*[[Spar (sailing)|Spar]]: s length of timber, aluminium, steel or carbon fibre of approximately round or pear shaped cross-section which supports a sail or sails. Spars include the mast, boom, gaff, yard, bowsprit, prod, boomkin, pole and dolphin striker.\n*[[Sole (foot)|Sole]]: the floor of a cabin or cockpit.\n*[[Spinnaker]] (or \"kite\"): a large, lightweight, down-wind sail used on fore and aft rigged yachts such as sloops to dramatically increase sail area typically used running with the wind.\n*[[Spring (nautical)|Spring]]: the amount of fore and aft curvature in the keel.\n*[[Stanchion]]s: a post for holding life lines on a deck.\n*[[Stainless steel]]: a corrosion-resistant alloy of mild steel and small percentages of such metals as copper, chromium, molybdenum, and nickel.  Common alloys are \"18/8\" (known as \"surgical stainless steel\") and \"316\" (\"marine grade\"), which contains more salt-water resistant nickel.\n*[[Stays (nautical)|Stays]]/[[shroud (sailing)|shrouds]]: standing or running rigging which holds a spar in position (e.g. forestay, backstay, bobstay). Formerly made of rope, typically of braided stainless steel wire, occasionally solid metal rod.\n*[[Stem (ship)|Stem]]: a continuation of the keel upwards at the bow where the two sides of the hull meet.\n*[[Stern]]: the aftmost part of a boat, often ending in a transom.\n*[[Stern sheets]] a flat area or deck, inboard of the transom in a small boat. It may contain hatches to access below decks or provide storage on deck for life saving equipment.\n*[[Strake]]: planking, running from the \"garboard\" strake affixed to the keel to the \"sheer\" strake below the caprail.\n*[[Clinker (boat building)|Stringer]] (also \"batten\"): a long relatively thin, knot free length of wood, running fore and aft, often used to reinforce planking on the inside of the hull.\n*[[Synthetic rope]]: lines manufactured from chained chemicals.  The four most common are: polyester (including brand names Dacron and Terylene), a strong, low stretch line, usually plaited (braided) used for running rigging; nylon, a strong but elastic line resistant to shock loads, best suited for mooring lines and anchor warps. It is usually laid (twisted) so to make it easier to grip when hauling; polypropylene, a light, cheap, slippery, buoyant line, typically laid, which is by far the weakest of the four, and deteriorates when exposed to sunlight. Commonly used on commercial fishing boats using nets; and Kevlar, an extremely strong and expensive fibre with almost no stretch, usually braided and best suited for halyards.\n*[[Taff rail]]: a railing at the extreme stern of a vessel.\n*[[Thwart]]: a transverse member used to maintain the shape of the topsides of a small boat, often doubling as a seat.\n*[[Tiller]]: a forward-facing attached to the rudder allowing a helmsman to steer a boat. On a dinghy, the tiller may have a hinged extension called a \"jigger\".\n*[[Toe rail]]: an upright longitudinal strip of wood surrounding a deck near the sheer, especially forward, for safety and to provide purchase when a boat is heeled.\n*[[Topping Lift]]: a line running from a cleat on the mast through a block at the masthead and down to the aft end of a boom for supporting the boom when not in use or when reefing. \n*[[Topsides (nautical)|Topsides]]: the side planking of a boat from the waterline to the sheerstrake.\n*[[Transom (nautical)|Transom]]: a vertical part of the hull at the stern. Transoms provide width and sadditional buoyancy at the stern. Dinghies may attach an outboard motor to the transom.\n*Warp: anchor line, traditionally made of stiff natural fibre such as hemp, today of stronger, lighter, synthetic fibres such as laid nylon, prized for its elasticity in absorbing shock loads on an anchor. \n*[[Winch]]: a geared device providing both friction and mechanical advantage in sail trimming, hoisting large sails, and retrieving an anchor. Some winches are self-tailing, allowing efficient one-man usage, others electrically powered.\n*[[Wind pennant]]: a small pivoting masthead wind indicator.\n*[[Yard (sailing)|Yard]]: a horizontal spar on a square rigged ship fitted to the forward side of a mast, holding a square sail forward of the shrouds. An extension to the yard is the \"yard-arm\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"175\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Traditional boat building in India\" >\nFile:View of a Boat at Bheemili (being manufactured).jpg|Boat construction underway at [[Bheemunipatnam]]<ref name=Sulkha>{{cite web|url=http://www.sulkhashipyard.in/About.html |title=Sulkha shipyard |publisher=Sulkhashipyard.in |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"175\" caption=\"Traditional wooden boat building in Vietnam.

It is buoyant, widely available and easily worked. It is a popular material for small boats (of e.g. {{convert|6|m|adj=on}} length; such as dinghies and sailboats). Its abrasion resistance varies according to the hardness and density of the wood and it can deteriorate if fresh water or marine organisms are allowed to penetrate the wood. Woods such as [[Teak]], [[Podocarpus totara|Totara]] and some [[Cedrus|cedar]]s have natural chemicals which prevent rot whereas other woods, such as [[Pinus radiata]], will rot very quickly. The hull of a wooden boat usually consists of planking fastened to frames and a keel. Keel and frames are traditionally made of hardwoods such as [[oak]] while planking can be [[oak]] but is more often softwood such as [[pine]], [[larch]] or [[Cedrus|cedar]].\n\n[[Plywood]] is especially popular for amateur construction but only marine ply using waterproof glues and even laminates should be used. Cheap construction plywood often has voids in the interior layers and is not suitable to boat building as the voids trap moisture and accelerate rot as well as physically weaken the plywood. No plywood is rot resistant and should be coated with epoxy resin and/or a good paint system. Varnish and Linseed oil should not be used on the exterior of a hull for waterproofing. Varnish has about 60% of the water resistance of a good paint system. Only boiled linseed oil should be used on a boat and only in the interior as it has very little water resistance but it is very easy to apply and has a pleasant smell. Note that used linseed rags should not be left in a pile as they can catch fire. A valuable 200-year-old waka (Maori canoe) caught fire in New Zealand in June 2014 when restorers left rags piled overnight. Raw linseed oil is not suited to boats as it stays damp and oily for a long time. Mildew will grow well on raw linseed oil treated timber but not on boiled linseed oil. More recently introduced tropical woods as [[mahogany]], [[Aucoumea klaineana|okoum\u00e9]], [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]], [[Dipterocarpus|Keruing]], [[Lophira alata|azob\u00e9]] and [[Intsia bijuga|merbau]].<ref>Zeilen:Van beginner tot gevorderde by Karel Heijnen</ref> are also used. With tropical species, extra attention needs to be taken to ensure that the wood is indeed [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]-certified.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrdc.org/land/forests/woodguide.asp |title=FSC certification |publisher=Nrdc.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glen-l.com/wood-plywood/wp-index.html |title=Boat building lumber |publisher=Glen-l.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Teak or [[iroko (hardwood)|iroko]] is usually used to create the deck and any superstructure. [[Adhesive|Glue]], [[screw]]s, [[rivets]] and/or [[nail (fastener)|nails]] are used to join the wooden components. Before teak is glued the natural oil must be wiped off with a chemical cleaner, otherwise the joint will fail.\n\nSome types of wood construction include:\n*'''[[carvel (boat building)|Carvel]]''', in which a smooth hull is formed by edge joined planks attached to a frame. The planks may be curved in cross section like barrel staves. Carvel planks are generally caulked with oakum or cotton that is driven into the seams between the planks and covered with some waterproof substance. It takes its name from an archaic ship type and is believed to have originated in the Mediterranean. A number of boat building texts are available which describe the carvel planking method in detail.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notablemath.weebly.com/carvel-planking.html |title=Carvel Planking for Boats, Sailboats: Richard Joyce Montana Tech |publisher=Notablemath.weebly.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n*'''[[Clinker (boat building)|Clinker]]''' is a technique originally identified with the [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavia]]ns and [[Ingveonic]] people in which [[wood]]en planks are fixed to each other with a slight overlap that is beveled for a tight fit. The planks may be mechanically connected to each other with copper rivets, bent over iron nails, screws or in modern boats with adhesives. Often, [[steam bending|steam bent]] wooden ribs are fitted inside the hull.\n*[[Strip planking]] is yet another type of wooden boat construction similar to carvel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanboats.co.uk/JB/strip_plank.htm |title=Strip Planking |publisher=Jordanboats.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> It is a glued construction method which is very popular with amateur boatbuilders as it is quick, avoids complex temporary jig work and does not require shaping of the planks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gartsideboats.com/faq2.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123155407/http://gartsideboats.com/faq2.php |archivedate=2010-11-23 |title=Planking Methods Comparison |publisher=Gartsideboats.com |date=2010-11-23 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n* [[Sheet plywood boat building]] uses sheets of '''[[plywood|plywood panel]]'''s usually fixed to longitudinal long wood such the chines, inwhales (sheer clamps) or intermediate stringers which are all bent around a series of frames. By attaching the ply sheets to the longwood rather than directly to the frames this avoids hard spots or an unfair hull. Plywood may be laminated into a round hull or used in single sheets. These hulls generally have one or more chines and the method is called [[Chine (boating)|Ply on Frame construction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boatbuilding.net/article.pl?sid=07/10/17/1655255 |title=Ply on Frame construction |publisher=Boatbuilding.net |accessdate=2012-06-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305183809/http://www.boatbuilding.net/article.pl?sid=07%2F10%2F17%2F1655255 |archivedate=2012-03-05 }}</ref> A subdivision of the sheet plywood boat building method is known as the [[stitch and glue|stitch-and-glue]] method,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glen-l.com/resources/glossary.html |title=Stitch and glue subdivision of sheet plywood method |publisher=Glen-l.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> where pre-shaped panels of plywood are drawn together then edge glued and reinforced with fibreglass without the use of a frame.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boatbuilder.org/stitchandglue.htm |title=Benefits of stitch and glue |publisher=Boatbuilder.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Metal or plastic ties, nylon fishing line or copper wires pull curved flat panels into three-dimensional curved shapes. These hulls generally have one or more chines. Marine grade plywood of good quality is designated \"WBP\" (which stands for water- and boiled-proof) or more usually BS 1088. Australian plywood manufacturers and suppliers have issued warnings that some Asian nations are selling ply stamped BS 1088 which does not meet international standards. Specifically, they say outer plies are too thin (should be {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}} minimum) or are very thin (less than {{convert|0.5|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) or high-grade surface ply such as Okoume is combined with a much heavier and wider inner cores. Most high-grade marine Okoume (Gaboon) ply uses lightweight poplar inner cores. Often the 1088 stamp is blurred in the poor Asian ply so it is not clear. In Australia and New Zealand a higher-grade marine ply than BS1088 is AS2272. It requires both faces to be \"A\" quality, with even-thickness plies. The most common plywood used for this grade is plantation-grown Hoop Pine which is fine grained, very smooth, moderately light (at {{convert|570|kg/m3|lb/cuft|abbr=on|disp=or}} it is the same weight as Meranti ply and about 13% heavier than genuine poplar cored BS1088 Okoume). Hoop pine has a very high stress rating of F17, indicating high strength. Meranti (Lauan) ply has a stress rating of F14 and Okoume ply F8. Okoume ply is commonly coated with epoxy to increase strength and impact resistance as well as to exclude water. Both types of plywood construction are very popular with amateur builders, and many dinghies such as the [[Vaurien]], Cherub, [[Tolman Skiff|Tolman]], Moth and P class  (ply on frame construction) and FJs, FDs and [[Kolibri (keelboat)|Kolibri]]s (stitch-and-glue method) have been built from it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bearfacemedia.co.uk/European_Dinghies.aspx|title=European Dinghies build by amateur builders |publisher=Bearfacemedia.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsnautiques.com/vaurien/txt_angl.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502141046/http://www.clubsnautiques.com/vaurien/txt_angl.htm |archivedate=2009-05-02 |title=Vaurien amateur building |publisher=Clubsnautiques.com |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> Another variation is tortured ply where very thin({{convert|3|mm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and flexible (often Okoume)preshaped panels ply are bent into compound curves and sewn together. Little or no framework or longitudinal wood is used. This method is mainly confined to kayaks.\n* '''[[Cold moulding]]''' is a composite method of wooden boat building that uses two or more layers of thin wood, called veneers, oriented in different directions, resulting in a strong monocoque structure, similar to a fibreglass hull but substantially lighter. Sometimes composed of a base layer of strip planking followed by multiple veneers. Sometimes just veneers are used.<ref>\u2033The Gougeon Brothers on Boat Construction, Wood and West System Materials\u2033</ref> Cold-moulding is popular in small, medium and very large, wooden super-yachts. Using different types of wood, the builder can lighten some areas such as bow and stern and strengthen other high-stress areas. Sometimes cold-moulded hulls are protected either inside or out or both with fibreglass or similar products for impact resistance, especially when lightweight, soft timber such as cedar is used. This method lends itself to great flexibility in hull shape.<ref>[http://wiki.dtonline.org/index.php/Cold_Moulding Cold moulding website]</ref>\n\nCold-moulded refers to a type of building one-off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at 45-degree angles to the centerline. This method is often called double-diagonal because a minimum of two layers is recommended, each occurring at opposing 45-degree angles. The \"hot-moulded\" method of building boats, which used ovens to heat and cure the resin, has not been widely used since World War II; and now almost all curing is done at room temperature.\n\n===Metal===\n====Iron and steel====\nEither used in sheet or alternatively, [[Sheet metal|plate]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/shipbuildingrepair/fabricating.html |title=Welding, hot-riveting or drilling of plates |publisher=Osha.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref> for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. It is strong, but heavy (despite the fact that the thickness of the hull can be less). It is generally about 30% heavier than aluminium and somewhat more heavy than [[polyester]]. The material rusts unless protected from water (this is usually done by means of a covering of paint). Modern steel components are [[welding|welded]] or [[Bolted joint|bolt]]ed together. As the welding can be done very easily (with common welding equipment), and as the material is very cheap, it is a popular material with amateur builders. Also, amateur builders which are not yet well established in building steel ships may opt for [[Do it yourself|DIY]] construction kits. If steel is used, a zinc layer is often applied to coat the entire hull. It is applied after [[sandblasting]] (which is required to have a cleaned surface) and before painting. The painting is usually done with [[lead paint]] (Pb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Optionally, the covering with the zinc layer may be left out, but it is generally not recommended. [[Zinc]] [[anode]]s also need to be placed on the ship's hull. Until the mid-1900s, steel sheets were [[rivet]]ed together.\n\n[[File:Punt-building-workshop-in-Oxford.jpg|thumb|A [[punt (boat)|punt]] under construction]]\n[[File:Lake Bennett boats.jpg|thumb|Wooden boats under construction during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]]]\n\n====Aluminum====\nAluminum and aluminum alloys are used both in sheet form for all-metal hulls or for isolated structural members. Many sailing spars are frequently made of aluminium after 1960. The material requires special manufacturing techniques, construction tools and construction skills. It is the lightest material for building large boats (being 15-20% lighter than polyester and 30% lighter than steel). Aluminium is very expensive in most countries and it is usually not used by amateur builders. While it is easy to cut, aluminium is difficult to weld, and also requires heat treatments such as [[precipitation hardening|precipitation strengthening]] for most applications.  Galvanic [[corrosion]] below the waterline is a serious concern, particularly in marinas where there are other conflicting metals. Aluminium is most commonly found in yachts and power boats that are not kept permanently in the water. Aluminium yachts are particularly popular in France.\n\n====Cupronickel====\nA relatively expensive metal used only very occasionally in boatbuilding is [[cupronickel]]. Arguably the ideal metal for boat hulls, cupronickel is reasonably tough, highly resistant to corrosion in seawater, and is (because of its copper content) a very effective [[antifouling]] metal. Cupronickel may be found on the [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s of premium [[tugboat]]s, [[fishing boat]]s and other working [[boat]]s; and may even be used for [[propeller]]s and  [[crankshaft|propeller shafts]].\n\n===Fiberglass===\n[[Fiberglass]] ([[glass-reinforced plastic]] or GRP) is typically used for production boats because of its ability to reuse a female mould as the foundation for the shape of the boat. The resulting structure is strong in tension but often needs to be either laid up with many heavy layers of resin-saturated fiberglass or reinforced with wood or foam in order to provide stiffness. GRP hulls are largely free of corrosion though not normally fireproof. These can be solid fiberglass or of the sandwich (cored) type, in which a core of [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]], [[foam]] or similar material is applied after the outer layer of fiberglass is laid to the mould, but before the inner skin is laid. This is similar to the next type, composite, but is not usually classified as composite, since the core material in this case does not provide much additional strength. It does, however, increase stiffness, which means that less resin and fiberglass cloth can be used in order to save weight. Most fibreglass boats are currently made in an open mould, with fibreglass and resin applied by hand ([[hand-lay-up]] method). Some are now constructed by vacuum infusion where the fibres are laid out and resin is pulled into the mould by atmospheric pressure. This can produce stronger parts with more glass and less resin, but takes special materials and more technical knowledge. Older fibreglass boats before 1990 were often not constructed in controlled temperature buildings leading to the widespread problem of fibreglass pox, where seawater seeped through small holes and caused delamination. The name comes from the multiude of surface pits in the outer gelcoat layer which resembles smallpox. Sometimes the problem was caused by atmospheric moisture being trapped in the layup during construction in humid weather.\n\n===Composite material===\n\"Composite construction\" involves a variety of [[composite material]]s and methods: an early example was a timber carvel skin attached to a frame and deck beams made of iron. Sheet copper anti-fouling (\"copper=bottomed\") could be attached to a wooden hull provided the risk of galvanic corrosion was minimised. Fast cargo vessels once were copper-bottomed to prevent being slowed by marine fouling.  GRP and ferrocement hulls are classic composite hulls, the term \"composite\" applies also to plastics reinforced with fibers other than glass.  When a hull is being created in a female mould, the composite materials are applied to the mould in the form of a [[thermosetting plastic]] (usually [[epoxy]], polyester, or vinylester) and some kind of fiber cloth ([[fiberglass]], [[kevlar]], [[dynel]], [[carbon fiber]], etc.). These methods can give strength-to-weight ratios approaching that of aluminum, while requiring less specialized tools and construction skills.\n\n===Ferrocement===\n[[File:RHGib jpg.jpg|thumb|A 22-meter professionally built ferrocement staysail schooner]]\nFirst developed in the mid-19th century in both France and Holland, ferrocement was also used for the [[D-Day]] [[Mulberry harbour]]s. After a buzz of excitement among homebuilders in the 1960s, ferro building has since declined.\n\nFerrocement is a relatively cheap method to produce a hull, although unsuitable for commercial mass production. A steel and iron \"armature\" is built to the exact shape of the hull, ultimately being covered in galvanised chicken netting. Then, on a single day, the cement is applied by a team of plasterers. The cement:sand ratio is a very rich 4:1; do not call it concrete! As the hull thickness is typically 2.5 to 3 cms,  ferrocement is unsuitable for boats less than about 15 metres [[Length overall|LOA]] as there is a weight penalty; above that length there is no penalty. Properly plastered ferrocement boats have smooth hulls with fine lines, and amateur builders are advised to use professional plasterers to produce a smooth finish. In the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, the cheapness of ferro construction encouraged amateur builders to build hulls larger than they could afford, not anticipating that the fitting-out costs of a larger boat can be crippling.\n\nThe advantages of a ferro hull are:\n* cannot burn, rot, or rust; & no osmosis\n* good insulation: cool in summer, warm in winter\n* tougher than [[fiberglass|GRP]], and almost as tough as a steel vessel; (and if damaged, easily repaired almost anywhere in the world)\n* properly built, a ferro hull is as fair as a GRP hull.\n* they may be cheap to buy (see disadvantages, below)\n\nThe disadvantages are:\n* many home-built ferro boats are lumpy, overweight and ugly.\n* some early builders, realising that their creation proved to be disappointing, scuttled their vessels and fraudulently claimed insurance.\n* accordingly, ferro yachts may be difficult to sell and nigh impossible to insure.\n\n''See also'': [[concrete ship]], [[concrete canoe]].\n\n==Hull types==\n{{Further|Hull (watercraft)}}\n\nThere are many hull types, and a builder should choose the most appropriate one for the boat's intended purpose. For example, a sea-going vessel needs a hull which is more stable and robust than a hull used in rivers and canals. Hull types include:\n\n* [[Smooth curve hull]]: these are rounded and free of chines or corners.\n* [[Chine (boating)|Chined hulls]]: these are hulls have flat panels (typically plywood) which meet at a sharp angle known as the \"chine\". Chined hulls range from simple flat-bottomed boats where the topsides and bottom meet at about 110 degrees (such as [[Banks dory|banks dories]] and [[Sharpie (boat)|sharpie]]s) to skiffs where the bottom is arced rather than flat. Multi-chine hulls allow an approximation of a round hull shape.\n* [[Flat-bottomed boat|Flat-bottomed hull]]: flat-bottomed hulls are suitable for canals and non-tidal rivers. They are often shallow-draft, and may operate in shallower water. They are cheap  to build but, being less stable and having no keel to give directional stability, they are unsuitable for sea-going vessels. (However, large ships are almost always flat bottomed, having a suitably large draft to overcome the problems of small flat-bottomed boats).\n* [[Hull (watercraft)|Displacement hulls]]: a displacement hull always remains partly submerged. Such a hull has a maximum \"hull speed\" which is a function of its waterline length. An exception is the [[catamaran]], whose twin hulls are usually so fine that they do not engender a bow wave.\n* [[Planing (sailing)|Planing]] hulls: planing hulls have a shape that allows the boat to rise out of the water as the speed increases. Sail boats that plane are typical V-shaped at the bows and flat-bottomed aft. Hydroplanes are very light, flat bottomed, high powered speed boats that plane easily on flat water, but they become unstable in rough water. Powerboats designed for rough water are usually deep V-bottomed with a deadrise angle of about 20-23 degrees. The most common form is to have at least one chine to allow for stability when cornering and for a supportive surface on which to ride while planing. Planing hulls allow much higher speeds to be achieved, as they are not limited by the waterline length the way displacement hulls are. Planing hulls need sufficient power to \"reach the plane\", after which the lack of drag allows high speeds yet with reduced power consumption.\n\n==Glossary==\n{{main|Glossary of nautical terms}}\n[[File:Samos Agios Isidoros 001.jpg|thumb|Boat building in Greece]]\n[[File:Samos Agios Isidoros 002.jpg|thumb|Side view of the wooden frame]]\n<!-- ***PLEASE NOTE*** This is not a catch-all <ref></ref>of miscellaneous marine terms.  Please confine entries to objects and terms bearing on the ''construction'' of small vessels.-->\n\n*[[Anchor]]: a device for holding a boat to the seabed, typically with chain and rode. Traditional anchors include the fisherman, Danforth, and plough types (such as the \"CQR\" and \"Delta\"). Recently, far more effective anchors with more reliable holding include the \"Rocna\" and the \"Ultra\", both of which are spade anchors.\n*[[Bitt]]s: a pair of short strong posts of wood or steel on the deck of a boat intended to take mooring lines. Also called \"bollards\".\n*[[Bilge]]: the lowest part of the interior of a hull. Water, fuel tanks, ballast, and heavy stores are variously placed in the bilge to lower the craft's centre of gravity.\n*[[Bilge keels]]: a pair of short keels fitted on either side of the hull.  Less hydro-dynamically efficient than a fin keel, they have a shallower draft. Full-length bilge keels add rigidity to a hull. Bilge keel craft are found in areas with large tidal ranges to keep the vessel upright when dried out.\n*[[Bilge pump]]: a manual or electric pump for draining the bilge.  Set at the lowest point, its inlet is protected by a screen to minimize blockages.\n*[[Block (sailing)|Block]]: a pulley used to give a line a fair lead and multiply its hauling power.

Its sides are notched to receive the tapered forward ends of deck planking so that no end grain is exposed.\n*[[Knee (construction)|Knee]]: a short L shaped piece of wood that joins or strengthens the joint in boat parts that meet between roughly 60 and 120 degrees. It may be a natural crook from a suitable wood species, sawn from a larger piece of timber, or laminated to size. Commonly used on thwarts to join topsides or keelsons to join transoms. A hanging knee sits upright beneath a thwart to support it. Hanging knees often support carlins where a full frame would be inconvenient.\n*[[Locker (cabinet)|Locker]]: an enclosed storage space\n*[[Mast (sailing)|Mast]]: a large vertical spar which supports the sails.

Ribs differ from frames or futtocks in being far smaller dimensions and bent in place compared to frames or futtocks, which are normally sawn to shape, or natural crooks that are shaped to fit with an adze, axe or chisel.\n*[[Rigging]]: standing rigging (either \"stays\" or shrouds\") are the wire cables or rods that support the mast(s).  Running rigging are the ropes (\"sheets\") to control the sails. \n*[[Rowlock]] (pronounced \"rollock\";(also \"oarlock\"): a 'U' shaped metal device that secures an oar and acts as a fulcrum during the motion of rowing. \n*[[Rudder]]: a hinged vertical plate at the stern for steering a craft. There may be more than one rudder.\n*[[Sampson post]]: a strong vertical post which supports a ship's [[windlass]] and the heel of its [[bowsprit]], also used to making off mooring lines.\n*[[Scupper]]s: gaps in the bulwarks permitting water to drain off the deck.\n*[[Shackle]]: a U-shaped fitting secured by a removable pin for securely connecting chains, lines, and other fittings.

Common alloys are \"18/8\" (known as \"surgical stainless steel\") and \"316\" (\"marine grade\"), which contains more salt-water resistant nickel.\n*[[Stays (nautical)|Stays]]/[[shroud (sailing)|shrouds]]: standing or running rigging which holds a spar in position (e.g. forestay, backstay, bobstay). Formerly made of rope, typically of braided stainless steel wire, occasionally solid metal rod.\n*[[Stem (ship)|Stem]]: a continuation of the keel upwards at the bow where the two sides of the hull meet.\n*[[Stern]]: the aftmost part of a boat, often ending in a transom.\n*[[Stern sheets]] a flat area or deck, inboard of the transom in a small boat. It may contain hatches to access below decks or provide storage on deck for life saving equipment.\n*[[Strake]]: planking, running from the \"garboard\" strake affixed to the keel to the \"sheer\" strake below the caprail.\n*[[Clinker (boat building)|Stringer]] (also \"batten\"): a long relatively thin, knot free length of wood, running fore and aft, often used to reinforce planking on the inside of the hull.\n*[[Synthetic rope]]: lines manufactured from chained chemicals.  The four most common are: polyester (including brand names Dacron and Terylene), a strong, low stretch line, usually plaited (braided) used for running rigging; nylon, a strong but elastic line resistant to shock loads, best suited for mooring lines and anchor warps. It is usually laid (twisted) so to make it easier to grip when hauling; polypropylene, a light, cheap, slippery, buoyant line, typically laid, which is by far the weakest of the four, and deteriorates when exposed to sunlight. Commonly used on commercial fishing boats using nets; and Kevlar, an extremely strong and expensive fibre with almost no stretch, usually braided and best suited for halyards.\n*[[Taff rail]]: a railing at the extreme stern of a vessel.\n*[[Thwart]]: a transverse member used to maintain the shape of the topsides of a small boat, often doubling as a seat.\n*[[Tiller]]: a forward-facing attached to the rudder allowing a helmsman to steer a boat. On a dinghy, the tiller may have a hinged extension called a \"jigger\".\n*[[Toe rail]]: an upright longitudinal strip of wood surrounding a deck near the sheer, especially forward, for safety and to provide purchase when a boat is heeled.\n*[[Topping Lift]]: a line running from a cleat on the mast through a block at the masthead and down to the aft end of a boom for supporting the boom when not in use or when reefing. \n*[[Topsides (nautical)|Topsides]]: the side planking of a boat from the waterline to the sheerstrake.\n*[[Transom (nautical)|Transom]]: a vertical part of the hull at the stern. Transoms provide width and sadditional buoyancy at the stern. Dinghies may attach an outboard motor to the transom.\n*Warp: anchor line, traditionally made of stiff natural fibre such as hemp, today of stronger, lighter, synthetic fibres such as laid nylon, prized for its elasticity in absorbing shock loads on an anchor. \n*[[Winch]]: a geared device providing both friction and mechanical advantage in sail trimming, hoisting large sails, and retrieving an anchor. Some winches are self-tailing, allowing efficient one-man usage, others electrically powered.\n*[[Wind pennant]]: a small pivoting masthead wind indicator.\n*[[Yard (sailing)|Yard]]: a horizontal spar on a square rigged ship fitted to the forward side of a mast, holding a square sail forward of the shrouds. An extension to the yard is the \"yard-arm\".\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"175\" class=\"center\" caption=\"Traditional boat building in India\" >\nFile:View of a Boat at Bheemili (being manufactured).jpg|Boat construction underway at [[Bheemunipatnam]]<ref name=Sulkha>{{cite web|url=http://www.sulkhashipyard.in/About.html |title=Sulkha shipyard |publisher=Sulkhashipyard.in |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n<center>\n<gallery widths=\"175\" caption=\"Traditional wooden boat building in Vietnam.
