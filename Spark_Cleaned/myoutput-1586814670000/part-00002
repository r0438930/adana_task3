The collection ranges from works created in the late nineteenth century when the recorded sound and film industries were in their infancy, to those made in the present day.\n\nThe NFSA collection first started as the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (within the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) in 1935, becoming an independent cultural organisation in 1984. On 3 October, Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] officially opened the NFSA's headquarters in Canberra.\n\n==History of the organisation==\n\nThe work of the Archive can be officially dated to the establishment of the National Historical Film and Speaking Record Library (part of the then [[National Library of Australia|Commonwealth National Library]]) by a [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] decision on 11 December 1935.\n\nAfter being part of the National Library of Australia, and its predecessors, for nearly 50 years, the National Film and Sound Archive was created as a separate [[Commonwealth]] collecting institution through an announcement in Parliament on 5 April 1984 that took immediate effect.<ref name=\"NAA CA 4123\">{{citation|title=CA 4123: National Film and Sound Archive of Australia, Central Office|url=http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/SearchOld.asp?Number=CA+4123|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</ref> At that time, an Advisory Committee was established to guide the institution.\n\nOn 21 June 1999, the name was changed to ScreenSound Australia, the National Collection of Screen and Sound, and changed again in early 2000 to ScreenSound Australia, National Screen and Sound Archive.

Following elections in November 2007, however, the new Labor Government implemented an election promise to allow the NFSA to become a [[statutory authority]], similar to other major cultural institutions including the [[National Library of Australia]], the [[National Gallery of Australia]] and the [[National Museum of Australia]].

Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[Australian Institute of Anatomy]]! -->\n{{main|Australian Institute of Anatomy}}\n[[File:National Film and Sound Archive viewed near McCoy Circuit.jpg|right|thumb|The National Film and Sound Archive fronts onto McCoy Circuit.]]\nThe building to which the Archive moved in 1984 was the home of the Australian Institute of Anatomy from 1931-84. Originally it held the anatomy collection of [[William Colin Mackenzie|Sir Colin MacKenzie]]. This collection included the heart of the celebrated Australian racehorse [[Phar Lap]].\n\nThe building is often classified as [[art deco]], though its overall architectural style is technically \"Late 20th Century Stripped Classical\", the style of ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised.  It features a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, a horizontal skyline, classical columns and a central entrance. The decorative foyer features images of native flora, fauna and Aboriginal art and motifs. Face masks of well-known scientists from the late 19th century and early 20th century are featured on the foyer\u2019s walls as a reminder of its previous incarnation as the Institute of Anatomy.\n\nThe building also features a landscaped courtyard, theatre and research centre. In 1999, the building was extended to accommodate the Archive's growth. The new wing\u2019s design is in keeping with the Art Deco style of the main structure with details and finishes to match the original.\n\n==Awards==\n\n===Ken G Hall Film Preservation Award===\nThe Ken G Hall Film Preservation Award was established in 1995 as a tribute to producer/director Ken G Hall. It is presented in recognition of an individual, group, or organisation, for their outstanding contribution to the art of moving image and its preservation. It is presented to candidates where there is a significant link between their work and its impact or relationship to the Australian film industry. Examples of this contribution include technical innovation, scholarship in the field, involvement with the survival of film as an art form and as a cultural experience, advocacy, sponsorship and fundraising.\n\n*2012 Susanne Chauvel Carlsson\n*2011 David Hannay\n*2010 [[Patricia Lovell]]\n*2009 Ian Dunlop\n*2006 [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]]\n*2005 [[Phillip Noyce]]\n*2004 Graham Shirley\n*2003 Tom Nurse\n*2002 Judy Adamson\n*2001 Murray Forrest\n*2000 [[Anthony Buckley]]\n*1999 Joan Long\n*1998 Not awarded\n*1997 [[Kodak]] Australasia\n*1996 [[Peter Weir]]\n*1995 Alan Rydge and [[Rupert Murdoch]]\n\n===National Folk Recording Award===\nThe NFSA National Folk Recording Award was established in 2001 to encourage and reward excellence in Australian folk music recording.

It found the NFSA to be stronger in current affairs and older programs, and YouTube stronger in game shows, lifestyle programs, and \"human interest\" material (births, marriages, and deaths). YouTube cataloging was found to have fewer broken links than the NFSA collection, and YouTube [[metadata]] could be searched more intuitively. The NFSA was found to generally provide more useful reference information about production and broadcast dates.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKee|first=Alan|title=YouTube versus the National Film and Sound Archive: Which Is the More Useful Resource for Historians of Australian Television?|journal=[[Television & New Media]]|year=2011|volume=12|issue=2|page=154}}</ref>\n\nThe NFSA announced plans to collect Australian-developed video games as part of its collection starting in 2019 with new titles to be added on an annual basis.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/26/national-film-and-sound-archive-of-australia-to-collect-preserve-aussie-video-games | title = National Film and Sound Archive of Australia to Collect, Preserve Aussie Video Games | first=  Luke | last = Reilly | date =September 26, 2019 | accessdate = September 26, 2019 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Special Collections ===\n* Film Australia Collection: contains a diverse range of more than 3,000 titles of Australian documentary and educational programs, spanning a century of Commonwealth documentary and docu-drama titles (1913\u20132008).\n* The [[Sounds of Australia]] is the NFSA's selection of sound recordings with cultural, historical and aesthetic significance and relevance, which inform or reflect life in Australia.

Please don't add new information or details here, but instead at the main article [[Australian Institute of Anatomy]]! -->\n{{main|Australian Institute of Anatomy}}\n[[File:National Film and Sound Archive viewed near McCoy Circuit.jpg|right|thumb|The National Film and Sound Archive fronts onto McCoy Circuit.]]\nThe building to which the Archive moved in 1984 was the home of the Australian Institute of Anatomy from 1931-84. Originally it held the anatomy collection of [[William Colin Mackenzie|Sir Colin MacKenzie]]. This collection included the heart of the celebrated Australian racehorse [[Phar Lap]].\n\nThe building is often classified as [[art deco]], though its overall architectural style is technically \"Late 20th Century Stripped Classical\", the style of ancient Greece and Rome but simplified and modernised.  It features a symmetrical fa\u00e7ade, a horizontal skyline, classical columns and a central entrance. The decorative foyer features images of native flora, fauna and Aboriginal art and motifs. Face masks of well-known scientists from the late 19th century and early 20th century are featured on the foyer\u2019s walls as a reminder of its previous incarnation as the Institute of Anatomy.\n\nThe building also features a landscaped courtyard, theatre and research centre. In 1999, the building was extended to accommodate the Archive's growth. The new wing\u2019s design is in keeping with the Art Deco style of the main structure with details and finishes to match the original.\n\n==Awards==\n\n===Ken G Hall Film Preservation Award===\nThe Ken G Hall Film Preservation Award was established in 1995 as a tribute to producer/director Ken G Hall.
