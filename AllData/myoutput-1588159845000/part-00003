{"title_page": "Anime and manga fandom", "text_new": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2010}}\n{{Anime and manga}}\n'''Anime and manga fandom''' (otherwise known as '''fan community''') is a worldwide community of fans of [[anime]] and [[manga]]. Anime includes [[animation|animated]] [[wikt:serial|series]], films and videos, while manga includes [[manga]], [[graphic novels]], drawings and related artwork. They have their origin in Japanese entertainment, but the style and culture has spread worldwide since its introduction into [[Western world|the West]] in the 1990s.\n\n== Otaku ==\n{{Main|Otaku}}\n''Otaku'' is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, including anime, manga or video games. In its original context, the term ''otaku'' is derived from a Japanese term for another's house or family ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u304a\u5b85|\u304a\u5b85]],}} ''otaku''), which is also used as an [[honorific]] second-person pronoun. The modern [[slang]] form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in [[hiragana]] (\u304a\u305f\u304f) or [[katakana]] (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af or, less frequently, \u30f2\u30bf\u30af), or rarely in [[r\u014dmaji]], appeared in the 1980s. In the anime [[Macross]], first aired in 1982, the term was used by [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]] as an honorific term.<ref>May 2006 issue of ''EX Taishuu'' magazine</ref><ref name=\"NRI\">\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u7814\u7a76(Otaku Shijou no Kenkyuu), \u91ce\u6751\u7e3d\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u6240(Nomura Research Institute), {{ISBN|978-986-124-768-7}}</ref> It appears to have been coined by the humorist and essayist [[Akio Nakamori]] in his 1983 series {{nihongo|''An Investigation of \"Otaku\"''|\u300e\u304a\u305f\u304f\u300f\u306e\u7814\u7a76|\"Otaku\" no Kenky\u016b}}, printed in the [[lolicon]] magazine ''[[Manga Burikko]]''. Animators like [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]] and [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] used the term among themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.<ref name=\"NRI\"/> After its wild spread usage by other Japanese people, however, it became [[pejorative]] and increasingly offensive in the 1990s, implying that a person is socially inept. ''Otaku'' can be seen as being similar to the English terms ''[[geek]]'' or ''[[nerd]]''.\n\nHowever, the term started to be used by anime and manga fans themselves again starting in the 2000s, in a more general and positive way, and today it is often used by those outside of the fandom to refer to fans of anime or manga. However, older generation otaku, like ''Otaking'' (King of Otakus) [[Toshio Okada]], in his book ''Otaku Wa Sude Ni Shindeiru'' (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u306f\u3059\u3067\u306b\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b) said the newer generation of self-proclaimed otakus are not real otakus, as they lack the passion and research sense into a particular sub-culture subject, and are only common fans which only over spent in buying products.\n\n== History of the community ==\n{{See also|History of anime|Manga outside Japan}}\n\nAnime and manga fandom traces back to at least the 1970s when after [[Space Battleship Yamato]]; stopped airing on Japanese [[television]], fans of the \nseries banded together to get ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' back on the air after it stopped airing on Japanese [[television]].<ref>{{cite web | title = An Overview of Yamato Fan History, Part 1 | url = http://starblazers.com/html.php?page_id=260&PHPSESSID=53ad571dd98998f6e351cf607ccd182b | publisher = [[Voyager Entertainment]] | accessdate = May 10, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090531042519/http://starblazers.com/html.php?page_id=260&PHPSESSID=a517f630dab6ea69371c4eae5e6c756d| archivedate= 31 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> In Japan, anime and manga are referred to collectively as the content industry: anime, video games, manga, and other related merchandise are different types of media focused around the same content.<ref name=\"Manion\">{{cite journal | last = Manion | first = Annie | year = 2005 | title = Discovering Japan: Anime and Learning Japanese Culture. | journal = East Asian Studies Center, USC | url = http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf | accessdate = April 27, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171215035736/http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf | archive-date = December 15, 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the manga market in Japan is beginning to decline. In 2007, the manga industry showed a 4% decrease in sales from the previous year, its fifth consecutive year of decline. Japanese and American researchers have proposed that this may be due to the decrease in the young population in Japan and a lack of interest in reading. The manga critic and translator [[Matt Thorn]] stated that there was a growing dissatisfaction with the lack of originality found in many manga.<ref>{{cite news | title = Quantcast Manga Sales in Japan Decline for Fifth Consecutive Year | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = October 20, 2007 | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-20/manga-sales-in-japan-decline-for-fifth-consecutive-year | accessdate = April 28, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090408075235/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-20/manga-sales-in-japan-decline-for-fifth-consecutive-year| archivedate= 8 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Al Kahn, CEO of [[4Kids Entertainment]], stated that \"Manga is a problem because we are in a culture that is not a reading culture\" and that \"Manga is dying in Japan.\"<ref>{{cite news | first = Al | last = Kahn | title = Sparks Fly at ICv2 Anime/Manga Conference | publisher = ICv2 | date = December 7, 2007 | url = http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/11741.html | accessdate = April 28, 2009}}</ref> Liza Coppola, vice president of [[Viz Media]], said that the widespread availability of cell phones and ability to view anime and manga on cell phones is likely the cause of decline in demand for anime and manga.<ref>{{cite news | title = Interview with Liza Coppola, Part 3 | publisher = ICv2 | date = December 7, 2007 | url = http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/11741.html | accessdate = April 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== English-language fan communities ===\nThe fan community in the English-speaking world began in the 1970s and steadily grew. According to Japanophile [[Fred Patten]], the very first fan club devoted to Japanese animation was the Cartoon/Fantasy Organization, which began in Los&nbsp;Angeles in 1977.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Deppey |first=Dirk |date=13 July 2005 |title=Scanlation Nation: Amateur Manga Translators Tell |journal=[[The Comics Journal]] |volume=269 |url=http://www.tcj.com/269/n_scan.html |accessdate=2012-09-30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505014917/http://www.tcj.com/269/n_scan.html |archivedate=2006-05-05}}</ref> Its growth characterized by waves that [[Gilles Poitras]] as well as Bruce Lewis and Cathy Sterling name as specific \"generations\", often instigated by a singular work.<ref name=\"Poitras\">{{cite book | last = Poitras | first = Gilles | date = December 1, 2000 | title = Anime Essentials: Every Thing a Fan Needs to Know | publisher = Stone Bridge Press | isbn = 1-880656-53-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the Philippines, [[DZBB-TV|GMA-7]] began airing ''[[Ch\u014ddenji Machine Voltes V|Voltes&nbsp;V]]'' in 1978. It was the first exposure of Filipinos to Japanese animation. ''Voltes&nbsp;V'' soon became very popular between children all around the Philippines which led to the sudden popularity of other anime series' related to the [[Super Robot]] genre in the Philippines. It was soon banned in 1979 by then president [[Ferdinand Marcos]], five episodes before the end of the series, along with the other anime series' airing at the time, for its violence and warlike themes. This however, did not hinder the Filipinos' growing love of anime, leading to the large popularity of anime and manga throughout the Philippines.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mann|first=William|title=Filipinos short-circuit 'Voltes V'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6gEkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I-4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4941,5305880&dq=voltes+v&hl=en|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=24 September 1979}}</ref>\n\nPoitras identifies the first generation as the \"Astro Boy Generation\". Despite being the first and most popular animated Japanese television series, ''[[Astro Boy]]'' did not create many hardcore fans, but it exposed viewers to the medium and increased their receptivity towards it later on. The \"Early Fans\" or \"Old Timers\" generation that consumed titles like ''[[Speed Racer]]'', ''[[Eighth Man]]'', and ''[[Battle of the Planets]]'' as staples. These fans were much more aware that what they were consuming was Japanese and took the initiative to search for more. The \"Yamato\" or \"Star Blazers\" generation originating from the series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' that originally aired in 1979\u201380. Poitras states that this generation was so loyal because ''Star Blazer'''s strong narration required viewers to never miss an episode. The Poitras dubs the next generation the \"Robotech Generation\", after the 1985 television series ''[[Robotech]]'', is the earliest major generation in the USA and is distinguished by fans clearly recognizing anime as a Japanese product with significant differences from American animation. Fans from this generation and the Yamato Generation were to make up the significant portion of organized fandom throughout the 1980s. The film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', which played in art theaters in December 1989, produced a cult following that Poitras names the \"Akira Generation\". ''Akira'' inspired some to move on to other works but stalled many becoming an isolated work in their eyes, overshadowing the creative context of anime and manga it represented.<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nThen in the 1990s, Poitras states that \"something new happened in the U.S.\", the \"Sailor Moon Generation\" was born. Previous generations consisted mostly of college age fans, however in 1995 ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' was adapted into English and caught the attention of people even as young as grade school in age, many of them female. In the span of a few months, the fan demographic changed dramatically and as their interests diversified, so did the titles adapted into English. Poitras, Lewis and Sterling describe current generation of fans as the \"Otaku Generation\", however not necessarily applying the word \"[[otaku]]\" to current fans. For this generation, the release of a title onto the television in the past was unusual enough that fans often remember their first anime experience as something special. Poitras remarked that as of the \"Otaku Generation\", the influx of fans into the fandom is better characterized by a continuous stream than as waves as it was in the past.<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nIn the United States, the fan community began as an offshoot of [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan community]], with fans bringing imported copies of Japanese [[manga]] to [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Jason H. | last = Bennett | title = A Preliminary History of American Anime Fandom | url = http://a-kon.co/bm/bm~doc/prelim_history.pdf | publisher = University of Texas at Arlington | accessdate = May 10, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022644/http://a-kon.com/bm/bm~doc/prelim_history.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-25}}</ref> Before anime began to be licensed in the U.S., fans who wanted to get a hold of anime would leak copies of anime movies and subtitle them, thus marking the start of [[fansubs]]. By 1994, anime had become more common in the U.S., and had begun being translated into English and shown on television, most commonly [[sh\u014dnen]] series such as [[Pok\u00e9mon]] and [[Astro Boy]].<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nAccording to [[Mike Tatsugawa]], the founder and CEO of the [[Anime Expo|Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation]], the first milestone for anime in the U.S. was in the 1980s with the advent of the [[Internet]]. With the Internet, fans were able to more easily communicate with each other and thus better able to exchange [[Fansub|fan-subtitled]] tapes and higher quality versions of anime.<ref name=\"Gardiner\">{{Cite news | last = Gardiner | first = Debbi | title = Anime in America | publisher = Japan Inc Communications | magazine=J@pan Inc Magazine |date = January 2003| url = http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=972 | accessdate = May 1, 2009}}</ref> Some experts, such as Susan Napier, a Professor of Japanese Language and Literature, say that ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' marked the first milestone.<ref name=\"Rogers\" /> However, most experts agree that the next milestone was in 1992 when [[U.S. Renditions]], a film importer, released the first English-subtitled anime videotape that year, entitled ''[[Gunbuster]]''. According to Tatsugawa, the success of ''Gunbuster'' triggered a flurry of releases.<ref name=\"Gardiner\" />\n\nDue to the [[Language localisation|localization]] process, many people who grew up watching anime did so not realizing that it originated in Japan. After the success of ''[[Power Rangers]]'' (which first aired in 1993), U.S. television companies began broadcasting ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' in 1995 and 1996 respectively. However, due to the relative failure of the latter two (both shows brought success when aired at a later time on [[Cartoon Network]]), anime did not seem like it would become mainstream.<ref name=\"Manion\" /> However, the anime boom in the U.S. began with the airing of the anime series ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''<ref name=\"Manion\" /> in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 1998, which served as proof to U.S. broadcasters and distributors that Japanese media could succeed in the U.S. market. It was only after ''Pok\u00e9mon'' and ''Power Rangers'' left the mainstream that U.S. audiences became aware of anime's Japanese origins.<ref name=\"Manion\" />\n\n==== Anime streaming outlets in the United States ====\nIn the United States there are a couple streaming outlets that fans can use to view anime and manga, while also being able to connect with those communities. One such outlet is [[Crunchyroll]], a streaming service that lets users view popular anime from the past and new anime episodes released to the website. Crunchyroll was created in 2006 as a distribution outlet for anime. Crunchyroll has since evolved into becoming something more for fans in the anime community. They have added an addition to their website that allows anime and manga fans to get news about anime releases, events, and topics related to the community. This has also evolved to the creation of the [[Crunchyroll Expo]]. This exposition is a large scale event in San Jose, CA that allows anime and manga fans to connect. The streaming service also features a store where you can purchase anime related products such as: figures, Japanese snacks, apparel, posters, video games and manga.\n\nIn addition, another streaming service within the United States is [[Funimation]]. Similar to Crunchyroll, Funimation allows you to view newly released anime while also offering a store with products similar to Crunchyroll. Funimation's website also has a section created for events related to anime and manga that allows their members to connect at the local and national level. There is also a blog section that allows those with an account on Funimation to connect with other fans and talk about their favorite, or maybe even least favorite, anime and episode. \n\n=== European fan communities (France, Italy, Spain and Germany) ===\nIn the 1970s, Japanese Animation reached Europe mainly with productions aimed at European and Japanese children with the main results being ''[[Heidi, Girl of the Alps|Heidi]]'', [[Vicky the Viking|''Vicky the Vicking'']] and ''[[Barbapapa]]''. However these works were not recognized as Japanese productions and did not earn much of a dedicated fanbase. However Italy, Spain and France grew an interest for more Japanese animation for their television programming, due to success of previous co-productions, Japan's productive output and cheap selling price in comparison to US animation.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Animation: A World History: Volume II: The Birth of a Style - The Three Markets|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0azMCgAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2015-10-23|isbn = 9781317519911|language = en|first = Giannalberto|last = Bendazzi}}</ref> Particularly Italy imported the most anime outside of Japan.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Italian anime boom: The outstanding success of Japanese animation in Italy, 1978\u20131984|journal = Journal of Italian Cinema & Media Studies|date = 2014-09-01|pages = 363\u2013381|volume = 2|issue = 3|doi = 10.1386/jicms.2.3.363_1|first = Marco|last = Pellitteri}}</ref> Like in the Philippines, the [[Super Robot]] Genre became very popular with series such as ''[[UFO Robot Grendizer]]'' and ''[[Mazinger Z]]''. However many more genres got added to the mix, with space opera such as ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', shojo shows like ''[[Candy Candy]]'' and [[The Rose of Versailles|''Rose of Versailles'']], sports like ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' and more. Germany however largely rejected Anime other than western literature adaptations of [[Nippon Animation]], with [[Speed Racer]] and ''[[Captain Future]]'' proving to be problematic. It was only during the rise of cable television during the '90s that Japanese series such as ''[[Queen Millennia]]'', and [[The Rose of Versailles|''Rose of Versailles'']] went on air. A strong affinity for unique Japanese productions was developed among a generation of German children during this period.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anime in Europe |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/goslingeuro1.5.html |website=www.awn.com |access-date=2016-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202000517/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/goslingeuro1.5.html |archivedate=2015-02-02 }}</ref>\n\n== Appeal of anime and manga ==\nOne major appeal of anime is its artwork; some fans claim that its visual quality is superior to that found in most animated series made in the United States<ref name=\"Gardiner\" /> and many ignore all non-Japanese animation. One fan described enjoying anime because \"there is no dividing line between special effects and what is real...it's just the way somebody imagined it\". The content editor of ''Anime Fringe'', Holly Kolodziejczak, described being amazed by anime's depth that was unlike the cartoons she had seen before: \"the characters had real personalities, their own feelings and motivations for their actions, strengths and flaws that enhanced their characters. They were more like real people, and thus people could much more readily identify with them.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/special/04.php | last = Kolodziejczak | first = Holly | title = So, this is Point B? - Looking Back, Going Forward |date=December 2005 | accessdate = 2009-05-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090417065025/http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/special/04.php| archivedate= 17 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Larry Green of [[Nausicaa.net]] agreed and added that anime discusses subjects for both adults and children whereas in the United States animation is traditionally for children.

Napier]], a Professor of Japanese Language and Literature, stated that anime fans \"find refuge in a culture that diverges from the typical American way of life.\" She pointed out that fascination with Japanese culture is not a new concept and has existed since the mid-19th century. For example, an 1876 painting by [[Claude Monet]] entitled ''La Japonaise'' depicts Monet's wife wearing a [[kimono]], with Japanese [[Fan (implement)#East Asia|hand fans]] shown in the background. Napier described this interest in Japan as an \"escape from the [[Industrial Revolution]] ... a [[Arcadia (utopia)|pastoral utopia]]\" for many Europeans.<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite news | last = Rogers | first = Carter | title = Professor of Japanese speaks about anime fandom | publisher = [[The Tufts Daily]] | date = February 23, 2009 | url = http://www.tuftsdaily.com/professor-of-japanese-speaks-about-anime-fandom-1.1568757 | accessdate = May 4, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416153226/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/professor-of-japanese-speaks-about-anime-fandom-1.1568757| archivedate= 16 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n=== What Is Anime? ===\nAnime is a Japanese art which is contrived from drawing of frames which flicker in front of a camera. Thus resulting in what is other wise known as a film.

Although fan service usually refers to sexually provocative scenes,<ref name=\"O'Connel\" /> it also refers more generally to events of little plot value designed to excite viewers or simply make them take notice, such as big explosions and battle scenes.<ref>{{cite web | first = Pete | last = Harcoff | title = Anime Glossary | publisher = The Anime Critic | date = May 23, 2003 | url = http://www.animecritic.com/resources/glossary.html | accessdate = May 1, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219224338/http://animecritic.com/resources/glossary.html | archive-date = February 19, 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref> When anime and manga are translated into English by U.S. companies, the original work is often edited to remove some of the fan service to make it more appropriate for U.S. audiences.

In fact, fluent English speakers who know sufficient Japanese are often preferred for translating over fluent Japanese speakers who know sufficient English, as the syntax of the latter group tends to be stiff.

Anime includes [[animation|animated]] [[wikt:serial|series]], films and videos, while manga includes [[manga]], [[graphic novels]], drawings and related artwork. They have their origin in Japanese entertainment, but the style and culture has spread worldwide since its introduction into [[Western world|the West]] in the 1990s.\n\n== Otaku ==\n{{Main|Otaku}}\n''Otaku'' is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests, including anime, manga or video games. In its original context, the term ''otaku'' is derived from a Japanese term for another's house or family ({{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u304a\u5b85|\u304a\u5b85]],}} ''otaku''), which is also used as an [[honorific]] second-person pronoun. The modern [[slang]] form, which is distinguished from the older usage by being written only in [[hiragana]] (\u304a\u305f\u304f) or [[katakana]] (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af or, less frequently, \u30f2\u30bf\u30af), or rarely in [[r\u014dmaji]], appeared in the 1980s. In the anime [[Macross]], first aired in 1982, the term was used by [[Lynn Minmay (Macross)|Lynn Minmay]] as an honorific term.<ref>May 2006 issue of ''EX Taishuu'' magazine</ref><ref name=\"NRI\">\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u5e02\u5834\u306e\u7814\u7a76(Otaku Shijou no Kenkyuu), \u91ce\u6751\u7e3d\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u6240(Nomura Research Institute), {{ISBN|978-986-124-768-7}}</ref> It appears to have been coined by the humorist and essayist [[Akio Nakamori]] in his 1983 series {{nihongo|''An Investigation of \"Otaku\"''|\u300e\u304a\u305f\u304f\u300f\u306e\u7814\u7a76|\"Otaku\" no Kenky\u016b}}, printed in the [[lolicon]] magazine ''[[Manga Burikko]]''. Animators like [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]] and [[Sh\u014dji Kawamori]] used the term among themselves as an honorific second-person pronoun since the late 1970s.<ref name=\"NRI\"/> After its wild spread usage by other Japanese people, however, it became [[pejorative]] and increasingly offensive in the 1990s, implying that a person is socially inept. ''Otaku'' can be seen as being similar to the English terms ''[[geek]]'' or ''[[nerd]]''.\n\nHowever, the term started to be used by anime and manga fans themselves again starting in the 2000s, in a more general and positive way, and today it is often used by those outside of the fandom to refer to fans of anime or manga. However, older generation otaku, like ''Otaking'' (King of Otakus) [[Toshio Okada]], in his book ''Otaku Wa Sude Ni Shindeiru'' (\u30aa\u30bf\u30af\u306f\u3059\u3067\u306b\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b) said the newer generation of self-proclaimed otakus are not real otakus, as they lack the passion and research sense into a particular sub-culture subject, and are only common fans which only over spent in buying products.\n\n== History of the community ==\n{{See also|History of anime|Manga outside Japan}}\n\nAnime and manga fandom traces back to at least the 1970s when after [[Space Battleship Yamato]]; stopped airing on Japanese [[television]], fans of the \nseries banded together to get ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' back on the air after it stopped airing on Japanese [[television]].<ref>{{cite web | title = An Overview of Yamato Fan History, Part 1 | url = http://starblazers.com/html.php?page_id=260&PHPSESSID=53ad571dd98998f6e351cf607ccd182b | publisher = [[Voyager Entertainment]] | accessdate = May 10, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090531042519/http://starblazers.com/html.php?page_id=260&PHPSESSID=a517f630dab6ea69371c4eae5e6c756d| archivedate= 31 May 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> In Japan, anime and manga are referred to collectively as the content industry: anime, video games, manga, and other related merchandise are different types of media focused around the same content.<ref name=\"Manion\">{{cite journal | last = Manion | first = Annie | year = 2005 | title = Discovering Japan: Anime and Learning Japanese Culture. | journal = East Asian Studies Center, USC | url = http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf | accessdate = April 27, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171215035736/http://www.chanpon.org/archive/manionthesis.pdf | archive-date = December 15, 2017 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nHowever, the manga market in Japan is beginning to decline. In 2007, the manga industry showed a 4% decrease in sales from the previous year, its fifth consecutive year of decline. Japanese and American researchers have proposed that this may be due to the decrease in the young population in Japan and a lack of interest in reading. The manga critic and translator [[Matt Thorn]] stated that there was a growing dissatisfaction with the lack of originality found in many manga.<ref>{{cite news | title = Quantcast Manga Sales in Japan Decline for Fifth Consecutive Year | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = October 20, 2007 | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-20/manga-sales-in-japan-decline-for-fifth-consecutive-year | accessdate = April 28, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090408075235/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-10-20/manga-sales-in-japan-decline-for-fifth-consecutive-year| archivedate= 8 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Al Kahn, CEO of [[4Kids Entertainment]], stated that \"Manga is a problem because we are in a culture that is not a reading culture\" and that \"Manga is dying in Japan.\"<ref>{{cite news | first = Al | last = Kahn | title = Sparks Fly at ICv2 Anime/Manga Conference | publisher = ICv2 | date = December 7, 2007 | url = http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/11741.html | accessdate = April 28, 2009}}</ref> Liza Coppola, vice president of [[Viz Media]], said that the widespread availability of cell phones and ability to view anime and manga on cell phones is likely the cause of decline in demand for anime and manga.<ref>{{cite news | title = Interview with Liza Coppola, Part 3 | publisher = ICv2 | date = December 7, 2007 | url = http://www.icv2.com/articles/home/11741.html | accessdate = April 28, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== English-language fan communities ===\nThe fan community in the English-speaking world began in the 1970s and steadily grew.

It was the first exposure of Filipinos to Japanese animation. ''Voltes&nbsp;V'' soon became very popular between children all around the Philippines which led to the sudden popularity of other anime series' related to the [[Super Robot]] genre in the Philippines. It was soon banned in 1979 by then president [[Ferdinand Marcos]], five episodes before the end of the series, along with the other anime series' airing at the time, for its violence and warlike themes. This however, did not hinder the Filipinos' growing love of anime, leading to the large popularity of anime and manga throughout the Philippines.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mann|first=William|title=Filipinos short-circuit 'Voltes V'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6gEkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=I-4DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4941,5305880&dq=voltes+v&hl=en|accessdate=24 May 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review|date=24 September 1979}}</ref>\n\nPoitras identifies the first generation as the \"Astro Boy Generation\". Despite being the first and most popular animated Japanese television series, ''[[Astro Boy]]'' did not create many hardcore fans, but it exposed viewers to the medium and increased their receptivity towards it later on. The \"Early Fans\" or \"Old Timers\" generation that consumed titles like ''[[Speed Racer]]'', ''[[Eighth Man]]'', and ''[[Battle of the Planets]]'' as staples. These fans were much more aware that what they were consuming was Japanese and took the initiative to search for more. The \"Yamato\" or \"Star Blazers\" generation originating from the series ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' that originally aired in 1979\u201380. Poitras states that this generation was so loyal because ''Star Blazer'''s strong narration required viewers to never miss an episode. The Poitras dubs the next generation the \"Robotech Generation\", after the 1985 television series ''[[Robotech]]'', is the earliest major generation in the USA and is distinguished by fans clearly recognizing anime as a Japanese product with significant differences from American animation. Fans from this generation and the Yamato Generation were to make up the significant portion of organized fandom throughout the 1980s. The film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', which played in art theaters in December 1989, produced a cult following that Poitras names the \"Akira Generation\". ''Akira'' inspired some to move on to other works but stalled many becoming an isolated work in their eyes, overshadowing the creative context of anime and manga it represented.<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nThen in the 1990s, Poitras states that \"something new happened in the U.S.\", the \"Sailor Moon Generation\" was born. Previous generations consisted mostly of college age fans, however in 1995 ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' was adapted into English and caught the attention of people even as young as grade school in age, many of them female. In the span of a few months, the fan demographic changed dramatically and as their interests diversified, so did the titles adapted into English. Poitras, Lewis and Sterling describe current generation of fans as the \"Otaku Generation\", however not necessarily applying the word \"[[otaku]]\" to current fans. For this generation, the release of a title onto the television in the past was unusual enough that fans often remember their first anime experience as something special. Poitras remarked that as of the \"Otaku Generation\", the influx of fans into the fandom is better characterized by a continuous stream than as waves as it was in the past.<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nIn the United States, the fan community began as an offshoot of [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fan community]], with fans bringing imported copies of Japanese [[manga]] to [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].<ref>{{cite web | first = Jason H. | last = Bennett | title = A Preliminary History of American Anime Fandom | url = http://a-kon.co/bm/bm~doc/prelim_history.pdf | publisher = University of Texas at Arlington | accessdate = May 10, 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725022644/http://a-kon.com/bm/bm~doc/prelim_history.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-25}}</ref> Before anime began to be licensed in the U.S., fans who wanted to get a hold of anime would leak copies of anime movies and subtitle them, thus marking the start of [[fansubs]]. By 1994, anime had become more common in the U.S., and had begun being translated into English and shown on television, most commonly [[sh\u014dnen]] series such as [[Pok\u00e9mon]] and [[Astro Boy]].<ref name=\"Poitras\" />\n\nAccording to [[Mike Tatsugawa]], the founder and CEO of the [[Anime Expo|Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation]], the first milestone for anime in the U.S. was in the 1980s with the advent of the [[Internet]]. With the Internet, fans were able to more easily communicate with each other and thus better able to exchange [[Fansub|fan-subtitled]] tapes and higher quality versions of anime.<ref name=\"Gardiner\">{{Cite news | last = Gardiner | first = Debbi | title = Anime in America | publisher = Japan Inc Communications | magazine=J@pan Inc Magazine |date = January 2003| url = http://www.japaninc.com/article.php?articleID=972 | accessdate = May 1, 2009}}</ref> Some experts, such as Susan Napier, a Professor of Japanese Language and Literature, say that ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' marked the first milestone.<ref name=\"Rogers\" /> However, most experts agree that the next milestone was in 1992 when [[U.S. Renditions]], a film importer, released the first English-subtitled anime videotape that year, entitled ''[[Gunbuster]]''. According to Tatsugawa, the success of ''Gunbuster'' triggered a flurry of releases.<ref name=\"Gardiner\" />\n\nDue to the [[Language localisation|localization]] process, many people who grew up watching anime did so not realizing that it originated in Japan. After the success of ''[[Power Rangers]]'' (which first aired in 1993), U.S. television companies began broadcasting ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' in 1995 and 1996 respectively. However, due to the relative failure of the latter two (both shows brought success when aired at a later time on [[Cartoon Network]]), anime did not seem like it would become mainstream.<ref name=\"Manion\" /> However, the anime boom in the U.S. began with the airing of the anime series ''[[Pok\u00e9mon (anime)|Pok\u00e9mon]]''<ref name=\"Manion\" /> in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 1998, which served as proof to U.S. broadcasters and distributors that Japanese media could succeed in the U.S. market. It was only after ''Pok\u00e9mon'' and ''Power Rangers'' left the mainstream that U.S. audiences became aware of anime's Japanese origins.<ref name=\"Manion\" />\n\n==== Anime streaming outlets in the United States ====\nIn the United States there are a couple streaming outlets that fans can use to view anime and manga, while also being able to connect with those communities. One such outlet is [[Crunchyroll]], a streaming service that lets users view popular anime from the past and new anime episodes released to the website. Crunchyroll was created in 2006 as a distribution outlet for anime. Crunchyroll has since evolved into becoming something more for fans in the anime community. They have added an addition to their website that allows anime and manga fans to get news about anime releases, events, and topics related to the community. This has also evolved to the creation of the [[Crunchyroll Expo]]. This exposition is a large scale event in San Jose, CA that allows anime and manga fans to connect. The streaming service also features a store where you can purchase anime related products such as: figures, Japanese snacks, apparel, posters, video games and manga.\n\nIn addition, another streaming service within the United States is [[Funimation]]. Similar to Crunchyroll, Funimation allows you to view newly released anime while also offering a store with products similar to Crunchyroll. Funimation's website also has a section created for events related to anime and manga that allows their members to connect at the local and national level. There is also a blog section that allows those with an account on Funimation to connect with other fans and talk about their favorite, or maybe even least favorite, anime and episode. \n\n=== European fan communities (France, Italy, Spain and Germany) ===\nIn the 1970s, Japanese Animation reached Europe mainly with productions aimed at European and Japanese children with the main results being ''[[Heidi, Girl of the Alps|Heidi]]'', [[Vicky the Viking|''Vicky the Vicking'']] and ''[[Barbapapa]]''. However these works were not recognized as Japanese productions and did not earn much of a dedicated fanbase. However Italy, Spain and France grew an interest for more Japanese animation for their television programming, due to success of previous co-productions, Japan's productive output and cheap selling price in comparison to US animation.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Animation: A World History: Volume II: The Birth of a Style - The Three Markets|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0azMCgAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2015-10-23|isbn = 9781317519911|language = en|first = Giannalberto|last = Bendazzi}}</ref> Particularly Italy imported the most anime outside of Japan.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Italian anime boom: The outstanding success of Japanese animation in Italy, 1978\u20131984|journal = Journal of Italian Cinema & Media Studies|date = 2014-09-01|pages = 363\u2013381|volume = 2|issue = 3|doi = 10.1386/jicms.2.3.363_1|first = Marco|last = Pellitteri}}</ref> Like in the Philippines, the [[Super Robot]] Genre became very popular with series such as ''[[UFO Robot Grendizer]]'' and ''[[Mazinger Z]]''. However many more genres got added to the mix, with space opera such as ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', shojo shows like ''[[Candy Candy]]'' and [[The Rose of Versailles|''Rose of Versailles'']], sports like ''[[Captain Tsubasa]]'' and more. Germany however largely rejected Anime other than western literature adaptations of [[Nippon Animation]], with [[Speed Racer]] and ''[[Captain Future]]'' proving to be problematic. It was only during the rise of cable television during the '90s that Japanese series such as ''[[Queen Millennia]]'', and [[The Rose of Versailles|''Rose of Versailles'']] went on air. A strong affinity for unique Japanese productions was developed among a generation of German children during this period.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anime in Europe |url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/goslingeuro1.5.html |website=www.awn.com |access-date=2016-02-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202000517/http://www.awn.com/mag/issue1.5/articles/goslingeuro1.5.html |archivedate=2015-02-02 }}</ref>\n\n== Appeal of anime and manga ==\nOne major appeal of anime is its artwork; some fans claim that its visual quality is superior to that found in most animated series made in the United States<ref name=\"Gardiner\" /> and many ignore all non-Japanese animation. One fan described enjoying anime because \"there is no dividing line between special effects and what is real...it's just the way somebody imagined it\". The content editor of ''Anime Fringe'', Holly Kolodziejczak, described being amazed by anime's depth that was unlike the cartoons she had seen before: \"the characters had real personalities, their own feelings and motivations for their actions, strengths and flaws that enhanced their characters. They were more like real people, and thus people could much more readily identify with them.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/special/04.php | last = Kolodziejczak | first = Holly | title = So, this is Point B? - Looking Back, Going Forward |date=December 2005 | accessdate = 2009-05-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090417065025/http://www.animefringe.com/magazine/2005/12/special/04.php| archivedate= 17 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Larry Green of [[Nausicaa.net]] agreed and added that anime discusses subjects for both adults and children whereas in the United States animation is traditionally for children.

Napier]], a Professor of Japanese Language and Literature, stated that anime fans \"find refuge in a culture that diverges from the typical American way of life.\" She pointed out that fascination with Japanese culture is not a new concept and has existed since the mid-19th century. For example, an 1876 painting by [[Claude Monet]] entitled ''La Japonaise'' depicts Monet's wife wearing a [[kimono]], with Japanese [[Fan (implement)#East Asia|hand fans]] shown in the background. Napier described this interest in Japan as an \"escape from the [[Industrial Revolution]] ... a [[Arcadia (utopia)|pastoral utopia]]\" for many Europeans.<ref name=\"Rogers\">{{cite news | last = Rogers | first = Carter | title = Professor of Japanese speaks about anime fandom | publisher = [[The Tufts Daily]] | date = February 23, 2009 | url = http://www.tuftsdaily.com/professor-of-japanese-speaks-about-anime-fandom-1.1568757 | accessdate = May 4, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090416153226/http://www.tuftsdaily.com/professor-of-japanese-speaks-about-anime-fandom-1.1568757| archivedate= 16 April 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n=== Fan service ===\n{{Main|Fan service}}\nFan service is material in a series which is intentionally added to please the audience. Although fan service usually refers to sexually provocative scenes,<ref name=\"O'Connel\" /> it also refers more generally to events of little plot value designed to excite viewers or simply make them take notice, such as big explosions and battle scenes.<ref>{{cite web | first = Pete | last = Harcoff | title = Anime Glossary | publisher = The Anime Critic | date = May 23, 2003 | url = http://www.animecritic.com/resources/glossary.html | accessdate = May 1, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090219224338/http://animecritic.com/resources/glossary.html | archive-date = February 19, 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref> When anime and manga are translated into English by U.S. companies, the original work is often edited to remove some of the fan service to make it more appropriate for U.S. audiences. Mike Tatsugawa explained this change as a result of a difference between cultural values of Japan and the U.S.<ref name=\"Poitras\" /><ref name=\"Gardiner\" /> In fact, some anime seem to feature little else other than fan service as their selling point.<ref>{{cite web | last = Santos | first = Carlo | title = 2004 Year in Review | publisher = [[Anime News Network]] | date = January 26, 2005 | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2005-01-26/4 | accessdate = May 1, 2009}}</ref> Some believe that the prevalence of fan service indicates a lack of maturity within the fandom; an editor of [[Del Rey Manga]] joked that manga ''[[Negima!]]'', which contained fan service, should be rated as \"for immature readers 16+\" rather than for \"mature readers 16+\".<ref name=\"O'Connel\" />\n\n== Fan Labor ==\n\n=== D\u014djin ===\n{{Main|D\u014djin}}D\u014djin are fan-made manga that are oftentimes bought and sold through d\u014djin events.

In fact, fluent English speakers who know sufficient Japanese are often preferred for translating over fluent Japanese speakers who know sufficient English, as the syntax of the latter group tends to be stiff.
