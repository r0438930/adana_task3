largest city in eastern [[Senegal]], {{convert|250|mi|km|order=flip}} southeast of [[Dakar]], and is the regional capital of the [[Tambacounda Region|province]] of the same name. Its estimated population in 2007 was 78,800.\n\n==Geography==\nTambacounda is situated on the sparsely populated [[Sahel|sah\u00e9lien]] plains of eastern Senegal. Like most of West Africa, the area has two seasons, the rainy season from June to October, characterized by heat, humidity and storms, and the dry season from November to May.\n\nNearby towns include Madina Maboule, Koukari, Yoro Sankoule, Sambadian, Djidje Kounda, Afia Seno, Saare Boylii and Kanderi Niana.\n==Climate==\nTambacounda has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (Aw). It has hot, dry winters and warm, wet summers. The average precipitation is {{convert|887|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n| location = Tambacounda\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 41.7\n|Feb record high C = 42.2\n|Mar record high C = 44.4\n|Apr record high C = 46.1\n|May record high C = 46.1\n|Jun record high C = 43.9\n|Jul record high C = 37.2\n|Aug record high C = 37.2\n|Sep record high C = 37.2\n|Oct record high C = 40.0\n|Nov record high C = 40.0\n|Dec record high C = 40.0\n|year record high C = \n\n| Jan high C = 35.0\n| Feb high C = 37.2\n| Mar high C = 38.9\n| Apr high C = 41.1\n| May high C = 39.4\n| Jun high C = 36.1\n| Jul high C = 32.2\n| Aug high C = 30.6\n| Sep high C = 31.7\n| Oct high C = 33.3\n| Nov high C = 35.0\n| Dec high C = 33.9\n\n| Jan mean C = 25.0\n| Feb mean C = 26.7\n| Mar mean C = 29.2\n| Apr mean C = 31.1\n| May mean C = 31.9\n| Jun mean C = 29.7\n| Jul mean C = 26.7\n| Aug mean C = 26.1\n| Sep mean C = 27.0\n| Oct mean C = 27.5\n| Nov mean C = 26.1\n| Dec mean C = 24.5\n| year mean C =\n\n| Jan low C = 15.0\n| Feb low C = 16.1\n| Mar low C = 19.4\n| Apr low C = 21.1\n| May low C = 24.4\n| Jun low C = 23.3\n| Jul low C = 21.1\n| Aug low C = 21.7\n| Sep low C = 22.2\n| Oct low C = 21.7\n| Nov low C = 17.2\n| Dec low C = 15.0\n\n|Jan record low C = 7.8\n|Feb record low C = 8.3\n|Mar record low C = 13.9\n|Apr record low C = 14.4\n|May record low C = 17.8\n|Jun record low C = 17.8\n|Jul record low C = 17.8\n|Aug record low C = 18.3\n|Sep record low C = 17.8\n|Oct record low C = 16.1\n|Nov record low C = 10.6\n|Dec record low C = 7.8\n|year record low C = \n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 1.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 1.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 0\n|Apr precipitation mm = 2.0\n|May precipitation mm = 21.1\n|Jun precipitation mm = 127.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 182.9\n|Aug precipitation mm = 256.0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 223.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 70.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 2.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 1\n|source 1 = <ref>https://globalbioclimatics.org/station/se-tamba.htm</ref>\n}}\n\n==Population and culture==\n\nBetween the censuses of 1988 and 2002, Tambacounda grew from 41,885 to 67,543 inhabitants.\n\nIn 2007, according to official estimates, the population reached 78,800 persons.\n\nSettled first by [[Mandinka people|Mandike]] peoples on the outskirts of the [[Mali Empire]], on the regular [[transhumance]] routes of [[Fula people|Fula]] cattle herders, and settled again by [[Wolof people|Wolof]] farmers in the early 20th century, Tambacounda has a mix of most of the [[Languages of Senegal|ethnic groups in Senegal]].\n\nThe Tambacounda region is famous for its rich [[djembe]] and dance culture and heritage. Some of the greatest djembe masters from [[Segu, Mali]] came to Tambacounda in the mid 1900s, bringing with them their history, knowledge, and secrets of the djembe. Among the famous musicians from Tambacounda is drummer [[Abdoulaye Diakite]].\n\n==Religion==\nAs with most of Senegal, the population is overwhelmingly [[Islam in Senegal|Muslim]], with much of the Wolof population in the region tracing their roots to [[Mouride]] [[sufi]] adherents who were given wild grassland by [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal|the brotherhood]] to clear and settle at the beginning of the 20th century.  There is a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tambacounda]], but only 1.8% of the population of the region is [[Roman Catholic]].\n\n==Transport hub==\n[[File:Train station, 2009.jpg|thumb|Train station, 2009]]\nHistorically, the city grew from a village along the [[Dakar\u2013Niger Railway|Dakar \u2013 Bamako railway]], built in the colonial period, and still used today, however passenger travel itself is limited. A branch line junctioning from this station is proposed to serve [[K\u00e9dougou]].\n\nThe city lies on the [[N1 road (Senegal)|N1]] and [[N7 road (Senegal)|N7 road]]s. As a part of the [[Trans-Sahelian Highway]] system, these are critical for traffic going between the [[Kayes Region]] of [[Mali]] and the coastal regions of [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]] ([[Dakar]], [[Thi\u00e8s]], [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]), the most densely populated parts of both these nations. This east\u2013west travel intersects with Senegal's most important route from [[Dakar]] to the [[Casamance]] region, which is cut off by [[Gambia]].  Slow river ferries, border posts, and corrupt border guards mean that many Senegalese are willing to travel far out of their way to avoid the international border.  In 2002 the [[MV Joola]] ferry from Dakar to [[Ziguinchor]] sank, but since then a new ferry has replaced it and the water route to [[Ziguinchor]] has reopened.  The road through Tambacounda is the only internal route between the two parts of the country, however it is also possible to travel through the [[Gambia]].\n\nThe town also has an airport, [[Tambacounda Airport]], serviced by national and international flights.\n[[Image:TambacoundaCows.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A farm near Tambacounda.]]\n\n==Agriculture==\nTambacounda is also a center for agricultural processing, with millet, sorgum, maize and cotton grown in the dry plains of the region. Sodefitex operates a large cotton processing plant in the town.\n\n==History==\n{{no ref|section|date=July 2018}}\nTambacounda was a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] town and trade center at the beginning of French colonialisation.  With the railway came more intensive cultivation of grains and cotton by [[Wolof people]]s seeking arable land.  French colonialists made the town a major transport center, and a number of buildings, including the rail station retain the colonial flavor.\n\n==Administration==\nTambacounda is the capital of [[Tambacounda Department]] (which includes three administrative regions) and the large [[Tambacounda Region]].\n\nSouty Tour\u00e9, the current mayor, was formerly a government minister under [[Abdou Diouf]], and was the founder of the [[Authentic Socialist Party (Senegal)|Parti socialiste authentique]] (PSA) political party.  The PSA has only one seat in the legislature, and Tambacounda is its political base.\n\n==Sites of interest==\n[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|[[Niokolo-Koba National Park]]]]\nThe [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]] lies just to the south of the town, and is famed for its wildlife.\n\nIn 2003, the iron-framed rail station, the ''H\u00f4tel de la Gare,'' and the colonial Pr\u00e9fecture building were placed on Senegal's list of ''Monuments historiques''.<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.sn/article.php3?id_article=137 Arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 27 mars 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207094223/http://www.culture.gouv.sn/article.php3?id_article=137 |date=2012-02-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Sister cities==\n* [[Image:Flag of France.svg|25px]] [[Bondy]] in [[France]].\n* [[Image:Flag of France.svg|25px]] [[La Roche sur Yon]] in [[France]] (local development project)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transport in Senegal]]\n\n== References ==\n* Translation of [[:fr:Tambacounda]] (January 2008).\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{in lang|fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080218125412/http://sip.sn/tambacounda/ Site officiel de la commune]\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.planete-senegal.com/visites/tambacounda.php Tambacounda sur Plan\u00e8te S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.tambacounda.info/ tambacounda.info]: Tambacounda based news and web portal.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120227175549/http://pcsenegal.org/tamba.html Peace Corps Senegal, Tambacounda Page]\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{in lang|fr}} Sekna Ciss\u00e9, ''\u00c9volution de la population de Tambacounda 1915-1976.

largest city in eastern [[Senegal]], {{convert|250|mi|km|order=flip}} southeast of [[Dakar]], and is the regional capital of the [[Tambacounda Region|province]] of the same name. Its estimated population in 2007 was 78,800.\n\n==Geography==\nTambacounda is situated on the sparsely populated [[Sahel|sah\u00e9lien]] plains of eastern Senegal. Like most of West Africa, the area has two seasons, the rainy season from June to October, characterized by heat, humidity and storms, and the dry season from November to May.\n\nNearby towns include Madina Maboule, Koukari, Yoro Sankoule, Sambadian, Djidje Kounda, Afia Seno, Saare Boylii and Kanderi Niana.\n==Climate==\nTambacounda has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (Aw). It has hot, dry winters and warm, wet summers. The average precipitation is {{convert|887|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n| location = Tambacounda\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 41.7\n|Feb record high C = 42.2\n|Mar record high C = 44.4\n|Apr record high C = 46.1\n|May record high C = 46.1\n|Jun record high C = 43.9\n|Jul record high C = 37.2\n|Aug record high C = 37.2\n|Sep record high C = 37.2\n|Oct record high C = 40.0\n|Nov record high C = 40.0\n|Dec record high C = 40.0\n|year record high C = \n\n| Jan high C = 35.0\n| Feb high C = 37.2\n| Mar high C = 38.9\n| Apr high C = 41.1\n| May high C = 39.4\n| Jun high C = 36.1\n| Jul high C = 32.2\n| Aug high C = 30.6\n| Sep high C = 31.7\n| Oct high C = 33.3\n| Nov high C = 35.0\n| Dec high C = 33.9\n\n| Jan mean C = 25.0\n| Feb mean C = 26.7\n| Mar mean C = 29.2\n| Apr mean C = 31.1\n| May mean C = 31.9\n| Jun mean C = 29.7\n| Jul mean C = 26.7\n| Aug mean C = 26.1\n| Sep mean C = 27.0\n| Oct mean C = 27.5\n| Nov mean C = 26.1\n| Dec mean C = 24.5\n| year mean C =\n\n| Jan low C = 15.0\n| Feb low C = 16.1\n| Mar low C = 19.4\n| Apr low C = 21.1\n| May low C = 24.4\n| Jun low C = 23.3\n| Jul low C = 21.1\n| Aug low C = 21.7\n| Sep low C = 22.2\n| Oct low C = 21.7\n| Nov low C = 17.2\n| Dec low C = 15.0\n\n|Jan record low C = 7.8\n|Feb record low C = 8.3\n|Mar record low C = 13.9\n|Apr record low C = 14.4\n|May record low C = 17.8\n|Jun record low C = 17.8\n|Jul record low C = 17.8\n|Aug record low C = 18.3\n|Sep record low C = 17.8\n|Oct record low C = 16.1\n|Nov record low C = 10.6\n|Dec record low C = 7.8\n|year record low C = \n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 1.0\n|Feb precipitation mm = 1.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 0\n|Apr precipitation mm = 2.0\n|May precipitation mm = 21.1\n|Jun precipitation mm = 127.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 182.9\n|Aug precipitation mm = 256.0\n|Sep precipitation mm = 223.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 70.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 2.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 1\n|source 1 = <ref>https://globalbioclimatics.org/station/se-tamba.htm</ref>\n}}\n\n==Population and culture==\n\nBetween the censuses of 1988 and 2002, Tambacounda grew from 41,885 to 67,543 inhabitants.\n\nIn 2007, according to official estimates, the population reached 78,800 persons.\n\nSettled first by [[Mandinka people|Mandike]] peoples on the outskirts of the [[Mali Empire]], on the regular [[transhumance]] routes of [[Fula people|Fula]] cattle herders, and settled again by [[Wolof people|Wolof]] farmers in the early 20th century, Tambacounda has a mix of most of the [[Languages of Senegal|ethnic groups in Senegal]].\n\nThe Tambacounda region is famous for its rich [[djembe]] and dance culture and heritage. Some of the greatest djembe masters from [[Segu, Mali]] came to Tambacounda in the mid 1900s, bringing with them their history, knowledge, and secrets of the djembe. Among the famous musicians from Tambacounda is drummer [[Abdoulaye Diakite]].\n\n==Religion==\nAs with most of Senegal, the population is overwhelmingly [[Islam in Senegal|Muslim]], with much of the Wolof population in the region tracing their roots to [[Mouride]] [[sufi]] adherents who were given wild grassland by [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal|the brotherhood]] to clear and settle at the beginning of the 20th century.  There is a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tambacounda]], but only 1.8% of the population of the region is [[Roman Catholic]].\n\n==Transport hub==\n[[File:Train station, 2009.jpg|thumb|Train station, 2009]]\nHistorically, the city grew from a village along the [[Dakar\u2013Niger Railway|Dakar \u2013 Bamako railway]], built in the colonial period, and still used today, however passenger travel itself is limited. A branch line junctioning from this station is proposed to serve [[K\u00e9dougou]].\n\nThe city lies on the [[N1 road (Senegal)|N1]] and [[N7 road (Senegal)|N7 road]]s. As a part of the [[Trans-Sahelian Highway]] system, these are critical for traffic going between the [[Kayes Region]] of [[Mali]] and the coastal regions of [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]] ([[Dakar]], [[Thi\u00e8s]], [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]]), the most densely populated parts of both these nations. This east\u2013west travel intersects with Senegal's most important route from [[Dakar]] to the [[Casamance]] region, which is cut off by [[Gambia]].  Slow river ferries, border posts, and corrupt border guards mean that many Senegalese are willing to travel far out of their way to avoid the international border.  In 2002 the [[MV Joola]] ferry from Dakar to [[Ziguinchor]] sank, but since then a new ferry has replaced it and the water route to [[Ziguinchor]] has reopened.  The road through Tambacounda is the only internal route between the two parts of the country, however it is also possible to travel through the [[Gambia]].\n\nThe town also has an airport, [[Tambacounda Airport]], serviced by national and international flights.\n[[Image:TambacoundaCows.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A farm near Tambacounda.]]\n\n==Agriculture==\nTambacounda is also a center for agricultural processing, with millet, sorgum, maize and cotton grown in the dry plains of the region. Sodefitex operates a large cotton processing plant in the town.\n\n==History==\n{{no ref|section|date=July 2018}}\nTambacounda was a [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] town and trade center at the beginning of French colonialisation.  With the railway came more intensive cultivation of grains and cotton by [[Wolof people]]s seeking arable land.  French colonialists made the town a major transport center, and a number of buildings, including the rail station retain the colonial flavor.\n\n==Administration==\nTambacounda is the capital of [[Tambacounda Department]] (which includes three administrative regions) and the large [[Tambacounda Region]].\n\nSouty Tour\u00e9, the current mayor, was formerly a government minister under [[Abdou Diouf]], and was the founder of the [[Authentic Socialist Party (Senegal)|Parti socialiste authentique]] (PSA) political party.  The PSA has only one seat in the legislature, and Tambacounda is its political base.\n\n==Sites of interest==\n[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|[[Niokolo-Koba National Park]]]]\nThe [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]] lies just to the south of the town, and is famed for its wildlife.\n\nIn 2003, the iron-framed rail station, the ''H\u00f4tel de la Gare,'' and the colonial Pr\u00e9fecture building were placed on Senegal's list of ''Monuments historiques''.<ref>[http://www.culture.gouv.sn/article.php3?id_article=137 Arr\u00eat\u00e9 du 27 mars 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207094223/http://www.culture.gouv.sn/article.php3?id_article=137 |date=2012-02-07 }}</ref>\n\n==Sister cities==\n* [[Image:Flag of France.svg|25px]] [[Bondy]] in [[France]].\n* [[Image:Flag of France.svg|25px]] [[La Roche sur Yon]] in [[France]] (local development project)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transport in Senegal]]\n\n== References ==\n* Translation of [[:fr:Tambacounda]] (January 2008).\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{in lang|fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080218125412/http://sip.sn/tambacounda/ Site officiel de la commune]\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.planete-senegal.com/visites/tambacounda.php Tambacounda sur Plan\u00e8te S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.tambacounda.info/ tambacounda.info]: Tambacounda based news and web portal.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120227175549/http://pcsenegal.org/tamba.html Peace Corps Senegal, Tambacounda Page]\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{in lang|fr}} Sekna Ciss\u00e9, ''\u00c9volution de la population de Tambacounda 1915-1976.
