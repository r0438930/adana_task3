Drakula/Dracula is played by balding Atif Kaptan. Both the novel and the film make an explicit connection with the historical [[Vlad the Impaler]], the Prince and three-time Voivode of [[Wallachia]]. This is the first film to portray Dracula with fangs.\n\n==Plot==\nThe year is 1953. Azmi, a lawyer, travels to Romania to close a real estate transaction with Count Dracula. Azmi receives a letter from Dracula at an inn in Bistritz. He meets fearful, superstitious people at the inn. They are frightened at the mention of Draculas name, and because it is the 14th of the month, a day of ill omen. A woman warns him not to go, but Azmi says he carries an amulet for protection. The hotel\u2019 car only takes Azmi so far, and then Dracula\u2019s own carriage picks him up. The Count himself, incognito, drives the carriage to the castle. At the castle, Azmi is greeted by the Count, who helps Azmi with his bags and shows him to his room. Dracula makes excuses as to the absence of his servants, and as to why he doesn't plan to eat dinner. Azmi enjoys a supper in which the Count does not join him. Dracula tells Azmi about Transylvanian history. Wolves howl outside, and the Count remarks: \u201cListen to them\u2014the children of the night! They sing beautiful song\u201d.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.42''.</ref>\n\nA hunchbacked servant suddenly appears and  gives Azmi a key to the library and warns him not to sleep there. In the library, the Count tells Azmi to write three letters home, in which he is to say that he has already left Transylvania. Azmi and Dracula discuss the sale of the house in Istanbul. Azmi cuts his thumb. The sight of blood excites the Count. Azmi explores the castle and falls asleep in one of the rooms, and is attacked a vampire woman. The Count stops the attack, giving the woman a baby to feed on. Azmi awakes as if from a nightmare. Dracula helps him return to his room. Azmi finds a book about vampires in\nthe library-but all the pages on how to destoy them are ripped off. A woman comes to the castle pleading for the return of her child. Wolves kill her. Azmi finds a vault in which the Count reposes in a coffin-like box and tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails, whereupon he flees in terror. Dracula later tries to attack Azmi, but his servant  intervenes, and Dracula kills him. A rooster crows, and Dracula disappears. Next night looking out a window, Azmi sees Dracula climb head-first down the outer wall. Azmi returns to the vault in which the Count reposes in his box and again tries to kill the Count with a shovel, but fails. He also empties a revolver into the Count, but gunshots do not harm him. Azmi runs away.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.42-43''.</ref>\n\nBack in Turkey, Azmi's wife G\u00fczin receives one of his letters. She frets because it\u2019s the first she's heard from him in ten days. G\u00fczin spends her time with her best friend Sadan.  Sadan's mother, who has a heart condition, says Sadan has been ill and walking in her sleep lately. Though Sadan seems happy as she recently become engaged to Turan. G\u00fczin and Sadan go to the seashore. While taking a walk, they meet four men carrying a coffin-like box, which they say is full of dirt from Romania. The men say that two other men hired to move the boxes of earth disap- peared in transit. That night Sadan walks in her sleep. G\u00fczin follows her to the seashore and sees her near the foot of a seaside staircase, being preyed upon by Dracula, who disappears. G\u00fczin walks Sadan back to her room. Sadan begins to suffer from a mysterious illness that leaves her pale and weak. Her illness baffles Dr. Akif. Dr.Nuri is called to examine Sadan  and notices that she has two tiny wounds on her throat. G\u00fczin meanwhile learns that Azmi  is being nursed back to health in a hospital in Edirne. She goes to bring him home. Dr.Nuri recommends blood transfusions for Sadan. He also places garlic in her room and prepares a wreath of it for her to wear in her sleep. He warns that her windows should not be opened at night. That night, Sadan\u2019s mother removes the necklace, with disastrous results. The Count breaks the window to Sadan\u2019s room and attacks her. Sadan\u2019s mother, who is still in the room at the time, dies of a heart attack. Azmi and G\u00fczin return from Edirne, but they are too late. Sadan is on her deathbed, marks from her neck vanished and her teeth appear longer and sharper. She speaks with strange seductiveness to Turan, but Dr. Nuri prevents Turan from kissing her. Sadan dies, is buried and then rises as vampire, who preys on children. Dr.Nuri, Azmi, G\u00fczin , Dr.Akif, and Turan agree to join forces against the Count. Dr.Nuri tells the others of his suspicions about Dracula, and about his limitations: he retreats from garlic, and he can be killed by a stake through the heart or by decapitation. Dr. Nuri also reveals that the wounds in the children\u2019s throats weren't made in the same way as Sadan\u2019s wounds, but were made by Sadan herself. Dr.Nuri leads Dr. Akif, Azmi, and Turan to the graveyard by night. Inside the tomb, Sadan's coffin is empty.<ref>Lyndon W. Joslin (2017): ''Count Dracula Goes to the Movies: Stoker's Novel Adapted, p.44''.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile Dracula turns his attention to G\u00fczin , entering her home. Azmi returns in time to run him off with a garlic clove. The next day, Dr. Nuri and the others return to the graveyard. They discover that\nSadan has returned to her grave. That night, Dr. Nuri returns to the graveyard with Dr. Akif, Azmi, and Turan, and wait for Sadan. She returns to the tomb carrying a child, whom she abandons when Van Dr.Nuri and the others confront her. After trying to sweet-talk Turan, she recoils from a garlic clove and is captured. The men then return Sadan to her grave, and Turan stakes her. Dr.Nuri, Azmi, Turan, and Dr.Akif infiltrate Dracula's house and find the boxes. They place garlic in them, and then lie in wait for the Count\u2019s return. G\u00fczin, who is a showgirl, is performing that night and has to return to the musical hall to fetch her garlic wreath she left there and is detained by Dracula, who waited her there.  Dracula states his admiration for her and desire to drink her drop by drop, puts her into a trance, and makes her dance for him.<ref>Lyndon W.
