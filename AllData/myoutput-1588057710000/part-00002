It was created in 1997 and every election since has been won by a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate.\n\nAn earlier constituency of the same name existed between 1918 and 1983, but lay further to the south-east, and was a predominantly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat.\n\n==Boundaries==\n\n[[File:LiverpoolWavertree1974Constituency.svg|right|thumb|260px|Liverpool Wavertree in Lancashire, boundaries used 1974\u20131983]]\n\n*1918\u20131950: The County Borough of Liverpool wards of Allerton, Childwall and Little Woolton, Garston, Much Woolton, Wavertree, and Wavertree West.\n*1950\u20131983: The County Borough of Liverpool wards of Old Swan, Wavertree, and Wavertree West.\n*1997\u20132010: The City of Liverpool wards of Broadgreen, Childwall, Church, Kensington, Old Swan, and Picton.\n*2010\u2013present: The City of Liverpool wards of Childwall, Church, Kensington and Fairfield, Old Swan, Picton, and Wavertree.\n\nThe constituency is one of five covering the city of [[Liverpool]], and covers the localities in the eastern parts of the city such as [[Wavertree]], [[Broadgreen]], [[Childwall]], [[Edge Hill, Merseyside|Edge Hill]], [[Kensington, Liverpool|Kensington]], [[Fairfield, Liverpool|Fairfield]], part of [[Mossley Hill]] and [[Old Swan]].\n\n==History==\nThe present Liverpool Wavertree constituency dates from 1997. It contained parts of the former constituencies of [[Liverpool Broadgreen (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Broadgreen]] and [[Liverpool Mossley Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Mossley Hill]]. It was held by [[Jane Kennedy (politician)|Jane Kennedy]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from 1997-2010, who was also the former MP for Liverpool Broadgreen. At  the 2005 general election, the Labour lead over the Liberal Democrats was cut from 38 points to 15 points.<ref name=electoral>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/elections/results/general_elections|title=Electoral Commission - Previous UK general elections|website=www.electoralcommission.org.uk}}</ref>  At the 2010 general election, Jane Kennedy retired, and [[Luciana Berger]] was selected as the official Labour candidate, which caused some friction in the local CLP, especially due to her close connection with Kennedy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/crash-landing-for-labour-candidate-parachuted-into-liverpool-1951962.html|location=London|title=Crash landing for Labour candidate parachuted into Liverpool|work=The Independent|date=23 April 2010|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAn earlier Liverpool Wavertree constituency existed until 1983; this was further to the south-east in the city and was predominantly a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat, occasionally with large majorities. It had been created in 1918, but a declining population in the 1970s caused it to be split between [[Liverpool Garston (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Garston]], the newly-formed [[Liverpool Broadgreen (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Broadgreen]] and [[Liverpool Mossley Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Mossley Hill]] constituencies. While the Conservatives have fared badly in the new Wavertree constituency (polling under 7% at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]), a direct comparison must take into account the differing boundaries since the 1997 recreation:<ref name=electoral/> with more inner-city areas than its previous incarnation, the seat is home to constituents on a lower income than the average in the [[North West of England|North West]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|title=Local statistics - Office for National Statistics|website=neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk}}</ref> and who are traditionally less sympathetic to Conservative policies. The 2015 general election result made the seat the seventh-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/labour-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority]  UK Political.info.

of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. It was created in 1997 and every election since has been won by a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate.\n\nAn earlier constituency of the same name existed between 1918 and 1983, but lay further to the south-east, and was a predominantly [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat.\n\n==Boundaries==\n\n[[File:LiverpoolWavertree1974Constituency.svg|right|thumb|260px|Liverpool Wavertree in Lancashire, boundaries used 1974\u20131983]]\n\n*1918\u20131950: The County Borough of Liverpool wards of Allerton, Childwall and Little Woolton, Garston, Much Woolton, Wavertree, and Wavertree West.\n*1950\u20131983: The County Borough of Liverpool wards of Old Swan, Wavertree, and Wavertree West.\n*1997\u20132010: The City of Liverpool wards of Broadgreen, Childwall, Church, Kensington, Old Swan, and Picton.\n*2010\u2013present: The City of Liverpool wards of Childwall, Church, Kensington and Fairfield, Old Swan, Picton, and Wavertree.\n\nThe constituency is one of five covering the city of [[Liverpool]], and covers the localities in the eastern parts of the city such as [[Wavertree]], [[Broadgreen]], [[Childwall]], [[Edge Hill, Merseyside|Edge Hill]], [[Kensington, Liverpool|Kensington]], [[Fairfield, Liverpool|Fairfield]], part of [[Mossley Hill]] and [[Old Swan]].\n\n==History==\nThe present Liverpool Wavertree constituency dates from 1997. It contained parts of the former constituencies of [[Liverpool Broadgreen (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Broadgreen]] and [[Liverpool Mossley Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Mossley Hill]]. It was held by [[Jane Kennedy (politician)|Jane Kennedy]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from 1997-2010, who was also the former MP for Liverpool Broadgreen. At  the 2005 general election, the Labour lead over the Liberal Democrats was cut from 38 points to 15 points.<ref name=electoral>{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/elections/results/general_elections|title=Electoral Commission - Previous UK general elections|website=www.electoralcommission.org.uk}}</ref>  At the 2010 general election, Jane Kennedy retired, and [[Luciana Berger]] was selected as the official Labour candidate, which caused some friction in the local CLP, especially due to her close connection with Kennedy.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/crash-landing-for-labour-candidate-parachuted-into-liverpool-1951962.html|location=London|title=Crash landing for Labour candidate parachuted into Liverpool|work=The Independent|date=23 April 2010|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nAn earlier Liverpool Wavertree constituency existed until 1983; this was further to the south-east in the city and was predominantly a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat, occasionally with large majorities. It had been created in 1918, but a declining population in the 1970s caused it to be split between [[Liverpool Garston (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Garston]], the newly-formed [[Liverpool Broadgreen (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Broadgreen]] and [[Liverpool Mossley Hill (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Mossley Hill]] constituencies. While the Conservatives have fared badly in the new Wavertree constituency (polling under 7% at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]), a direct comparison must take into account the differing boundaries since the 1997 recreation:<ref name=electoral/> with more inner-city areas than its previous incarnation, the seat is home to constituents on a lower income than the average in the [[North West of England|North West]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|title=Local statistics - Office for National Statistics|website=neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk}}</ref> and who are traditionally less sympathetic to Conservative policies. The 2015 general election result made the seat the seventh-safest of Labour's 232 seats by percentage of majority.<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/labour-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority]  UK Political.info.  Retrieved 2017-01-29</ref>\n\nAt the 2010 general election, the Liberal Democrats' targeting of the seat led to a high turnout;<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8663394.stm|title=BBC News - Liverpool polling station runs out of ballots|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> however, it was comfortably retained by Labour with a 2.1% swing away from the Liberal Democrats.
