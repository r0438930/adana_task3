Founded in 1885, the UofA was the first university in the [[Arizona Territory]]. {{as of|2018}}, the university enrolls 45,217 students<ref name=\"Facts\"/> in 19 separate colleges/schools, including the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]] in Tucson and Phoenix and the [[James E. Rogers College of Law]], and is affiliated with two academic medical centers ([[Banner University Medical Center Tucson|Banner - University Medical Center Tucson]] and Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix). The University of Arizona is governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]]. The University of Arizona is one of the elected members of the [[Association of American Universities]] and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group.\n\nKnown as the [[Arizona Wildcats]] (often shortened to \"Cats\"), the UA's intercollegiate athletic teams are members of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. UA athletes have won national titles in several sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are cardinal red and navy blue.\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:OldMain UofA 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main in 1889]]\nAfter the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862]], the push for a university in Arizona grew. The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize. With no parties willing to provide land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate the land to build the school.<ref name=\"History 3a\">{{cite web | title=The Founding of the University: Myths and Heroes| access-date=Aug 11, 2019 | url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the-founding-of-the-university-myths-and-heroes}}</ref> Construction of [[Old Main, University of Arizona|Old Main]], the first building on campus, began on October 27, 1887, and classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, which is still in use today.<ref name=\"History 3\">{{cite web | title=The Old Main | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211105338/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 11, 2006}}</ref> Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the university maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Academics==\nThe University of Arizona offers bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and professional degrees.

The program's requirements entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an [[honors course]] through an honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona.\n\nThe University of Arizona Honors College recently completed construction on an Honors dormitory known as the Honors Village. The facility includes a meal hall, which is open to the public, classroom spaces, faculty offices, and space for 1052 student residents.\n\nThere are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985.

Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]].

From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K.

From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics.

The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258\u2013139\u201312. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games.

Founded in 1885, the UofA was the first university in the [[Arizona Territory]]. {{as of|2018}}, the university enrolls 45,217 students<ref name=\"Facts\"/> in 19 separate colleges/schools, including the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]] in Tucson and Phoenix and the [[James E. Rogers College of Law]], and is affiliated with two academic medical centers ([[Banner University Medical Center Tucson|Banner - University Medical Center Tucson]] and Banner - University Medical Center Phoenix). The University of Arizona is governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]]. The University of Arizona is one of the elected members of the [[Association of American Universities]] and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group.\n\nKnown as the [[Arizona Wildcats]] (often shortened to \"Cats\"), the UA's intercollegiate athletic teams are members of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. UA athletes have won national titles in several sports, most notably men's basketball, baseball, and softball. The official colors of the university and its athletic teams are cardinal red and navy blue.\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=March 2014}}\n[[File:OldMain UofA 1889.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main in 1889]]\nAfter the passage of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862]], the push for a university in Arizona grew. The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize. With no parties willing to provide land for the new institution, the citizens of Tucson prepared to return the money to the Territorial Legislature until two gamblers and a saloon keeper decided to donate the land to build the school.<ref name=\"History 3a\">{{cite web | title=The Founding of the University: Myths and Heroes| access-date=Aug 11, 2019 | url=https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the-founding-of-the-university-myths-and-heroes}}</ref> Construction of [[Old Main, University of Arizona|Old Main]], the first building on campus, began on October 27, 1887, and classes met for the first time in 1891 with 32 students in Old Main, which is still in use today.<ref name=\"History 3\">{{cite web | title=The Old Main | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | access-date=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060211105338/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history3.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 11, 2006}}</ref> Because there were no high schools in Arizona Territory, the university maintained separate preparatory classes for the first 23 years of operation.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Academics==\nThe University of Arizona offers bachelor's, master's, doctoral, and professional degrees.

The program's requirements entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an [[honors course]] through an honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona.\n\nThe University of Arizona Honors College recently completed construction on an Honors dormitory known as the Honors Village. The facility includes a meal hall, which is open to the public, classroom spaces, faculty offices, and space for 1052 student residents.\n\nThere are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996. The Stevie Eller Dance Theater, opened in 2003 (across the Mall from [[McKale Center]]) as a {{convert|28600|sqft|m2|-1|adj=on}} dedicated performance venue for the UA's dance program, one of the most highly regarded university dance departments in the United States.

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\n\n====Golf====\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 ([[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]]), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably [[Jim Furyk]]. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] and [[Lorena Ochoa]].\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\nThe [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the \"Laxcats\".

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (\u201984, \u201986, \u201987, \u201988, \u201991, \u201993, \u201994, \u201997) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]].

From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics. The ZonaZoo program is co-owned by the Associated Students of the University of Arizona (ASUA) and Arizona Athletics yet run by a team of individuals called the ZonaZoo Crew. In 2014, ESPN ranked ZonaZoo as the top student cheering section in the PAC 12 conference and in 2015, and in 2018, ZonaZoo received the Best Student Section of the Year award from the National Collegiate Student Section Association.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wildcat.arizona.edu/article/2015/04/zonazoo-named-top-student-section-by-ncssa|title=ZonaZoo named top student section by NCSSA|last=Payne|first=Roberto|date=April 8, 2015|work=The Daily Wildcat|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Notable venues===\nThe [[McKale Center]], which opened in 1973, is used by men's and women's basketball, women's gymnastics, and women's volleyball. The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there.
