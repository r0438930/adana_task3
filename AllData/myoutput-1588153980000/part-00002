It opened on 30th April 1996 and was built during 1995-96 by [[Custom Coasters International]], who wanted a ride to showcase their company in Europe. Megafobia features a [[Twister roller coaster|twister style layout]].\n\nMegafobia was the first white-knuckle attraction to be installed at Oakwood Theme Park (then Oakwood Leisure Park) in West Wales and transformed the park's fortunes from a small family leisure park to a major UK theme park. Until the construction of [[Wicker Man (roller coaster)|Wicker Man]] commenced at [[Alton Towers]] in 2017, it was also the most recent wooden roller coaster to be built in the UK.\n\nOn 30 April 2016 it celebrated 20 Years at Oakwood.\n\n==Ride experience==\nOut of the station, trains make a left turn and small dip before climbing the 85 foot tall lift hill. At the top, the track makes a 180 degree left turn, before diving down the first drop. The first drop passes through the structure, and is followed by a sweeping left curve and an airtime hill crossing over the lift hill. After this airtime hill, the track hits a 180 degree left turn, to face back towards the lift hill. The camera is situated at the exit of this turn. The track heads back towards the lift hill, passing over an airtime hill and drop that cross under the lift hill and over the first drop. The track then makes a three-quarter right turn that passes through the lift hill's structure. Leaving the lift hill structure, the train passes through an airtime hill and crosses over the exit from the first turnaround before turning around on a 180 degree right turn and drop. The track weaves under itself and traces back along the earlier pass through the lift hill structure before making a drop and turn to the right. After passing under the second hill, the track makes another right turn and then makes another drop before hitting the final brake run. Trains then pass through the transfer track and storage area before returning to the station.\n==Similar rides==\n[[Rampage (roller coaster)|Rampage]] at [[Alabama Adventure]], also built by [[Custom Coasters International]], has an almost identical layout to Megafobia. The biggest deviation is the station and brake run. Rampage places the final brake run under the first airtime hill, with trains then making a slight left, passing through the transfer track parallel to the second hill, then going through a dip drop and 180 degree right turn before sliding down another drop into the station. There is thus a slight right turn from the station to the lift hill instead of a left turn. \n== Awards ==\nMegafobia has consistently been rated among the top wooden coasters in the [[Golden Ticket Awards]].\n\n{{GTA table\n| type       = wood\n| accessdate = September 24, 2015\n| 1998       = 5\n| 1999       = 10\n| 2000       = 9\n| 2001       = 10\n| 2002       = 9\n| 2003       = 9\n| 2004       = 14\n| 2005       = 13\n| 2006       = 24\n| 2007       = 25\n| 2008       = 22\n| 2009       = 25\n| 2010       = 30\n| 2011       = 20\n| 2012       = 27\n| 2013       = 30\n| 2014       = 33\n| 2015       = 27\n| 2016       = 35\n| 2017       = \u2013\n| 2018       = 46\n| 2019       = 44\n}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Megafobia Oakwood Theme Park.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== References == \n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100709141609/http://www.oakwoodthemepark.co.uk/rides/megafobia.asp Megafobia] at Oakwood's website\n{{Custom coasters international roller coasters}}\n{{John Wardley}}\n\n[[Category:Roller coasters in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1996]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox roller coaster\n|name=Megafobia\n|image=Megafobia-1.jpg    <!--Use ONLY the filename, not a full [[Image:]] link-->\n|caption=Megafobia\n|location=Oakwood Theme Park        <!--Must not be linked, will auto-categorize the coaster.-->\n|section=          <!--Must not be linked.-->\n|type=Wood             <!--Must be \"Steel\" or \"Wood\", nothing else.
