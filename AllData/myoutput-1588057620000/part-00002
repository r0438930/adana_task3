Some breeds, such as the [[Hackney pony]], are primarily used for [[driving (horse)|driving]], while other breeds, such as the [[Connemara pony]] and [[Australian Pony]], are used primarily for [[equestrianism|riding]]. Others, such as the [[Welsh pony]], are used for both riding and driving.\n\n[[File:Shetland Pony in Harness and Cart.gif|thumb|A [[Shetland pony]] shown in [[Driving (horse)|harness]]]]\nThere is no direct correlation between a horse's size and its inherent athletic ability.<ref>Barakat, Christine. \"Why Size Matters.\"  ''Equus,'' October 2007, Issue 361, pp. 36-42</ref>  Ponies compete at events that include [[show hunter]], [[English riding]] on the flat, [[driving (horse)|driving]], and [[western riding]] classes at [[horse show]]s, as well as other competitive events such as [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]] and [[combined driving]]. They are seen in casual pursuits such as [[trail riding]], but a few ponies have performed in international-level competition.  Though many exhibitors confine themselves to classes just for ponies, some top ponies are competitive against full-sized horses. For example, a {{convert|14.1|hand|in cm|adj=on}} pony named [[Stroller (horse)|Stroller]] was a member of the British Equestrian [[show jumping]] team, and won the silver medal at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. More recently, the {{convert|14.1+3/4|hand|in cm|adj=on|lk=off}} pony [[Theodore O'Connor]] won the gold medal in [[eventing]] at the 2007 [[Pan American Games]].\n\n[[Pony Club]]s, open to young people who own either horses or ponies, are formed worldwide to educate young people about horses, promote responsible horse ownership, and also sponsor competitive events for young people and smaller horses.\n\nIn many parts of the world ponies are also still used as [[working animal]]s, as [[packhorse|pack animals]] and for pulling various [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s. They are used for children's pony rides at [[traveling carnival]]s and at children's private parties where small children can take short rides on ponies that are saddled and then either led individually or hitched to a \"pony wheel\" (a non-motorized device akin to a [[hot walker]]) that leads six to eight ponies at a time. Ponies are sometimes seen at summer camps for children, and are widely used for [[pony trekking]] and other forms of [[Equitourism]] riding holidays, often carrying adults as well as children.\nPonies are used for riding Kedarnath pilgrims in India.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Main|List of horse breeds}}\n[[File:Shetlands in Belgium.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Shetland pony]] is one of the smallest pony breeds, but is very strong.]]\nPonies are often distinguished by their [[phenotype]], a stocky body, dense bone, round shape and well-sprung ribs. They have a short head, large eyes and small ears. In addition to being smaller than a horse, their legs are proportionately shorter. They have strong [[horse hoof|hooves]] and grow a heavier [[coat (animal)|hair coat]], seen in a thicker mane and tail as well as a particularly heavy winter coat.<ref name=Strickland/>\n\nPony [[list of horse breeds|breeds]] have developed all over the world, particularly in cold and harsh climates where hardy, sturdy [[working animal]]s were needed. They are remarkably strong for their size. Breeds such as the [[Connemara pony]], are recognized for their ability to carry a full-sized adult rider. Pound for pound ponies can pull and carry more weight than a horse.<ref name=Strickland/> Draft-type ponies are able to pull loads significantly greater than their own weight, with larger ponies capable of pulling loads comparable to those pulled by full-sized [[draft horse]]s, and even very small ponies are able to pull as much as 450 percent of their own weight.<ref>[http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2010/07/27/boone-county-fair-pony-pull/ McNeill, Erin. \"Ponies at Boone County Fair pull their weight and then some\" Missourian, July 27, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130119224039/http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2010/07/27/boone-county-fair-pony-pull/ |date=January 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nNearly all pony breeds are very hardy, [[easy keeper]]s that share the ability to thrive on a more limited diet than that of a regular-sized horse, requiring half the [[hay]] for their weight as a horse, and often not needing grain at all. However, for the same reason, they are also more vulnerable to [[laminitis]] and [[Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction|Cushing's syndrome]].  They may also have problems with [[hyperlipemia]].<ref name=Strickland/>\n\nPonies are generally considered intelligent and friendly, though sometimes they also are described as stubborn or cunning.<ref name=Strickland>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/12649/pony-power|title=Pony Power!|publisher=}}</ref> The differences of opinion often result from an individual pony's degree of proper training. Ponies [[horse training|trained]] by inexperienced individuals, or only ridden by beginners, can turn out to be spoiled because their riders typically lack the experience base to correct bad habits. Properly trained ponies are appropriate mounts for children who are learning to ride.  Larger ponies can be ridden by adults, as ponies are usually strong for their size.<ref name=Strickland/>\n\n[[File:Connemara mare.jpg|thumb|The [[Connemara pony]] is a larger pony which occasionally matures over {{hands|14.2}}.]]\nFor showing purposes, ponies are often grouped into small, medium, and large sizes. Small ponies are {{hands|12.2}} and under, medium ponies are over 12.2 but no taller than {{hands|13.2|lk=off}}, and large ponies are over {{hands|13.2|lk=off}} but no taller than {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}.\n\nThe smallest equines are called [[miniature horse]]s by many of their breeders and breed organizations, rather than ponies, even though they stand smaller than small ponies,<ref name=Strickland/> usually no taller than {{convert|38|in|cm hand}} at the withers.  However, there are also [[miniature pony]] breeds.\n\n==Breeds and types that are not ponies==\n[[File:Polo2.JPG|thumb|left|The full-sized horses used for [[polo]] are called \"polo ponies,\" even though they are taller than ponies.]]\nSome [[list of horse breeds|horse breeds]] are not defined as ponies, even when they have some animals that measure under {{hands|14.2}}. This is usually due to body build, traditional uses and overall physiology. Breeds that are considered horses regardless of height include the [[Arabian horse]], [[American Quarter Horse]] and the [[Morgan horse]], all of which have individual members both over and under {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}.\n\n[[File:Gammur.jpg|thumb|The Icelandic horse is considered a horse, not a pony, by those who own and breed them.]]\nOther horse breeds, such as [[Icelandic horse]] and [[Fjord horse]], may sometimes be pony-sized or have some pony characteristics, such as a heavy coat, thick mane, and heavy bone, but are generally classified as \"horses\" by their respective registries.<ref name=Strickland/> In cases such as these, there can be considerable debate over whether to call certain breeds \"horses\" or \"ponies.\"  However, individual [[breed registry|breed registries]] usually are the arbiters of such debates, weighing the relative horse and pony characteristics of a breed. In some breeds, such as the [[Welsh pony]], the horse-versus-pony controversy is resolved by creating separate divisions for consistently horse-sized animals, such as the [[Welsh pony|\"Section D\" Welsh Cob]].\n\nSome horses may be pony height due to environment more than [[genetics]]. For example, the [[Chincoteague pony]], a [[feral horse]] that lives on [[Assateague Island]] off the coast of [[Virginia]], often matures to the height of an average small horse when raised from a [[foal]] under [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] conditions.<ref>[http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-assateague-island-national-seashore-horseback-riding-maryland-sidwcmdev_068312.html Assateague National Seashore - Wild Horses ]</ref>\n[[File:Feralpony.jpg|thumb|There is debate over whether the feral Chincoteague ponies of Assateague Island are horses or ponies]]\n\nConversely, the term \"pony\" is occasionally used to describe horses of normal height. Horses used for [[polo]] are often called \"[[polo pony|polo ponies]]\" regardless of height, even though they are often of [[Thoroughbred]] breeding and often well over {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}. [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes also have the tradition of referring to their horses as \"ponies,\" when speaking in English, even though many of the [[Mustang (horse)|Mustang horses]] they used in the 19th century were close to or over {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}, and most horses owned and bred by Native peoples today are of full horse height. The term \"pony\" is also sometimes used to describe a full-sized horse in a humorous or affectionate sense.\n\nThe [[United States Pony Club]] defines \"pony\" to be any mount that is ridden by a member regardless of its breed or size. Persons up to 25 years old are eligible for membership, and some of the members' \"ponies\" actually are full-size horses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Ponies}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [[Pony Express]], back in the old days when people would deliver mail on horses\n* [[List of horse breeds]], includes pony breeds\n* [[Pony Club]]\n* [[Equine nutrition]], for information on special feeding needs of ponies\n* [[Easy keeper]]\n* [[Horse care]], taking care of a horse\n* [[Norman Thelwell]], the late British artist known for his cartoons of ponies and their riders\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Budiansky, Stephen.

Some breeds, such as the [[Hackney pony]], are primarily used for [[driving (horse)|driving]], while other breeds, such as the [[Connemara pony]] and [[Australian Pony]], are used primarily for [[equestrianism|riding]]. Others, such as the [[Welsh pony]], are used for both riding and driving.\n\n[[File:Shetland Pony in Harness and Cart.gif|thumb|A [[Shetland pony]] shown in [[Driving (horse)|harness]]]]\nThere is no direct correlation between a horse's size and its inherent athletic ability.<ref>Barakat, Christine. \"Why Size Matters.\"  ''Equus,'' October 2007, Issue 361, pp. 36-42</ref>  Ponies compete at events that include [[show hunter]], [[English riding]] on the flat, [[driving (horse)|driving]], and [[western riding]] classes at [[horse show]]s, as well as other competitive events such as [[Gymkhana (Equestrian)|gymkhana]] and [[combined driving]]. They are seen in casual pursuits such as [[trail riding]], but a few ponies have performed in international-level competition.  Though many exhibitors confine themselves to classes just for ponies, some top ponies are competitive against full-sized horses. For example, a {{convert|14.1|hand|in cm|adj=on}} pony named [[Stroller (horse)|Stroller]] was a member of the British Equestrian [[show jumping]] team, and won the silver medal at the [[1968 Summer Olympics]]. More recently, the {{convert|14.1+3/4|hand|in cm|adj=on|lk=off}} pony [[Theodore O'Connor]] won the gold medal in [[eventing]] at the 2007 [[Pan American Games]].\n\n[[Pony Club]]s, open to young people who own either horses or ponies, are formed worldwide to educate young people about horses, promote responsible horse ownership, and also sponsor competitive events for young people and smaller horses.\n\nIn many parts of the world ponies are also still used as [[working animal]]s, as [[packhorse|pack animals]] and for pulling various [[horse-drawn vehicle]]s. They are used for children's pony rides at [[traveling carnival]]s and at children's private parties where small children can take short rides on ponies that are saddled and then either led individually or hitched to a \"pony wheel\" (a non-motorized device akin to a [[hot walker]]) that leads six to eight ponies at a time. Ponies are sometimes seen at summer camps for children, and are widely used for [[pony trekking]] and other forms of [[Equitourism]] riding holidays, often carrying adults as well as children.\nPonies are used for riding Kedarnath pilgrims in India.\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Main|List of horse breeds}}\n[[File:Shetlands in Belgium.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Shetland pony]] is one of the smallest pony breeds, but is very strong.]]\nPonies are often distinguished by their [[phenotype]], a stocky body, dense bone, round shape and well-sprung ribs. They have a short head, large eyes and small ears. In addition to being smaller than a horse, their legs are proportionately shorter. They have strong [[horse hoof|hooves]] and grow a heavier [[coat (animal)|hair coat]], seen in a thicker mane and tail as well as a particularly heavy winter coat.<ref name=Strickland/>\n\nPony [[list of horse breeds|breeds]] have developed all over the world, particularly in cold and harsh climates where hardy, sturdy [[working animal]]s were needed. They are remarkably strong for their size. Breeds such as the [[Connemara pony]], are recognized for their ability to carry a full-sized adult rider. Pound for pound ponies can pull and carry more weight than a horse.<ref name=Strickland/> Draft-type ponies are able to pull loads significantly greater than their own weight, with larger ponies capable of pulling loads comparable to those pulled by full-sized [[draft horse]]s, and even very small ponies are able to pull as much as 450 percent of their own weight.<ref>[http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2010/07/27/boone-county-fair-pony-pull/ McNeill, Erin. \"Ponies at Boone County Fair pull their weight and then some\" Missourian, July 27, 2010] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130119224039/http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2010/07/27/boone-county-fair-pony-pull/ |date=January 19, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nNearly all pony breeds are very hardy, [[easy keeper]]s that share the ability to thrive on a more limited diet than that of a regular-sized horse, requiring half the [[hay]] for their weight as a horse, and often not needing grain at all. However, for the same reason, they are also more vulnerable to [[laminitis]] and [[Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction|Cushing's syndrome]].  They may also have problems with [[hyperlipemia]].<ref name=Strickland/>\n\nPonies are generally considered intelligent and friendly, though sometimes they also are described as stubborn or cunning.<ref name=Strickland>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/12649/pony-power|title=Pony Power!|publisher=}}</ref> The differences of opinion often result from an individual pony's degree of proper training. Ponies [[horse training|trained]] by inexperienced individuals, or only ridden by beginners, can turn out to be spoiled because their riders typically lack the experience base to correct bad habits. Properly trained ponies are appropriate mounts for children who are learning to ride.  Larger ponies can be ridden by adults, as ponies are usually strong for their size.<ref name=Strickland/>\n\n[[File:Connemara mare.jpg|thumb|The [[Connemara pony]] is a larger pony which occasionally matures over {{hands|14.2}}.]]\nFor showing purposes, ponies are often grouped into small, medium, and large sizes. Small ponies are {{hands|12.2}} and under, medium ponies are over 12.2 but no taller than {{hands|13.2|lk=off}}, and large ponies are over {{hands|13.2|lk=off}} but no taller than {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}.\n\nThe smallest equines are called [[miniature horse]]s by many of their breeders and breed organizations, rather than ponies, even though they stand smaller than small ponies,<ref name=Strickland/> usually no taller than {{convert|38|in|cm hand}} at the withers.  However, there are also [[miniature pony]] breeds.\n\n==Breeds and types that are not ponies==\n[[File:Polo2.JPG|thumb|left|The full-sized horses used for [[polo]] are called \"polo ponies,\" even though they are taller than ponies.]]\nSome [[list of horse breeds|horse breeds]] are not defined as ponies, even when they have some animals that measure under {{hands|14.2}}. This is usually due to body build, traditional uses and overall physiology. Breeds that are considered horses regardless of height include the [[Arabian horse]], [[American Quarter Horse]] and the [[Morgan horse]], all of which have individual members both over and under {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}.\n\n[[File:Gammur.jpg|thumb|The Icelandic horse is considered a horse, not a pony, by those who own and breed them.]]\nOther horse breeds, such as [[Icelandic horse]] and [[Fjord horse]], may sometimes be pony-sized or have some pony characteristics, such as a heavy coat, thick mane, and heavy bone, but are generally classified as \"horses\" by their respective registries.<ref name=Strickland/> In cases such as these, there can be considerable debate over whether to call certain breeds \"horses\" or \"ponies.\"  However, individual [[breed registry|breed registries]] usually are the arbiters of such debates, weighing the relative horse and pony characteristics of a breed. In some breeds, such as the [[Welsh pony]], the horse-versus-pony controversy is resolved by creating separate divisions for consistently horse-sized animals, such as the [[Welsh pony|\"Section D\" Welsh Cob]].\n\nSome horses may be pony height due to environment more than [[genetics]]. For example, the [[Chincoteague pony]], a [[feral horse]] that lives on [[Assateague Island]] off the coast of [[Virginia]], often matures to the height of an average small horse when raised from a [[foal]] under [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] conditions.<ref>[http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-assateague-island-national-seashore-horseback-riding-maryland-sidwcmdev_068312.html Assateague National Seashore - Wild Horses ]</ref>\n[[File:Feralpony.jpg|thumb|There is debate over whether the feral Chincoteague ponies of Assateague Island are horses or ponies]]\n\nConversely, the term \"pony\" is occasionally used to describe horses of normal height. Horses used for [[polo]] are often called \"[[polo pony|polo ponies]]\" regardless of height, even though they are often of [[Thoroughbred]] breeding and often well over {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}. [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes also have the tradition of referring to their horses as \"ponies,\" when speaking in English, even though many of the [[Mustang (horse)|Mustang horses]] they used in the 19th century were close to or over {{hands|14.2|lk=off}}, and most horses owned and bred by Native peoples today are of full horse height. The term \"pony\" is also sometimes used to describe a full-sized horse in a humorous or affectionate sense.\n\nThe [[United States Pony Club]] defines \"pony\" to be any mount that is ridden by a member regardless of its breed or size. Persons up to 25 years old are eligible for membership, and some of the members' \"ponies\" actually are full-size horses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Ponies}}\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [[Pony Express]], back in the old days when people would deliver mail on horses\n* [[List of horse breeds]], includes pony breeds\n* [[Pony Club]]\n* [[Equine nutrition]], for information on special feeding needs of ponies\n* [[Easy keeper]]\n* [[Horse care]], taking care of a horse\n* [[Norman Thelwell]], the late British artist known for his cartoons of ponies and their riders\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Budiansky, Stephen.
