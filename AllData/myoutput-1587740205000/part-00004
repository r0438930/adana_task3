''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 7.</ref>\n\n===Spirituality===\nFrom early childhood, long before she undertook her public mission or even her monastic vows, Hildegard's spiritual awareness was grounded in what she called the umbra viventis lucis, the reflection of the living Light. Her letter to [[Guibert of Gembloux]], which she wrote at the age of seventy- seven, describes her experience of this light with admirable precision:\n\n\"From my early childhood, before my bones, nerves and veins were fully strengthened, I have always seen this vision in my soul, even to the present time when I am more than seventy years old. In this vision my soul, as God would have it, rises up high into the vault of heaven and into the changing sky and spreads itself out among different peoples, although they are far away from me in distant lands and places. And because I see them this way in my soul, I observe them in accord with the shifting of clouds and other created things. I do not hear them with my outward ears, nor do I perceive them by the thoughts of my own heart or by any combination of my five senses, but in my soul alone, while my outward eyes are open. So I have never fallen prey to ecstasy in the visions, but I see them wide awake, day and night. And I am constantly fettered by sickness, and often in the grip of pain so intense that it threatens to kill me, but God has sustained me until now. The light which I see thus is not spatial, but it is far, far brighter than a cloud which carries the sun. I can measure neither height, nor length, nor breadth in it; and I call it \"the reflection of the living Light.\" And as the sun, the moon, and the stars appear in water, so writings, sermons, virtues, and certain human actions take form for me and gleam.\"<ref>Newman, Barbara. \"Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation.\" ''Church History'' 54, no. 2 (1985): 163-75.</ref>\n\n===Monastic life===\nPerhaps because of Hildegard's visions, or as a method of political positioning (or both), Hildegard's parents offered her as an [[oblate]] to the [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] monastery at the [[Disibodenberg]], which had been recently reformed in the [[Palatinate Forest]]. The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' says she was professed with an older woman, [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count [[Stephen II, Count of Sponheim|Stephan II of Sponheim]], at the age of eight.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p. 139.</ref> However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 52\u201355, 69; and John Van Engen, \"Abbess: 'Mother and Teacher', in Barbara Newman, ed., ''Voice of the Living Light'' (California: University of California Press, 1998), pp. 30\u201351, at pp. 32\u201333.</ref> Their vows were received by Bishop [[Otto of Bamberg|Otto Bamberg]] on All Saints' Day, 1112. Some scholars speculate that Hildegard was placed in the care of Jutta at the age of eight, and the two women were then enclosed together six years later.<ref>Michael McGrade, \"Hildegard von Bingen\", in ''Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart: allgemeine Enzyklopaldie der Musik,'' 2nd edition, T.2, Vol. 8, ed. Ludwig Fischer (Kassel and New York: Bahrenreiter, 1994).</ref>\n\nIn any case, Hildegard and Jutta were enclosed together at the [[Disibodenberg]], and formed the core of a growing community of women attached to the male monastery. Jutta was also a visionary and thus attracted many followers who came to visit her at the cloister. Hildegard tells us that Jutta taught her to read and write, but that she was unlearned and therefore incapable of teaching Hildegard sound biblical interpretation.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 6.</ref> The written record of the ''Life of Jutta'' indicates that Hildegard probably assisted her in reciting the psalms, working in the garden and other handiwork, and tending to the sick.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), pp. 70\u201373; Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), p. 8.</ref> This might have been a time when Hildegard learned how to play the ten-stringed [[psaltery]]. [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]], a frequent visitor, may have taught Hildegard simple psalm notation. The time she studied music could have been the beginning of the compositions she would later create.<ref>Reed-Jones, Carol. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Women of Vision'' (Washington: Paper Crane Press, 2004), p. 6.</ref>\n\nUpon Jutta's death in 1136, Hildegard was unanimously elected as ''magistra'' of the community by her fellow nuns.<ref>Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 84.</ref> Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be [[Prioress]], which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence for herself and her nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to [[Rupertsberg]].<ref>Furlong, Monica. ''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 85.</ref> This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to a new location in Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.<ref>McGrade, \"Hildegard\", ''MGG''.</ref> Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at [[Eibingen Abbey|Eibingen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wam.rutgers.edu/profiles/hildegard-of-bingen-an-interview-with-dr-margot-fassler/|title=Women in art and music|website=rutgers.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\nBefore Hildegard's death, a problem arose with the clergy of Mainz. A man buried in Rupertsburg had died after excommunication from the Church. Therefore, the clergy wanted to remove his body from the sacred ground. Hildegard did not accept this idea, replying that it was a sin and that the man had been reconciled to the church at the time of his death.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina.

''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), p. 77.</ref> She used the term 'visio' (the Latin for \"vision\") to describe this feature of her experience and recognized that it was a gift that she could not explain to others. Hildegard explained that she saw all things in the light of God through the five senses: sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch.<ref>Schipperges, Heinrich. ''Hildegard of Bingen: Healing and the Nature of the Cosmos'' (New Jersey: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1997), p. 10.</ref> Hildegard was hesitant to share her visions, confiding only to [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], who in turn told Volmar, Hildegard's tutor and, later, secretary.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. ''Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age'' (New York: Doubleday, 2001), p. 55.</ref> Throughout her life, she continued to have many visions, and in 1141, at the age of 42, Hildegard received a vision she believed to be an instruction from God, to \"write down that which you see and hear.\"<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. ''Visionary Women'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), p. 8.</ref> Still hesitant to record her visions, Hildegard became physically ill. The illustrations recorded in the book of Scivias were visions that Hildegard experienced, causing her great suffering and tribulations.<ref>Underhill, Evelyn. ''Mystics of the Church'' (Pennsylvania: Morehouse Publishing, 1925), pp. 78\u201379.</ref> In her first theological text, ''[[Scivias]]'' (\"Know the Ways\"), Hildegard describes her struggle within:\n\n<blockquote>But I, though I saw and heard these things, refused to write for a long time through doubt and bad opinion and the diversity of human words, not with stubbornness but in the exercise of humility, until, laid low by the scourge of God, I fell upon a bed of sickness; then, compelled at last by many illnesses, and by the witness of a certain noble maiden of good conduct [the nun Richardis von Stade] and of that man whom I had secretly sought and found, as mentioned above, I set my hand to the writing. While I was doing it, I sensed, as I mentioned before, the deep profundity of scriptural exposition; and, raising myself from illness by the strength I received, I brought this work to a close \u2013 though just barely \u2013 in ten years. (...) And I spoke and wrote these things not by the invention of my heart or that of any other person, but as by the secret mysteries of God I heard and received them in the heavenly places. And again I heard a voice from Heaven saying to me, 'Cry out, therefore, and write thus!'<ref>Hildegard von Bingen, ''Scivias'', trans. by Columba Hart and Jane Bishop with an Introduction by Barbara J. Newman, and Preface by Caroline Walker Bynum (New York: Paulist Press, 1990), pp. 60\u201361.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was between November 1147 and February 1148 at the synod in Trier that [[Pope Eugene III|Pope Eugenius]] heard about Hildegard's writings. It was from this that she received Papal approval to document her visions as revelations from the Holy Spirit, giving her instant credence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Oliveira, Plinio Correa de. \"St. Hildegard Von Bingen, 17 September\".

In total, 26 visionary experiences were captured in this compilation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n''[[Scivias]]'' is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an \"egg\"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the [[Trinity]], the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]], the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the [[Eucharist]], and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues.

The commission found that the visions were authentic and returned to the Pope, with a portion of the ''Scivias''.

She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, ''Ordo Virtutum'', and the \"Book of the Rewards of Life\" takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches. Standing in our defence, however, are the sober voices of the Virtues, powerfully confronting every vicious deception.<ref>Hildegard of Bingen. ''The Book of the Rewards of Life''. Trans. Bruce W.

Lucca, MS 1942, early 13th-century copy.]]\nHildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received \"an extraordinary mystical vision\" in which was revealed the \"sprinkling drops of sweet rain\" that [[John the Evangelist]] experienced when he wrote, \"In the beginning was the Word...\" (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the \"Work of God\", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The ''Book of Divine Works'', therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.<ref>\"The Life of Hildegard\", II.16, in ''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 179; Dronke, Peter. ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 162\u201363.</ref>\n\nThe ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (''Caritas'') or Wisdom (''Sapientia''). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God's dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's commentary on the Prologue to John's Gospel (John 1:1\u201314), a direct rumination on the meaning of \"In the beginning was the Word...\" The single vision that constitutes the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1\u20132:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the Church's history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul's growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of ''Scivias'' to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard's longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the Church from her own days of \"womanish weakness\" through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.<ref>St. Hildegard of Bingen, [https://www.hfsbooks.com/catalog/title/?isbn=978-0813231297 ''The Book of Divine Works''], trans.

In addition to the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]],'' sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost.<ref>Hildegard of Bingen. ''Symphonia'', ed. Barbara Newman (2nd Ed.; Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988, 1998).</ref> This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers.\n\n{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nOne of her better-known works, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (''Play of the Virtues''), is a [[morality play]]. It is uncertain when some of Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the ''Ordo Virtutum'' is thought to have been composed as early as 1151.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098\u20131179: A Visionary Life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 102.</ref> It is an independent Latin morality play with music (82 songs); it does not supplement or pay homage to the Mass or the Office of a certain feast. The most significant part of this entire composition is, however, that the ''Ordo virtutum'' is the earliest known surviving musical drama that is not attached to a liturgy.<ref name=\"Burkholder, J. Peter 2006\"/>\n\nThis entertainment was both performed and bemused by a select community of noblewomen and nuns. Even more fascinating about this piece, the devil has no music whatsoever in the plot of the play, he instead shouts and bellows all his lines. All other characters sing in monophonic plainchant. This includes Patriarchs, Prophets, A Happy Soul, A Unhappy Soul and A Penitent Soul along with 16 female Virtues (including Mercy, Innocence, Chasity, Obedience, Hope, and Faith).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe ''Ordo virtutum'' was probably performed as a manifestation of the theology Hildegard delineated in the ''Scivias''. The play serves as a group enchantment of the Christian story of sin, confession, repentance, and forgiveness. Notably, it is the female Virtues who restore the fallen to the community of the faithful, not the male Patriarchs or Prophets. This would have been a significant message to the nuns in Hildegard's convent. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima (the human souls) and the Virtues.<ref>Audrey Ekdahl Davidson. \"Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen's Ordo Virtutum.\" ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Western Michigan University, 1992), pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the ''Ordo Virtutum'', Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum''. The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona.

Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority.

The first, ''Physica,'' contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. This document is also thought to contain the first recorded reference of the usage of hops in beer as a preservative.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kitsock |first1=Greg |title=Hops: The beer ingredient (most) drinkers love |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/hops-the-beer-ingredient-most-drinkers-love/2014/02/10/fd5daab0-8f57-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html |website=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Garrett |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |date=9 September 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=435}}</ref> The second, ''Causae et Curae'', is an exploration of the people's bodies living or dead, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases.<ref name=\"medical\">Hildegard von Bingen, ''Causae et Curae (Holistic Healing)'', trans. by Manfred Pawlik and Patrick Madigan, ed. by Mary Palmquist and John Kulas (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, Inc., 1994); Hildegard von Bingen, ''Physica'', trans. Priscilla Throop (Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press, 1998).</ref> Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts.<ref name=Sweet/> Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by [[M\u00e9lanie Lipinska]], a Polish scientist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Old Time Makers of Medicine|last=Walsh|first=James|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1911|location=New York|pages=194\u2013201}}.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its wealth of practical evidence, ''Causae et Curae'' is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach.<ref name=Glaze/> Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the \"green\" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. ''Viriditas'', or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.<ref name=\"Sweet\" /> Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nThus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of ''Causae et Curae'' \"explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology.\"<ref name=Glaze/> In this section, she gives specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when the moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ or body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like \"the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp\"). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool.<ref name=Sweet/> Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy.<ref name=Glaze/> For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception).<ref name=Sweet/> Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.<ref name=encyclopedia>\"Hildegard of Bingen.\" Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004.</ref>\n\nAs Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: \"the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds.\"<ref name=Glaze/> Although she inherited the basic framework of [[humorism|humoral theory]] from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to \"superior\" and \"inferior\" elements\u2014blood and phlegm corresponding to the \"celestial\" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the \"terrestrial\" elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind.<ref name=Glaze/> As she writes in ''Causae et Curae'' c. 42:\n\n<blockquote>It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the ''flegmata'' within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [''livor'']. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the ''flegmata'' arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses.<ref>Quoted in Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'\" p. 136.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== ''Lingua ignota'' and ''Litterae ignotae'' ===\n[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|Alphabet by Hildegard von Bingen, Litterae ignotae, which she used for her language [[Lingua Ignota]]]]\n\nHildegard also invented an [[constructed script|alternative alphabet]].

Mumford, \"A Feminist Prolegomenon for the Study of Hildegard of Bingen,\" in ''Gender, Culture, and the Arts: Women, Culture, and Society'', eds. R. Dotterer and S. Bowers (Selinsgrove: Susquehanna University Press, 1993), pp. 44\u201353.</ref> They note her reference to herself as a member of the weaker sex and her rather constant belittling of women. Hildegard frequently referred to herself as an unlearned woman, completely incapable of Biblical exegesis.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford. Visionary Women (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice.<ref>Barbara Newman, \"Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation,\" ''Church History'' 54 (1985): pp. 163\u201375; Barbara Newman, ''Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard's Theology of the Feminine'', (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987).</ref> Hildegard used her voice to amplify the Church's condemnation of institutional corruption, in particular [[simony]].\n\nHildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary [[New Age movement]], mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic. Though her medical writings were long neglected, and then studied without reference to their context,<ref name=Sweet4>Sweet, V. (1999). \"Hildegard of Bingen and the greening of medieval medicine.\" ''Bulletin of the history of Medicine'', 73(3), p. 386.</ref> she was the inspiration for Dr. Gottfried Hertzka's \"Hildegard-Medicine\", and is the namesake for June Boyce-Tillman's Hildegard Network, a healing center that focuses on a holistic approach to wellness and brings together people interested in exploring the links between spirituality, the arts, and healing.<ref>June Boyce-Tillman, \"Hildegard of Bingen at 900: The Eye of a Woman,\" ''The Musical Times'' 139, no. 1865 (Winter, 1998): p. 35.</ref> Her reputation as a medicinal writer and healer was also used by early feminists to argue for women's rights to attend medical schools.<ref name=Sweet4/> Hildegard's reincarnation has been debated since 1924 when Austrian mystic [[Rudolf Steiner]] lectured that a nun of her description was the past life of Russian poet-philosopher [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Soloviev]],<ref>Steiner, Rudolf.

Her letter to [[Guibert of Gembloux]], which she wrote at the age of seventy- seven, describes her experience of this light with admirable precision:\n\n\"From my early childhood, before my bones, nerves and veins were fully strengthened, I have always seen this vision in my soul, even to the present time when I am more than seventy years old. In this vision my soul, as God would have it, rises up high into the vault of heaven and into the changing sky and spreads itself out among different peoples, although they are far away from me in distant lands and places. And because I see them this way in my soul, I observe them in accord with the shifting of clouds and other created things. I do not hear them with my outward ears, nor do I perceive them by the thoughts of my own heart or by any combination of my five senses, but in my soul alone, while my outward eyes are open. So I have never fallen prey to ecstasy in the visions, but I see them wide awake, day and night. And I am constantly fettered by sickness, and often in the grip of pain so intense that it threatens to kill me, but God has sustained me until now. The light which I see thus is not spatial, but it is far, far brighter than a cloud which carries the sun.

The date of Hildegard's enclosure at the monastery is the subject of debate. Her ''[[Hagiography|Vita]]'' says she was professed with an older woman, [[Jutta von Sponheim|Jutta]], the daughter of Count [[Stephen II, Count of Sponheim|Stephan II of Sponheim]], at the age of eight.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), p. 139.</ref> However, Jutta's date of enclosure is known to have been in 1112, when Hildegard would have been fourteen.<ref>''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans.

''Visions and Longings: Medieval Women Mystics'' (Massachusetts: Shambhala Publications, 1996), p. 85.</ref> This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of [[Archbishop Henry I of Mainz]]. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to a new location in Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot himself could not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery.<ref>McGrade, \"Hildegard\", ''MGG''.</ref> Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where [[Volmar (monk)|Volmar]] served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe.

''Scivias'' is a contraction of ''Sci vias Domini'' (''Know the Ways of the Lord''), and it was Hildegard's first major visionary work, and one of the biggest milestones in her life.

In total, 26 visionary experiences were captured in this compilation.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n''[[Scivias]]'' is structured into three parts of unequal length. The first part (six visions) chronicles the order of God's creation: the Creation and Fall of Adam and Eve, the structure of the universe (famously described as the shape of an \"egg\"), the relationship between body and soul, God's relationship to his people through the Synagogue, and the choirs of angels. The second part (seven visions) describes the order of redemption: the coming of Christ the Redeemer, the [[Trinity]], the Church as the Bride of Christ and the Mother of the Faithful in [[baptism]] and [[confirmation]], the orders of the Church, Christ's sacrifice on the Cross and the [[Eucharist]], and the fight against the devil. Finally, the third part (thirteen visions) recapitulates the history of salvation told in the first two parts, symbolized as a building adorned with various allegorical figures and virtues. It concludes with the Symphony of Heaven, an early version of Hildegard's musical compositions.<ref>SCIVIAS.</ref>\n\nIn early 1148, a commission was sent by the Pope to Disibodenberg to find out more about Hildegard and her writings. The commission found that the visions were authentic and returned to the Pope, with a portion of the ''Scivias''.

She had already explored this area in her musical morality play, ''Ordo Virtutum'', and the \"Book of the Rewards of Life\" takes up that play's characteristic themes. Each vice, although ultimately depicted as ugly and grotesque, nevertheless offers alluring, seductive speeches that attempt to entice the unwary soul into their clutches.

Lucca, MS 1942, early 13th-century copy.]]\nHildegard's last and grandest visionary work had its genesis in one of the few times she experienced something like an ecstatic loss of consciousness. As she described it in an autobiographical passage included in her Vita, sometime in about 1163, she received \"an extraordinary mystical vision\" in which was revealed the \"sprinkling drops of sweet rain\" that [[John the Evangelist]] experienced when he wrote, \"In the beginning was the Word...\" (John 1:1). Hildegard perceived that this Word was the key to the \"Work of God\", of which humankind is the pinnacle. The ''Book of Divine Works'', therefore, became in many ways an extended explication of the Prologue to John's Gospel.<ref>\"The Life of Hildegard\", II.16, in ''Jutta & Hildegard: The Biographical Sources'', trans. Anna Silvas (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1999), 179; Dronke, Peter. ''Women Writers of the Middle Ages'' (Cambridge University Press, 1984), pp. 162\u201363.</ref>\n\nThe ten visions of this work's three parts are cosmic in scale, to illustrate various ways of understanding the relationship between God and his creation. Often, that relationship is established by grand allegorical female figures representing Divine Love (''Caritas'') or Wisdom (''Sapientia''). The first vision opens the work with a salvo of poetic and visionary images, swirling about to characterize God's dynamic activity within the scope of his work within the history of salvation. The remaining three visions of the first part introduce the famous image of a human being standing astride the spheres that make up the universe and detail the intricate relationships between the human as microcosm and the universe as macrocosm. This culminates in the final chapter of Part One, Vision Four with Hildegard's commentary on the Prologue to John's Gospel (John 1:1\u201314), a direct rumination on the meaning of \"In the beginning was the Word...\" The single vision that constitutes the whole of Part Two stretches that rumination back to the opening of Genesis, and forms an extended commentary on the seven days of the creation of the world told in Genesis 1\u20132:3. This commentary interprets each day of creation in three ways: literal or cosmological; allegorical or ecclesiological (i.e. related to the Church's history); and moral or tropological (i.e. related to the soul's growth in virtue). Finally, the five visions of the third part take up again the building imagery of ''Scivias'' to describe the course of salvation history. The final vision (3.5) contains Hildegard's longest and most detailed prophetic program of the life of the Church from her own days of \"womanish weakness\" through to the coming and ultimate downfall of the Antichrist.<ref>St. Hildegard of Bingen, [https://www.hfsbooks.com/catalog/title/?isbn=978-0813231297 ''The Book of Divine Works''], trans.

In addition to the ''[[Ordo Virtutum]],'' sixty-nine musical compositions, each with its own original poetic text, survive, and at least four other texts are known, though their musical notation has been lost.<ref>Hildegard of Bingen. ''Symphonia'', ed. Barbara Newman (2nd Ed.; Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1988, 1998).</ref> This is one of the largest repertoires among medieval composers.\n\n{{Listen|filename=O frondens 2.ogg|title=''O frondens virga''|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nOne of her better-known works, ''Ordo Virtutum'' (''Play of the Virtues''), is a [[morality play]]. It is uncertain when some of Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the ''Ordo Virtutum'' is thought to have been composed as early as 1151.<ref>Flanagan, Sabina. ''Hildegard of Bingen, 1098\u20131179: A Visionary Life'' (London: Routledge, 1989), p. 102.</ref> It is an independent Latin morality play with music (82 songs); it does not supplement or pay homage to the Mass or the Office of a certain feast. The most significant part of this entire composition is, however, that the ''Ordo virtutum'' is the earliest known surviving musical drama that is not attached to a liturgy.<ref name=\"Burkholder, J. Peter 2006\"/>\n\nThis entertainment was both performed and bemused by a select community of noblewomen and nuns. Even more fascinating about this piece, the devil has no music whatsoever in the plot of the play, he instead shouts and bellows all his lines. All other characters sing in monophonic plainchant. This includes Patriarchs, Prophets, A Happy Soul, A Unhappy Soul and A Penitent Soul along with 16 female Virtues (including Mercy, Innocence, Chasity, Obedience, Hope, and Faith).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe ''Ordo virtutum'' was probably performed as a manifestation of the theology Hildegard delineated in the ''Scivias''. The play serves as a group enchantment of the Christian story of sin, confession, repentance, and forgiveness. Notably, it is the female Virtues who restore the fallen to the community of the faithful, not the male Patriarchs or Prophets. This would have been a significant message to the nuns in Hildegard's convent. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima (the human souls) and the Virtues.<ref>Audrey Ekdahl Davidson. \"Music and Performance: Hildegard of Bingen's Ordo Virtutum.\" ''The Ordo Virtutum of Hildegard of Bingen: Critical Studies'', (Kalamazoo, MI: Western Michigan University, 1992), pp. 1\u201329.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the ''Ordo Virtutum'', Hildegard composed many liturgical songs that were collected into a cycle called the ''Symphonia armoniae celestium revelationum''. The songs from the Symphonia are set to Hildegard's own text and range from antiphons, hymns, and sequences, to responsories.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona.

Neither claim to be rooted in her visionary experience and its divine authority. Rather, they spring from her experience helping in and then leading the monastery's herbal garden and infirmary, as well as the theoretical information she likely gained through her wide-ranging reading in the monastery's library.<ref name=Glaze>Florence Eliza Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'\" in ''Voice of the Living Light: Hildegard of Bingen and Her World'', ed.

''Hildegard's Healing Plants: From Her Medieval Classic Physica'' (Massachusetts: Beacon Press, 2001), pp. xi\u2013xii</ref> In addition to her hands-on experience, she also gained medical knowledge, including elements of her humoral theory, from traditional Latin texts.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nHildegard catalogued both her theory and practice in two works. The first, ''Physica,'' contains nine books that describe the scientific and medicinal properties of various plants, stones, fish, reptiles, and animals. This document is also thought to contain the first recorded reference of the usage of hops in beer as a preservative.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kitsock |first1=Greg |title=Hops: The beer ingredient (most) drinkers love |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/hops-the-beer-ingredient-most-drinkers-love/2014/02/10/fd5daab0-8f57-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html |website=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Oliver |first1=Garrett |title=The Oxford Companion to Beer |date=9 September 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=435}}</ref> The second, ''Causae et Curae'', is an exploration of the human body, its connections to the rest of the natural world, and the causes and cures of various diseases.<ref name=\"medical\">Hildegard von Bingen, ''Causae et Curae (Holistic Healing)'', trans. by Manfred Pawlik and Patrick Madigan, ed. by Mary Palmquist and John Kulas (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, Inc., 1994); Hildegard von Bingen, ''Physica'', trans. Priscilla Throop (Rochester, Vermont: Healing Arts Press, 1998).</ref> Hildegard documented various medical practices in these books, including the use of bleeding and home remedies for many common ailments. She also explains remedies for common agricultural injuries such as burns, fractures, dislocations, and cuts.<ref name=Sweet/> Hildegard may have used the books to teach assistants at the monastery. These books are historically significant because they show areas of medieval medicine that were not well documented because their practitioners (mainly women) rarely wrote in Latin. Her writings were commentated on by [[M\u00e9lanie Lipinska]], a Polish scientist.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Old Time Makers of Medicine|last=Walsh|first=James|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1911|location=New York|pages=194\u2013201}}.</ref>\n\nIn addition to its wealth of practical evidence, ''Causae et Curae'' is also noteworthy for its organizational scheme. Its first part sets the work within the context of the creation of the cosmos and then humanity as its summit, and the constant interplay of the human person as microcosm both physically and spiritually with the macrocosm of the universe informs all of Hildegard's approach.<ref name=Glaze/> Her hallmark is to emphasize the vital connection between the \"green\" health of the natural world and the holistic health of the human person. ''Viriditas'', or greening power, was thought to sustain human beings and could be manipulated by adjusting the balance of elements within a person.<ref name=\"Sweet\" /> Thus, when she approached medicine as a type of gardening, it was not just as an analogy. Rather, Hildegard understood the plants and elements of the garden as direct counterparts to the humors and elements within the human body, whose imbalance led to illness and disease.<ref name=Sweet/>\n\nThus, the nearly three hundred chapters of the second book of ''Causae et Curae'' \"explore the etiology, or causes, of disease as well as human sexuality, psychology, and physiology.\"<ref name=Glaze/> In this section, she gives specific instructions for bleeding based on various factors, including gender, the phase of the moon (bleeding is best done when the moon is waning), the place of disease (use veins near diseased organ or body part) or prevention (big veins in arms), and how much blood to take (described in imprecise measurements, like \"the amount that a thirsty person can swallow in one gulp\"). She even includes bleeding instructions for animals to keep them healthy. In the third and fourth sections, Hildegard describes treatments for malignant and minor problems and diseases according to the humoral theory, again including information on animal health. The fifth section is about diagnosis and prognosis, which includes instructions to check the patient's blood, pulse, urine and stool.<ref name=Sweet/> Finally, the sixth section documents a lunar horoscope to provide an additional means of prognosis for both disease and other medical conditions, such as conception and the outcome of pregnancy.<ref name=Glaze/> For example, she indicates that a waxing moon is good for human conception and is also good for sowing seeds for plants (sowing seeds is the plant equivalent of conception).<ref name=Sweet/> Elsewhere, Hildegard is even said to have stressed the value of boiling drinking water in an attempt to prevent infection.<ref name=encyclopedia>\"Hildegard of Bingen.\" Encyclopedia of World Biography. 2004.</ref>\n\nAs Hildegard elaborates the medical and scientific relationship between the human microcosm and the macrocosm of the universe, she often focuses on interrelated patterns of four: \"the four elements (fire, air, water, and earth), the four seasons, the four humors, the four zones of the earth, and the four major winds.\"<ref name=Glaze/> Although she inherited the basic framework of [[humorism|humoral theory]] from ancient medicine, Hildegard's conception of the hierarchical inter-balance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) was unique, based on their correspondence to \"superior\" and \"inferior\" elements\u2014blood and phlegm corresponding to the \"celestial\" elements of fire and air, and the two biles corresponding to the \"terrestrial\" elements of water and earth. Hildegard understood the disease-causing imbalance of these humors to result from the improper dominance of the subordinate humors. This disharmony reflects that introduced by Adam and Eve in the Fall, which for Hildegard marked the indelible entrance of disease and humoral imbalance into humankind.<ref name=Glaze/> As she writes in ''Causae et Curae'' c. 42:\n\n<blockquote>It happens that certain men suffer diverse illnesses. This comes from the phlegm which is superabundant within them. For if man had remained in paradise, he would not have had the ''flegmata'' within his body, from which many evils proceed, but his flesh would have been whole and without dark humor [''livor'']. However, because he consented to evil and relinquished good, he was made into a likeness of the earth, which produces good and useful herbs, as well as bad and useless ones, and which has in itself both good and evil moistures. From tasting evil, the blood of the sons of Adam was turned into the poison of semen, out of which the sons of man are begotten. And therefore their flesh is ulcerated and permeable [to disease]. These sores and openings create a certain storm and smoky moisture in men, from which the ''flegmata'' arise and coagulate, which then introduce diverse infirmities to the human body. All this arose from the first evil, which man began at the start, because if Adam had remained in paradise, he would have had the sweetest health, and the best dwelling-place, just as the strongest balsam emits the best odor; but on the contrary, man now has within himself poison and phlegm and diverse illnesses.<ref>Quoted in Glaze, \"Medical Writer: 'Behold the Human Creature,'\" p. 136.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== ''Lingua ignota'' and ''Litterae ignotae'' ===\n[[File:Litterae ignotae.png|thumb|right|Alphabet by Hildegard von Bingen, Litterae ignotae, which she used for her language [[Lingua Ignota]]]]\n\nHildegard also invented an [[constructed script|alternative alphabet]]. ''Litterae ignotae'' (''Alternate Alphabet'') was another work and was more or less a secret code, or even an intellectual code \u2013 much like a modern crossword puzzle today.\n\nThe text of her writing and compositions reveals Hildegard's use of this form of modified medieval [[Latin]], encompassing many invented, conflated and abridged words.<ref name=\"Ruether, Rosemary Radford 2002\" /> Because of her inventions of words for her lyrics and use of a constructed script, many [[conlang]]ers look upon her as a medieval precursor.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GkuK53bU4_UC ''Hildegard of Bingen's Unknown Language: An Edition, Translation, and Discussion''], ed. Sarah Higley (2007)</ref>\n\nHildegard's ''Lingua ignota'' (''Unknown Language'') was a composition that comprised a series of invented words that corresponded to an eclectic list of nouns. Scholars believe that Hildegard used her ''[[Lingua Ignota]]'' to increase solidarity among her nuns.<ref>Barbara J. Newman, \"Introduction\" to Hildegard, ''Scivias'', p. 13.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\n===During her lifetime===\nMaddocks claims that it is likely Hildegard learned simple Latin and the tenets of the Christian faith but was not instructed in the Seven [[Liberal Arts]], which formed the basis of all education for the learned classes in the Middle Ages: the ''[[Trivium (education)|Trivium]]'' of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric plus the ''[[Quadrivium]]'' of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.<ref>Maddocks, Fiona. Hildegard of Bingen: The Woman of Her Age. New York: Doubleday, 2001. p. 40.</ref> The correspondence she kept with the outside world, both spiritual and social, transcended the cloister as a space of spiritual confinement and served to document Hildegard's grand style and strict formatting of medieval letter writing.<ref name=\"Dietrich, Julia 1997\"/><ref>For cloister as confinement see [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04060a.htm \"Female\" section of \"Cloister\"] in ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]''.</ref>\n\nContributing to Christian European rhetorical traditions, Hildegard \"authorized herself as a theologian\" through alternative rhetorical arts.<ref name=\"Dietrich, Julia 1997\">Dietrich, Julia. \"The Visionary Rhetoric of Hildegard of Bingen.\" ''Listening to their Voices: The Rhetorical Activities of Historic Women'', Molly Meijer Wertheimer, ed.

(Boston: Allyn Bacon, 2005), pp. ??.</ref> Hildegard's participation in these arts speaks to her significance as a female rhetorician, transcending bans on women's social participation and interpretation of scripture. The acceptance of public preaching by a woman, even a well-connected abbess and acknowledged prophet, does not fit the stereotype of this time. Her preaching was not limited to the monasteries; she preached publicly in 1160 in Germany. (New York: Routledge, 2001, 9). She conducted four preaching tours throughout Germany, speaking to both clergy and laity in chapter houses and in public, mainly denouncing clerical corruption and calling for reform.<ref>Ruether, Rosemary Radford.

Visionary Women (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fotress, 2002), pp. 10\u201311.</ref> Such a statement on her part, however, worked to her advantage because it made her statements that all of her writings and music came from visions of the Divine more believable, therefore giving Hildegard the authority to speak in a time and place where few women were permitted a voice.<ref>Barbara Newman, \"Hildegard of Bingen: Visions and Validation,\" ''Church History'' 54 (1985): pp. 163\u201375; Barbara Newman, ''Sister of Wisdom: St. Hildegard's Theology of the Feminine'', (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987).</ref> Hildegard used her voice to amplify the Church's condemnation of institutional corruption, in particular [[simony]].\n\nHildegard has also become a figure of reverence within the contemporary [[New Age movement]], mostly because of her holistic and natural view of healing, as well as her status as a mystic.
