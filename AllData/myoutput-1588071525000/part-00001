Sulham House can still be seen through the south arch of Wilder's Folly looking north, but Sulhamstead House is no longer visible from the top of the hill. Wilder and Thoyts were married on 13 June 1769, and had eleven children.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Visitation of England and Wales (Notes) | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vBvi6Gu6fboC&pg=PA109 | volume=4 | page=109 | year=1902 }}</ref>\n\nThe building featured an open ground-level [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]].
