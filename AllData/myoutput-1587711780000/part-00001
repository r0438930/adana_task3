The gallery is in Founder\u2019s and is open to the public every Wednesday during the autumn and spring terms and some weekends throughout the year.

Their collections have been enhanced with additional acquisitions and commissions.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} Following the death of Herringham part of her eclectic art collection, including paintings by her and other women artists as well as Indian miniatures and Japanese woodblock prints, was given to Bedford College by her husband.
