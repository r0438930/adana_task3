The album was released on May 14, 2002, by Roc-A-Fella Records, [[Diplomat Records]] and [[Def Jam Recordings]]. It served as an introduction of the Cam'ron-fronted rap group, [[The Diplomats]], to the general public. There are featured guest appearances from [[The Diplomats]], [[DJ Kay Slay]], [[Daz Dillinger]], Tiffany, [[Jay-Z]], McGruff, [[Memphis Bleek]], and [[Beanie Sigel]]. To date, it is his most commercially successful album, it peaked at number 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 226,000 copies and eventually sold over one million copies in the United States, being certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1423291/ludacris-lights-up-no-1-with-red-light |title=Ludacris Lights Up No. 1 With 'Red Light' |magazine=Billboard |date=2004-12-15 |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - May 24, 2014 |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=2014-05-24}}</ref>\n\nIts two singles were \"[[Oh Boy (Cam'ron song)|Oh Boy]]\" (featuring [[Juelz Santana]]) and \"[[Hey Ma (Cam'ron song)|Hey Ma]]\" (featuring Juelz Santana, [[Freekey Zekey]], and [[DJ Kay Slay]]). \"[[Oh Boy (Cam'ron song)|Oh Boy]]\" held the number one spot on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles for five straight weeks, the number one spot on the [[Hot Rap Tracks]] and peaked at number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The second hit was \"Hey Ma\", which reached number three on the Hot 100 and number eight on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming his biggest hit. \"Daydreaming\" was a later single released in 2003 but failed to duplicate the success from his earlier singles.\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Birchmeier |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/come-home-with-me-mw0000659823 |title=Come Home with Me -
