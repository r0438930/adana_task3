In the [[United States]], the make was Griffith and the model was Griffith Series 200, whilst the [[United Kingdom]] the make was [[TVR]] and the model was Griffith 200. \n\n==Origin==\nJack Griffith came up with the idea for the car in 1964, and secured rights to market the cars in the US. Griffith ran a car repair workshop in the US for patrons such as Gerry Sagerman and [[Mark Donohue]] who had both driven a [[TVR Grantura]] at [[Sebring International Raceway]] in 1962. The concept for the Griffith Series 200 originated during a dinner with [[Carroll Shelby]], where Griffith declared he could build a car that could outperform an [[AC Cobra]].\n\nGriffith first attempt was to put the [[Ford]] [[V8 engine]] from [[Mark Donohue]]'s AC Cobra into a [[TVR Grantura]]. While this did not work, the idea prompted further conversations. Griffith wanted TVR to supply him with modified [[TVR Grantura]] [[chassis]], without an [[engine]] or [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], and TVR complied with his request. \n\nIn an effort to get the engine and gearbox to fit, some chassis triangulation was removed compared to that of the Grantura Mk 3, and various parts of the chassis were simply [[hammer]]ed until the [[Powertrain|drivetrain]] fitted.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} The [[brake]]s were not upgraded either, although slightly wider 185 section [[tyre (wheel)|tyre]]s were added.\n\n==Production==\nThe Griffith Series 200 could either be fitted with a {{Convert|195|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} motor,{{Clarify|reason=|date=November 2018}} or a {{Convert|289|in3|l}} motor{{Clarify|reason=|date=November 2018}} that put out {{Convert|271|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.

Top speed was 163 mph (262 km/h). Bolster wrote that \"over 150 mph (242 km/h), things become somewhat fraught. One must either choose a still day or risk becoming one of Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines.\" The Griffith had the 271 hp engine with three twin-choke Holley carburetters.
