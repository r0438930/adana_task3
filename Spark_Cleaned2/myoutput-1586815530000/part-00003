He named various waterways in the district. The waiata {{lang|mi|\"Ka tat\u016b e hine ko Manawat\u016b\"}} describes how his heart ({{lang|mi|manawa}}) settled or momentarily stopped ({{lang|mi|tat\u016b}}) when he saw the Manawatu River.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Government ==\nThe region covers all or part of ten [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authority]] areas. Parts of five of these are covered by five other [[regions of New Zealand]], the most of any region. In descending order of land area the territorial authority districts are [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], the major parts of [[Tararua District]] and [[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]], [[Manawatu District|Manawat\u016b]], [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]], [[Horowhenua District|Horowhenua]], and small parts of [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]], [[Waitomo District|Waitomo]], and [[Taupo District|Taupo]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png|title=Map |website=upload.wikimedia.org}}</ref> The largest city is [[Palmerston North]], with a population of 85,300 (June 2012 estimate). It is the only territorial authority in the region to be administered by a city council.\n\nThe governing body of the regional council consists of 12 councillors from 6 constituencies across the region, elected by the public; from the north: Ruapehu (1 councillor), Whanganui (2), Manawatu-Rangitikei (2), Palmerston North (4), Horowhenua-Kairanga (2), Tararua District (1). It sits in Palmerston North. It has the responsibility for managing natural and physical resources, providing flood protection and monitoring environmental problems and fresh air, clean water, productive land and natural eco-systems. It is also responsible for public transport.\n\n==Geography==\nThe region is dominated and defined by two significant river catchments, the [[Whanganui River|Whanganui]] and the [[Manawatu River|Manawatu]]. The Whanganui River, in the northwest, is the longest navigable river in New Zealand. The river was extremely important to early [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] as it was the southern link in a chain of waterways that spanned almost two-thirds of the North Island. It was one of the chief areas of M\u0101ori settlement with its easily fortified cliffs and ample food supplies. Legends emphasise the importance of the river and it remains sacred to Whanganui [[iwi]]. M\u0101ori along the coast and lowland plains grew [[Sweet potato|kumara]] and other crops. The Manawatu River runs across the centre of the region, from rolling hill country in the east to the fertile [[Manawatu Plains]] in the west. The main city of [[Palmerston North]] is located on these plains, and is an important service city for the southern North Island as a whole. This river is unusual, in that it passes from hill country to plains through a gorge cut into much higher country, an indication that the hills have risen since the river formed.\n\nTo the southeast, a further, more sparsely populated area of the [[Tararua District]] lies between the sources of the [[Manawatu River]] near [[Norsewood]] and the Pacific coast. This area, often historically connected with both the [[Hawke's Bay region]] to the north and the [[Wairarapa]] to the south, was historically simply known as Bush, a name which still survives in some businesses and organisations, most notably the [[Wairarapa-Bush Rugby Football Union]].\n\nThe two river catchments have very different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], [[Rangitikei (district), New Zealand|Rangitikei]] and [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]] remained more M\u0101ori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained a river of mystery. Since then exploitation of the river's commercial potential has opened up the area, often causing friction with local M\u0101ori, who have long-standing grievances. Manawat\u016b-Whanganui as a whole is one of the most important pastoral areas in New Zealand, its status recognised when the government opened the [[Massey University|Massey Agricultural College]] in the 1920s.\n\nMuch of Manawatu-Wanganui was fertile and [[forest|bush]]-covered when Europeans arrived and developed the area as a source of [[timber]]. [[Saw mill]]ing and [[flax]] [[Mill (factory)|milling]] dominated the 19th century, followed by an influx of [[sheep]] farmers who exploited the newly cleared ground. [[Deforestation]], burn-offs of timber and scrub and large scale drainage combined with [[overgrazing]], resulted in considerable environmental degradation. In the early 1900s authorities realised that careful management was needed to maintain this important [[agriculture|agricultural]] area.\n\n===Topography===\nManawat\u016b-Whanganui takes up a large proportion of the lower half of the North Island. It is the second-largest local government region in the North Island and the sixth-largest in New Zealand, totalling 22,215&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (8.1% of New Zealand's land area). The region stretches from north of Taumarunui to south of Levin on the west coast, and across to the east coast from [[Cape Turnagain]] to Owhanga. It borders the [[Waikato]], [[Taranaki]], [[Hawke's Bay (region)|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Wellington (region)|Wellington]] regions and includes river catchment areas that run from the [[volcanic plateau]] to the sea. The [[Pacific Ocean]] is the eastern boundary and the [[Ruahine Ranges]] form a natural boundary with Hawke's Bay.\n\nThe area includes a variety of landscape formations. Districts close to the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Volcanic Plateau]] are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The [[Manawatu (district)|Manawatu District]] has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded [[Manawatu Plains]] that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of marine sediment, which is about five or six million years old. A [[block fault]]ing system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil and some of the Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatu River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatu River begins just inside the Hawke's Bay region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the [[Tasman Sea]]. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the [[Manawatu Gorge]]) is a [[water gap]] through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The [[Whanganui District]] is more rugged, with [[canyon]]-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.\n\nThe region includes a series of mountain ranges, notably the [[Tararua Range]] and the [[Ruahine Ranges|Ruahine Range]] and the three major active [[volcano]]es of the North Island. [[Mount Ruapehu]] at 2,797 m is the tallest mountain in the North Island, [[Mount Ngauruhoe|Ngauruhoe]] 2,291 m and [[Mount Tongariro|Tongariro]] 1,968 m. During the last 100 years Ruapehu has experienced six significant eruptions, and last erupted in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThree major rivers divide the region: the Whanganui (290&nbsp;km), Manawat\u016b (182&nbsp;km) and [[Rangitikei River|Rangitikei]] (241&nbsp;km). The Whanganui is the second-longest river and has the second-largest catchment in the North Island, draining most of the inland region west of [[Lake Taupo]]. There are few roads in this area, which contains some of the largest surviving areas of native bush in the North Island.\n\n===Soil and climate===\nSoils are productive with the addition of [[fertiliser]]. In the Manawat\u016b and [[Horowhenua]] Districts there are sandy soils and swampy hollows around the coast with [[loess]]-covered terraces and river flats inland. These river flats and swamp areas contain fertile [[alluvial]] and organic soils. On the drier terraces inland yellow-grey earths predominate. The flatter more fertile soils suit intensive sheep farming and cropping while the hill country of Rangitikei favours semi-intensive sheep and [[beef]] farming. Areas close to the volcanic plateau consist largely of [[pumice]] soils which lack some essential trace elements but within the region much of this land is occupied by national parks.\n\nThe region has a comparatively mild climate with greater climatic extremes inland. [[Chateau Tongariro]] experienced the lowest temperature recorded in the North Island, falling to -13.6&nbsp;\u00b0C on 7 July 1937. In summer the region is warm, with a maximum mid-summer daily average of between 20.1 and 22.9&nbsp;\u00b0C. Sunshine hours approximate the national average for much of the region (1,800-2,000 hours per annum) but Palmerston North is defined as cloudy with an average of 1,725 sunshine hours. In the winter the minimum mid-winter daily average for coastal areas is 4.0 to 7.9&nbsp;\u00b0C, while inland areas are considerably colder. [[Waiouru]] has a minimum mid-winter daily average of 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nRainfall on the plains is slightly below average, with Palmerston North receiving 960&nbsp;mm, while the rest of the region receives the New Zealand average rainfall of 1,000-2,000&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Conservation and parks===\nThe region contains areas of great ecological significance, reflected in the designation of approximately a seventh of its land area as part of the nation's conservation estate. [[Tongariro National Park]] is the largest park in the region (795.98&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and is the oldest national park in the country, established in 1887. The volcanoes Tongariro, Ruapehu and Ngauruhoe are sacred to M\u0101ori and were given to the nation by [[Te Heuheu Tukino IV]], paramount chief of [[Ngati Tuwharetoa]]. They form the nucleus of the park, which is designated a [[world heritage]] area.\n\n[[Whanganui National Park]] is slightly smaller (742.31&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and was established 99 years later when a series of reserves were incorporated into one area and given national park status. There are two state forest parks in the rugged, bush-clad Ruahine Range and Tararua Range. The four parks offer [[skiing]], [[tramping]], [[jetboat]]ing and white-water [[rafting]] and the opportunity to appreciate the environment.\n\nThe regional council, responsible for managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental problems such as pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as [[African feathergrass]], [[Galega officinalis|goats rue]] and nodding [[thistle]] pose a threat to pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. [[Common brushtail possum|Possums]] are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine [[tuberculosis]]. Eradication programmes also concentrate on [[rabbit]]s, [[Rook (bird)|rook]]s and feral [[goat]]s, while other exotic species such as [[Parma wallaby]] (''Macropus parma''),{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[wasp]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[stoat]]s and [[weasel]]s are a source of concern.\n\n===Biodiversity===\nThe internationally recognised [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] estuarine wetlands site at [[Foxton Beach]] is of note as having one of the most diverse ranges of wetlands birds to be seen at any one place in New Zealand. A total of 95 species have been identified at the estuary. It is a significant area of salt marsh and mudflat and a valuable feeding ground for many birds including the migratory Eastern bar-tailed Godwit, which flies all the way from Siberia to New Zealand to escape the harsh northern winter. The estuary is also a permanent home to 13 species of birds, six species of fish and four plants species, all of which are threatened. It regularly supports about one percent of the world population of wrybills.<ref name=\"doc.govt.nz\">{{cite web |title=Manawatu Estuary |url=https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/manawatu-estuary |website=doc.govt.nz |publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation |language=en-nz}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>\n\n==People==\n[[File:ManawatuWanganuiRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right|280px| Population density in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui at the 2006 census]]\n\nThe region had a usually resident population of 222,672 people at the 2013 census, the sixth-largest population in New Zealand. Between the 2006 and 2013 censuses the population rose by 249, which is less than one percent.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats2013|14181|Manawatu-Wanganui Region}}</ref>\n\nThere are two major urban areas. [[Palmerston North]], with a resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} ({{NZ population data 2018|}|y}} estimate), expanded as an educational centre and a supply centre for the surrounding rural hinterland. It became a city in 1930. The other major urban area is [[Whanganui]], with an estimated resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y|y|y|as of |.}} Other urban centres include [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]], [[Feilding]], [[Dannevirke]], [[Taumarunui]], [[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]], and [[Marton, New Zealand|Marton]]. The region also includes the smaller towns of Bulls, Ohakune, Waiouru, Raetihi, Taihape, Woodville, Pahiatua, Eketahuna, Ashhurst, Foxton Beach, Turakina, Sanson, Shannon and Manakau.\n\nCity life does not dominate, as half the population live outside a large urban area, over a third in small towns or rural areas. While [[manufacturing]] has become an important part of the economy, most businesses are agriculturally based and agriculture remains the linchpin. The dominance of agriculture, combined with the relatively small scale of most urban areas, gives a rural quality to the region, quite distinct from the neighbouring [[Wellington Region]]. The rugged interior has become one of the main training areas for the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], which maintain three bases in the region: [[RNZAF Base Ohakea]], [[Linton Military Camp]], and [[Waiouru Military Camp]].\n\n===Cities and towns===\n{{Largest cities\n| name        = Largest cities in Manawatu-Wanganui\n| class       = nav\n| country     = Manawat\u016b-Whanganui\n| stat_ref    = Statistics New Zealand {{NZ population data 2018|||y}} estimate{{NZ population data 2018||||y}}\n| div_name    = \n| div_link    = \n\n| city_1 = Palmerston North | div_1 =  | pop_1 = {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} | img_1 = Palmerston north city.jpg\n| city_2 = Whanganui | div_2 =  | pop_2 = {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y}} | img_2 = Whanganui River to Dublin Street Bridge.jpg\n| city_3 = Levin, New Zealand{{!}}Levin | div_3 =  | pop_3 = {{NZ population data 2018|Levin|y}} | img_3 = Levin.jpg\n| city_4 = Feilding | div_4 =  | pop_4 = {{NZ population data 2018|Feilding|y}} | img_4 = Feilding, NZ.jpg\n| city_5 = Dannevirke | div_5 =  | pop_5 = {{NZ population data 2018|Dannevirke|y}}\n| city_6 = Marton, New Zealand{{!}}Marton | div_6 =  | pop_6 = {{NZ population data 2018|Marton|y}}\n| city_7 = Taumarunui | div_7 =  | pop_7 = {{NZ population data 2018|Taumarunui|y}}\n| city_8 = Foxton, New Zealand{{!}} Foxton | div_8 =  | pop_8 = {{NZ population data 2018|Foxton|y}}\n| city_9 = Ashhurst | div_9 =  | pop_9 = {{NZ population data 2018|Ashhurst|y}}\n| city_10 = Pahiatua | div_10 = | pop_10 = {{NZ population data 2018|Pahiatua|y}}\n}}\n\n===Culture and identity===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Ethnic groups of Manawat\u016b-Whanganui residents, 2013 census<ref>{{cite web |title= Ethnic group (total responses), for the census usually resident population count, 2001, 2006, and 2013 Censuses (RC, TA, AU) |url= http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8020 |publisher= Statistics New Zealand}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Coastal M\u0101ori garden and gather food but life for M\u0101ori further inland is more difficult, relying on hunting and gathering.\n* 1820\u201340 [[Ngati Toa|Ng\u0101ti Toa]] and [[Te Atiawa]] [[iwi]] displace local iwi from their lands.\n* 1830 [[Te Rauparaha]] (Ngati Toa) lay siege to P\u016btiki [[P\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|P\u0101]] in retaliation for an attack on [[Kapiti Island]], sacking the p\u0101 and killing its inhabitants.\n* 1831 European traders arrive in the Whanganui area, led by Joe Rowe, supposedly a dealer in preserved heads ([[moko mokai]]). A dispute with local M\u0101ori leads to the death of three of his party and his own head is cut off and preserved.\n* 1840 [[Jerningham Wakefield]] ([[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s son) purchases {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} of land, under dubious circumstances, for the [[New Zealand Company]], including the town site for Petre (later to be Wanganui). The first European settlers start arriving in Petre.\n* 1842 The first organised European settlers in [[Horowhenua]] arrive at [[Paiaka]].\n* 1847 In July the \"Battle of St John's Wood\" occurs when 400 M\u0101ori clash with an equal force of British Regulars.\n* 1848 The Crown purchases Wanganui, {{convert|80000|acre|km2}}, {{convert|8000|acre|km2}} of which are supposed to be set aside as a reserve.\n* 1855 Paiaka settlers move closer to the coast at \"[[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]]\", which becomes a port handling flax, timber and agricultural produce.\n* 1856 The ''[[Wanganui Chronicle]]'' is first published.\n* 1860s Scandinavians settle in the [[Tararua (district), New Zealand|Tararua]] District, later founding [[Eketahuna]], [[Dannevirke]], and [[Norsewood]].\n* 1865 A battle ensues between the [[Pai Marire|Hau Hau]] adherents (who were largely upper Whanganui M\u0101ori), who want to expel the [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] at Wanganui, and the M\u0101ori of the lower river.\n* 1866 [[Palmerston North]] (Te Papai-oea) is founded. It is surrounded by forests, with the Manawatu River serving as its only link with the port of Foxton and the outside world.\n* 1870s The bush is gradually felled and the Manawatu opened up for European farms and settlement.

A higher than average proportion of businesses were engaged in the [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[fishing]] industries, 6.3% compared with 4.4% nationally. Businesses engaged in retail trade were dominant numerically. In 1997 there were 2,300 businesses, employing a total of 10,380 full-time\nequivalents (FTEs). The percentage of businesses engaged in manufacturing was slightly higher than the national average and manufacturing employed the greatest number of people (12,830 FTEs).\n\n===Energy===\nUnlike its neighbour [[Taranaki]], Manawat\u016b-Whanganui has not been a major producer of energy or minerals. Some new power schemes are operating, including the southern hemisphere's largest collection<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz|title=NZWEA Home Page|website=www.windenergy.org.nz}}</ref> of [[wind farm]]s, with 194 installed turbines and more planned.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe region is known for its strong agricultural base, which prompted the establishment of an agricultural college there in the 1920s. The government wanted to promote scientific farming and established colleges in two of the most important farming areas, [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and the Manawat\u016b. Research by members of the college into animal genetics in the 1930s led to the development of new breeds of sheep, the [[Drysdale (sheep)|Drysdale]] and the [[Perendale]], which became commercially significant after World War II.\n\nAgriculture dominates land use although there are areas of forestry and [[horticulture]]. Soils and climate favour pastoral farming. There were 6,344 farm holdings on 30 June 1996, which was almost a tenth of all farm holdings in New Zealand. Farming occupied 72.5% of land, which was much higher than the national average of 60.1%. Approximately 80% of this land was used for agricultural purposes (grazing, arable, fodder and fallow land). In the Manawat\u016b, Rangitikei and Tararua Districts this percentage rose to over 90% of total land.\n\nThe region is one of the most important areas of pastoral farming in New Zealand. It had 7,216,177 sheep (at 30 June 1996), the largest number of sheep in the North Island and the fourth-highest figure in the country behind Canterbury, [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Otago]]. [[Barley]], which is used for the manufacture of stock feed and for malting, is grown. The region produces the largest quantities of barley in the North Island, providing 10% of the national refined crop of 302,804 tonnes in 1995. The region also produces a significant proportion of vegetables in New Zealand. By planted land area, the region produces 25% of the country's [[lettuce]], 23% percent of its [[asparagus]], and 19% of its [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]] and [[cauliflower]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshfacts.co.nz/files/freshfacts-2018.pdf|title=Fresh Facts: New Zealand Horticulture|date=2018|website=Plant & Food Research|issn=1177-2190}}</ref>\n\n===Forestry===\nThe region is one of the most significant forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawat\u016b since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.\n\n===Tourism===\nFor the eight quarters between September 1996 and June 1998 the region averaged 4.1% of total guest nights in New Zealand. This was close behind Wellington at 6.7% and greater than Hawke's Bay, which averaged 3.1%. Occupancy rates, at 20.1%, were the fourth-lowest in the country for the June 1998 quarter. Rates for the city of Palmerston North were significantly higher than the national average (39.5% compared with 25.8%) whereas districts such as Ruapehu are far more seasonal with fairly low occupancy rates except in the peak ski season.\n\n===Transport===\n[[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]], the main highway, and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway, which both link [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], run through the region. The [[Palmerston North\u2013Gisborne Line]] and [[New Zealand State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] follow the [[Manawatu Gorge]], linking the region with Hawke's Bay. The [[Marton\u2013New Plymouth Line]] provides a railway link with Taranaki, and from this line the short [[Wanganui Branch]] runs to Whanganui. Road and rail transport give the region's exporters easy access to ports.\n\nThe region has approximately 16% of the North Island's road length. There are 8,732&nbsp;km of road, of which two-thirds are sealed. Approximately 12% of roads are classified as urban and three-quarters as rural, with almost half of the rural roads being unsealed. With 945.9&nbsp;km the region has the second-highest length of state highways in the North Island, after Waikato.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/publications/analytical%20reports/new%20zealand%20a%20regional%20profile%201998/regional-profile-manawatu-wanganui.aspx A regional profile: Manawatu/Wanganui], [[Statistics New Zealand]].\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Manawatu-Whanganui Region}}\n* [http://www.horizons.govt.nz/ Horizons Regional Council]\n* [http://www.manawatunz.co.nz/ Destination Manawatu]\n\n{{coord|-39.6|175.6|region:NZ-MWT_type:adm1st|display=title}}\n\n{{Regions of New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Manawat\u016b-Whanganui| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use New Zealand English|date=September 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2019}}\n{{short description|Region of New Zealand}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name = Manawat\u016b-Whanganui\n|settlement_type = [[Regions of New Zealand|Region of New Zealand]]\n|total_type = Region\n|image_map = Position of ManawatuWanganui.png\n|subdivision_type = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name = {{NZL}}\n|subdivision_type1 = Island\n|subdivision_name1 = [[North Island]]\n|seat = [[Palmerston North]]\n|parts_type = [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|Territorial authorities]]\n|parts_style = list\n|p1 = [[Palmerston North City]]\n|p2 = [[Manawatu District]]\n|p3 = [[Horowhenua District]]\n|p4 = [[Tararua District]]\n|p5 = [[Rangitikei District]]\n|p6 = [[Whanganui District]]\n|p7 = [[Ruapehu District]]\n|p8 = [[Stratford District, New Zealand|Stratford District]] (part)\n|p9 = [[Waitomo District]] (part)\n|p10 = [[Taupo District]] (part)\n|leader_title = Chairperson\n|leader_name = Rachel Keedwell \n|leader_title1 = Deputy Chairperson\n|leader_name1 = [[Jono Naylor]]\n|established_title = Established\n|established_date = 1989\n|area_total_km2 = 22215\n|elevation_max_m = 2797\n|elevation_min_m = 0\n|population_as_of = {{NZ population data 2018|||y}}\n|population_footnotes = <ref name=\"NZ_population_data_2018\"/>\n|population_total = {{NZ population data 2018|Manawatu-Wanganui region|y}}\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n| blank_name_sec1                 = [[Human Development Index|HDI]] (2017)\n| blank_info_sec1                 = 0.894<ref name=\"GlobalDataLab\">{{Cite web|url=https://hdi.globaldatalab.org/areadata/shdi/|title=Sub-national HDI - Area Database - Global Data Lab|website=hdi.globaldatalab.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-13}}</ref><br/>{{color|#090|very high}} \u00b7 [[List of regions of New Zealand by Human Development Index|13th]]\n|timezone = [[NZST]]\n|utc_offset = +12\n|timezone_DST = NZDT\n|utc_offset_DST = +13\n|website = [http://www.horizons.govt.nz/ www.Horizons.govt.nz]\n}}\n\n'''Manawat\u016b-Whanganui'''<ref>{{cite news |title=Seal of approval for spelling of Manawat\u016b-Whanganui region |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/399415/seal-of-approval-for-spelling-of-manawatu-whanganui-region |work=[[Radio New Zealand|RNZ]] |date=23 September 2019 |language=en-nz}}</ref> ({{IPA-mi|manawa\u02c8t\u0289\u02d0 \u02c8\u0294wa\u014ban\u0289i|}}; spelled '''Manawatu-Wanganui''' prior to 2019) is a [[regions of New Zealand|region]] in the lower half of the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], whose main population centres are the cities of [[Palmerston North]] and [[Whanganui]].

He named various waterways in the district. The waiata {{lang|mi|\"Ka tat\u016b e hine ko Manawat\u016b\"}} describes how his heart ({{lang|mi|manawa}}) settled or momentarily stopped ({{lang|mi|tat\u016b}}) when he saw the Manawatu River.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Government ==\nThe region covers all or part of ten [[territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authority]] areas. Parts of five of these are covered by five other [[regions of New Zealand]], the most of any region. In descending order of land area the territorial authority districts are [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], the major parts of [[Tararua District]] and [[Rangitikei District|Rangitikei]], [[Manawatu District|Manawat\u016b]], [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]], [[Horowhenua District|Horowhenua]], and small parts of [[Stratford, New Zealand|Stratford]], [[Waitomo District|Waitomo]], and [[Taupo District|Taupo]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/NZTerritorialAuthorities.png|title=Map |website=upload.wikimedia.org}}</ref> The largest city is [[Palmerston North]], with a population of 85,300 (June 2012 estimate). It is the only territorial authority in the region to be administered by a city council.\n\nThe governing body of the regional council consists of 12 councillors from 6 constituencies across the region, elected by the public; from the north: Ruapehu (1 councillor), Whanganui (2), Manawatu-Rangitikei (2), Palmerston North (4), Horowhenua-Kairanga (2), Tararua District (1). It sits in Palmerston North. It has the responsibility for managing natural and physical resources, providing flood protection and monitoring environmental problems and fresh air, clean water, productive land and natural eco-systems. It is also responsible for public transport.\n\n==Geography==\nThe region is dominated and defined by two significant river catchments, the [[Whanganui River|Whanganui]] and the [[Manawatu River|Manawatu]]. The Whanganui River, in the northwest, is the longest navigable river in New Zealand. The river was extremely important to early [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] as it was the southern link in a chain of waterways that spanned almost two-thirds of the North Island. It was one of the chief areas of M\u0101ori settlement with its easily fortified cliffs and ample food supplies. Legends emphasise the importance of the river and it remains sacred to Whanganui [[iwi]]. M\u0101ori along the coast and lowland plains grew [[Sweet potato|kumara]] and other crops. The Manawatu River runs across the centre of the region, from rolling hill country in the east to the fertile [[Manawatu Plains]] in the west. The main city of [[Palmerston North]] is located on these plains, and is an important service city for the southern North Island as a whole. This river is unusual, in that it passes from hill country to plains through a gorge cut into much higher country, an indication that the hills have risen since the river formed.\n\nTo the southeast, a further, more sparsely populated area of the [[Tararua District]] lies between the sources of the [[Manawatu River]] near [[Norsewood]] and the Pacific coast. This area, often historically connected with both the [[Hawke's Bay region]] to the north and the [[Wairarapa]] to the south, was historically simply known as Bush, a name which still survives in some businesses and organisations, most notably the [[Wairarapa-Bush Rugby Football Union]].\n\nThe two river catchments have very different natures. While the open Manawatu Plains became more densely settled by Europeans, inland [[Ruapehu District|Ruapehu]], [[Rangitikei (district), New Zealand|Rangitikei]] and [[Whanganui District|Whanganui]] remained more M\u0101ori-dominated, remote and independent, and is still heavily forested. As late as the 1950s the Whanganui River remained a river of mystery. Since then exploitation of the river's commercial potential has opened up the area, often causing friction with local M\u0101ori, who have long-standing grievances. Manawat\u016b-Whanganui as a whole is one of the most important pastoral areas in New Zealand, its status recognised when the government opened the [[Massey University|Massey Agricultural College]] in the 1920s.\n\nMuch of Manawatu-Wanganui was fertile and [[forest|bush]]-covered when Europeans arrived and developed the area as a source of [[timber]]. [[Saw mill]]ing and [[flax]] [[Mill (factory)|milling]] dominated the 19th century, followed by an influx of [[sheep]] farmers who exploited the newly cleared ground. [[Deforestation]], burn-offs of timber and scrub and large scale drainage combined with [[overgrazing]], resulted in considerable environmental degradation. In the early 1900s authorities realised that careful management was needed to maintain this important [[agriculture|agricultural]] area.\n\n===Topography===\nManawat\u016b-Whanganui takes up a large proportion of the lower half of the North Island. It is the second-largest local government region in the North Island and the sixth-largest in New Zealand, totalling 22,215&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (8.1% of New Zealand's land area). The region stretches from north of Taumarunui to south of Levin on the west coast, and across to the east coast from [[Cape Turnagain]] to Owhanga. It borders the [[Waikato]], [[Taranaki]], [[Hawke's Bay (region)|Hawke's Bay]] and [[Wellington (region)|Wellington]] regions and includes river catchment areas that run from the [[volcanic plateau]] to the sea. The [[Pacific Ocean]] is the eastern boundary and the [[Ruahine Ranges]] form a natural boundary with Hawke's Bay.\n\nThe area includes a variety of landscape formations. Districts close to the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau|Volcanic Plateau]] are higher and more rugged, often subject to harsh temperatures in winter. The [[Manawatu (district)|Manawatu District]] has a much gentler topography, consisting mainly of the flat, tree-studded [[Manawatu Plains]] that run between the ranges and the sea. The land was under the sea till about 500,000 years ago and still has a very thick layer of marine sediment, which is about five or six million years old. A [[block fault]]ing system underneath the thick sediment has raised a series of domes and gentle depressions. These structures can provide natural storage areas for oil and some of the Manawatu domes have been drilled. The domes have shaped the course of the Manawatu River, giving it a meandering path which, uniquely among New Zealand rivers, begins close to the east coast and exits on the west coast. The Manawatu River begins just inside the Hawke's Bay region, then flows through a deep gorge to the Manawatu Plains before exiting in the [[Tasman Sea]]. The river is also unique in New Zealand (and rare worldwide) in that this gorge (the [[Manawatu Gorge]]) is a [[water gap]] through recently uplifted rock, causing the river to flow from relatively low-lying land along an eroded course through higher terrain. The [[Whanganui District]] is more rugged, with [[canyon]]-like valleys and gorges carved out of the soft rock by rivers and ocean waves.\n\nThe region includes a series of mountain ranges, notably the [[Tararua Range]] and the [[Ruahine Ranges|Ruahine Range]] and the three major active [[volcano]]es of the North Island. [[Mount Ruapehu]] at 2,797 m is the tallest mountain in the North Island, [[Mount Ngauruhoe|Ngauruhoe]] 2,291 m and [[Mount Tongariro|Tongariro]] 1,968 m. During the last 100 years Ruapehu has experienced six significant eruptions, and last erupted in 1995 and 1996.\n\nThree major rivers divide the region: the Whanganui (290&nbsp;km), Manawat\u016b (182&nbsp;km) and [[Rangitikei River|Rangitikei]] (241&nbsp;km). The Whanganui is the second-longest river and has the second-largest catchment in the North Island, draining most of the inland region west of [[Lake Taupo]]. There are few roads in this area, which contains some of the largest surviving areas of native bush in the North Island.\n\n===Soil and climate===\nSoils are productive with the addition of [[fertiliser]]. In the Manawat\u016b and [[Horowhenua]] Districts there are sandy soils and swampy hollows around the coast with [[loess]]-covered terraces and river flats inland. These river flats and swamp areas contain fertile [[alluvial]] and organic soils. On the drier terraces inland yellow-grey earths predominate. The flatter more fertile soils suit intensive sheep farming and cropping while the hill country of Rangitikei favours semi-intensive sheep and [[beef]] farming. Areas close to the volcanic plateau consist largely of [[pumice]] soils which lack some essential trace elements but within the region much of this land is occupied by national parks.\n\nThe region has a comparatively mild climate with greater climatic extremes inland. [[Chateau Tongariro]] experienced the lowest temperature recorded in the North Island, falling to -13.6&nbsp;\u00b0C on 7 July 1937. In summer the region is warm, with a maximum mid-summer daily average of between 20.1 and 22.9&nbsp;\u00b0C. Sunshine hours approximate the national average for much of the region (1,800-2,000 hours per annum) but Palmerston North is defined as cloudy with an average of 1,725 sunshine hours. In the winter the minimum mid-winter daily average for coastal areas is 4.0 to 7.9&nbsp;\u00b0C, while inland areas are considerably colder. [[Waiouru]] has a minimum mid-winter daily average of 0.1&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n\nRainfall on the plains is slightly below average, with Palmerston North receiving 960&nbsp;mm, while the rest of the region receives the New Zealand average rainfall of 1,000-2,000&nbsp;mm.\n\n===Conservation and parks===\nThe region contains areas of great ecological significance, reflected in the designation of approximately a seventh of its land area as part of the nation's conservation estate. [[Tongariro National Park]] is the largest park in the region (795.98&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and is the oldest national park in the country, established in 1887. The volcanoes Tongariro, Ruapehu and Ngauruhoe are sacred to M\u0101ori and were given to the nation by [[Te Heuheu Tukino IV]], paramount chief of [[Ngati Tuwharetoa]]. They form the nucleus of the park, which is designated a [[world heritage]] area.\n\n[[Whanganui National Park]] is slightly smaller (742.31&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and was established 99 years later when a series of reserves were incorporated into one area and given national park status. There are two state forest parks in the rugged, bush-clad Ruahine Range and Tararua Range. The four parks offer [[skiing]], [[tramping]], [[jetboat]]ing and white-water [[rafting]] and the opportunity to appreciate the environment.\n\nThe regional council, responsible for managing natural and physical resources, provides flood protection and monitors environmental problems such as pest infestation and pollution. Invasive plant pests such as [[African feathergrass]], [[Galega officinalis|goats rue]] and nodding [[thistle]] pose a threat to pastureland in this heavily agricultural-dependent region, and the council has instituted control campaigns. The council has also instituted animal pest control programmes. [[Common brushtail possum|Possums]] are perceived as the major animal pest since they damage native forests and endanger cattle production through the spread of bovine [[tuberculosis]]. Eradication programmes also concentrate on [[rabbit]]s, [[Rook (bird)|rook]]s and feral [[goat]]s, while other exotic species such as [[Parma wallaby]] (''Macropus parma''),{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[wasp]]s, [[ferret]]s, [[stoat]]s and [[weasel]]s are a source of concern.\n\n==People==\n[[File:ManawatuWanganuiRegionPopulationDensity.png|thumb|right|280px| Population density in Manawat\u016b-Whanganui at the 2006 census]]\n\nThe region had a usually resident population of 222,672 people at the 2013 census, the sixth-largest population in New Zealand. Between the 2006 and 2013 censuses the population rose by 249, which is less than one percent.<ref>{{NZ Quickstats2013|14181|Manawatu-Wanganui Region}}</ref>\n\nThere are two major urban areas. [[Palmerston North]], with a resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} ({{NZ population data 2018|}|y}} estimate), expanded as an educational centre and a supply centre for the surrounding rural hinterland. It became a city in 1930. The other major urban area is [[Whanganui]], with an estimated resident population of {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y|y|y|as of |.}} Other urban centres include [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]], [[Feilding]], [[Dannevirke]], [[Taumarunui]], [[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]], and [[Marton, New Zealand|Marton]]. The region also includes the smaller towns of Bulls, Ohakune, Waiouru, Raetihi, Taihape, Woodville, Pahiatua, Eketahuna, Ashhurst, Foxton Beach, Turakina, Sanson, Shannon and Manakau.\n\nCity life does not dominate, as half the population live outside a large urban area, over a third in small towns or rural areas. While [[manufacturing]] has become an important part of the economy, most businesses are agriculturally based and agriculture remains the linchpin. The dominance of agriculture, combined with the relatively small scale of most urban areas, gives a rural quality to the region, quite distinct from the neighbouring [[Wellington Region]]. The rugged interior has become one of the main training areas for the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], which maintain three bases in the region: [[RNZAF Base Ohakea]], [[Linton Military Camp]], and [[Waiouru Military Camp]].\n\n===Cities and towns===\n{{Largest cities\n| name        = Largest cities in Manawatu-Wanganui\n| class       = nav\n| country     = Manawat\u016b-Whanganui\n| stat_ref    = Statistics New Zealand {{NZ population data 2018|||y}} estimate{{NZ population data 2018||||y}}\n| div_name    = \n| div_link    = \n\n| city_1 = Palmerston North | div_1 =  | pop_1 = {{NZ population data 2018|Palmerston North|y}} | img_1 = Palmerston north city.jpg\n| city_2 = Whanganui | div_2 =  | pop_2 = {{NZ population data 2018|Whanganui|y}} | img_2 = Whanganui River to Dublin Street Bridge.jpg\n| city_3 = Levin, New Zealand{{!}}Levin | div_3 =  | pop_3 = {{NZ population data 2018|Levin|y}} | img_3 = Levin.jpg\n| city_4 = Feilding | div_4 =  | pop_4 = {{NZ population data 2018|Feilding|y}} | img_4 = Feilding, NZ.jpg\n| city_5 = Dannevirke | div_5 =  | pop_5 = {{NZ population data 2018|Dannevirke|y}}\n| city_6 = Marton, New Zealand{{!}}Marton | div_6 =  | pop_6 = {{NZ population data 2018|Marton|y}}\n| city_7 = Taumarunui | div_7 =  | pop_7 = {{NZ population data 2018|Taumarunui|y}}\n| city_8 = Foxton, New Zealand{{!}} Foxton | div_8 =  | pop_8 = {{NZ population data 2018|Foxton|y}}\n| city_9 = Ashhurst | div_9 =  | pop_9 = {{NZ population data 2018|Ashhurst|y}}\n| city_10 = Pahiatua | div_10 = | pop_10 = {{NZ population data 2018|Pahiatua|y}}\n}}\n\n===Culture and identity===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Ethnic groups of Manawat\u016b-Whanganui residents, 2013 census<ref>{{cite web |title= Ethnic group (total responses), for the census usually resident population count, 2001, 2006, and 2013 Censuses (RC, TA, AU) |url= http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8020 |publisher= Statistics New Zealand}}</ref>\n|-\n!

A dispute with local M\u0101ori leads to the death of three of his party and his own head is cut off and preserved.\n* 1840 [[Jerningham Wakefield]] ([[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]]'s son) purchases {{convert|40000|acre|km2}} of land, under dubious circumstances, for the [[New Zealand Company]], including the town site for Petre (later to be Wanganui). The first European settlers start arriving in Petre.\n* 1842 The first organised European settlers in [[Horowhenua]] arrive at [[Paiaka]].\n* 1847 In July the \"Battle of St John's Wood\" occurs when 400 M\u0101ori clash with an equal force of British Regulars.\n* 1848 The Crown purchases Wanganui, {{convert|80000|acre|km2}}, {{convert|8000|acre|km2}} of which are supposed to be set aside as a reserve.\n* 1855 Paiaka settlers move closer to the coast at \"[[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]]\", which becomes a port handling flax, timber and agricultural produce.\n* 1856 The ''[[Wanganui Chronicle]]'' is first published.\n* 1860s Scandinavians settle in the [[Tararua (district), New Zealand|Tararua]] District, later founding [[Eketahuna]], [[Dannevirke]], and [[Norsewood]].\n* 1865 A battle ensues between the [[Pai Marire|Hau Hau]] adherents (who were largely upper Whanganui M\u0101ori), who want to expel the [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] at Wanganui, and the M\u0101ori of the lower river.\n* 1866 [[Palmerston North]] (Te Papai-oea) is founded. It is surrounded by forests, with the Manawatu River serving as its only link with the port of Foxton and the outside world.\n* 1870s The bush is gradually felled and the Manawatu opened up for European farms and settlement. Former [[Denmark|Danish]] Prime Minister, Bishop [[Ditlev Gothard Monrad]], organises a settlement of Danes near [[Awapuni, Manawatu-Wanganui|Awapuni]].\n* 1871 The first sawmill is established at Palmerston North.\n* 1872 Wanganui becomes a borough.\n* 1875 The ''[[Manawatu Times]]'' is published for the first time at Palmerston North.\n* 1876 A railway opens between Foxton and Palmerston North via Longburn, later named the [[Foxton Branch]]. [[Wellington Province]] abolished.\n* 1877 Palmerston North becomes a borough.\n* 1878 A railway line opens between Palmerston North and Wanganui. The first portion later became part of the [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]], between [[Aramoho]] and Wanganui the [[Wanganui and Castlecliff Branches|Wanganui Branch]], and the rest part of the [[Marton\u2013New Plymouth Line]].\n* 1884 The [[Sanson Tramway]], built and operated by the Manawatu County Council, opens to [[Sanson, New Zealand]] from the Foxton Branch at [[Himatangi]].\n* 1885 Mother [[Mary Joseph Aubert]] starts her community of the Daughters of Our Lady of Compassion at [[Jerusalem, New Zealand|Jerusalem]], founding a home for M\u0101ori orphans, the elderly and infirm. The private [[Wanganui and Castlecliff Branches|Castleciff Railway]] opens between Wanganui and Castlecliff.\n* 1886 The [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]] opens between [[Wellington]] and Longburn railway (later the [[North Island Main Trunk]]), superseding the Foxton link and ensuring Palmerston North's growth.\n* 1889 [[Levin, New Zealand|Levin]] is founded because of the construction of Wellington & Manawatu Railway\n* 1908 The North Island Main Trunk reaches [[Taumarunui]] and thence [[Auckland]], opening up the inland districts for development.\n* 1906 Levin becomes a borough.\n* 1924 Wanganui becomes a city.\n* 1930 Palmerston North becomes a city.\n* 1934 A major earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale strikes near Pahiatua and causes widespread damage from Porangahau to Castlepoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://info.geonet.org.nz/display/quake/M+7.6,+Horoeka,+5+March+1934|title=GeoNet News|website=info.geonet.org.nz}}</ref>\n* 1939 [[Ohakea]] [[Royal New Zealand Air Force|Air Force]] Station commences operations.\n* 1945 The Sanson Tramway closes.\n* 1953 New Zealand's worst rail disaster occurs at [[Tangiwai disaster|Tangiwai]] on the North Island Main Trunk, as the railway bridge collapses because of a [[lahar]] flow from the crater lake on [[Mount Ruapehu]]. A train with Christmas holiday-makers plunges into the flood, killing 151 people.\n* 1956 The private railway between Wanganui and Castlecliff is purchased by the government and incorporated into the [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national railway network]] as the Castlecliff Branch.\n* 1959 The Foxton Branch railway closes.\n* 1963 [[Massey University]] is formed by a merger of a branch of [[Victoria University of Wellington|Victoria University]] (at Palmerston North) with Massey Agricultural College.\n* 1970 Famous New Zealand poet [[James K.

A higher than average proportion of businesses were engaged in the [[agriculture]], [[forestry]] and [[fishing]] industries, 6.3% compared with 4.4% nationally. Businesses engaged in retail trade were dominant numerically. In 1997 there were 2,300 businesses, employing a total of 10,380 full-time\nequivalents (FTEs). The percentage of businesses engaged in manufacturing was slightly higher than the national average and manufacturing employed the greatest number of people (12,830 FTEs).\n\n===Energy===\nUnlike its neighbour [[Taranaki]], Manawat\u016b-Whanganui has not been a major producer of energy or minerals. Some new power schemes are operating, including the southern hemisphere's largest collection<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windenergy.org.nz|title=NZWEA Home Page|website=www.windenergy.org.nz}}</ref> of [[wind farm]]s, with 194 installed turbines and more planned.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe region is known for its strong agricultural base, which prompted the establishment of an agricultural college there in the 1920s. The government wanted to promote scientific farming and established colleges in two of the most important farming areas, [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and the Manawat\u016b. Research by members of the college into animal genetics in the 1930s led to the development of new breeds of sheep, the [[Drysdale (sheep)|Drysdale]] and the [[Perendale]], which became commercially significant after World War II.\n\nAgriculture dominates land use although there are areas of forestry and [[horticulture]]. Soils and climate favour pastoral farming. There were 6,344 farm holdings on 30 June 1996, which was almost a tenth of all farm holdings in New Zealand. Farming occupied 72.5% of land, which was much higher than the national average of 60.1%. Approximately 80% of this land was used for agricultural purposes (grazing, arable, fodder and fallow land). In the Manawat\u016b, Rangitikei and Tararua Districts this percentage rose to over 90% of total land.\n\nThe region is one of the most important areas of pastoral farming in New Zealand. It had 7,216,177 sheep (at 30 June 1996), the largest number of sheep in the North Island and the fourth-highest figure in the country behind Canterbury, [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] and [[Otago]]. [[Barley]], which is used for the manufacture of stock feed and for malting, is grown. The region produces the largest quantities of barley in the North Island, providing 10% of the national refined crop of 302,804 tonnes in 1995. The region also produces a significant proportion of vegetables in New Zealand. By planted land area, the region produces 25% of the country's [[lettuce]], 23% percent of its [[asparagus]], and 19% of its [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]] and [[cauliflower]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.freshfacts.co.nz/files/freshfacts-2018.pdf|title=Fresh Facts: New Zealand Horticulture|date=2018|website=Plant & Food Research|issn=1177-2190}}</ref>\n\n===Forestry===\nThe region is one of the most significant forestry areas in the southern North Island. The predominant soil type, yellow-brown earths, when enhanced by the use of fertilisers, is very suitable for forestry. Forestry has a long history in the Manawat\u016b since Palmerston North developed as a saw-milling town, and the region's initial prosperity depended on heavy exploitation of native timbers. But land use practices inhibited the long term viability of this indigenous forestry industry. Severe burn-offs destroyed large areas of native forest and subsequent overgrazing affected the soils. Forestry largely disappeared until the early twentieth century. In an attempt to combat erosion problems in sandy soils the government planted forests in the Foxton/Levin area in the early twentieth century. Inland forests were planted later. Some private native forest has been set aside for sustainable logging but most forestry depends on exotic plantings.\n\n===Tourism===\nFor the eight quarters between September 1996 and June 1998 the region averaged 4.1% of total guest nights in New Zealand. This was close behind Wellington at 6.7% and greater than Hawke's Bay, which averaged 3.1%. Occupancy rates, at 20.1%, were the fourth-lowest in the country for the June 1998 quarter. Rates for the city of Palmerston North were significantly higher than the national average (39.5% compared with 25.8%) whereas districts such as Ruapehu are far more seasonal with fairly low occupancy rates except in the peak ski season.\n\n===Transport===\n[[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]], the main highway, and the [[North Island Main Trunk]] railway, which both link [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]], run through the region. The [[Palmerston North\u2013Gisborne Line]] and [[New Zealand State Highway 3|State Highway 3]] follow the [[Manawatu Gorge]], linking the region with Hawke's Bay. The [[Marton\u2013New Plymouth Line]] provides a railway link with Taranaki, and from this line the short [[Wanganui Branch]] runs to Whanganui. Road and rail transport give the region's exporters easy access to ports.\n\nThe region has approximately 16% of the North Island's road length. There are 8,732&nbsp;km of road, of which two-thirds are sealed. Approximately 12% of roads are classified as urban and three-quarters as rural, with almost half of the rural roads being unsealed. With 945.9&nbsp;km the region has the second-highest length of state highways in the North Island, after Waikato.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [http://www.stats.govt.nz/~/media/Statistics/publications/analytical%20reports/new%20zealand%20a%20regional%20profile%201998/regional-profile-manawatu-wanganui.aspx A regional profile: Manawatu/Wanganui], [[Statistics New Zealand]].\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Manawatu-Whanganui Region}}\n* [http://www.horizons.govt.nz/ Horizons Regional Council]\n* [http://www.manawatunz.co.nz/ Destination Manawatu]\n\n{{coord|-39.6|175.6|region:NZ-MWT_type:adm1st|display=title}}\n\n{{Regions of New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:Manawat\u016b-Whanganui| ]]\n", "name_user": "Arjanvanderboon", "label": "safe", "comment": "added paragraph on biodiversity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manawat%C5%AB-Whanganui"}
