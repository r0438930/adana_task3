The metal chains are usually end-capped by anions, usually [[halide]]s. The organic ligands often pyridylamide, [[pyridone]], [[1,8-Naphthyridine|naphthyridine]], or their derivatives. Each metal atom is [[octahedral molecular geometry|six-coordinate]], bonded to two other metals along the axis of the molecule (except terminal metals, which are bonded to one metal and one capping anion) and to four nitrogen atoms perpendicular to the axis.\n\nThe organic ligands template the formation of the chains by bringing the metal ions together and aligning them into a linear string. The number of nitrogen atoms in the ligand determines the number of metal atoms that will be incorporated into the chain. Thus, the synthesis yields molecular wires of predetermined length. This feature, in combination with the fact that the molecules have well-defined ends, differentiates EMACs from other kinds of molecular wires: EMACs exist only as distinct molecular entities, they do not aggregate and they do not form periodic structures of repeating units.\n\nMost known EMACs contain from three to nine metal atoms. The longest EMACs that have been constructed so far incorporate eleven Ni atoms and have a length of approximately 2 nanometers, although it is estimated that chains with up to 17 metal atoms (4-5 nanometers) could be accessed with currently available ligands.<ref>Two Linear Undecanickel Mixed-Valence Complexes: Increasing the Size and the Scope of the Electronic Properties of Nickel Metal Strings\u2020\nAuthors Rayyat H.

The cobalt-containing molecule Co<sub>3</sub>(dpa)<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> (dpa = [[2,2'-dipyridylamide]]) was synthesized by both research groups, but each proposed a different structure: the group from Taiwan reported an unsymmetric structure with a long and a short Co-Co bond, whereas the Texas group identified a symmetric structure with equal Co-Co bond lengths. This disagreement sparked a controversy that lasted for years, until it was realized that both forms of the molecule actually exist simultaneously. While this debate led to the realization that the compound can be used as a molecular switch, it also created a new problem since none of the recognized types of [[isomerism]] could explain the existence of a molecule in two structural forms that differ only in the length of one or more bonds (and not in their stereochemistry or connectivity of the atoms).
