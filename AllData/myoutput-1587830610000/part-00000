prefecture-level city in southeast of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The administrative seat of Nyingchi is [[Bayi District]]. The Chinese claim part of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], which is one of the states of India, as part of the prefecture. (See [[South Tibet dispute]].)\n\nNyingchi is the location of [[Buchu Monastery]].\n\n==Geography and landmarks==\nThe prefecture-level city contains the [[Namcha Barwa]] Peak, and the [[Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon]], located in [[M\u00eadog County]], which attracts significant tourism and geoscientific and biological study to the area.\n\nApproximately 90 kilometers west of [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], is the alpine [[Pagsum Lake|Basum Lake]] in the upper catchment area of the [[Ba River (China)|Ba River]], the largest tributary of the [[Nyang River]] lying on average about {{convert|3,538|m}} above sea level. The lake surface is on average about 3,538 meters above sea level. Covering an area of {{convert|25.9|km2|abbr=on}}, the surrounding is populated by a diverse wildlife including [[leopard]]s, [[bear]]s, [[goat]]s, musk deer and Tibetan snow lions. In 1997, the Basum Lake was listed by the [[World Tourism Organization]] as a top tourist attraction. The lake also contains an inlet with a [[Gelug]] monastery. East of Nyingchi County, is the Seche La Mountain, a mountain of the [[Nyainqentanglha]] Mountain Range, which forms part of the watershed of the Nyang River and the [[Polung Zangbo]] River. Benri La Mountain near the small town of [[Nyingchi County|Dagze]] is a known sacred site of the Tibetan [[Bon]] Sect. Considered by Tibetans as one of the four great holy mountains in Tibet, on every tenth day of the eighth month of the [[Tibetan calendar]], a day of intense worshipping called \"Nangbolhasoi,\" is performed (meaning \"seeking for treasures from immortals.\")\n\n[[Bayi, Nyingchi County|Bayi Town]] is the administrative seat of Nyingchi, located 406 kilometers east of [[Lhasa]]. The vicinity is known for its [[cypress]]es which can grow up to 30 meters.\n\nThe Nangpo Gully, located about 50 kilometers northwest from [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], is one of the northern tributaries of the [[Nyang River]] and its upper stream is formed by the confluence of Yangwo, Gyixing and Boru streams. The area contains the [[hot spring]]s the Nun's Hot Springs, the Lama's Hot Springs and the Boru Hot Springs and many old [[pine tree]]s and [[cypress]]es, and caves. At the foot of the gully is the Yellow sect (Gelug) [[Bagar Monastery]], which was built during the period of the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]]. The cave above the monastery contains [[mural]]s of holy animals and Buddhist images, and below the cave is the famous [[karst]] springs. show jade-red bear branches, forming a \"Red Cloud Gully\" of 5 kilometers. The cobbles in the bed of the stream look like scattered pearls, so this place is also called \"Pearl Shoal.\" The scenes here are unique and beautiful.\n\n[[Lamaling Monastery|Burqug Lamaling Monastery]] is located on the third terrace on the left bank of the lower reaches of the [[Nyang River]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[subtropical highland climate|subtropical highland]] (Cwb).<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">{{Cite web |url=//en.climate-data.org/location/227757/ |title=Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Nyingchi |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2017-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=Y\n|single line=Y\n|location=Nyingchi (1981&ndash;2010 normals)\n|Jan high C= 8.9\n|Feb high C=10.2\n|Mar high C=13.5\n|Apr high C=16.6\n|May high C=19.5\n|Jun high C=21.6\n|Jul high C=22.3\n|Aug high C=22.1\n|Sep high C=20.5\n|Oct high C=17.4\n|Nov high C=13.7\n|Dec high C=10.1\n\n|Jan mean C= 1.0\n|Feb mean C= 2.8\n|Mar mean C= 5.9\n|Apr mean C= 8.9\n|May mean C=12.1\n|Jun mean C=15.1\n|Jul mean C=16.2\n|Aug mean C=15.7\n|Sep mean C=13.9\n|Oct mean C=10.3\n|Nov mean C= 5.5\n|Dec mean C= 1.7\n\n|Jan low C= \u22124.7\n|Feb low C= \u22122.3\n|Mar low C=  1.0\n|Apr low C=  3.8\n|May low C=  7.0\n|Jun low C= 10.8\n|Jul low C= 12.0\n|Aug low C= 11.6\n|Sep low C=  9.9\n|Oct low C=  5.6\n|Nov low C= \u22120.3\n|Dec low C= \u22124.2\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm=  1.3\n|Feb precipitation mm=  4.4\n|Mar precipitation mm= 19.0\n|Apr precipitation mm= 46.2\n|May precipitation mm= 75.3\n|Jun precipitation mm=119.2\n|Jul precipitation mm=143.3\n|Aug precipitation mm=122.2\n|Sep precipitation mm=110.5\n|Oct precipitation mm= 45.4\n|Nov precipitation mm=  4.7\n|Dec precipitation mm=  1.0\n\n|Jan humidity = 49\n|Feb humidity = 53\n|Mar humidity = 58\n|Apr humidity = 63\n|May humidity = 65\n|Jun humidity = 72\n|Jul humidity = 76\n|Aug humidity = 76\n|Sep humidity = 76\n|Oct humidity = 66\n|Nov humidity = 56\n|Dec humidity = 50\n|source 1= China Meteorological Administration<ref name=\"cma graphical\">{{cite web|url=http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7f51 - WeatherBk Data |publisher=[[China Meteorological Administration]] |language = zh-cn |accessdate=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Forestry and agriculture ==\n[[File:Gongbo&#039;gyamda, Nyingchi, Tibet, China - panoramio (19).jpg|thumb|[[Basum Tso|Basum Lake]] in [[Gongbo'gyamda County]]]]\n\"According to local forestry officials, Nyingchi hosts the country's largest primitive forest region that covers 26.4 billion cubic metres, storing over 800 million cubic metres of wood.\"<ref name = \"tibettravelplanner\">{{Cite web\n| title = Tibet travel guide of Nyingchi Region, Bayi Town\n| accessdate = 2013-10-20\n| url = http://www.tibettravelplanner.com/reg_nyingchi.htm\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808015208/http://www.tibettravelplanner.com/reg_nyingchi.htm\n| archive-date = 2014-08-08\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> The forests of Bomi, Zayu and Loyu have ancient dragon spruces which reach heights of over 80 metres and diameters of 2.5 metres.

This is the second largest airport in TAR and is closer to LAC than any other airport in the region. While the airport terminal is meant for civil aviation, it is known that Chinese airports, especially those in TAR, are essentially \u2018dual-use\u2019 \u2013 meant for both civil and military use. As Xinhua had announced in 2015, China is carrying out an \u2018integration\u2019 of civil-military airports in order to \u2018strengthen aviation safety and combat support capabilities\u2019. This will include joint maintenance of airport support facilities, joint flight safety support and joint airport management. Incidentally, one of the first airports to implement the aforesaid \u2018integration\u2019 was the Lhasa Gonggar Airport in TAR, having completed the process in 2015 itself. It can therefore be said that Nyingchi airport gives the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) an additional operational base in TAR, and one that is right opposite the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh Overall, this development is in keeping with the recent increase in the tempo of PLAAF activities in TAR. }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[Guangdong]] province announced that it plans to invest more than RMB 400 million (US$63 million) in Nyingchi's tourism industry.

'''Linzhi''', is a prefecture-level city in southeast of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. The administrative seat of Nyingchi is [[Bayi District]]. The Chinese claim part of [[Arunachal Pradesh]], which is one of the states of India, as part of the prefecture. (See [[South Tibet dispute]].)\n\nNyingchi is the location of [[Buchu Monastery]].\n\n==Geography and landmarks==\nThe prefecture-level city contains the [[Namcha Barwa]] Peak, and the [[Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon]], located in [[M\u00eadog County]], which attracts significant tourism and geoscientific and biological study to the area.\n\nApproximately 90 kilometers west of [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], is the alpine [[Pagsum Lake|Basum Lake]] in the upper catchment area of the [[Ba River (China)|Ba River]], the largest tributary of the [[Nyang River]] lying on average about {{convert|3,538|m}} above sea level. The lake surface is on average about 3,538 meters above sea level. Covering an area of {{convert|25.9|km2|abbr=on}}, the surrounding is populated by a diverse wildlife including [[leopard]]s, [[bear]]s, [[goat]]s, musk deer and Tibetan snow lions. In 1997, the Basum Lake was listed by the [[World Tourism Organization]] as a top tourist attraction. The lake also contains an inlet with a [[Gelug]] monastery. East of Nyingchi County, is the Seche La Mountain, a mountain of the [[Nyainqentanglha]] Mountain Range, which forms part of the watershed of the Nyang River and the [[Polung Zangbo]] River. Benri La Mountain near the small town of [[Nyingchi County|Dagze]] is a known sacred site of the Tibetan [[Bon]] Sect. Considered by Tibetans as one of the four great holy mountains in Tibet, on every tenth day of the eighth month of the [[Tibetan calendar]], a day of intense worshipping called \"Nangbolhasoi,\" is performed (meaning \"seeking for treasures from immortals.\")\n\n[[Bayi, Nyingchi County|Bayi Town]] is the administrative seat of Nyingchi, located 406 kilometers east of [[Lhasa]]. The vicinity is known for its [[cypress]]es which can grow up to 30 meters.\n\nThe Nangpo Gully, located about 50 kilometers northwest from [[Gongbo'gyamda County]], is one of the northern tributaries of the [[Nyang River]] and its upper stream is formed by the confluence of Yangwo, Gyixing and Boru streams. The area contains the [[hot spring]]s the Nun's Hot Springs, the Lama's Hot Springs and the Boru Hot Springs and many old [[pine tree]]s and [[cypress]]es, and caves. At the foot of the gully is the Yellow sect (Gelug) [[Bagar Monastery]], which was built during the period of the [[Fifth Dalai Lama]]. The cave above the monastery contains [[mural]]s of holy animals and Buddhist images, and below the cave is the famous [[karst]] springs. show jade-red bear branches, forming a \"Red Cloud Gully\" of 5 kilometers. The cobbles in the bed of the stream look like scattered pearls, so this place is also called \"Pearl Shoal.\" The scenes here are unique and beautiful.\n\n[[Lamaling Monastery|Burqug Lamaling Monastery]] is located on the third terrace on the left bank of the lower reaches of the [[Nyang River]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[subtropical highland climate|subtropical highland]] (Cwb).<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">{{Cite web |url=//en.climate-data.org/location/227757/ |title=Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Nyingchi |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2017-03-20 }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=Y\n|single line=Y\n|location=Nyingchi (1981&ndash;2010 normals)\n|Jan high C= 8.9\n|Feb high C=10.2\n|Mar high C=13.5\n|Apr high C=16.6\n|May high C=19.5\n|Jun high C=21.6\n|Jul high C=22.3\n|Aug high C=22.1\n|Sep high C=20.5\n|Oct high C=17.4\n|Nov high C=13.7\n|Dec high C=10.1\n\n|Jan mean C= 1.0\n|Feb mean C= 2.8\n|Mar mean C= 5.9\n|Apr mean C= 8.9\n|May mean C=12.1\n|Jun mean C=15.1\n|Jul mean C=16.2\n|Aug mean C=15.7\n|Sep mean C=13.9\n|Oct mean C=10.3\n|Nov mean C= 5.5\n|Dec mean C= 1.7\n\n|Jan low C= \u22124.7\n|Feb low C= \u22122.3\n|Mar low C=  1.0\n|Apr low C=  3.8\n|May low C=  7.0\n|Jun low C= 10.8\n|Jul low C= 12.0\n|Aug low C= 11.6\n|Sep low C=  9.9\n|Oct low C=  5.6\n|Nov low C= \u22120.3\n|Dec low C= \u22124.2\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm=  1.3\n|Feb precipitation mm=  4.4\n|Mar precipitation mm= 19.0\n|Apr precipitation mm= 46.2\n|May precipitation mm= 75.3\n|Jun precipitation mm=119.2\n|Jul precipitation mm=143.3\n|Aug precipitation mm=122.2\n|Sep precipitation mm=110.5\n|Oct precipitation mm= 45.4\n|Nov precipitation mm=  4.7\n|Dec precipitation mm=  1.0\n\n|Jan humidity = 49\n|Feb humidity = 53\n|Mar humidity = 58\n|Apr humidity = 63\n|May humidity = 65\n|Jun humidity = 72\n|Jul humidity = 76\n|Aug humidity = 76\n|Sep humidity = 76\n|Oct humidity = 66\n|Nov humidity = 56\n|Dec humidity = 50\n|source 1= China Meteorological Administration<ref name=\"cma graphical\">{{cite web|url=http://data.cma.cn/data/weatherBk.html |script-title=zh:\u4e2d\u56fd\u6c14\u8c61\u6570\u636e\u7f51 - WeatherBk Data |publisher=[[China Meteorological Administration]] |language = zh-cn |accessdate=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Forestry and agriculture ==\n[[File:Gongbo&#039;gyamda, Nyingchi, Tibet, China - panoramio (19).jpg|thumb|[[Basum Tso|Basum Lake]] in [[Gongbo'gyamda County]]]]\n\"According to local forestry officials, Nyingchi hosts the country's largest primitive forest region that covers 26.4 billion cubic metres, storing over 800 million cubic metres of wood.\"<ref name = \"tibettravelplanner\">{{Cite web\n| title = Tibet travel guide of Nyingchi Region, Bayi Town\n| accessdate = 2013-10-20\n| url = http://www.tibettravelplanner.com/reg_nyingchi.htm\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808015208/http://www.tibettravelplanner.com/reg_nyingchi.htm\n| archive-date = 2014-08-08\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> The forests of Bomi, Zayu and Loyu have ancient dragon spruces which reach heights of over 80 metres and diameters of 2.5 metres.

This is the second largest airport in TAR and is closer to LAC than any other airport in the region. While the airport terminal is meant for civil aviation, it is known that Chinese airports, especially those in TAR, are essentially \u2018dual-use\u2019 \u2013 meant for both civil and military use. As Xinhua had announced in 2015, China is carrying out an \u2018integration\u2019 of civil-military airports in order to \u2018strengthen aviation safety and combat support capabilities\u2019. This will include joint maintenance of airport support facilities, joint flight safety support and joint airport management. Incidentally, one of the first airports to implement the aforesaid \u2018integration\u2019 was the Lhasa Gonggar Airport in TAR, having completed the process in 2015 itself. It can therefore be said that Nyingchi airport gives the People\u2019s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) an additional operational base in TAR, and one that is right opposite the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh Overall, this development is in keeping with the recent increase in the tempo of PLAAF activities in TAR. }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\n[[Guangdong]] province announced that it plans to invest more than RMB 400 million (US$63 million) in Nyingchi's tourism industry.
