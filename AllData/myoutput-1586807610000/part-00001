Two black men had been arrested as suspects in a rape, and attempted rape and murder. The alleged victims were two young white women and the father of one of them. When a mob seeking to lynch the men discovered the sheriff had transferred them out of the city, the whites furiously spread out to attack black neighborhoods, murdered black citizens on the streets, and destroyed black businesses and homes.  The state militia was called out to quell the rioting.\n\nThe riot, trials and aftermath are said to be one of the most well-documented examples<!-- Did both sources say this? that would be unusual --> of the complex intersection of race, class, and criminal justice in the United States.<ref name=Complex>{{cite book|title=In Lincoln's Shadow: the Springfield, Illinois, Race Riot of 1908|last=Senechal de la Roche|first=Roberta|publisher=Southern Illinois University|year=2008|page=10}}</ref><ref name=SoCalled>{{cite journal|title=The So-Called Race Riot at Springfield, Illinois|journal=Charities and the Commons|location=New York, NY|volume=XX|year=1908|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101066882646;view=1up;seq=729|pages=709\u2013711}}</ref>  In 2008 an [[NPR]] report on the centenary of the race riot said that the fact of its taking place in a Northern state, specifically in \"[[Emancipation Proclamation|The Land of Lincoln]]\", demonstrated that blacks were mistreated across the country, not just in the South, and described the event as a proxy for the story of race in America.<ref name=USstory>{{cite news|author=Cheryl Corley|title=Springfield, Ill., Marks Centenary Of Riots|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93606402|date=14 Aug 2008|publisher=[[NPR]]}}</ref>\n\nAt least sixteen people died as a result of the riot: nine black residents, and seven white residents who were associated with the mob, five of whom were killed by state militia and two committed [[suicide]].

Personal and property damages, suffered overwhelmingly by blacks, amounted to more than $150,000 (approximately $4&nbsp;million in 2018), as dozens of black homes and businesses were destroyed, as well as three white-owned businesses of suspected black sympathizers.<ref name=Lovers>{{cite news|title=Mob Begins During After Negroes are Taken from Jail by Ruse: Woman Leads Rioters Who Wreck Big Restaurant; Nominee Chafin Protects Negro and Then is Stoned|date=15 Aug 1908|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|location=St. Louis, Missouri}}</ref><ref name=Bill>{{cite news|title=Springfield's Riot Bill|date=19 Sep 1908|newspaper=The Times-Democrat|location=New Orleans, Louisiana}}</ref><ref name=Lyric>{{cite interview|last=Himmick Becker|first=Helen|interviewer=Kay MacLean|title=Becker, Helen - Interview and Memoir|url=http://www.idaillinois.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/uis/id/979/rec/2|publisher=Oral History Collection, Archives/Special Collections, University of Illinois at Springfield|year=1975}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the rioting, numerous blacks left Springfield, but it is unclear how many moved away permanently. Although in the following months over 100 riot-related indictments were issued and some pled to minor violations, only one alleged rioter went to trial and conviction for lesser offenses. Of the two accused black men, who were the initial focus of the lynch mob, one was eventually tried, convicted and hanged, the other was set free. Near the 100th anniversary in 2008, the City of Springfield erected historical markers and a memorial statue.

For example, between May\u2013June 1907, neighboring [[Decatur, Illinois|Decatur]] had nearly 70 arrests for drunkenness.<ref name=Decatur>{{cite news|title=Only 14 Arrests for Drunkenness|newspaper=The Decatur Herald|location=Decatur, Illinois|date=8 Jun 1908}}</ref>  However, one year later, after Decatur had become \"dry,\" it had 80 percent fewer drinking arrests, and every man who had been arrested for drunkenness had obtained his liquor in Springfield.<ref name=Decatur/>\n\nThe drinking culture of Springfield fed into the pending attacks in two ways.  First, though Springfield was somewhat sheltered from the sluggish economy, the Panic did leave more men unemployed or underemployed.

Whites talked about how \"everybody knows that mob has made our families safe,\" boasting that the attacks were \"the best thing that ever happened to the Capital City,\" and celebrating that \"this was only the beginning of a crusade that shall make Springfield decent and keep it that way\":<ref name=Safe/><ref name=BestThingEver>{{cite news|title=Makes the Bad Lands Safe|date=18 Aug 1908|newspaper=The Decatur Herald}}</ref><ref name=Decent>{{cite news|title=Springfield Scum Driven to Winds|date=28 Aug 1908|newspaper=The Decatur Herald}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|...\"Springfield had no shame.

This also meant that blacks were abruptly deprived of casual neighborhood gathering places.<ref name=Saloons/> Lee F.

For example, three coal mines, including Woodside and Tuxhorn, employed approximately 500 men, of which 30 percent were black.  Following the attacks, the 350 white miners went to the president of the Springfield United Mine Workers union, refusing to work with black miners, stating that they felt \"unsafe\" working with blacks underground.<ref name=Miners/><ref name=Miners2>{{cite news|title=Another Mine Closed|date=20 Aug 1908|newspaper=The Pantagraph |location=Bloomington, Illinois}}</ref>  The mines shut down for several days, only re-opening when mine executives threatened to bring in black strikebreakers if the white miners did not resume work.  Several other white employers also received letters in the mail, threatening their lives and property, if they did not dismiss their black employees or if they did business with blacks.<ref name=Indictments3/>\n\nBecause merchants refused to deliver provisions to blacks at Camp Lincoln, hesitated to serve blacks in town, or overcharged them when they did, the state purchased $10,000 (over $250,000 in 2018) worth of groceries to re-sell to blacks so they could have food.<ref name=Indy/><ref name=HallamFree/><ref name=Groceries>{{cite news|title=Ask Far to Other Towns|date=22 Aug 1908|newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><ref name=FareRequest>{{cite news|title=Indicts Six More on Riots Charges: Ask Fare to Other Towns|date=28 Aug 1908|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|location=Chicago, Illinois}}</ref>\n\n====Social and political effects====\nWhite men immediately galvanized around the notion of restricting blacks from voting. From 1890 to 1908 legislatures of southern states had passed new constitutions and laws that raised barriers to voter registration, effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchising most blacks]] and excluding them from politics. This policy was enforced for decades, into the late 1960s.\n\nLocal discussions were similarly overt in intent:\n\n{{quote|The male citizen of the black belt in late years has come to pose as a political factor in Springfield.

Many newspapers claimed that more 2,000 fled; which might have been likely during the attack and its immediate aftermath. It appears that most blacks did return to Springfield, or were replaced by new migrants. Prior to the attacks, Springfield had about 2,700 blacks. Two years later, per the 1910 US Census, the black population had risen to just under 3,000.<ref name=BlackPop/><ref name=ImmPop/>\n\nThose who did return, and found that they were rendered homeless, sought refuge at the state Arsenal building, joining the 300 blacks who had not left the Arsenal since the attacks began.

This perception, of any such threat, increases the likelihood for violence; while the convergence of such deemed threats is likely to increase the expression of that violence:<ref name=HallamFree/>\n\n{{quote|The enslavement of one race by another produces necessarily certain moral effects upon both races, moral deterioration of the masters, moral degradation of the slaves. The deeper the degradation of the one, the greater will be the deterioration of the other, and vice versa. Indeed, slavery is a breeding-bed, a sort of compost heap, where the best qualities of both races decay and become food for the worst. The brute appetites and passions of the two act and react on the moral natures of each race with demoralizing effects. The subjection of the will of one race, under such circumstances, to the will of another begets in the race that rules cruelty and tyranny, and in the one that is ruled, fear, cunning and deceit...And there is no help for this so long as the one race rules and the other race is ruled, so long as there exists between them in the state inequality of rights, of conditions, based solely on the racehood of each.<ref name=Heart>{{cite journal|journal=The Arena|editor=B.O.
