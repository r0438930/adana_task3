'''p-nuclei''' (''p'' stands for [[proton]]-rich) are certain proton-rich, naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of some [[Chemical element|elements]] between [[selenium]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] inclusive which cannot be produced in either the [[S-process|s-]] or the [[r-process]].

Cameron]]: ''Nuclear Reactions in Stars and Nucleogenesis.'' In: ''Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific'', Vol. 69, 1957, p. 201-222. ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1957PASP...69..201C&link_type=ARTICLE&db_key=AST online])</ref> showed how the majority of naturally occurring [[nuclide]]s beyond the element [[iron]] can be made in two kinds of [[neutron capture]] processes, the s- and the r-process. Some proton-rich nuclides found in nature are not reached in these processes and therefore at least one additional process is required to synthesize them. These [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are called '''p-nuclei'''.

Since the definition of the p-nuclei depends on the current knowledge of the s- and r-process (see also [[nucleosynthesis]]), the original list of 35 p-nuclei may be modified over the years, as indicated in the Table below.
For example, it is recognized today that the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of <sup>152</sup>Gd and <sup>164</sup>Er contain at least strong contributions from the [[s-process]].<ref name=\"s-contrib\">C. Arlandini, F. Käppeler, K. Wisshak, R. Gallino, M. Lugaro, M. Busso, O. Straniero: ''Neutron Capture in Low-Mass Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: Cross Sections and Abundance Signatures.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 525, 1999, p. 886-900. ( {{doi|10.1086/307938}})</ref> This also seems to apply to those of <sup>113</sup>In and <sup>115</sup>Sn, which additionally could be made in the [[r-process]] in small amounts.<ref name=\"r-contrib\">Zs.

The [[Half-life|long-lived]] [[radionuclide]]s <sup>92</sup>Nb, <sup>97</sup>Tc, <sup>98</sup>Tc and <sup>146</sup>Sm are not among the classically defined p-nuclei as they no longer occur naturally on Earth. By the above definition, however, they are also p-nuclei because they cannot be made in either the s- or the r-process. From the discovery of their [[decay product]]s in [[presolar grains]] it can be inferred that at least <sup>92</sup>Nb and <sup>146</sup>Sm were present in the [[solar nebula]]. This offers the possibility to estimate the time since the last production of these p-nuclei before the formation of the [[solar system]].<ref name=\"dauphas\">N. Dauphas, T. Rauscher, B. Marty, L.

p-nuclei are very rare. Those isotopes of an element which are p-nuclei are less abundant typically by factors of ten to one thousand than the other isotopes of the same element. The abundances of p-nuclei can only be determined in [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] investigations and by analysis of [[meteorite|meteoritic]] material and [[presolar grains]]. They cannot be identified in [[Astronomical spectroscopy|stellar spectra]]. Therefore, the knowledge of p-abundances is restricted to those of the Solar System and it is unknown whether the solar abundances of p-nuclei are typical for the [[Milky Way]].<ref name=\"arnould\">M.

== Origin of the p-nuclei ==

The [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] production of p-nuclei is not completely understood yet. The favored ''γ-process'' (see below) in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] cannot produce
all p-nuclei in sufficient amounts, according to current [[computer simulation]]s. This is why additional production mechanisms and astrophysical sites are under investigation, as outlined below. It is also conceivable that there is not just a single process responsible for all p-nuclei but that different processes in a number of astrophysical sites produce certain ranges of p-nuclei.<ref name=\"posnic2010\">T. Rauscher: ''Origin of p-Nuclei in Explosive Nucleosynthesis.'' In: ''Proceedings of Science'' [http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/100/059/NIC XI_059.pdf PoS(NIC XI)059]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2010 ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2213 arXiv.org:1012.2213])</ref>

In the search for the relevant processes creating p-nuclei, the usual way is to identify the possible production mechanisms (processes) and then to investigate their possible realization in various astrophysical sites. The same logic is applied in the discussion below.

=== Basics of p-nuclide production ===

In principle, there are two ways to produce proton-rich [[nuclide]]s: by successively adding [[proton]]s to a nuclide (these are [[nuclear reaction]]s of type (p,γ) or by removing neutrons from a nucleus through sequences of [[photodisintegration]]s of type (γ,n).<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />

Under conditions encountered in astrophysical environments it is difficult to obtain p-nuclei through proton captures because the [[Coulomb barrier]] of a nucleus increases with increasing [[proton number]]. A proton requires more energy to be incorporated (''captured'') into an atomic nucleus when the Coulomb barrier is higher. The available average energy of the protons is determined by the [[temperature]] of the stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Increasing the temperature, however, also speeds up the (γ,p) photodisintegrations which counteract the (p,γ) captures. The only alternative avoiding this would be to have a very large number of protons available so that the effective number of captures per second is large even at low temperature. In extreme cases (as discussed below) this leads to the synthesis of extremely short-lived [[radionuclide]]s which [[Radioactive decay|decay]] to stable nuclides only after the captures cease.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />

Appropriate combinations of temperature and proton density of a stellar plasma have to be explored in the search of possible production mechanisms for p-nuclei. Further [[parameter]]s are the time available for the nuclear processes, and number and type of initially present nuclides (''seed nuclei'').

=== Possible processes ===

==== The p-process ====
{{Main article|p-process}}
In a p-process it is suggested that p-nuclei were made through a few proton captures on stable nuclides. The seed nuclei originate from the s- and r-process and are already present in the stellar plasma. As outlined above, there are serious difficulties explaining all p-nuclei through such a process although it was originally suggested to achieve exactly this.<ref name=\"b2fh\" /><ref name=\"cameron\" /><ref name=\"arnould\" /> It was shown later that the required conditions are not reached in [[star]]s or stellar explosions.<ref name=\"truran\">J. Audouze, J. W. Truran: ''P-process nucleosynthesis in postshock supernova envelope environments.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 202, 1975, p. 204-213. ( {{doi|10.1086/153965}})</ref>

Based on its historical meaning, the term ''p-process'' is sometimes sloppily used for any process synthesizing p-nuclei, even when no proton captures are involved.

==== The γ-process ====
p-Nuclei can also be obtained by [[photodisintegration]] of [[s-process|''s''-process]] and [[r-process|''r''-process]] nuclei. At temperatures around 2–3&nbsp;[[giga]][[kelvin]]s (GK) and short process time of a few seconds (this requires an explosive process) photodisintegration of the pre-existing nuclei will remain small, just enough to produce the required tiny abundances of p-nuclei.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"woosley\">S. E. Woosley, W. M. Howard: ''The p-process in supernovae.'' In: The Astrophysical Journal Supplement, Vol. 36, 1978, p. 285–304. ({{doi|10.1086/190501}})</ref> This is called '''γ-process''' (gamma process) because the photodisintegration proceeds by [[nuclear reaction]]s of the types (γ,n), (γ,α) and (γ,p), which are caused by highly energetic [[photon]]s ([[Gamma ray]]s).<ref name=\"woosley\" />

==== The ν-process (nu process) ====
If a sufficiently intensive source of neutrinos is available, [[nuclear reaction]]s can directly produce certain nuclides, for example <sup>7</sup>Li, <sup>11</sup>B, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>138</sup>La in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]].<ref name=\"nu-process\">S. E. Woosley, D. H. Hartmann, R. D. Hoffman, W. C. Haxton: ''The &nu;-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 356, 1990, p. 272-301. ( {{doi|10.1086/168839}})</ref>

==== Rapid proton capture processes ====

In a p-process protons are added to stable or weakly [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[atomic nuclei]]. 
If there is a high proton density in the stellar plasma, even short-lived [[radionuclides]] can capture one or more protons before they [[beta decay]]. This quickly moves the [[nucleosynthesis]] path from the region of stable nuclei to the very proton-rich side of the [[chart of nuclides]]. This is called ''rapid proton capture''.<ref name=\"posnic2010\" />

Here, a series of (p,γ) reactions proceeds until either the [[beta decay]] of a nucleus is faster than a further proton capture, or the [[proton drip line]] is reached. Both cases lead to one or several sequential beta decays until a nucleus is produced which again can capture protons before it beta decays. Then the proton capture sequences continue.

It is possible to cover the region of the lightest nuclei up to <sup>56</sup>Ni within a second because both proton captures and beta decays are fast. Starting with <sup>56</sup>Ni, however, a number of ''waiting points'' are encountered in the reaction path. These are nuclides which both have relatively long [[half-life|half-lives]] (compared to the process timescale) and can only slowly add another proton (that is, their [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for (p,γ) reactions is small). Examples for such waiting points are: <sup>56</sup>Ni, <sup>60</sup>Zn, <sup>64</sup>Ge, <sup>68</sup>Se. Further waiting points may be important, depending on the detailed conditions and location of the reaction path. It is typical for such waiting points to show half-lives of minutes to days. Thus, they considerably increase the time required to continue the reaction sequences. If the conditions required for this rapid proton capture are only present for a short time (the timescale of explosive astrophysical events is of the order of seconds), the waiting points limit or hamper the continuation of the reactions to heavier nuclei.<ref name=\"schatz\">H. Schatz, et al.: ''rp-Process Nucleosynthesis at Extreme Temperature and Density Conditions.'' In: ''Physics Reports'', Vol. 294, 1998, p. 167-263. ( {{doi|10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00048-3}})</ref>

In order to produce p-nuclei, the process path has to encompass nuclides bearing the same [[mass number]] (but usually containing more protons) as the desired p-nuclei. These nuclides are then converted into p-nuclei through sequences of beta decays after the rapid proton captures ceased.

Variations of the main category ''rapid proton captures'' are the rp-, pn-, and νp-processes, which will be briefly outlined below.

===== The rp-process =====
{{Main article|rp-process}}
The so-called '''rp-process''' (''rp'' is for ''rapid proton capture'') is the purest form of the rapid proton capture process described above. At proton densities of more than {{val|e=28}} protons/cm<sup>3</sup> and temperatures around 2 GK the reaction path is close to the [[proton drip line]].<ref name=\"schatz\" /> The waiting points can be bridged provided that the process time is 10-600 s. Waiting-point nuclides are produced with larger abundances while the production of nuclei \"behind\" each waiting-point is more and more suppressed.

A definitive endpoint is reached close to <sup>104</sup>Te because the reaction path runs into a region of nuclides which decay preferably by [[alpha decay]] and thus loop the path back onto itself.<ref name=\"rp-end\">H. Schatz, et al.: ''End Point of the rp Process on Accreting Neutron Stars.'' In: ''Physical Review Letters'', Vol. 86, 2001, p. 3471-3474. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471 ] {{doi|10.1016/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471}})</ref> Therefore, an rp-process would only be able to produce p-nuclei with [[mass number]]s less than or equal to 104.

===== The pn-process =====
The waiting points in rapid proton capture processes can be avoided by (n,p) reactions which are much faster than proton captures on or beta decays of waiting points nuclei. This results in a considerable reduction of the time required to build heavy elements and allows an efficient production within seconds.<ref name=\"arnould\" /> This requires, however, a (small) supply of free [[neutron]]s which are usually not present in such proton-rich plasmas. One way to obtain them is to release them through other reactions occurring simultaneously as the rapid proton captures. This is called ''neutron-rich rapid proton capture'' or '''pn-process'''.<ref name=\"pn-proc\">S. Goriely, J. José, M. Hernanz, M. Rayet, M. Arnould: ''He-detonation in sub-Chandrasekhar CO white dwarfs: A new insight into energetics and p-process nucleosynthesis.'' In: ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', Vol. 383, 2002, p. L27-L30. ( {{doi|10.1051/0004-6361:20020088}})</ref>

===== The &nu;p-process =====
Another possibility to obtain the neutrons required for the accelerating (n,p) reactions in proton-rich environments is to use the anti-neutrino capture on protons ({{nowrap|{{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}}}}), turning a proton and an anti-neutrino into a [[positron]] and a neutron. Since (anti-)neutrinos interact only very weakly with protons, a high [[flux]] of anti-neutrinos has to act on a plasma with high proton density. This is called '''νp-process''' (nu p process).<ref name=\"nup-process\">C. Fröhlich, G. Martínez-Pinedo, M. Liebendörfer, F.-K. Thielemann, E. Bravo, W. R. Hix, K. Langanke, N. T. Zinner: ''Neutrino-Induced Nucleosynthesis of A&gt;64 Nuclei: The &nu;p Process.'' In: ''Physical Review Letters'', Vol. 96, 2006, article 142502. ( {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.142502}})</ref>

=== Possible synthesis sites ===

==== Core-collapse supernovae ====
Massive [[star]]s end their life in a [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernova]]. In such a supernova, a shockfront from an explosion runs from the center of the star through its outer layers and ejects these. When the shockfront reaches the O/Ne-shell of the star (see also [[stellar evolution]]), the conditions for a γ-process are reached for 1-2 s.

Although the majority of p-nuclei can be made in this way, some [[mass number|mass]] regions of p-nuclei turn out to be problematic in model calculations. It has been known already for decades that p-nuclei with mass numbers {{nowrap|A &lt; 100}} cannot be produced in a γ-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"woosley\" /> Modern simulations also show problems in the range {{nowrap|150 ≤ A ≤ 165}}.<ref name=\"posnic2010\" /><ref name=\"rhhw\">T. Rauscher, A. Heger, R. D. Hoffman, S. E. Woosley: ''Nucleosynthesis in Massive Stars with Improved Nuclear and Stellar Physics.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 576, 2002, p. 323-348. ( {{doi|10.1086/341728}})</ref>

The p-nucleus <sup>138</sup>La is not produced in the γ-process but it can be made in a ν-process. A hot [[neutron star]] is made in the center of such a core-collapse supernova and it radiates neutrinos with high intensity. The neutrinos interact also with the outer layers of the exploding star and cause nuclear reactions which create <sup>138</sup>La, among other nuclei.<ref name=\"nu-process\" /><ref name=\"rhhw\" /> Also <sup>180m</sup>Ta may receive a contribution from this ν-process.

It was suggested<ref name=\"nup-process\" /> to supplement the γ-process in the outer layers of the star by another process, occurring in the deepest layers of the star, close to the neutron star but still being ejected instead of falling onto the neutron star surface. Due to the initially high flow of neutrinos from the forming neutron star, these layers become extremely proton-rich through the reaction {{nowrap|{{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}}}. Although the anti-neutrino flux is initially weaker a few neutrons will be created, nevertheless, because of the large number of protons. This allows a ''&nu;p-process'' in these deep layers. Because of the short timescale of the explosion and the high [[Coulomb barrier]] of the heavier nuclei, such a νp-process could possibly only produce the lightest p-nuclei. Which nuclei are made and how much of them depends sensitively on many details in the simulations and also on the actual explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova, which still is not completely understood.<ref name=\"nup-process\" /><ref name=\"nup-process2\">C. Fröhlich, et al.: ''Composition of the Innermost Core-Collapse Supernova Ejecta.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 637, 2006, p. 415-426. ( {{doi|10.1086/498224}})</ref>

==== Thermonuclear supernovae ====

A [[thermonuclear supernova]] is the explosion of a [[white dwarf]] in a [[binary star]] system, triggered by thermonuclear reactions in matter from a companion star [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] on the surface of the white dwarf. The accreted matter is rich in [[hydrogen]] (protons) and [[helium]] ([[Alpha particle|&alpha; particles]]) and becomes hot enough to allow [[nuclear reaction]]s.

A number of models for such explosions are discussed in literature, of which two were explored regarding the prospect of producing p-nuclei. None of these explosions release neutrinos, therefore rendering ν- and νp-process impossible. Conditions required for the rp-process are also not attained.

Details of the possible production of p-nuclei in such supernovae depend sensitively on the composition of the matter accreted from the companion star (the ''seed nuclei'' for all subsequent processes). Since this can change considerably from star to star, all statements and models of p-production in thermonuclear supernovae are prone to large uncertainties.<ref name=\"arnould\" />

===== Type Ia supernovae =====
The consensus model of thermonuclear supernovae postulates that the white dwarf explodes after exceeding the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] by the accretion of matter because the contraction and heating ignites explosive [[carbon burning]] under [[Degenerate matter|degenerate]] conditions. A nuclear burning front runs through the white dwarf from the inside out and tears it apart. Then the outermost layers closely beneath the surface of the white dwarf (containing 0.05 [[solar mass]]es of matter) exhibit the right conditions for a γ-process.<ref name=\"Ia-gamma\">W. M. Howard, S. B. Meyer, S. E. Woosley: ''A new site for the astrophysical gamma-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal Letters'', Vol. 373, 1991, p. L5-L8. ( {{doi|10.1086/186038}})</ref>

The p-nuclei are made in the same way as in the γ-process in core-collapse supernovae and also the same difficulties are encountered. In addition, <sup>138</sup>La and <sup>180m</sup>Ta are not produced. A variation of the seed abundances by assuming increased [[s-process]] abundances only scales the abundances of the resulting p-nuclei without curing the problems of relative underproduction in the nuclear mass ranges given above.<ref name=\"arnould\" />

===== subChandrasekhar supernovae =====
In a subclass of [[type Ia supernova]]e, the so-called '''subChandrasekhar supernova''', the white dwarf may explode long before it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit because nuclear reactions in the accreted matter can already heat the white dwarf during its accretion phase and trigger explosive carbon burning prematurely. Helium-rich accretion favors this type of explosion. [[Helium burning]] ignites degeneratively on the bottom of the accreted helium layer and causes two shockfronts. The one running inwards ignites the carbon explosion. The outwards moving front heats the outer layers of the white dwarf and ejects them. Again, these outer layers are site to a γ-process at temperatures of 2-3 GK. Due to the presence of α particles (helium nuclei), however, additional nuclear reactions become possible. Among those are such which release a large number of neutrons, such as <sup>18</sup>O(α,n)<sup>21</sup>Ne, <sup>22</sup>Ne(α,n)<sup>25</sup>Mg, and <sup>26</sup>Mg(α,n)<sup>29</sup>Si. This allows a ''pn-process'' in that part of the outer layers which experiences temperatures above 3 GK.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"pn-proc\" />

Those light p-nuclei which are underproduced in the γ-process can be so efficiently made in the pn-process that they even show much larger abundances than the other p-nuclei. To obtain the observed solar relative abundances, a strongly enhanced [[s-process]] seed (by factors of 100-1000 or more) has to be assumed which increases the yield of heavy p-nuclei from the γ-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"pn-proc\" />

==== Neutron stars in binary star systems ====
{{Main article|rp-process}}
A [[neutron star]] in a [[binary star]] system can also accrete matter from the companion star on its surface. Combined [[hydrogen burning|hydrogen]] and [[helium burning]] ignites when the accreted layer of [[degenerate matter]] reaches a density of
{{nowrap|{{val|e=5}}–{{val|e=6}} g/cm<sup>3</sup>}} and a temperature exceeding {{val|0.2|u=GK}}. This leads to [[thermonuclear]] burning comparable to what happens in the outwards moving shockfront of subChandrasekhar supernovae. The neutron star itself is not affected by the explosion and therefore the nuclear reactions in the accreted layer can proceed longer than in an explosion. This allows to establish an rp-process. It will continue until either all free protons are used up or the burning layer has expanded due to the increase in temperature and its density falls below the one required for the nuclear reactions.<ref name=\"schatz\" />

It was shown that the properties of [[X-ray burster|X-ray bursts]] in the [[Milky Way]] can be explained by an rp-process on the surface of accreting neutron stars.<ref name=\"x-bursts\">S. E. Woosley, et al.: ''Models for Type I X-Ray Bursts with Improved Nuclear Physics.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal Supplement'', Vol. 151, 2004, p. 75-102. ( {{doi|10.1086/381553}})</ref> It remains unclear, yet, whether matter (and if, how much matter) can be ejected and escape the [[gravitational field]] of the neutron star. Only if this is the case can such objects be considered as possible sources of p-nuclei. Even if this is corroborated, the demonstrated endpoint of the rp-process limits the production to the light p-nuclei (which are underproduced in core-collapse supernovae).<ref name=\"rp-end\" />

'''p-nuclei''' (''p'' stands for [[proton]]-rich) are certain proton-rich, naturally occurring [[isotope]]s of some [[Chemical element|elements]] between [[selenium]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] inclusive which cannot be produced in either the [[S-process|s-]] or the [[r-process]].

Cameron]]: ''Nuclear Reactions in Stars and Nucleogenesis.'' In: ''Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific'', Vol. 69, 1957, p. 201-222. ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=1957PASP...69..201C&link_type=ARTICLE&db_key=AST online])</ref> showed how the majority of naturally occurring [[nuclide]]s beyond the element [[iron]] can be made in two kinds of [[neutron capture]] processes, the s- and the r-process. Some proton-rich nuclides found in nature are not reached in these processes and therefore at least one additional process is required to synthesize them. These [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are called '''p-nuclei'''.

Since the definition of the p-nuclei depends on the current knowledge of the s- and r-process (see also [[nucleosynthesis]]), the original list of 35 p-nuclei may be modified over the years, as indicated in the Table below.
For example, it is recognized today that the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|abundances]] of <sup>152</sup>Gd and <sup>164</sup>Er contain at least strong contributions from the [[s-process]].<ref name=\"s-contrib\">C. Arlandini, F. Käppeler, K. Wisshak, R. Gallino, M. Lugaro, M. Busso, O. Straniero: ''Neutron Capture in Low-Mass Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: Cross Sections and Abundance Signatures.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 525, 1999, p. 886-900. ( {{doi|10.1086/307938}})</ref> This also seems to apply to those of <sup>113</sup>In and <sup>115</sup>Sn, which additionally could be made in the [[r-process]] in small amounts.<ref name=\"r-contrib\">Zs.

The [[Half-life|long-lived]] [[radionuclide]]s <sup>92</sup>Nb, <sup>97</sup>Tc, <sup>98</sup>Tc and <sup>146</sup>Sm are not among the classically defined p-nuclei as they no longer occur naturally on Earth. By the above definition, however, they are also p-nuclei because they cannot be made in either the s- or the r-process. From the discovery of their [[decay product]]s in [[presolar grains]] it can be inferred that at least <sup>92</sup>Nb and <sup>146</sup>Sm were present in the [[solar nebula]]. This offers the possibility to estimate the time since the last production of these p-nuclei before the formation of the [[solar system]].<ref name=\"dauphas\">N. Dauphas, T. Rauscher, B. Marty, L.

p-nuclei are very rare. Those isotopes of an element which are p-nuclei are less abundant typically by factors of ten to one thousand than the other isotopes of the same element. The abundances of p-nuclei can only be determined in [[Geochemistry|geochemical]] investigations and by analysis of [[meteorite|meteoritic]] material and [[presolar grains]]. They cannot be identified in [[Astronomical spectroscopy|stellar spectra]]. Therefore, the knowledge of p-abundances is restricted to those of the Solar System and it is unknown whether the solar abundances of p-nuclei are typical for the [[Milky Way]].<ref name=\"arnould\">M.

== Origin of the p-nuclei ==

The [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] production of p-nuclei is not completely understood yet. The favored ''γ-process'' (see below) in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] cannot produce
all p-nuclei in sufficient amounts, according to current [[computer simulation]]s. This is why additional production mechanisms and astrophysical sites are under investigation, as outlined below. It is also conceivable that there is not just a single process responsible for all p-nuclei but that different processes in a number of astrophysical sites produce certain ranges of p-nuclei.<ref name=\"posnic2010\">T. Rauscher: ''Origin of p-Nuclei in Explosive Nucleosynthesis.'' In: ''Proceedings of Science'' [http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/100/059/NIC XI_059.pdf PoS(NIC XI)059]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2010 ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2213 arXiv.org:1012.2213])</ref>

In the search for the relevant processes creating p-nuclei, the usual way is to identify the possible production mechanisms (processes) and then to investigate their possible realization in various astrophysical sites. The same logic is applied in the discussion below.

=== Basics of p-nuclide production ===

In principle, there are two ways to produce proton-rich [[nuclide]]s: by successively adding [[proton]]s to a nuclide (these are [[nuclear reaction]]s of type (p,γ) or by removing neutrons from a nucleus through sequences of [[photodisintegration]]s of type (γ,n).<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />

Under conditions encountered in astrophysical environments it is difficult to obtain p-nuclei through proton captures because the [[Coulomb barrier]] of a nucleus increases with increasing [[proton number]]. A proton requires more energy to be incorporated (''captured'') into an atomic nucleus when the Coulomb barrier is higher. The available average energy of the protons is determined by the [[temperature]] of the stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Increasing the temperature, however, also speeds up the (γ,p) photodisintegrations which counteract the (p,γ) captures. The only alternative avoiding this would be to have a very large number of protons available so that the effective number of captures per second is large even at low temperature. In extreme cases (as discussed below) this leads to the synthesis of extremely short-lived [[radionuclide]]s which [[Radioactive decay|decay]] to stable nuclides only after the captures cease.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />

Appropriate combinations of temperature and proton density of a stellar plasma have to be explored in the search of possible production mechanisms for p-nuclei. Further [[parameter]]s are the time available for the nuclear processes, and number and type of initially present nuclides (''seed nuclei'').

=== Possible processes ===

==== The p-process ====
{{Main article|p-process}}
In a p-process it is suggested that p-nuclei were made through a few proton captures on stable nuclides. The seed nuclei originate from the s- and r-process and are already present in the stellar plasma. As outlined above, there are serious difficulties explaining all p-nuclei through such a process although it was originally suggested to achieve exactly this.<ref name=\"b2fh\" /><ref name=\"cameron\" /><ref name=\"arnould\" /> It was shown later that the required conditions are not reached in [[star]]s or stellar explosions.<ref name=\"truran\">J. Audouze, J. W. Truran: ''P-process nucleosynthesis in postshock supernova envelope environments.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 202, 1975, p. 204-213. ( {{doi|10.1086/153965}})</ref>

Based on its historical meaning, the term ''p-process'' is sometimes sloppily used for any process synthesizing p-nuclei, even when no proton captures are involved.

==== The γ-process ====
p-Nuclei can also be obtained by [[photodisintegration]] of [[s-process|''s''-process]] and [[r-process|''r''-process]] nuclei. At temperatures around 2–3&nbsp;[[giga]][[kelvin]]s (GK) and short process time of a few seconds (this requires an explosive process) photodisintegration of the pre-existing nuclei will remain small, just enough to produce the required tiny abundances of p-nuclei.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"woosley\">S. E. Woosley, W. M. Howard: ''The p-process in supernovae.'' In: The Astrophysical Journal Supplement, Vol. 36, 1978, p. 285–304. ({{doi|10.1086/190501}})</ref> This is called '''γ-process''' (gamma process) because the photodisintegration proceeds by [[nuclear reaction]]s of the types (γ,n), (γ,α) and (γ,p), which are caused by highly energetic [[photon]]s ([[Gamma ray]]s).<ref name=\"woosley\" />

==== The ν-process (nu process) ====
If a sufficiently intensive source of neutrinos is available, [[nuclear reaction]]s can directly produce certain nuclides, for example <sup>7</sup>Li, <sup>11</sup>B, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>138</sup>La in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]].<ref name=\"nu-process\">S. E. Woosley, D. H. Hartmann, R. D. Hoffman, W. C. Haxton: ''The &nu;-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 356, 1990, p. 272-301. ( {{doi|10.1086/168839}})</ref>

==== Rapid proton capture processes ====

In a p-process protons are added to stable or weakly [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[atomic nuclei]]. 
If there is a high proton density in the stellar plasma, even short-lived [[radionuclides]] can capture one or more protons before they [[beta decay]]. This quickly moves the [[nucleosynthesis]] path from the region of stable nuclei to the very proton-rich side of the [[chart of nuclides]]. This is called ''rapid proton capture''.<ref name=\"posnic2010\" />

Here, a series of (p,γ) reactions proceeds until either the [[beta decay]] of a nucleus is faster than a further proton capture, or the [[proton drip line]] is reached. Both cases lead to one or several sequential beta decays until a nucleus is produced which again can capture protons before it beta decays. Then the proton capture sequences continue.

It is possible to cover the region of the lightest nuclei up to <sup>56</sup>Ni within a second because both proton captures and beta decays are fast. Starting with <sup>56</sup>Ni, however, a number of ''waiting points'' are encountered in the reaction path. These are nuclides which both have relatively long [[half-life|half-lives]] (compared to the process timescale) and can only slowly add another proton (that is, their [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for (p,γ) reactions is small). Examples for such waiting points are: <sup>56</sup>Ni, <sup>60</sup>Zn, <sup>64</sup>Ge, <sup>68</sup>Se. Further waiting points may be important, depending on the detailed conditions and location of the reaction path. It is typical for such waiting points to show half-lives of minutes to days. Thus, they considerably increase the time required to continue the reaction sequences. If the conditions required for this rapid proton capture are only present for a short time (the timescale of explosive astrophysical events is of the order of seconds), the waiting points limit or hamper the continuation of the reactions to heavier nuclei.<ref name=\"schatz\">H. Schatz, et al.: ''rp-Process Nucleosynthesis at Extreme Temperature and Density Conditions.'' In: ''Physics Reports'', Vol. 294, 1998, p. 167-263. ( {{doi|10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00048-3}})</ref>

In order to produce p-nuclei, the process path has to encompass nuclides bearing the same [[mass number]] (but usually containing more protons) as the desired p-nuclei. These nuclides are then converted into p-nuclei through sequences of beta decays after the rapid proton captures ceased.

Variations of the main category ''rapid proton captures'' are the rp-, pn-, and νp-processes, which will be briefly outlined below.

===== The rp-process =====
{{Main article|rp-process}}
The so-called '''rp-process''' (''rp'' is for ''rapid proton capture'') is the purest form of the rapid proton capture process described above. At proton densities of more than {{val|e=28}} protons/cm<sup>3</sup> and temperatures around 2 GK the reaction path is close to the [[proton drip line]].<ref name=\"schatz\" /> The waiting points can be bridged provided that the process time is 10-600 s. Waiting-point nuclides are produced with larger abundances while the production of nuclei \"behind\" each waiting-point is more and more suppressed.

A definitive endpoint is reached close to <sup>104</sup>Te because the reaction path runs into a region of nuclides which decay preferably by [[alpha decay]] and thus loop the path back onto itself.<ref name=\"rp-end\">H. Schatz, et al.: ''End Point of the rp Process on Accreting Neutron Stars.'' In: ''Physical Review Letters'', Vol. 86, 2001, p. 3471-3474. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471 ] {{doi|10.1016/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471}})</ref> Therefore, an rp-process would only be able to produce p-nuclei with [[mass number]]s less than or equal to 104.

===== The pn-process =====
The waiting points in rapid proton capture processes can be avoided by (n,p) reactions which are much faster than proton captures on or beta decays of waiting points nuclei. This results in a considerable reduction of the time required to build heavy elements and allows an efficient production within seconds.<ref name=\"arnould\" /> This requires, however, a (small) supply of free [[neutron]]s which are usually not present in such proton-rich plasmas. One way to obtain them is to release them through other reactions occurring simultaneously as the rapid proton captures. This is called ''neutron-rich rapid proton capture'' or '''pn-process'''.<ref name=\"pn-proc\">S. Goriely, J. José, M. Hernanz, M. Rayet, M. Arnould: ''He-detonation in sub-Chandrasekhar CO white dwarfs: A new insight into energetics and p-process nucleosynthesis.'' In: ''Astronomy and Astrophysics'', Vol. 383, 2002, p. L27-L30. ( {{doi|10.1051/0004-6361:20020088}})</ref>

===== The &nu;p-process =====
Another possibility to obtain the neutrons required for the accelerating (n,p) reactions in proton-rich environments is to use the anti-neutrino capture on protons ({{nowrap|{{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Positron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}}}}), turning a proton and an anti-neutrino into a [[positron]] and a neutron. Since (anti-)neutrinos interact only very weakly with protons, a high [[flux]] of anti-neutrinos has to act on a plasma with high proton density. This is called '''νp-process''' (nu p process).<ref name=\"nup-process\">C. Fröhlich, G. Martínez-Pinedo, M. Liebendörfer, F.-K. Thielemann, E. Bravo, W. R. Hix, K. Langanke, N. T. Zinner: ''Neutrino-Induced Nucleosynthesis of A&gt;64 Nuclei: The &nu;p Process.'' In: ''Physical Review Letters'', Vol. 96, 2006, article 142502. ( {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.142502}})</ref>

=== Possible synthesis sites ===

==== Core-collapse supernovae ====
Massive [[star]]s end their life in a [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernova]]. In such a supernova, a shockfront from an explosion runs from the center of the star through its outer layers and ejects these. When the shockfront reaches the O/Ne-shell of the star (see also [[stellar evolution]]), the conditions for a γ-process are reached for 1-2 s.

Although the majority of p-nuclei can be made in this way, some [[mass number|mass]] regions of p-nuclei turn out to be problematic in model calculations. It has been known already for decades that p-nuclei with mass numbers {{nowrap|A &lt; 100}} cannot be produced in a γ-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"woosley\" /> Modern simulations also show problems in the range {{nowrap|150 ≤ A ≤ 165}}.<ref name=\"posnic2010\" /><ref name=\"rhhw\">T. Rauscher, A. Heger, R. D. Hoffman, S. E. Woosley: ''Nucleosynthesis in Massive Stars with Improved Nuclear and Stellar Physics.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 576, 2002, p. 323-348. ( {{doi|10.1086/341728}})</ref>

The p-nucleus <sup>138</sup>La is not produced in the γ-process but it can be made in a ν-process. A hot [[neutron star]] is made in the center of such a core-collapse supernova and it radiates neutrinos with high intensity. The neutrinos interact also with the outer layers of the exploding star and cause nuclear reactions which create <sup>138</sup>La, among other nuclei.<ref name=\"nu-process\" /><ref name=\"rhhw\" /> Also <sup>180m</sup>Ta may receive a contribution from this ν-process.

It was suggested<ref name=\"nup-process\" /> to supplement the γ-process in the outer layers of the star by another process, occurring in the deepest layers of the star, close to the neutron star but still being ejected instead of falling onto the neutron star surface. Due to the initially high flow of neutrinos from the forming neutron star, these layers become extremely proton-rich through the reaction {{nowrap|{{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} → {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}}}. Although the anti-neutrino flux is initially weaker a few neutrons will be created, nevertheless, because of the large number of protons. This allows a ''&nu;p-process'' in these deep layers. Because of the short timescale of the explosion and the high [[Coulomb barrier]] of the heavier nuclei, such a νp-process could possibly only produce the lightest p-nuclei. Which nuclei are made and how much of them depends sensitively on many details in the simulations and also on the actual explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova, which still is not completely understood.<ref name=\"nup-process\" /><ref name=\"nup-process2\">C. Fröhlich, et al.: ''Composition of the Innermost Core-Collapse Supernova Ejecta.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 637, 2006, p. 415-426. ( {{doi|10.1086/498224}})</ref>

==== Thermonuclear supernovae ====

A [[thermonuclear supernova]] is the explosion of a [[white dwarf]] in a [[binary star]] system, triggered by thermonuclear reactions in matter from a companion star [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] on the surface of the white dwarf. The accreted matter is rich in [[hydrogen]] (protons) and [[helium]] ([[Alpha particle|&alpha; particles]]) and becomes hot enough to allow [[nuclear reaction]]s.

A number of models for such explosions are discussed in literature, of which two were explored regarding the prospect of producing p-nuclei. None of these explosions release neutrinos, therefore rendering ν- and νp-process impossible. Conditions required for the rp-process are also not attained.

Details of the possible production of p-nuclei in such supernovae depend sensitively on the composition of the matter accreted from the companion star (the ''seed nuclei'' for all subsequent processes). Since this can change considerably from star to star, all statements and models of p-production in thermonuclear supernovae are prone to large uncertainties.<ref name=\"arnould\" />

===== Type Ia supernovae =====
The consensus model of thermonuclear supernovae postulates that the white dwarf explodes after exceeding the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] by the accretion of matter because the contraction and heating ignites explosive [[carbon burning]] under [[Degenerate matter|degenerate]] conditions. A nuclear burning front runs through the white dwarf from the inside out and tears it apart. Then the outermost layers closely beneath the surface of the white dwarf (containing 0.05 [[solar mass]]es of matter) exhibit the right conditions for a γ-process.<ref name=\"Ia-gamma\">W. M. Howard, S. B. Meyer, S. E. Woosley: ''A new site for the astrophysical gamma-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal Letters'', Vol. 373, 1991, p. L5-L8. ( {{doi|10.1086/186038}})</ref>

The p-nuclei are made in the same way as in the γ-process in core-collapse supernovae and also the same difficulties are encountered. In addition, <sup>138</sup>La and <sup>180m</sup>Ta are not produced. A variation of the seed abundances by assuming increased [[s-process]] abundances only scales the abundances of the resulting p-nuclei without curing the problems of relative underproduction in the nuclear mass ranges given above.<ref name=\"arnould\" />

===== subChandrasekhar supernovae =====
In a subclass of [[type Ia supernova]]e, the so-called '''subChandrasekhar supernova''', the white dwarf may explode long before it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit because nuclear reactions in the accreted matter can already heat the white dwarf during its accretion phase and trigger explosive carbon burning prematurely. Helium-rich accretion favors this type of explosion. [[Helium burning]] ignites degeneratively on the bottom of the accreted helium layer and causes two shockfronts. The one running inwards ignites the carbon explosion. The outwards moving front heats the outer layers of the white dwarf and ejects them. Again, these outer layers are site to a γ-process at temperatures of 2-3 GK. Due to the presence of α particles (helium nuclei), however, additional nuclear reactions become possible. Among those are such which release a large number of neutrons, such as <sup>18</sup>O(α,n)<sup>21</sup>Ne, <sup>22</sup>Ne(α,n)<sup>25</sup>Mg, and <sup>26</sup>Mg(α,n)<sup>29</sup>Si. This allows a ''pn-process'' in that part of the outer layers which experiences temperatures above 3 GK.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"pn-proc\" />

Those light p-nuclei which are underproduced in the γ-process can be so efficiently made in the pn-process that they even show much larger abundances than the other p-nuclei. To obtain the observed solar relative abundances, a strongly enhanced [[s-process]] seed (by factors of 100-1000 or more) has to be assumed which increases the yield of heavy p-nuclei from the γ-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"pn-proc\" />

==== Neutron stars in binary star systems ====
{{Main article|rp-process}}
A [[neutron star]] in a [[binary star]] system can also accrete matter from the companion star on its surface. Combined [[hydrogen burning|hydrogen]] and [[helium burning]] ignites when the accreted layer of [[degenerate matter]] reaches a density of
{{nowrap|{{val|e=5}}–{{val|e=6}} g/cm<sup>3</sup>}} and a temperature exceeding {{val|0.2|u=GK}}. This leads to [[thermonuclear]] burning comparable to what happens in the outwards moving shockfront of subChandrasekhar supernovae. The neutron star itself is not affected by the explosion and therefore the nuclear reactions in the accreted layer can proceed longer than in an explosion. This allows to establish an rp-process. It will continue until either all free protons are used up or the burning layer has expanded due to the increase in temperature and its density falls below the one required for the nuclear reactions.<ref name=\"schatz\" />

It was shown that the properties of [[X-ray burster|X-ray bursts]] in the [[Milky Way]] can be explained by an rp-process on the surface of accreting neutron stars.<ref name=\"x-bursts\">S. E. Woosley, et al.: ''Models for Type I X-Ray Bursts with Improved Nuclear Physics.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal Supplement'', Vol. 151, 2004, p. 75-102. ( {{doi|10.1086/381553}})</ref> It remains unclear, yet, whether matter (and if, how much matter) can be ejected and escape the [[gravitational field]] of the neutron star. Only if this is the case can such objects be considered as possible sources of p-nuclei. Even if this is corroborated, the demonstrated endpoint of the rp-process limits the production to the light p-nuclei (which are underproduced in core-collapse supernovae).<ref name=\"rp-end\" />

==History==

===Beginnings in late 1970s===
In 1976, [[Frank Agrama]] began selling broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to his friend, former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi|Silvio Berlusconi's]] [[Mediaset]] media company. In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>  
In 1983, Agrama founded Harmony Gold USA. He later also became the Los Angeles commercial representative of another of Chan's companies, Wiltshire Trading.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===The 1980s: notable projects===

====''Shaka Zulu'' (1983–1986)====
In late 1983, Agrama negotiated a deal with the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC) to distribute the controversial ''[[Shaka Zulu (TV series)|Shaka Zulu]]'' miniseries<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |work=Remembered |date=30 May 2013 |title=Remembering Shaka Zulu |accessdate=2015-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233031/http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |archivedate=8 December 2015}}</ref> in spite of the economic sanctions at the time.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/entertainment/ca-14929_1_shaka-zulu 'Shaka Zulu': Negative Metaphor For South African Blacks], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 21, 1986</ref> The planned 10-episode [[miniseries]] was based on the story of the king of the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]], [[Shaka]] (reigned 1816 to 1828), and the writings of the British [[Merchant|traders]] with whom he interacted.

Throughout 1984 and 1985, the original budget of about $1.75 million escalated quickly to $12 million, and the SABC justified the outlay to anticipated returns to be earned on the international market. Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.

''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>

====''Robotech'' (1985)====
In the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:

#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''
#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>

Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.

===Late 1980s to early 2000s===
In 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.

In 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].

From 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.

===2000s and beyond===
Harmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.

In August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.

==Legal problems==

Harmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.

===Mediaset conviction===
On November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>

On October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.

===Mediatrade acquittal===

In October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>

According to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.

Prosecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>

On July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}</ref> An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.<ref name=\"afr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l’appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped.

==Legal issues regarding ''Macross'' copyright==
Harmony Gold, via its license of ''[[Robotech]]'', is the co-copyright owner in the US for images of mecha from the component series of the show, ''[[Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', ''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'', and ''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''. They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.

Most notably, many early designs used in ''[[BattleTech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of BattleTech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.

Harmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray ’mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I. Joe vs. Transformers: The Epic Conclusion\" violated their copyright license and trademarks on the animated Japanese ''[[Macross]]'' TV series (1982–84).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|title=HARMONY GOLD USA, INC vs HASBRO|work=www.courthousenews.com|accessdate=April 29, 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014085251/http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|archivedate=October 14, 2013}}</ref>  On September 23, 2013, Harmony Gold's suit against Hasbro was dismissed with prejudice, and Hasbro was allowed to continue to sell the sets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-17/harmony-gold-usa-v-hasbro-case-dismissed | title = Harmony Gold USA v. Hasbro Case Dismissed|work=www.animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}</ref>

The legal status of Harmony Gold's license to ''Macross'' was dubious. Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property.

In November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber MOSPEADA'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to ''Macross'' and its trademark for the ''Macross'' series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these was set to take place ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmony Gold's Macross, Mospeada, Southern Cross Licenses Still Expire in 2021|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-14/harmony-gold-macross-mospeada-southern-cross-licenses-still-expire-in-2021/.121372|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>

On July 5, 2019, Harmony Gold confirmed that their license with Tatsunoko had been renewed again, extending their ownership of the ''Macross'' franchise's co-copyright past the original 2021 expiration date. While a specific number of years wasn't given for the length of this extension, Harmony Gold chairman Frank Agrama stated that the company will \"look forward to the next 35 years of working with Tatsunoko and world class business partners on ''Robotech''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Robotech/Macross License Has Been Extended (Exclusive)|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/robotech/282027/the-robotechmacross-license-has-been-extended-exclusive|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=5 July 2019|date=5 July 2019}}</ref>

==Search for the Dragon Ball Harmony Gold Dub==
The dub was lost since it first aired in December 1989 or January 1990 on [[WWJ-TV|WGPR 62]] and [[WMYD|WXON 20]] in [[Detroit]]. It was made aware in a 2000 issue of ''[[Animerica]]'', before [[Funimation]] acquired the rights to the franchise. The search went on for two decades after the ''Animerica'' article until a user named Tom_Servo founded an individual on the Kazenshuu forums who taped it during the television premiere. Tom_Servo eventually uploaded the tapes of the 2 films from the individual on February 21 and of the first five episodes on March 1st on the [[Internet Archive]]. The dub is infamous for changing the names of the characters.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Previously Lost First Episode of Original Harmony Gold Dragon Ball English Dub Recently Unearthed by Fans!|url=https://www.themix.net/2020/02/previously-lost-first-episode-of-original-harmony-gold-dragon-ball-english-dub-recently-unearthed-by-fans/|last=Baculi|first=Spencer|date=February 21, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020|work=The Mix}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Remaining Episodes of Harmony Gold’s Lost English Dragon Ball Dub Discovered and Archived by Fan|url=https://boundingintocomics.com/2020/03/03/remaining-episodes-of-harmony-golds-lost-english-dragon-ball-dub-discovered-and-archived-by-fan/|last=Baculi|first=Spencer|date=March 3, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020|work=Bounding Into Comics}}</ref>

Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.

In addition to its distribution and production interests, Harmony Gold manages several [[real estate]] properties in the Southern California area. They also operate a screening room in Los Angeles.

==History==

===Beginnings in late 1970s===
In 1976, [[Frank Agrama]] began selling broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to his friend, former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi|Silvio Berlusconi's]] [[Mediaset]] media company. In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>  
In 1983, Agrama founded Harmony Gold USA. He later also became the Los Angeles commercial representative of another of Chan's companies, Wiltshire Trading.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===The 1980s: notable projects===

====''Shaka Zulu'' (1983–1986)====
In late 1983, Agrama negotiated a deal with the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC) to distribute the controversial ''[[Shaka Zulu (TV series)|Shaka Zulu]]'' miniseries<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |work=Remembered |date=30 May 2013 |title=Remembering Shaka Zulu |accessdate=2015-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233031/http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |archivedate=8 December 2015}}</ref> in spite of the economic sanctions at the time.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/entertainment/ca-14929_1_shaka-zulu 'Shaka Zulu': Negative Metaphor For South African Blacks], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 21, 1986</ref> The planned 10-episode [[miniseries]] was based on the story of the king of the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]], [[Shaka]] (reigned 1816 to 1828), and the writings of the British [[Merchant|traders]] with whom he interacted.

Throughout 1984 and 1985, the original budget of about $1.75 million escalated quickly to $12 million, and the SABC justified the outlay to anticipated returns to be earned on the international market. Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.

''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>

====''Robotech'' (1985)====
In the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:

#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''
#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>

Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.

===Late 1980s to early 2000s===
In 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.

In 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].

From 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.

===2000s and beyond===
Harmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.

In August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.

==Legal problems==

Harmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.

===Mediaset conviction===
On November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>

On October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.

===Mediatrade acquittal===

In October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>

According to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.

Prosecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>

On July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}</ref> An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.<ref name=\"afr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l’appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped.

==Legal issues regarding ''Macross'' copyright==
Harmony Gold, via its license of ''[[Robotech]]'', is the co-copyright owner in the US for images of mecha from the component series of the show, ''[[Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', ''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'', and ''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''. They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.

Most notably, many early designs used in ''[[BattleTech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of BattleTech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.

Harmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray ’mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I. Joe vs. Transformers: The Epic Conclusion\" violated their copyright license and trademarks on the animated Japanese ''[[Macross]]'' TV series (1982–84).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|title=HARMONY GOLD USA, INC vs HASBRO|work=www.courthousenews.com|accessdate=April 29, 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014085251/http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|archivedate=October 14, 2013}}</ref>  On September 23, 2013, Harmony Gold's suit against Hasbro was dismissed with prejudice, and Hasbro was allowed to continue to sell the sets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-17/harmony-gold-usa-v-hasbro-case-dismissed | title = Harmony Gold USA v. Hasbro Case Dismissed|work=www.animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}</ref>

The legal status of Harmony Gold's license to ''Macross'' was dubious. Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property.

In November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber MOSPEADA'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to ''Macross'' and its trademark for the ''Macross'' series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these was set to take place ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmony Gold's Macross, Mospeada, Southern Cross Licenses Still Expire in 2021|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-14/harmony-gold-macross-mospeada-southern-cross-licenses-still-expire-in-2021/.121372|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>

On July 5, 2019, Harmony Gold confirmed that their license with Tatsunoko had been renewed again, extending their ownership of the ''Macross'' franchise's co-copyright past the original 2021 expiration date. While a specific number of years wasn't given for the length of this extension, Harmony Gold chairman Frank Agrama stated that the company will \"look forward to the next 35 years of working with Tatsunoko and world class business partners on ''Robotech''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Robotech/Macross License Has Been Extended (Exclusive)|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/robotech/282027/the-robotechmacross-license-has-been-extended-exclusive|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=5 July 2019|date=5 July 2019}}</ref>

==Search for the Dragon Ball Harmony Gold Dub==
The dub was lost since it first aired in December 1989 or January 1990 on [[WWJ-TV|WGPR 62]] and [[WMYD|WXON 20]] in [[Detroit]]. It was made aware in a 2000 issue of [[Animerica]], before [[Funimation]] acquired the rights to the franchise.  The search went on for two decades after the Animerica article until a user named Tom_Servo founded an individual on the Kazenshuu forums who taped it during the television premiere. Tom_Servo eventually uploaded the tapes of the 2 films from the individual on February 21 and of the first five episodes on March 1st on the [[Internet Archive]]. The dub is infamous for changing the names of the characters.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Previously Lost First Episode of Original Harmony Gold Dragon Ball English Dub Recently Unearthed by Fans!|url=https://www.themix.net/2020/02/previously-lost-first-episode-of-original-harmony-gold-dragon-ball-english-dub-recently-unearthed-by-fans/|last=Baculi|first=Spencer|date=February 21, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020|work=The Mix}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Remaining Episodes of Harmony Gold’s Lost English Dragon Ball Dub Discovered and Archived by Fan|url=https://boundingintocomics.com/2020/03/03/remaining-episodes-of-harmony-golds-lost-english-dragon-ball-dub-discovered-and-archived-by-fan/|last=Baculi|first=Spencer|date=March 3, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020|work=Bounding Into Comics}}</ref>

==Alternative names: MasterVision==
Harmony Gold was known in the [[United Kingdom]] as MasterVision in the VHS pre-certs sector. They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.

'''Harmony Gold USA, Inc.''' is an American film and television production company. It was founded in 1983 by [[Egypt]]ian-born [[Frank Agrama]] and is managed by his daughter, Jehan F. Agrama.

In 1976, Agrama sold broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to the [[Mediaset]] media conglomerate.<ref>{{cite web

The company worked closely with Intersound, a Los Angeles-based [[Recording studio|post-production recording studio]], managed by Frank's son, Ahmed Agrama. They were responsible for partially dubbing ''[[Dragon Ball]]'',<ref>{{cite web

In addition to its distribution and production interests, Harmony Gold manages several [[real estate]] properties in the Southern California area. They also operate a screening room in Los Angeles.

==History==

===Beginnings in late 1970s===
In 1976, [[Frank Agrama]] began selling broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to his friend, former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi|Silvio Berlusconi's]] [[Mediaset]] media company. In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>  
In 1983, Agrama founded Harmony Gold USA. He later also became the Los Angeles commercial representative of another of Chan's companies, Wiltshire Trading.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===The 1980s: notable projects===

====''Shaka Zulu'' (1983–1986)====
In late 1983, Agrama negotiated a deal with the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC) to distribute the controversial ''[[Shaka Zulu (TV series)|Shaka Zulu]]'' miniseries<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |work=Remembered |date=30 May 2013 |title=Remembering Shaka Zulu |accessdate=2015-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233031/http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |archivedate=8 December 2015}}</ref> in spite of the economic sanctions at the time.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/entertainment/ca-14929_1_shaka-zulu 'Shaka Zulu': Negative Metaphor For South African Blacks], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 21, 1986</ref> The planned 10-episode [[miniseries]] was based on the story of the king of the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]], [[Shaka]] (reigned 1816 to 1828), and the writings of the British [[Merchant|traders]] with whom he interacted.

Throughout 1984 and 1985, the original budget of about $1.75 million escalated quickly to $12 million, and the SABC justified the outlay to anticipated returns to be earned on the international market. Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.

''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>

====''Robotech'' (1985)====
In the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:

#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''
#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>

Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.

===Late 1980s to early 2000s===
In 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.

In 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].

From 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.

===2000s and beyond===
Harmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.

In August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.

==Legal problems==

Harmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.

===Mediaset conviction===
On November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>

On October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.

===Mediatrade acquittal===

In October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>

According to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.

Prosecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>

On July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}</ref> An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.<ref name=\"afr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l’appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped.

==Legal issues regarding ''Macross'' copyright==
Harmony Gold, via its license of ''[[Robotech]]'', is the co-copyright owner in the US for images of mecha from the component series of the show, ''[[Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', ''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'', and ''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''. They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.

Most notably, many early designs used in ''[[BattleTech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of BattleTech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.

Harmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray ’mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I. Joe vs. Transformers: The Epic Conclusion\" violated their copyright license and trademarks on the animated Japanese ''[[Macross]]'' TV series (1982–84).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|title=HARMONY GOLD USA, INC vs HASBRO|work=www.courthousenews.com|accessdate=April 29, 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014085251/http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|archivedate=October 14, 2013}}</ref>  On September 23, 2013, Harmony Gold's suit against Hasbro was dismissed with prejudice, and Hasbro was allowed to continue to sell the sets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-17/harmony-gold-usa-v-hasbro-case-dismissed | title = Harmony Gold USA v. Hasbro Case Dismissed|work=www.animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}</ref>

The legal status of Harmony Gold's license to ''Macross'' was dubious. Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property.

In November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber MOSPEADA'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to ''Macross'' and its trademark for the ''Macross'' series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these was set to take place ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmony Gold's Macross, Mospeada, Southern Cross Licenses Still Expire in 2021|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-14/harmony-gold-macross-mospeada-southern-cross-licenses-still-expire-in-2021/.121372|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>

On July 5, 2019, Harmony Gold confirmed that their license with Tatsunoko had been renewed again, extending their ownership of the ''Macross'' franchise's co-copyright past the original 2021 expiration date. While a specific number of years wasn't given for the length of this extension, Harmony Gold chairman Frank Agrama stated that the company will \"look forward to the next 35 years of working with Tatsunoko and world class business partners on ''Robotech''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Robotech/Macross License Has Been Extended (Exclusive)|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/robotech/282027/the-robotechmacross-license-has-been-extended-exclusive|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=5 July 2019|date=5 July 2019}}</ref>

==Search for the Dragon Ball Harmony Gold Dub==
The dub was lost since it first aired in December 1989 or January 1990 on [[WWJ-TV|WGPR 62]] and [[WMYD|WXON 20]] in [[Detroit]]. It was made aware in a 2000 issue of [[Animerica]], before [[Funimation]] acquired the rights to the franchise.  The search went on for two decades after the Animerica article until a user named Tom_Servo founded an individual on the Kazenshuu forums who taped it during the television premiere. Tom_Servo eventually uploaded the tapes of the 2 films from the individual on February 21 and of the first five episodes on March 1st on the [[Internet Archive]]. The dub is infamous for changing the names of the characters.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Previously Lost First Episode of Original Harmony Gold Dragon Ball English Dub Recently Unearthed by Fans!|url=https://www.themix.net/2020/02/previously-lost-first-episode-of-original-harmony-gold-dragon-ball-english-dub-recently-unearthed-by-fans/|last=Baculi|first=Spencer|date=February 21, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020|work=The Mix}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Remaining Episodes of Harmony Gold’s Lost English Dragon Ball Dub Discovered and Archived by Fan|url=https://boundingintocomics.com/2020/03/03/remaining-episodes-of-harmony-golds-lost-english-dragon-ball-dub-discovered-and-archived-by-fan/|last=Baculi|first=Spencer|date=March 3, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020|work=Bounding Into Comics}}</ref>

==Alternative names: MasterVision==
Harmony Gold was known in the [[United Kingdom]] as MasterVision in the VHS pre-certs sector. They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.

'''Harmony Gold USA, Inc.''' is an American film and television production company. It was founded in 1983 by [[Egypt]]ian-born [[Frank Agrama]] and is managed by his daughter, Jehan F. Agrama.

In 1976, Agrama sold broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to the [[Mediaset]] media conglomerate.<ref>{{cite web

The company worked closely with Intersound, a Los Angeles-based [[Recording studio|post-production recording studio]], managed by Frank's son, Ahmed Agrama. They were responsible for partially dubbing ''[[Dragon Ball]]'',<ref>{{cite web

In addition to its distribution and production interests, Harmony Gold manages several [[real estate]] properties in the Southern California area. They also operate a screening room in Los Angeles.

==History==

===Beginnings in late 1970s===
In 1976, [[Frank Agrama]] began selling broadcast rights from [[Paramount Pictures]] to his friend, former Italian Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi|Silvio Berlusconi's]] [[Mediaset]] media company. In the late 1970s, Agrama, while in a trade fair in [[Cannes]], [[France]], met [[Hong Kong]] [[entrepreneur]]s Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun. The three agreed to form a collaboration to trade movie rights internationally. Chan set up Hong Kong-based company Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, while Agrama set up Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>  
In 1983, Agrama founded Harmony Gold USA. He later also became the Los Angeles commercial representative of another of Chan's companies, Wiltshire Trading.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}

===The 1980s: notable projects===

====''Shaka Zulu'' (1983–1986)====
In late 1983, Agrama negotiated a deal with the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] (SABC) to distribute the controversial ''[[Shaka Zulu (TV series)|Shaka Zulu]]'' miniseries<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |work=Remembered |date=30 May 2013 |title=Remembering Shaka Zulu |accessdate=2015-11-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208233031/http://remembered.co.za/shaka-kasenzangakhona-31 |archivedate=8 December 2015}}</ref> in spite of the economic sanctions at the time.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1986-11-21/entertainment/ca-14929_1_shaka-zulu 'Shaka Zulu': Negative Metaphor For South African Blacks], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 21, 1986</ref> The planned 10-episode [[miniseries]] was based on the story of the king of the [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]], [[Shaka]] (reigned 1816 to 1828), and the writings of the British [[Merchant|traders]] with whom he interacted.

Throughout 1984 and 1985, the original budget of about $1.75 million escalated quickly to $12 million, and the SABC justified the outlay to anticipated returns to be earned on the international market. Frank Agrama, however, noted the production was a \"calculated gamble.\" ''Shaka Zulu'' had in fact, become the most expensive miniseries ever produced for television syndicate in the United States without pre-commitment to network or operation time to date. To ensure its marketability, Harmony Gold demanded that the well known white 'stars' appeared in the first episode to satisfy US advertisers, contrary to original script.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/archive/history-south-africa-alternative-visions-and-practices-joshua-brown|title=History from South Africa: Alternative Visions and Practices, page 301|publisher=Joshua Brown|date=1991}}</ref> The SABC's involvement was also completely removed for its international release due to legal implications set by [[apartheid]]. The opening credits featured Harmony Gold, with Frank Agrama listed as associate producer.

''Shaka Zulu'' went on to become a massive success worldwide, and has developed a [[cult following]] since its premiere in 1986. It has been the most repeatedly screened miniseries ever shown on syndicated television in the [[United States]]. By 1992, it had been seen by over 350 million viewers. The series dislodged John Marshall's ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'' and the later ''[[The Gods Must be Crazy]]'' film series as the prime shaper of American perceptions of 'tribal' history in Southern Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tlweb.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/screeningthepast/firstrelease/fr0703/ktfr15.html|title=Shaka Zulu and visual constructions of history|publisher=Screening the Past|date=30 June 2003}}</ref> Despite its success, the SABC failed to recoup the cost of their production due to unfair terms negotiated by Harmony Gold during production.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://camerainthesun.com/?p=25727|title=Joshua Sinclair on Shaka Zulu and apartheid|publisher=Camera in the Sun|date=September 2013}}</ref>

====''Robotech'' (1985)====
In the mid 1980s, Harmony Gold hired [[Carl Macek]] to adapt [[Japan]]ese animated programming for American broadcast release. Macek originally wanted to adapt ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' only, but was instead forced to combine it with two other [[anime]] series together, even though they had no relation to Macross. These three series became ''[[Robotech]]''. The other two series used are:

#''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]''
#''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''<ref>(NOTE: ''[[Super Dimension Century Orguss]]'' was originally planned to be used as the third \"season\" after ''Macross'' & ''Southern Cross''. However, that plan was scrapped due to right issues, which resulted in its replacement by ''MOSPEADA''. Additionally, both Mospeada, and Orguss predate Southern Cross)</ref>

Harmony Gold's cited reasoning for combining these unrelated series was its decision to market ''Macross'' for American weekday syndication television, which required a minimum of 65 episodes at the time (thirteen weeks at five episodes per week). ''Macross'' and the two other series each had fewer episodes than required, since they originally aired in Japan as weekly series. The production was successful enough to merit an American produced movie and a spin-off, ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]''. Due to unforeseen economic circumstances, production was cancelled.

===Late 1980s to early 2000s===
In 1988, after the cancellation of ''[[Robotech II: The Sentinels]]'', a number of the staff were recruited to work at [[Saban Entertainment]]. Carl Macek, along with his friend [[Jerry Beck]] went on to found [[Streamline Pictures]]. Meanwhile, Harmony Gold began moving away from production and began focusing more on film distribution, dot-com ventures and real estate.

In 1998, Harmony Gold came under some scrutiny by several media executives for their role as a 'middleman' selling Paramount Pictures distribution rights to [[Mediaset]].

From 1999 to the early 2000s, the company began reverting to film production once again. They partnered with [[Netter Digital]] and hired [[Carl Macek]] to write ''[[Robotech 3000]]'', which would have been an American produced spinoff of the original series. A promotional trailer was screened at the 2000 [[FanimeCon]] anime convention, and was widely panned by fans. [[Tatsunoko Production]]s attempted to salvage the project, to no avail.

===2000s and beyond===
Harmony Gold began heavily pushing ''Robotech'', first by releasing the series via a partnership with [[A.D. Vision|ADV Films]] in the US, and [[Manga Entertainment]] in the UK. In 2006, they partnered with [[Funimation|FUNimation Entertainment]] to release the American produced ''[[Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles]]'' on home video.

In August 2014, Harmony Gold released their first direct-to-video live-action feature in over a decade, ''The Big Goofy Secret of Hidden Pines''. Directed by Henri Charr, the film revolves around the comedic antics of two vacationers after they stumble upon Bigfoot.

==Legal problems==

Harmony Gold and its founder, Frank Agrama, have had an extensive history of legal troubles beginning in the early 2000s. Italian investigators discovered and froze bank accounts in Switzerland; five belonging to Agrama. According to another Italian daily, the ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the five accounts are said to contain SFr140 million ($109.5 million). This early investigation led to two high-profile trials.

===Mediaset conviction===
On November 29, 2006, federal agents raided Agrama's home and offices in connection with Italy's ongoing tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting investigation of its former Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. Court documents revealed the recent search by FBI agents centered on Italian allegations that Agrama, Berlusconi and others fraudulently inflated the price of television rights originally purchased by Agrama so that millions of dollars in kickbacks could be paid to executives of Berlusconi's [[Mediaset]] media empire.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/29/local/me-agrama29|title=Federal agents search producer's home, office|language=English|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=29 November 2006}}</ref>

On October 26, 2012, Agrama was convicted after a lengthy [[Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi#Mediaset television and cinema rights .28false accounting.2C embezzlement and tax fraud.29|trial]] involving the buying and selling of US film rights to the Mediaset media company at inflated prices.<ref name=\"bbcfraud\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|title=Silvio Berlusconi sentenced for tax fraud | work=BBC News | date=26 October 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140207101452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20102215|archivedate=7 February 2014}}</ref> As his age exceeded 70 years, he was exempted from direct imprisonment and served no actual jail time. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', on November 21, 2006 prosecutors in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] charged Agrama, along with Berlusconi and ten others, in a trial over tax fraud, embezzlement and false accounting at Mediaset.

===Mediatrade acquittal===

In October 2011, Paddy Chan Mei-yiu and Katherine Hsu May-chun, along with nine others (including Frank Agrama and [[Pier Silvio Berlusconi]], son of Silvio Berlusconi), were indicted by a Milan court and charged with buying rights for US television series and movies, then reselling them to broadcasting rights firm Mediatrade (a subsidiary of Mediaset) at inflated prices and laundering the money in a complex scheme. The four companies allegedly involved in this scheme were Wiltshire Trading, Harmony Gold, CS Secretaries and Loong Po Management.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mediaset-mediatrade-idUSKBN0E21FH20140522#DvRYAqYgWZjC0iay.97|title=Hong Kong set to hand over Berlusconi-related evidence|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=7 June 2013}}</ref>

According to prosecutors, Chan met Agrama in [[Cannes]], [[France]] in the late 1970s at a trade fair and they decided to form a partnership to trade movie rights internationally. Chan organized a Hong Kong-based Harmony Gold Limited in 1979, records from the city's Companies Registry show. In the same year, Agrama organized Agrama Film Enterprises on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. Four years later, he set up Harmony Gold. He later also became the Los Angeles representative of another Hong Kong company established by Chan, Wiltshire Trading.

Prosecutors estimated the illicit profits between 1988 and 1999 amounted to US$170 million. Earlier in 2005, Swiss investigators froze 150 million francs (HK$1.29 billion) at a UBS branch in Lugano belonging to Harmony Gold, Wiltshire Trading and other companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1324781/italian-prosecutors-say-hong-kong-women-were-key-massive-money|title=Italian prosecutors say Hong Kong women were key to a massive money-laundering scheme|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=22 May 2014}}</ref>

On July 24, 2014, [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] reported that some of the charges have been dropped due to expiring [[statute of limitations]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117957401.html?categoryid=22&cs=1 | title=Judge throws out some Berlusconi charges | author=Nick Vivarelli | work=Variety | accessdate=2015-12-11 | date=2014}}</ref> An appeals hearing was set to take place January 20, 2016.<ref name=\"afr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.e-duesse.it/News/Televisione/Mediatrade-il-20-gennaio-inizia-l-appello-195937|work=e-duesse|date=November 9, 2015|title=Mediatrade, il 20 gennaio inizia l’appello|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref> On January 18, 2016, all charges against Frank Agrama and five other people were dropped.

==Legal issues regarding ''Macross'' copyright==
Harmony Gold, via its license of ''[[Robotech]]'', is the co-copyright owner in the US for images of mecha from the component series of the show, ''[[Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'', ''[[Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross]]'', and ''[[Genesis Climber MOSPEADA]]''. They have pursued multiple lawsuits against anyone using mecha which even vaguely resemble these designs.

Most notably, many early designs used in ''[[Battletech]]'', such as the ''Warhammer'', ''Valkyrie'', and ''Marauder'', were licensed directly from the Japanese producers of ''Macross'', with the overlapping rights mistake not being realized for nearly a decade. Harmony Gold sued [[FASA]], and as a result these designs were removed from the game. Fan outcry over 'The Unseen' has led to multiple attempts to negotiate deals allowing for resumed use of the designs, but despite in one case a sourcebook going to press before being abruptly pulled, no deal has ever been reached. As a result of the failed negotiations, the producers of Battletech ruled that any designs not developed in house would no longer be used in order to avoid future issues.

Harmony Gold issued cease and desist orders against sites displaying images and trailers from the deceased video game MechWarrior, due to one of the mechs used in the trailer being a ''Warhammer''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/5352295/mechwarrior-5-runs-into-legal-trouble | title=Mechwarrior 5 Runs Into Legal Trouble | author=Luke Plunkett | work=Kotaku | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-05}}</ref>  The company claims that the images portray ’mechs that they own the rights to, according to a legal settlement from 1996.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | title=Harmony Gold USA vs FASA | author=UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS, EASTERN DIVISION | work=Legal Filing | year=1996 | accessdate=2009-09-05 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903213803/http://alex.kaempen.org/harmony_gold_v._fasa.html | archive-date=2012-09-03 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2013, Harmony Gold claimed in Federal Court that [[Hasbro]]'s [[San Diego Comic-Con International|SDCC 2013]] exclusive set \"G.I. Joe vs. Transformers: The Epic Conclusion\" violated their copyright license and trademarks on the animated Japanese ''[[Macross]]'' TV series (1982–84).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|title=HARMONY GOLD USA, INC vs HASBRO|work=www.courthousenews.com|accessdate=April 29, 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014085251/http://courthousenews.com/2013/07/23/Transformers.pdf|archivedate=October 14, 2013}}</ref>  On September 23, 2013, Harmony Gold's suit against Hasbro was dismissed with prejudice, and Hasbro was allowed to continue to sell the sets.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-10-17/harmony-gold-usa-v-hasbro-case-dismissed | title = Harmony Gold USA v. Hasbro Case Dismissed|work=www.animenewsnetwork.com|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}</ref>

The legal status of Harmony Gold's license to ''Macross'' was dubious. Harmony Gold's license for ''Macross'' came from [[Tatsunoko Production]], but Japanese courts ruled that it was [[Studio Nue]] (creators of the series) that controls the ''Macross'' intellectual property. The license Tatsunoko was given was for international distribution outside Japan only, and does not allow them to control the intellectual property.

In November 2016, Harmony Gold initiated arbitration against Tatsunoko, to which Tatsunoko responded with counterclaims.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knaub|first1=Kelly|title=Judge OKs Production Co.'s $850K Award In License Dispute - Law360|url=https://www.law360.com/articles/957616/judge-oks-production-co-s-850k-award-in-license-dispute|website=Law360|accessdate=19 September 2017|location=New York|date=August 25, 2017}}</ref> With the exception of the original visual depictions of 41 characters, which are owned by [[Big West Advertising]] not Tatsunoko, the arbitrator found that Harmony Gold had the rights to ''Super Dimension Fortress Macross'', ''Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross'', and ''Genesis Climber MOSPEADA'' until their expiry on March 14, 2021, as per the licensing agreement. Harmony Gold also holds several trademarks related to ''Macross'' and its trademark for the ''Macross'' series was renewed on December 26, 2012. The expiration date for these was set to take place ten years from that date, on December 26, 2022.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harmony Gold's Macross, Mospeada, Southern Cross Licenses Still Expire in 2021|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-09-14/harmony-gold-macross-mospeada-southern-cross-licenses-still-expire-in-2021/.121372|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=19 September 2017|date=14 September 2017}}</ref>

On July 5, 2019, Harmony Gold confirmed that their license with Tatsunoko had been renewed again, extending their ownership of the ''Macross'' franchise's co-copyright past the original 2021 expiration date. While a specific number of years wasn't given for the length of this extension, Harmony Gold chairman Frank Agrama stated that the company will \"look forward to the next 35 years of working with Tatsunoko and world class business partners on ''Robotech''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Robotech/Macross License Has Been Extended (Exclusive)|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/robotech/282027/the-robotechmacross-license-has-been-extended-exclusive|website=Den of Geek|accessdate=5 July 2019|date=5 July 2019}}</ref>

==Search for the Dragon Ball Harmony Gold Dub==
The dub was lost since it first aired in December 1989 or January 1990 on [[WWJ-TV|WGPR 62]] and [[WMYD|WXON 20]] in [[Detroit]]. It was made aware in a 2000 issue of [[Animerica]], before [[Funimation]] acquired the rights to the franchise.  The search went on for two decades after the Animerica article until a user named Tom_Servo founded an individual on the Kazenshuu forums who taped it during the television premiere. Tom_Servo eventually uploaded the tapes of the 2 films from the individual on February 21 and of the first five episodes on March 1st on the [[Internet Archive]]. The dub is infamous for changing the names of the characters.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Previously Lost First Episode of Original Harmony Gold Dragon Ball English Dub Recently Unearthed by Fans!|url=https://www.themix.net/2020/02/previously-lost-first-episode-of-original-harmony-gold-dragon-ball-english-dub-recently-unearthed-by-fans/|last=Baculi|first=Spencer|date=February 21, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020|work=The Mix}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Remaining Episodes of Harmony Gold’s Lost English Dragon Ball Dub Discovered and Archived by Fan|url=https://boundingintocomics.com/2020/03/03/remaining-episodes-of-harmony-golds-lost-english-dragon-ball-dub-discovered-and-archived-by-fan/|last=Baculi|first=Spencer|date=March 3, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020|work=Bounding Into Comics}}</ref>

==Alternative names: MasterVision==
Harmony Gold was known in the [[United Kingdom]] as MasterVision in the VHS pre-certs sector. They released the same films on another UK label Kids Cartoon Collection for the home market during the 1985. Finding a MasterVision or Kids Cartoon Collection (a.k.a. Harmony Gold in the UK) is like striking a pot of Harmony Gold, as they were a rare brand of VHS in the UK. Some English dubs by Harmony Gold only made it to the UK under these UK labels of them, ''The Little Train'' was one of their notable UK exclusive English speaking dubs for instance, as there are no signs of any US versions, possibly due to its rare existence in the US. However, this mentioned dub did get a semi US Harmony Gold dub in Mexican in the NTSC region, so it did hit one NTSC dub in the Americas. This notable rare film dub by them was made from footage from a 1980 Italian URBS production instead of their normal fare in Japan using footage by Toei and Tatsunoko. This noted film was released in 1985 by them on both Kids Cartoon Collection and MaserVision, making it one of their first and only UK exclusives, as far as English dubs by them are concerned. These VHS companies by them also released the standard fare from their USA branch, for example ''The Brave Frog'' and ''Robotech'' in the UK.

[[File:Oldloveboat.png|thumb| American and Canadian students arriving by plane to Taiwan in 1967 to attend the first Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour(Currently named Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour), informally known as [[The Love Boat]]. Photo permission provided by Victor Wong and the Chinese Canadian Archive.<ref>[https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/chinese-canadian-archive/ Chinese Canadian Archive Official Website]</ref>]] 

The '''Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour to [[Taiwan]]''', informally known as the '''Love Boat''', is currently a three-week summer program for about 70 to 100 College-aged [[Overseas Chinese]] and [[Overseas Taiwanese]]. In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], it is also colloquially referred to as ''Měi-Jiā-yíng'' (美加營) &ndash; “America and Canada Camp” &ndash;  a reference to the origin of most participants. The program is held at the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://chientan.cyh.org.tw/?lang=en Chientan Youth Activity Center Official Website(Chinese)]</ref>(劍潭) in [[Taipei]] which is not to be confused with [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] subway station.

==Origins of the Study Tour==
[[File:Lb1969c.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1969 Roster Book of the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour.  This would in later years be turned into the annual Study Tour Yearbook. Photo Permission provided by the Chinese Canadian Archive.]]  
The Study Tour program was started in 1967 by the [[China Youth Corps]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080120093946/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=17692&CtNode=118 ''Taiwan National Journal'' article (17 December 1999) on the study tour (English)]</ref> According to the Chinese Canadian Archive,<ref>[https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/local-history-genealogy/2018/03/new-exhibit-unveiled-chinese-canadian-archive.html''Chinese Canadian Archive article'' ]</ref> the original name of the program was the \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour\" and was initially promoted across North America through various local Chinese newspapers by Chinese North Americans with relations to the [[Kuomintang]] party. The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan. This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government's subsidizing of the program was to shore up [[Overseas Chinese]] support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the [[Kuomintang]] for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the [[Overseas Chinese]] community not only for its financing but also for its political support.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23462345?seq=1 Taiwan and Overseas Chinese during the Cold War Era]</ref>  In fact Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]],<ref>[http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=sun_yat-sen.html Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]</ref> the founder of the [[Kuomintang]] as well as the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)]], recognized early the importance of [[Overseas Chinese]] support<ref>[https://www.straight.com/blogra/faces-vancouver-kuomintang-building-chinatown Sun Yat-Sen and Overseas Chinese history]</ref> and went as far as to say that \"Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.<ref>[http://www.heroesofconfederation.com/Sun_Yat_Sen/sun_mission(1).html Sun Yat-Sen acknowledgement of Overseas Chinese]</ref>\"  However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its \"[[Loveboat]]\" reputation of spawning many relationships as well hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.

==Changes from 1967 to 1999==
[[File:Lb1969a.jpg|thumb|Official 1969 Certificate of attendance for the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour. Photo permission provided by [[Jan Wong]] and the Chinese Canadian Archive]]The Study Tour has gone through many changes over the years which correspond with Taiwan's changing politics and economy. After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4271166/_Chinese_American_Transnationalism_Aboard_the_Love_Boat_The_Overseas_Youth_Language_Training_and_Study_Tour_to_the_Republic_of_China_ Chinese American Transnationalism aboard the Loveboat]</ref>, the [[China Youth Corps]] conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25.  According to journalist [[Jan Wong]], a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the [[Shilin District]] near modern day [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] station.  During this time, the [[China Youth Corps]] had changed the name of the Study Tour to become \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,\" to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300–500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in two separate campuses in 1990, one remaining at Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei's [[Tam Kang Campus]].  During this time, and due to the increase in student size, the [[China Youth Corps]] came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission which has since been renamed the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]].

[[File:Chientan.jpg|thumb|Chientan Youth Activity Center]]
This increase in enrolment coincided with both Taiwan's 1987 lifting of [[martial law]] and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island's reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture, improved Chinese language skills and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the National Chinese Community.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/popup.php?x=news3 Direct link to August 3rd, 2004 Toronto Star article \"Finding a Mate Offshore\" by William Lin]</ref> This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of \"Asian American identity\" for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011209130536/http://www.geocities.com/jodeman.geo/loveboat.htm 'A More Complete Description of The Love Boat\" (English)]</ref>  There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common \"Chinese North American Experience\" of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society. This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships.  In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as \"little diplomats.\"  This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters.  This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan.  These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board(excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan Government subsidization, also led to an increased popularity for the trip as most agreed it was an excellent deal. 
[[File:224273 9461070452 3021 n.jpg|thumb|Students sneaking out of Chientan Campus at night to party]]
However, a by-product of the Study Tour's increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child.  Some parents desiring their children to find a \"suitable Chinese spouse\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113166784230094239 The Loveboat Wall Street Journal Article]</ref> sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour.  Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour's [[Love Boat]] reputation for fear of not being allowed to go.  These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other.  All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its [[Love Boat]] nickname and reputation.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/index.php?y=inthenews ''Toronto Star'' 3 August 2004 article on the Study Tour re-published by Click2Asia.  Click2Asia indicates date and source of material (Toronto Star) in this link]</ref> Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. 

[[File:Loveboatclub.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students of the Love Boat enjoying an evening at a Taipei Dance Club]]
The job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local College-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students' itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, trips outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent(in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on insuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the [[China Youth Corps]] only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan Universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with other Western Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as equally life-changing as did the students who attended.

Another prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory [[University]] enrolment with a preference for students in [[Ivy League]] Universities and students in their final year of University and thus near the age limit.  Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhode Scholars as well as Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge.  Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families.  Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe.  Participation had gradually increased from Europe especially from the countries such as England, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.  Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants.  This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among [[Overseas Chinese]] worldwide.
[[File:222318 9461130452 2683 n.jpg|thumb|CYC President Dr. Jeanne Li giving her final speech during the 2000 Study Tour Closing Ceremony]]
By the 1990s, the Study Tour had become a 6 week long program with an enrolment of 1200 participants aged from 18–23 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors.  As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing Language class education schedule.  These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others.  After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the \"Closing Ceremony\" in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level Government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium.  This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous \"9 day trip down South\" which took all 1200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas.  Several of these scenic attractions included [[Taroko National Park]], [[Sun Moon Lake]], [[Kenting National Park]], and [[Sanxiantai]] among others.  The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning(sometimes tearfully) to their countries of origin.

==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==
[[File:Ocean2.jpg|thumb|National Taiwan Ocean University Campus]]Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by [[Ocean Campus]] in [[Keelung]].  Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus.<ref>[http://www.explode.com/passport/taiwan.shtml Explode.com Study Tour Article \"Fear and Loathing in Taiwan\" (English)]</ref>  But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei.  In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife.  Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond.  Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour.  This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.

==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==
[[File:Kenting.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Kenting]], one of the scenic sites during \"The 9 day trip down South\"]]
One other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student.  According to Valerie Soe's 2019 documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan<ref>[https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/about Loveboat Taiwan documentary Official Website ]</ref>\", in August 1993 during that year's \"9 day trip down south\", a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of [[Kenting]].  The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him.  His body was not found until it washed up several days later.  This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement.  Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students.  Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour,<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html Article detailing Studytour in Mid 1990s (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408160336/http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html |date=2007-04-08 }}</ref> students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.

==Changes from 2000 to 2012==
[[File:Ktvtpe.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students enjoying a night at a Taipei KTV]]
The program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]]. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted.  Further problems for the Study tour continued.  The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan's [[Kuomintang]] party since its inception in 1967.  After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour.  As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrolment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students.<ref>[http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html Article detailing study tour history (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116232224/http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html |date=2006-11-16 }}</ref> To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the \"Baby Boat\", a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12–18. The cuts did not end there.  In 2002, due to lack of government support, the [[China Youth Corps]] which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.
[[File:Militarytpe.jpg|thumb|Love Boat participants at a Taiwan military base in [[Kaoshiung]].  To meet its ideological aims, the Study Tour required students to attend demonstrations at various military bases and to attend lectures. ]]
As a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted  about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in [[Taichung]].  The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus.  This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a \"Trip down South.\" There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.

In the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even 
missile threats/military posturing from China.  However, no Study Tour year was ever canceled due to these incidents except the 2003 year.  In 2003, the worldwide SARS outbreak caused the only ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began.  Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions.

The Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.\"  One group remained at Chientan Campus which on this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks.  Another group was located at Taichung.  The enrolment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in the Taiwanese dialect.  These changes did not last when the [[Kuomintang]] party returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in mandarin were again re-established.

==Changes to Chientan Campus==
[[File:Shilinloveboat.jpg|thumb|Students enjoying the famous [[Shilin Night Market]] near Chientan Campus]]
The Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the [[Shilin District]] for decades since the [[China Youth Corps]] first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex.  In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/03/2003617375Remove China Youth Corps’ center: Taipei councilor]</ref> and to replace it with an arts center and park<ref>[https://www.eco-business.com/news/taipei-city-mulls-shilin-district-urban-renewal-plan/ Taipei City mulls Shilin District urban renewal plan</ref>.  Complicated negotiations between the [[China Youth Corps]] and the [[Taipei City Government]] continued into September 2016 until finally coming to a compromise.<ref>[https://english.geo.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=73D3E2CB30F6953F&sms=DFFA119D1FD5602C&s=127DCA87C2E42784] Taipei City Government has agreed on land resumption of Chientan Youth Activity Center and will continue the lease according to law</ref> Their agreement stipulated that by the end of 2024, all property rights to the Chientan Youth Activity Center would be transferred without compensation from the [[China Youth Corps]] to the [[Taipei City Government]].  What fate may lie for the Chientan Youth Activity Center after the beginning of 2025, whether it be renewal or demolition, remains unknown.

==Changes from 2013 to current program==
[[File:Loveboatclass.jpg|thumb|A typical Study Tour mandarin language class]]
The documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan\" further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants.  The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer.  Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour.<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=2169&pid=35039 \"Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour Official Website\"]</ref>\"  It is now solely run by the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]](OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its Official website<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/ Overseas Community Affairs Council Official Website]</ref> the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 18 and 25 years old.  It is also just one of the OCAC's many \"expatriate\" programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year.   Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-straight relations.  With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes \"participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities\" as described in the OCAC's application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan's goal of establishing greater international support and recognition.

Even though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.

==In popular culture==

The '''Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour to [[Taiwan]]''', informally known as the '''Love Boat''', is currently a three-week summer program for about 70 to 100 College-aged [[Overseas Chinese]] and [[Overseas Taiwanese]]. In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], it is also colloquially referred to as ''Měi-Jiā-yíng'' (美加營) &ndash; “America and Canada Camp” &ndash;  a reference to the origin of most participants. The program is held at the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://chientan.cyh.org.tw/?lang=en Chientan Youth Activity Center Official Website(Chinese)]</ref>(劍潭) in [[Taipei]] which is not to be confused with [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] subway station.

==Origins of the Study Tour==
[[File:Lb1969c.jpg|thumb|Cover of the 1969 Roster Book of the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour.  This would in later years be turned into the annual Study Tour Yearbook. Photo Permission provided by the Chinese Canadian Archive.]]  
The Study Tour program was started in 1967 by the [[China Youth Corps]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080120093946/http://taiwanjournal.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=17692&CtNode=118 ''Taiwan National Journal'' article (17 December 1999) on the study tour (English)]</ref> According to the Chinese Canadian Archive,<ref>[https://torontopubliclibrary.typepad.com/local-history-genealogy/2018/03/new-exhibit-unveiled-chinese-canadian-archive.html''Chinese Canadian Archive article'' ]</ref> the original name of the program was the \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour\" and was initially promoted across North America through various local Chinese newspapers by Chinese North Americans with relations to the [[Kuomintang]] party. The primary goal of the program was to acquaint, or re-acquaint, young people of Chinese descent living in other parts of the world with Chinese culture and language. Thus, participants take brief courses in language and arts, attend lectures, and take scenic tours of Taiwan. This however, is the popular perception of the program. The alternate and original purpose for the Taiwan Government's subsidizing of the program was to shore up [[Overseas Chinese]] support for its cross-strait political policies, particularly those of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in regards to its tense relations with China. Accordingly, participants were to attend lectures on cross-strait relations which others might perceive as propaganda. The program was conceived by the Taiwan Government in part because the [[Kuomintang]] for many decades had recognized the historical importance of the [[Overseas Chinese]] community not only for its financing but also for its political support.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23462345?seq=1 Taiwan and Overseas Chinese during the Cold War Era]</ref>  In fact Dr. [[Sun Yat-Sen]],<ref>[http://chinatown.library.uvic.ca/index.html%3Fq=sun_yat-sen.html Dr. Sun Yat-Sen]</ref> the founder of the [[Kuomintang]] as well as the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)]], recognized early the importance of [[Overseas Chinese]] support<ref>[https://www.straight.com/blogra/faces-vancouver-kuomintang-building-chinatown Sun Yat-Sen and Overseas Chinese history]</ref> and went as far as to say that \"Overseas Chinese are the Mother of the Revolution.<ref>[http://www.heroesofconfederation.com/Sun_Yat_Sen/sun_mission(1).html Sun Yat-Sen acknowledgement of Overseas Chinese]</ref>\"  However, beyond the political origins of the Study Tour, the program is most famous for its historically positive influence on Chinese American identity in addition to its \"[[Loveboat]]\" reputation of spawning many relationships as well hosting a frenetic nightlife scene which many participants indulged in.

==Changes from 1967 to 1999==
[[File:Lb1969a.jpg|thumb|Official 1969 Certificate of attendance for the Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour. Photo permission provided by [[Jan Wong]] and the Chinese Canadian Archive]]The Study Tour has gone through many changes over the years which correspond with Taiwan's changing politics and economy. After an experimental trial run in 1966 of only 5 students from North America<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/4271166/_Chinese_American_Transnationalism_Aboard_the_Love_Boat_The_Overseas_Youth_Language_Training_and_Study_Tour_to_the_Republic_of_China_ Chinese American Transnationalism aboard the Loveboat]</ref>, the [[China Youth Corps]] conducted the first official Study Tour in 1967 which hosted 70-100 participants from America and Canada, with an age range of between 14 and 25.  According to journalist [[Jan Wong]], a 1969 Study Tour participant, the first few years of the Study Tour program were held at [[Fu Jen Catholic University]]. As the popularity of the program grew, the number of participants increased and the headquarters moved to the Chientan Youth Activity Center in the 1970s located in the [[Shilin District]] near modern day [[Jiantan Station|Jiantan]] station.  During this time, the [[China Youth Corps]] had changed the name of the Study Tour to become \"Overseas Chinese Youth Language Training and Study Tour to the Republic of China,\" to be more in line with their political ideology. By the 1970s and 1980s, the average size of the program slowly grew to 300–500 students up until 1988 and then in 1989 peaked exponentially at 1200 participants. Due to the overwhelming increase in demand participants had to be placed in two separate campuses in 1990, one remaining at Chientan Campus and the other new one held at Taipei's [[Tam Kang Campus]].  During this time, and due to the increase in student size, the [[China Youth Corps]] came to share sponsoring responsibilities with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission which has since been renamed the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]].

[[File:Chientan.jpg|thumb|Chientan Youth Activity Center]]
This increase in enrolment coincided with both Taiwan's 1987 lifting of [[martial law]] and also its astronomical economic rise in the technology boom which greatly increased the island's reputation and prosperity. Further, because many originally skeptical participants were returning home with a greater appreciation of Taiwanese culture, improved Chinese language skills and were raving about the quality of the Tour to their family, this consequently led to good word of mouth about the program being spread within the National Chinese Community.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/popup.php?x=news3 Direct link to August 3rd, 2004 Toronto Star article \"Finding a Mate Offshore\" by William Lin]</ref> This was especially pertinent in the 1970s and 1980s when Chinese communities were smaller than present day and a clear sense of \"Asian American identity\" for many North American born Chinese was nebulous at best. Many American-born Chinese who initially did not have any Chinese language skills and who refused to date a fellow Asian, returned from the Tour not only expressing a greater appreciation of Chinese language and culture but also a greater willingness to date within the Asian community.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011209130536/http://www.geocities.com/jodeman.geo/loveboat.htm 'A More Complete Description of The Love Boat\" (English)]</ref>  There were many reasons for this, but especially for those participants who came from communities without many Chinese, the Study Tour provided a unique forum to share their common \"Chinese North American Experience\" of growing up and needing to reconcile both North American and Asian Cultures in a predominantly Caucasian society. This bonding not only produced several relationships but it also created many lifelong friendships.  In addition, it did not hurt that during the trip, students were treated as \"little diplomats.\"  This was witnessed during their police escorted bus trips to local Taipei landmarks where local traffic was essentially stopped for the convenience of their journey and to the relative chagrin of local Taiwanese commuters.  This same sense of diplomacy was bestowed upon them at various military installations and cultural performances that students attended and were attempts by the program to ingratiate students with the people and culture of Taiwan.  These various aspects of the Study Tour combined with the fact that 6 weeks of room and board(excluding airfare) only cost the participant $400 US dollars, due to Taiwan Government subsidization, also led to an increased popularity for the trip as most agreed it was an excellent deal. 
[[File:224273 9461070452 3021 n.jpg|thumb|Students sneaking out of Chientan Campus at night to party]]
However, a by-product of the Study Tour's increased popularity was increased competition by parents to register their children especially at large urban centers in New York and California. In fact, there were often waiting lists to get on the program and for some parents getting their child on the program became a symbol of status and often pertinent or high-ranking connections facilitated the application process for their child.  Some parents desiring their children to find a \"suitable Chinese spouse\"<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113166784230094239 The Loveboat Wall Street Journal Article]</ref> sent their unsuspecting children on the trip while telling them it was chiefly a Language Study Tour.  Conversely, some students who were interested in attending would often neglect to inform their parents about the Study Tour's [[Love Boat]] reputation for fear of not being allowed to go.  These concerns by some parents came from rumours that a few participants engaged in sexually promiscuous activity. On the other side of the spectrum, several Study Tour attendees did happen to fall in love and end up marrying each other.  All these instances led to the Study Tour gaining its [[Love Boat]] nickname and reputation.<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/about/index.php?y=inthenews ''Toronto Star'' 3 August 2004 article on the Study Tour re-published by Click2Asia.  Click2Asia indicates date and source of material (Toronto Star) in this link]</ref> Several unplanned pregnancies were however documented on the 1996 Study Tour which resulted in more stringent rules for subsequent tours; including rules against the opposite sex being present in the same dorm room and more strictly administered curfews. 

[[File:Loveboatclub.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students of the Love Boat enjoying an evening at a Taipei Dance Club]]
The job of implementing these many rules has traditionally been overseen by many local College-aged Taiwan counselors whose responsibilities, from early morning to late at night, consisted of organizing all the various logistics of the students' itinerary. This included organizing language/cultural classes, trips outings, speech contests, meals, medical care, guest speakers, and enforcing discipline which included trying to prevent(in vain) the students from sneaking out of the campus in the evening to enjoy the Taipei nightlife. Due to the sheer volume of minor misdeeds many counselors had to turn a blind eye and instead focused their energies on insuring the safety and well being of the students. Becoming a Study Tour counselor for local Taiwanese was considered by many a badge of honour, as throughout the 1960s to the 1990s, the [[China Youth Corps]] only accepted local Taiwan applicants from the best Taiwan Universities and degree programs in a rigorous selection process. For many counselors, the Study Tour was their very first contact with other Western Chinese from abroad and many found the cultural exchange as equally life-changing as did the students who attended.

Another prerequisite of the Study Tour by the 1980s had become mandatory [[University]] enrolment with a preference for students in [[Ivy League]] Universities and students in their final year of University and thus near the age limit.  Students with high academic achievements such as Presidential Scholars, Rhode Scholars as well as Truman Scholars were also given higher priority and were able to attend the Study Tour without charge.  Further rules stipulated that a family could only send one of its children at a time during any particular tour year so as to avoiding hoarding of spots by families.  Exceptions were made however to twins and siblings from Europe.  Participation had gradually increased from Europe especially from the countries such as England, France, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.  Countries such as Australia and those from South America and Africa also began sending small numbers of Study Tour participants.  This contributed greatly to the sense of international community among [[Overseas Chinese]] worldwide.
[[File:222318 9461130452 2683 n.jpg|thumb|CYC President Dr. Jeanne Li giving her final speech during the 2000 Study Tour Closing Ceremony]]
By the 1990s, the Study Tour had become a 6 week long program with an enrolment of 1200 participants aged from 18–23 with a management staff of over 80 Counselors.  As the size of the program expanded, more cultural classes were added to the existing Language class education schedule.  These classes now included calligraphy, cooking, Chinese medicine, Chinese yo-yo, fan dancing, flute, kung-fu, painting, paper cutting, stick-fighting, southern fiddle, sword-fighting, Taiwanese aboriginal dance, ribbon dancing, zither, and several others.  After 4 weeks of training, some students would perform what they learned during the \"Closing Ceremony\" in front of an audience of Study Tour participants and several high-level Government officials at the Chientan Youth Activity Center auditorium.  This Closing Ceremony preceded the famous \"9 day trip down South\" which took all 1200 study tour participants, in 4 separate groups, on a bus tour around the entire island of Taiwan to see the major scenic areas.  Several of these scenic attractions included [[Taroko National Park]], [[Sun Moon Lake]], [[Kenting National Park]], and [[Sanxiantai]] among others.  The end of the 9 day trip down South coincided with the end of the Study Tour and with all the students shortly returning(sometimes tearfully) to their countries of origin.

==Addition of Ocean Campus in 1992==
[[File:Ocean2.jpg|thumb|National Taiwan Ocean University Campus]]Starting in 1992, another memorable change occurred in the Study Tour in that Tam Kang Campus was replaced in use by [[Ocean Campus]] in [[Keelung]].  Many recall with fondness or revulsion the facilities of Ocean Campus.<ref>[http://www.explode.com/passport/taiwan.shtml Explode.com Study Tour Article \"Fear and Loathing in Taiwan\" (English)]</ref>  But by popular opinion, those students who were placed in Chientan Campus had the more comfortable facilities and the convenience to the nearby Shilin night market in Taipei.  In comparison, those students at Ocean Campus experienced slightly less convenient facilities albeit theirs did include more athletic and outdoor activities but unfortunately were a good cab ride away from the Taipei nightlife.  Without such amenities as Chientan campus, students at Ocean Campus often had no choice but to use their greater opportunities and free time at Ocean campus to communicate and bond.  Unfortunately, the idea and logistics behind a Campus switch between Chientan and Ocean would not come to fruition until the Study tour of 1996. During this switch, participants at Ocean and Chientan would switch campuses half-way during the Tour.  This type of switch would continue until the 2001 Study Tour.

==Death of student in 1993 and subsequent lawsuit==
[[File:Kenting.jpg|thumb|Bay of [[Kenting]], one of the scenic sites during \"The 9 day trip down South\"]]
One other reason for stricter rules involved the death of a student.  According to Valerie Soe's 2019 documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan<ref>[https://www.loveboat-taiwan.com/about Loveboat Taiwan documentary Official Website ]</ref>\", in August 1993 during that year's \"9 day trip down south\", a participant went against the wishes of the counselors to swim in the bay of [[Kenting]].  The student was caught in an undertow and subsequently drowned while others were attempting to rescue him.  His body was not found until it washed up several days later.  This embroiled the Study tour in a multimillion-dollar lawsuit which lasted many years and ended in a settlement.  Thus, stricter rules were created for the Study Tour overall not only for legal purposes but also for the protection of the students.  Although complete enforcement is extremely difficult for the counselors of the Tour,<ref>[http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html Article detailing Studytour in Mid 1990s (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408160336/http://www.click2asia.com/studytour/studytourfeature.html |date=2007-04-08 }}</ref> students caught breaking major rules such as fighting, stealing, or sexual harassment are immediately sent home.

==Changes from 2000 to 2012==
[[File:Ktvtpe.jpg|thumb|Study Tour students enjoying a night at a Taipei KTV]]
The program maintained its number of participants and its program structure throughout the 1990s but this changed after the [[1999 Jiji earthquake]]. As a result, many parents were hesitant of sending their children to Taiwan. As a result, the number of participants in the year 2000 tour dropped to 800 as anyone who applied was accepted.  Further problems for the Study tour continued.  The Study Tour had historically been funded and supported by Taiwan's [[Kuomintang]] party since its inception in 1967.  After the 2000 Taiwan election, the incoming change of administration of the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) did not fully support the aims or goals of the Study Tour.  As a result, funding was drastically cut and enrolment for the tour of 2001 was limited to 800 students.<ref>[http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html Article detailing study tour history (English)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116232224/http://www.heychristine.com/journals/06-13-01.html |date=2006-11-16 }}</ref> To cut costs, most students of that year were removed from the traditional Chientan building and moved to a smaller adjacent one that historically hosted the \"Baby Boat\", a much younger Study Tour, where participants were aged between 12–18. The cuts did not end there.  In 2002, due to lack of government support, the [[China Youth Corps]] which usually ran the program announced that it could no longer support a sizable number of students at Chientan for its 2002 Study Tour and that other organizations would have to pick up the slack.
[[File:Militarytpe.jpg|thumb|Love Boat participants at a Taiwan military base in [[Kaoshiung]].  To meet its ideological aims, the Study Tour required students to attend demonstrations at various military bases and to attend lectures. ]]
As a result, in 2002 the Chientan campus hosted  about 100 students with other tour participants going to three other different campuses; including one campus near the Taipei Zoo and another in [[Taichung]].  The fourth group was the most unusual as they did not have a specific or permanent home base and spent most of their trip traveling around the island by bus.  This fourth group therefore, did not get nor require a \"Trip down South.\" There was no campus switch for this 2002 Study tour and each group hosted approximately 100 members.

In the over 50 year history of the Taiwan Study Tour, the students have survived through many travails such as earthquakes, typhoons, localized disease outbreaks, and even 
missile threats/military posturing from China.  However, no Study Tour year was ever canceled due to these incidents except the 2003 year.  In 2003, the worldwide SARS outbreak caused the only ever cancellation of a Study Tour before it even began.  Parents were hesitant to send their children to Taiwan at the time and Tour organizers recognized the logistical nightmare due to widespread quarantine conditions.

The Study Tour resumed in 2004 with two groups and a new official name of \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Summer Formosa Study Tour.\"  One group remained at Chientan Campus which on this year included more strictly enforced 11pm bed checks.  Another group was located at Taichung.  The enrolment slowly increased with Chientan campus eventually housing up to 200 Study tour students with the potential for greater expansion. Due to the insistence by the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] between 2005-2007 there was increased pressure on the Study Tour to offer language classes in the Taiwanese dialect.  These changes did not last when the [[Kuomintang]] party returned to power in 2008 and the traditional classes in mandarin were again re-established.

==Changes to Chientan Campus==
[[File:Shilinloveboat.jpg|thumb|Students enjoying the famous [[Shilin Night Market]] near Chientan Campus]]
The Chientan Youth Activity Center has been a fixture in the [[Shilin District]] for decades since the [[China Youth Corps]] first acquired property rights to 65% of the land it sits on prior to 1988 with the remaining 35% being state owned in a relationship that was complex.  In 2015, there were calls by Taipei City politicians to demolish and remove the Chientan Youth Activity Center<ref>[http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2015/05/03/2003617375Remove China Youth Corps’ center: Taipei councilor]</ref> and to replace it with an arts center and park<ref>[https://www.eco-business.com/news/taipei-city-mulls-shilin-district-urban-renewal-plan/ Taipei City mulls Shilin District urban renewal plan</ref>.  Complicated negotiations between the [[China Youth Corps]] and the [[Taipei City Government]] continued into September 2016 until finally coming to a compromise.<ref>[https://english.geo.gov.taipei/News_Content.aspx?n=73D3E2CB30F6953F&sms=DFFA119D1FD5602C&s=127DCA87C2E42784] Taipei City Government has agreed on land resumption of Chientan Youth Activity Center and will continue the lease according to law</ref> Their agreement stipulated that by the end of 2024, all property rights to the Chientan Youth Activity Center would be transferred without compensation from the [[China Youth Corps]] to the [[Taipei City Government]].  What fate may lie for the Chientan Youth Activity Center after the beginning of 2025, whether it be renewal or demolition, remains unknown.

==Changes from 2013 to current program==
[[File:Loveboatclass.jpg|thumb|A typical Study Tour mandarin language class]]
The documentary \"Loveboat Taiwan\" further goes on to describe the dwindling number of students attending the Study Tour during the late 2000s up to the last larger-scale Study Tour year in 2013 which numbered at about 350 participants.  The number of Study Tour attendees dropped drastically after that year and currently sits at around 70-100 students accepted each summer.  Ironically, the current Study Tour being organized annually is similar in size to the very first Study Tour held in 1967 and is currently named \"Overseas Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour.<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/Pages/VDetail.aspx?nodeid=2169&pid=35039 \"Compatriot Youth Taiwan Study Tour Official Website\"]</ref>\"  It is now solely run by the [[Overseas Community Affairs Council]](OCAC) of Taiwan and according to its Official website<ref>[https://www.ocac.gov.tw/OCAC/Eng/ Overseas Community Affairs Council Official Website]</ref> the Study Tour is now only a 3 week long program with an age group of between 18 and 25 years old.  It is also just one of the OCAC's many \"expatriate\" programs it runs for visiting international students in the summer and throughout the year.   Due to the shorter period of time, language training is less stressed than in previous years and with comparatively less emphasis on cross-straight relations.  With far fewer cultural classes offered as in past Study Tours due to the much smaller number of students, the current Tour focuses on introducing participants to Taiwan history, culture, landmarks, and also includes \"participation in earth environmental activities and charitable activities\" as described in the OCAC's application form. Participants also get the unique opportunity to visit the Office of the President of Taiwan, re-establishing the important historical link between Overseas Chinese and Taiwanese to Taiwan's goal of establishing greater International support and recognition.

Even though Chinese communities in North America now enjoy greater mainstream acceptance than they did over 50 years ago, and despite the fact modern Chinese North Americans youths may take associating with each other for granted as well as an unquestioned way of life, the goals and endeavours of the Taiwan Study Tour remain the same.

{{For|the American web series|Hyperlinked}}
{{Selfref|For help creating links in Wikipedia, see [[Help:Contents/Links]].}}
[[File:Hyperlink-Wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|An example of a hyperlink with a mouse pointer hovering above it]]
[[File:Sistema hipertextual.jpg|thumb|Several documents being connected by hyperlinks.]]

In [[computing]], a '''hyperlink''', or simply a '''link''', is a reference to [[Data (computing)|data]] that the [[user (computing)|user]] can follow by [[point and click|clicking]] or [[touchscreen|tapping]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp|title=HTML Links|website=www.w3schools.com|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. [[Hypertext]] is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called [[anchor text]]. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a ''hypertext system'', and to create a hyperlink is ''to hyperlink'' (or simply ''to link''). A user following hyperlinks is said to ''navigate'' or ''browse'' the hypertext.

The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in an online reference work such as [[Wikipedia]], or [[Google]], many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] such as tables of contents, [[footnotes]], [[bibliographies]], [[index (publishing)|indexes]], [[letter (message)|letters]] and [[glossaries]].

In some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as [[HTML element#Anchor|anchors]] and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the [[World Wide Web]] most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new [[Tab (interface)|tab]]<ref>See https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tabbrows.htm</ref>). Another possibility is [[transclusion]], for which the link target is a document [[:wikt:fragment|fragment]] that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web ''spider'' or [[Web crawler|crawler]].

==Types of links==

===Inline links===
An [[Inline linking|inline link]] displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.

An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a [[thumbnail]], [[Image resolution|low resolution]] [[Preview (computing)|preview]], [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] section, or [[magnification|magnified]] section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with [[desktop publishing|print publishing]] software – e.g., with an [[external link]]. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a [[page layout]].

===Anchor===
An anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|title=Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Virtual Reality: Models, Systems, and Application: First International Conference, MHVR'94, Moscow, Russia September (14–16), 1996. Selected Papers|last=Brusilovski|first=Peter|last2=Kommers|first2=Piet|last3=Streitz|first3=Norbert|date=1996-05-15|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783540612827|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRm8id6u3UAhVLslQKHRj1BCMQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|archivedate=2018-02-07}}</ref>—generally text, though not necessarily. For instance, it may also be a ''hot area'' in an image ([[image map]] in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a [[Politics of Africa|political map of Africa]] may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping [[Skin (computing)|skins]] or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.

===Fat link===
A '''fat link''' (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\"<ref>\"[http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#extended-link XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.0]\" accessed 2010-1-27</ref>) or a \"multi-tailed link\" <ref>\"HTML, Web Browsers, and Other Paraphernalia\" accessed 2011-08-15 https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143743/http://people.duke.edu/~mshumate/fiction/htt/tools.html#fatlink</ref> is a [[hyperlink]] which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a [[multivalued function]].

==Uses in various technologies==

===HTML===
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the [[Internet]]. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language [[HTML]].

This is what a hyperlink to the home page of the [[W3C organization]] could look like in HTML code:

<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">
<a href=\"http://www.w3.org\">W3C organization website</a>
</syntaxhighlight>
      
This HTML code consists of several [[HTML element|tags]]:
* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag '''<nowiki><a</nowiki>''', and includes a hyperlink reference '''<nowiki>href=\"http://www.w3.org</nowiki>\"''' to the '''URL''' for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)
* The [[URL]] is followed by '''>''', marking the end of the anchor opening tag.
* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.
* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).
* The anchor closing tag ('''<nowiki></a></nowiki>''') terminates the hyperlink code.

[[Webgraph]] is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], formed from [[web page]]s as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.

===XLink: hyperlinks ===
{{Main article|XLink}}

The [[W3C]] [[W3C#Recommendations and Certifications|Recommendation]] called '''[[XLink]]''' describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These '''extended links''' can be ''multidirectional'', linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe ''simple links'', which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.

===Wikis=== <!-- As of September 2016, this header is linked to by the redirect [[Wikilink]], so please don't change the header without adding the current title as an anchor. Also please leave '''wikilinks''' in bold.   -->
{{Glossary term|Wikilink|wikilink}}
While [[wiki]]s may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of [[wiki markup]], a set of [[lightweight markup language]]s specifically for wikis, provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments—in other words, for creating '''wikilinks'''.
[[File:Wiki-linking.png|thumb|alt=Simple image demonstrating how internal [[MediaWiki]] links work (that is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title: two opening square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two closing square brackets.| How internal [[MediaWiki]] links work when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title. ]]

The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] used [[CamelCase]] for this purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of [[Wikipedia]] and is still used in some wikis, such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]], and [[PmWiki]]. A common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the term to be wikilinked. For example, the input \"<nowiki>[[zebras]]</nowiki>\" is converted by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a [[zebras]] article.
Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
* '''Internal wikilinks''' or '''intrawiki links''' lead to pages within the same wiki website.
* '''[[Interwiki links]]''' are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages of other wikis that are associated with the first.
* '''External links''' lead to other webpages (those not covered in the above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that don't yet exist, which are instead shown in [[redlink|red]].<ref>Wikipedia: the missing manual By John Broughton, 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-51516-2}}, [https://archive.org/details/wikipediamissing00brou_0/page/75 p. 75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA75 |date=2018-02-07 }}</ref> Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question mark after the wikilinked term.

===Virtual worlds===
{{main article|Hyperlinks in virtual worlds}}
Hyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D [[virtual world]] networks, including those that use the [[OpenSimulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid |title=Hypergrid – OpenSim |publisher=Opensimulator.org |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> and [[Open Cobalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |title=Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces – Cobalt – DukeWiki |publisher=Wiki.duke.edu |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184439/https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |archivedate=2012-12-21 }}</ref> platforms.

=== Permalinks ===
{{Main|Digital preservation}}
Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlink that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to [[Pointer (computer programming)#Typed pointers and casting|point]] and [[URL redirection#Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs|redirect]] readers to the same [[Web page]], blog post or any online digital media<ref name=\"techopedia.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | title = Definition of Permanent Link (Permalink)  | website = techopedia.com | language = en | access-date = Oct 31, 2018 | archive-url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | archive-date = March 2, 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>.

The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in [[BMC Bioinformatics]] analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters’ [[Web of Science]] [[Science citation index|citation index]], founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<ref>{{cite web | first = Leighton | last = W.

==How hyperlinks work in HTML==
A link from one domain to another is said to be ''outbound'' from its source anchor and [[inbound link|''inbound'']] to its target.

The most common destination anchor is a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] used in the [[World Wide Web]]. This can refer to a document, e.g. a [[webpage]], or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an [[HTML element]] with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a [[fragment identifier]] —   \"#''id attribute''\" — appended.

When linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"''id attribute''\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#''page=386''\".

===Link behavior in web browsers===
A [[web browser]] usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different [[color]], [[font]] or [[Typeface|style]]. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) language.

In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a [[computer mouse|mouse]] [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] may change into a [[hand]] motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the [[user (computing)|user]] activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the [[file type]] and on the browser and its [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], another program may be activated to open the file.

The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:
* '''link destination''' (\"href\" pointing to a URL)
* '''[[Anchor text|link label]]'''
* '''link title'''
* '''link target'''
* '''link class''' or '''link id'''

It uses the [[HTML anchor|HTML element \"a\"]] with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|title=Making a Server (\"HREF\" is for \"hypertext reference\")|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=2012-10-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025220948/http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|archivedate=2012-10-25|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref>) and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"[[Cascading Style Sheets|class]]\" or \"id\":

:<samp>&lt;a href=\"''URL''\" title=\"''link title''\" target=\"''link target''\" class=\"''link class''\"&gt;''link label''&lt;/a&gt;</samp>

To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:

:<code><nowiki><a href=\"http://example.com/\">Example</a></nowiki></code>

In a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.

When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular [[Window (computing)|window]], but in a special [[Mouse hover|hover box]], which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the [[status bar]].

Normally, a link opens in the current [[framing (World Wide Web)|frame]] or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

Creation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.

Another special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.

==History==
[[File:SRI ARC Engelbart Nov 1969.jpg|thumb|Douglas Engelbart and his team at [[SRI International|SRI]], 1969]]
The term \"link\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by [[Ted Nelson]] at the start of [[Project Xanadu]]. Nelson had been inspired by \"[[As We May Think]]\", a popular 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]]. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the [[Memex]]) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.

In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by [[Autodesk]] in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by [[Douglas Engelbart]] (with [[Jeff Rulifson]] as chief [[programmer]]) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. [[Ben Shneiderman]] working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/ HyperTIES system] in 1983.  HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web.  In 1988, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.{{cn|date=February 2019|reason=First electronic book is a bold claim.}}

A database program [[HyperCard]] was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, [[Windows Help]], which was introduced with [[Microsoft Windows 3.0]], had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single [[Online help|help file]] together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic browser]] (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.

==Legal issues==
{{Main article|Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing}}

While hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.

Contentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.<ref>See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.</ref>

In certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks. After [[litigation]], a [[court]] found for Prodigy, ruling that [[British Telecom]]'s patent did not cover web hyperlinks.<ref>[[CNET]] News.com, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030207070416/http://news.com.com/2100-1033-955001.html Hyperlink patent case fails to click]. August 23, 2002.</ref>

In [[United States]] ''[[jurisprudence]]'', there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or [[copyright infringement|infringing]] (e.g., illegal MP3 copies).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041507/http://www.cybertelecom.org/ip/link.htm Cybertelecom:: Legal to Link?]&nbsp; The ''Internet Archive''.

[[File:Hyperlink-Wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|An example of a hyperlink with a mouse pointer hovering above it]]
[[File:Sistema hipertextual.jpg|thumb|Several documents being connected by hyperlinks.]]

In [[computing]], a '''hyperlink''', or simply a '''link''', is a reference to [[Data (computing)|data]] that the [[user (computing)|user]] can follow by [[point and click|clicking]] or [[touchscreen|tapping]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp|title=HTML Links|website=www.w3schools.com|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. [[Hypertext]] is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called [[anchor text]]. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a ''hypertext system'', and to create a hyperlink is ''to hyperlink'' (or simply ''to link''). A user following hyperlinks is said to ''navigate'' or ''browse'' the hypertext.

The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in an online reference work such as [[Wikipedia]], or [[Google]], many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] such as tables of contents, [[footnotes]], [[bibliographies]], [[index (publishing)|indexes]], [[letter (message)|letters]] and [[glossaries]].

In some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as [[HTML element#Anchor|anchors]] and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the [[World Wide Web]] most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new [[Tab (interface)|tab]]<ref>See https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tabbrows.htm</ref>). Another possibility is [[transclusion]], for which the link target is a document [[:wikt:fragment|fragment]] that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web ''spider'' or [[Web crawler|crawler]].

==Types of links==

===Inline links===
An [[Inline linking|inline link]] displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.

An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a [[thumbnail]], [[Image resolution|low resolution]] [[Preview (computing)|preview]], [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] section, or [[magnification|magnified]] section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with [[desktop publishing|print publishing]] software – e.g., with an [[external link]]. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a [[page layout]].

===Anchor===
An anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|title=Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Virtual Reality: Models, Systems, and Application: First International Conference, MHVR'94, Moscow, Russia September (14–16), 1996.

For instance, it may also be a ''hot area'' in an image ([[image map]] in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a [[Politics of Africa|political map of Africa]] may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping [[Skin (computing)|skins]] or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.

===Fat link===
A '''fat link''' (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\"<ref>\"[http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#extended-link XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.0]\" accessed 2010-1-27</ref>) or a \"multi-tailed link\" <ref>\"HTML, Web Browsers, and Other Paraphernalia\" accessed 2011-08-15 https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143743/http://people.duke.edu/~mshumate/fiction/htt/tools.html#fatlink</ref> is a [[hyperlink]] which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a [[multivalued function]].

==Uses in various technologies==

===HTML===
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the [[Internet]]. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language [[HTML]].

This is what a hyperlink to the home page of the [[W3C organization]] could look like in HTML code:

<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">
<a href=\"http://www.w3.org\">W3C organization website</a>
</syntaxhighlight>
      
This HTML code consists of several [[HTML element|tags]]:
* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag '''<nowiki><a</nowiki>''', and includes a hyperlink reference '''<nowiki>href=\"http://www.w3.org</nowiki>\"''' to the '''URL''' for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)
* The [[URL]] is followed by '''>''', marking the end of the anchor opening tag.
* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.
* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).
* The anchor closing tag ('''<nowiki></a></nowiki>''') terminates the hyperlink code.

[[Webgraph]] is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], formed from [[web page]]s as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.

===XLink: hyperlinks ===
{{Main article|XLink}}

The [[W3C]] [[W3C#Recommendations and Certifications|Recommendation]] called '''[[XLink]]''' describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These '''extended links''' can be ''multidirectional'', linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe ''simple links'', which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.

===Wikis=== <!-- As of September 2016, this header is linked to by the redirect [[Wikilink]], so please don't change the header without adding the current title as an anchor. Also please leave '''wikilinks''' in bold.   -->
{{Glossary term|Wikilink|wikilink}}
While [[wiki]]s may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of [[wiki markup]], a set of [[lightweight markup language]]s specifically for wikis, provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments—in other words, for creating '''wikilinks'''.
[[File:Wiki-linking.png|thumb|alt=Simple image demonstrating how internal [[MediaWiki]] links work (that is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title: two opening square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two closing square brackets.| How internal [[MediaWiki]] links work when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title. ]]

The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] used [[CamelCase]] for this purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of [[Wikipedia]] and is still used in some wikis, such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]], and [[PmWiki]]. A common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the term to be wikilinked. For example, the input \"<nowiki>[[zebras]]</nowiki>\" is converted by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a [[zebras]] article.
Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
* '''Internal wikilinks''' or '''intrawiki links''' lead to pages within the same wiki website.
* '''[[Interwiki links]]''' are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages of other wikis that are associated with the first.
* '''External links''' lead to other webpages (those not covered in the above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that don't yet exist, which are instead shown in [[redlink|red]].<ref>Wikipedia: the missing manual By John Broughton, 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-51516-2}}, [https://archive.org/details/wikipediamissing00brou_0/page/75 p. 75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA75 |date=2018-02-07 }}</ref> Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question mark after the wikilinked term.

===Virtual worlds===
{{main article|Hyperlinks in virtual worlds}}
Hyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D [[virtual world]] networks, including those that use the [[OpenSimulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid |title=Hypergrid – OpenSim |publisher=Opensimulator.org |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> and [[Open Cobalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |title=Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces – Cobalt – DukeWiki |publisher=Wiki.duke.edu |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184439/https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |archivedate=2012-12-21 }}</ref> platforms.

=== Permalinks ===
{{Main|Digital preservation}}
Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlink that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to [[Pointer (computer programming)#Typed pointers and casting|point]] and [[URL redirection#Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs|redirect]] readers to the same [[Web page]], blog post or any online digital media<ref name=\"techopedia.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | title = Definition of Permanent Link (Permalink)  | website = techopedia.com | language = en | access-date = Oct 31, 2018 | archive-url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | archive-date = March 2, 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>.

The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in [[BMC Bioinformatics]] analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters’ [[Web of Science]] [[Science citation index|citation index]], founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<ref>{{cite web | first = Leighton | last = W.

==How hyperlinks work in HTML==
A link from one domain to another is said to be ''outbound'' from its source anchor and [[inbound link|''inbound'']] to its target.

The most common destination anchor is a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] used in the [[World Wide Web]]. This can refer to a document, e.g. a [[webpage]], or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an [[HTML element]] with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a [[fragment identifier]] —   \"#''id attribute''\" — appended.

When linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"''id attribute''\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#''page=386''\".

===Link behavior in web browsers===
A [[web browser]] usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different [[color]], [[font]] or [[Typeface|style]]. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) language.

In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a [[computer mouse|mouse]] [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] may change into a [[hand]] motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the [[user (computing)|user]] activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the [[file type]] and on the browser and its [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], another program may be activated to open the file.

The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:
* '''link destination''' (\"href\" pointing to a URL)
* '''[[Anchor text|link label]]'''
* '''link title'''
* '''link target'''
* '''link class''' or '''link id'''

It uses the [[HTML anchor|HTML element \"a\"]] with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|title=Making a Server (\"HREF\" is for \"hypertext reference\")|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=2012-10-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025220948/http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|archivedate=2012-10-25|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref>) and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"[[Cascading Style Sheets|class]]\" or \"id\":

:<samp>&lt;a href=\"''URL''\" title=\"''link title''\" target=\"''link target''\" class=\"''link class''\"&gt;''link label''&lt;/a&gt;</samp>

To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:

:<code><nowiki><a href=\"http://example.com/\">Example</a></nowiki></code>

In a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.

When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular [[Window (computing)|window]], but in a special [[Mouse hover|hover box]], which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the [[status bar]].

Normally, a link opens in the current [[framing (World Wide Web)|frame]] or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

Creation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.

Another special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.

==History==
[[File:SRI ARC Engelbart Nov 1969.jpg|thumb|Douglas Engelbart and his team at [[SRI International|SRI]], 1969]]
The term \"hyperlink\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by [[Ted Nelson]] at the start of [[Project Xanadu]]. Nelson had been inspired by \"[[As We May Think]]\", a popular 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]]. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the [[Memex]]) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.

In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by [[Autodesk]] in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by [[Douglas Engelbart]] (with [[Jeff Rulifson]] as chief [[programmer]]) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. [[Ben Shneiderman]] working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/ HyperTIES system] in 1983.  HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web.  In 1988, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.{{cn|date=February 2019|reason=First electronic book is a bold claim.}}

A database program [[HyperCard]] was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, [[Windows Help]], which was introduced with [[Microsoft Windows 3.0]], had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single [[Online help|help file]] together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic browser]] (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.

==Legal issues==
{{Main article|Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing}}

While hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.

Contentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.<ref>See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.</ref>

In certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks. After [[litigation]], a [[court]] found for Prodigy, ruling that [[British Telecom]]'s patent did not cover web hyperlinks.<ref>[[CNET]] News.com, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030207070416/http://news.com.com/2100-1033-955001.html Hyperlink patent case fails to click]. August 23, 2002.</ref>

In [[United States]] ''[[jurisprudence]]'', there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or [[copyright infringement|infringing]] (e.g., illegal MP3 copies).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041507/http://www.cybertelecom.org/ip/link.htm Cybertelecom:: Legal to Link?]&nbsp; The ''Internet Archive''.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Atlas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἄτλας}}, ''Átlas'') was a [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] condemned to hold up the celestial heavens for eternity after the [[Titanomachy]]. Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest [[List of Greek mythological figures#Heroes|Greek heroes]]: [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]] in [[Roman mythology]]) and [[Perseus]]. According to the ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]], Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in extreme [[Hesperides|west]].<ref name=\"517–520\"/> Later, he became commonly identified with the [[Atlas Mountains]] in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of [[Mauretania]].<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. In antiquity, he was credited with inventing the first [[celestial spheres|celestial sphere]]. In some texts, he is even credited with the invention of [[astronomy]] itself.<ref name=\"Diodorus\"/>

Atlas was the son of the Titan [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]] and the [[Oceanid]] [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]]<ref name=\"Pseudo-Apollodorus\"/> or [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]].<ref name=\"Asia\"/> He was a brother of [[Epimetheus]] and [[Prometheus]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roman|first=Luke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOgWfjNIxoMC|title=Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology|last2=Roman|first2=Monica|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2639-5|location=|pages=92|language=en}}</ref> He had many children, mostly daughters, the [[Hesperides]], the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]], the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]], and the nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] who lived on the island [[Ogygia]].<ref name=\"Daughter\"/>

The term [[Atlas]] has been used to describe a collection of maps since the 16th century when Flemish geographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] published his work in honor of the mythological Titan.

The \"[[Atlantic Ocean]]\" is derived from \"Sea of Atlas\". In Ancient Greek, Plato's Timaeus dialogue also mentions \"Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος\" (English:\"[[Atlantis]] nisos\") meaning \"Atlas's Island\", giving rise to the English derivative: Atlantis (Atlantean / of Atlas).<ref>https://www.dictionary.com/e/atlantis/</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of the name ''Atlas'' is uncertain. [[Virgil]] took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them with adjectives that explained them: for Atlas his adjective is ''durus'', \"hard, enduring\",<ref>''[[Aeneid]]'' iv.247: \"''Atlantis duri''\" and other instances; see Robert W. Cruttwell, \"Virgil, Aeneid, iv. 247: 'Atlantis Duri'\" ''The Classical Review'' '''59'''.1 (May 1945), p. 11.</ref> which suggested to George Doig<ref>George Doig, \"Vergil's Art and the Greek Language\" ''The Classical Journal'' '''64'''.1 (October 1968, pp. 1-6) p. 2.</ref> that Virgil was aware of the Greek τλῆναι \"to endure\"; Doig offers the further possibility that Virgil was aware of [[Strabo]]'s remark that the native North African name for this mountain was ''Douris''. Since the Atlas mountains rise in the region inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]], it has been suggested that the name might be taken from one of the [[Berber languages|Berber]], specifically ''ádrār'' 'mountain'.<ref>Strabo, 17.3;</ref>

Traditionally historical linguists etymologize the Ancient Greek word Ἄτλας ([[genitive case|genitive]]: Ἄτλαντος) as comprised from copulative α- and the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*telh₂-'' 'to uphold, support' (whence also τλῆναι), and which was later reshaped to an nt-stem.<ref name=\"Beekes\">{{Cite document|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek |volume=1 |author-link=Robert Beekes |first=Robert |last=Beekes |first2=Lucien |last2=van Beek |page=163 |year=2010 |publisher=Brill|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->&#123;&#123;inconsistent citations&#125;&#125; }}</ref> However, [[Robert Beekes]] argues that it cannot be expected that this ancient Titan carries an Indo-European name, and that the word is of [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Greek]] origin, and such words often end in ''-ant''.<ref name=\"Beekes\"/>

== Mythology ==
===Punishment===
{{main|Titanomachy}}
Atlas and his brother [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]] sided with the Titans in their war against the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]], the [[Titanomachy]]. When the Titans were defeated, many of them (including Menoetius) were confined to [[Tartarus]], but [[Zeus]] condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia (the Earth)]] and hold up the sky on his shoulders.<ref name=\"517–520\"/> Thus, he was ''Atlas Telamon'', \"enduring Atlas,\" and became a doublet of [[Coeus]], the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve.<ref>The usage in [[Virgil]]'s ''maximum Atlas axem umero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum'' (''Aeneid'', iv.481f , cf vi.796f), combining poetic and parascientific images, is discussed in P. R. Hardie, \"Atlas and Axis\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' N.S. '''33'''.1 (1983:220-228).</ref>

A common misconception today is that Atlas was forced to hold the Earth on his shoulders, but Classical art shows Atlas holding the [[celestial spheres]], not the [[globe|terrestrial globe]]; the solidity of the marble globe borne by the renowned [[Farnese Atlas]] may have aided the conflation, reinforced in the 16th century by the developing usage of ''atlas'' to describe a corpus of [[Atlas|terrestrial maps]].

===Encounter with Perseus===
{{main|Perseus}}
The Greek poet [[Polyidus]] c. 398 BC<ref>[[Polyeidos (poet)|Polyeidos]], Fragment 837; Ovid, 'Metamorphoses'' 4.627''</ref> tells a tale of Atlas, then a shepherd, encountering [[Perseus]] who [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turned him to stone]]. Ovid later gives a more detailed account of the incident, combining it with the myth of Heracles. In this account Atlas is not a shepherd but a King.<ref>Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', IV.617ff ([http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Perseus.html#Atlas on-line English translation at Theoi Project]).</ref> According to Ovid, Perseus arrives in Atlas' Kingdom and asks for shelter, declaring he is a son of Zeus. Atlas, fearful of a prophecy which warned of a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples from his orchard, refuses Perseus hospitality.<ref name=\"LOTN\"/> In this account, Atlas is turned not just into stone by Perseus, but an entire mountain range: Atlas' head the peak, his shoulders ridges and his hair woods. The prophecy did not relate to Perseus stealing the golden apples but [[Heracles]], another son of Zeus, and Perseus' great-grandson.<ref>{{harvp|Ogden|2008|pp=49, 108, 114}}</ref>

===Encounter with Heracles===
{{main|Heracles}}
[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|Atlas and Hercules]]
One of the [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]] of the hero [[Heracles]] was to fetch some of the golden apples which grow in [[Hera]]'s garden, tended by Atlas' reputed daughters, the [[Hesperides]] which were also called the Atlantides, and guarded by the dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]. Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from his daughters.<ref name=\":0\">[[Diodorus Siculus]]. ''Library, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.27.2]''</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gantz|1993|pp=410-413}}</ref>

Upon his return with the apples, however, Atlas attempted to trick Heracles into carrying the sky permanently by offering to deliver the apples himself, as anyone who purposely took the burden must carry it forever, or until someone else took it away. Heracles, suspecting Atlas did not intend to return, pretended to agree to Atlas' offer, asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders. When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again, Heracles took the apples and ran away.

In some versions,<ref>A lost passage of [[Pindar]] quoted by Strabo (3.5.5) was the earliest reference in this context: \"the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles\"; the passage in Pindar has not been traced.</ref> Heracles instead built the two great [[Pillars of Hercules]] to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas much as he liberated [[Prometheus]].

===Other Variations===
[[File:Singer Sargent, John - Atlas and the Hesperides - 1925.jpg|thumb|''Atlas and the Hesperides'' by Singer Sargent, John (1925)]]

====King of Atlantis====
According to [[Plato]], the first king of [[Atlantis]] was also named '''Atlas''', but that Atlas was a son of [[Poseidon]] and the mortal woman Cleito.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''</ref> The works of [[Eusebius]]<ref name=\"Eusebius\"/> and [[Diodorus]]<ref name=\"Diodorus\"/> also give an Atlantean account of Atlas. In these accounts, Atlas' father was [[Uranus]] and his mother was [[Gaia]]. His grandfather was [[Elyon#Sanchuniathon|Elium]] \"King of [[Phoenicia]]\" who lived in [[Byblos]] with his wife [[Baal Berith|Beruth]]. Atlas was raised by his sister, [[Basilea (queen)|Basilia]].<ref>For further comment on Mercator's chosen Titanic genealogy see {{harvp|Keuning|1947}}, {{harvp|Akerman|1994}} and {{harvp|Ramachandran|2015|p=42}}</ref><ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>See {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book III}}, Eusebius' ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' references the same mythology as Diodorus stating \"These then are the principal heads of the theology held among the Atlanteans\".</ref>

====King of Mauretania====
Atlas was also a legendary king of [[Mauretania]], the land of the [[Mauri people|Mauri]] in antiquity roughly corresponding with modern [[Maghreb]]. In the 16th century [[Gerardus Mercator]] put together the first collection of maps to be called an \"[[Atlas]]\" and devoted his book to the \"King of Mauretania\".<ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>{{harvp|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|p=103}}</ref>

Atlas became associated with Northwest Africa over time. He had been connected with the [[Hesperides]], \"Nymphs\" which guarded the [[golden apple]]s, and [[Gorgons]] both of which lived beyond Ocean in the extreme west of the world since [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]].<ref>See {{harvp|Gantz|1993|p=401}} and {{harvp|Ogden|2008|p=47-49}}</ref> [[Diodorus]] and [[Palaephatus]] mention that the Gorgons lived in the Gorgades, islands in the [[Aethiopian Sea]]. The main island was called Cerna and modern day arguments have been advanced that these islands may correspond to [[Cape Verde]] due to [[Phoenicia]]n exploration.<ref>For instance the Phoenician [[Hanno the Navigator]] is said to have sailed as far as [[Mount Cameroon]] in the 5th or 6th century BC. See {{harvp|Lemprière|1833|pp=249-250}} and Ovid, ''The Metamorphoses'', commented by Henry T. Riley {{ISBN|978-1-4209-3395-6}}</ref> The Northwest Africa region emerged as the canonical home of the King via separate sources. In particular, according to Ovid, after Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain range, he flies over [[Aethiopia]], the blood of Medusa's head giving rise to Libyan snakes. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the habit of associating Atlas' home to a chain of mountains, the [[Atlas mountains]], which were near [[Mauretania]] and [[Numidia]], was firmly entrenched.<ref>{{harvp|Lemprière|1833|pp=249-250}}</ref>

<!-- Hatnote at [[Aril]] redirects here -->
The identifying name ''Aril'' is inscribed on two 5th-century BC Etruscan bronze items: a mirror from [[Vulci]] and a ring from an unknown site.<ref>Paolo Martini, ''Il nome etrusco di Atlante'', (Rome:Università di Roma) 1987 investigates the etymology of ''aril'', rejecting a link to the verbal morpheme ''ar-'' (\"support\") in favor of a Phoenician etymon in an unattested possible form ''*'arrab(a)'', signifying \"guarantor in a commercial transaction\" with the connotation of \"mediator\", related to the Latin borrowing ''arillator'', \"middleman\". This section and note depend on Rex Wallace's review of Martini in ''Language'' '''65'''.1 (March 1989:187–188).</ref> Both objects depict the encounter with Atlas of [[Hercle]]—the Etruscan [[Heracles]]—identified by the inscription; they represent rare instances where a figure from [[Greek mythology]] was imported into [[Etruscan mythology]], but the name was not. The Etruscan name ''Aril'' is etymologically independent.

According to Robert Graves' ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', the [[Pelasgians]] believed the creator goddess [[Eurynome (disambiguation)|Eurynome]] assigned Atlas and [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] to govern the [[Moon (mythology)|moon]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Greek Myths|last=Graves|first=Robert|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0140171990|location=|pages=27|quote=|via=}}</ref>

==Genealogy==
Sources describe Atlas as the father, by different goddesses, of numerous children, mostly daughters. Some of these are assigned conflicting or overlapping identities or parentage in different sources.

==Cultural influence==
{{Main|Atlas (disambiguation)}}
Atlas' best-known cultural association is in [[cartography]]. The first publisher to associate the Titan Atlas with a group of maps was the print-seller [[Antonio Lafreri]], on the engraved title-page he applied to his ''ad hoc'' assemblages of maps, ''Tavole Moderne Di Geografia De La Maggior Parte Del Mondo Di Diversi Autori'' (1572);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapforum.com/03/lafrscho.htm|author=Ashley Baynton-Williams|title=The 'Lafreri school' of Italian mapmakers|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> however, he did not use the word \"Atlas\" in the title of his work, an innovation of [[Gerardus Mercator]], who dedicated his \"atlas\" specifically to honour the Titan, Atlas, King of [[Mauretania]], a learned philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer.

In psychology, Atlas is used metaphorically to describe [[Atlas personality|the personality of someone whose childhood was characterized by excessive responsibilities]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vogel|first=L. Z.|last2=Savva|first2=Stavroula|date=1993-12-01|title=Atlas personality|journal=British Journal of Medical Psychology|language=en|volume=66|issue=4|pages=323–330|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.1993.tb01758.x|pmid=8123600|issn=2044-8341}}</ref>

<ref name=\"Diodorus\">Referencing [[Diodorus]]:
*\"[Atlas] perfected the science of astrology and was the first to publish to mankind the doctrine of the sphere.  and it was for this reason that the idea was held that the entire heavens were supported upon the shoulders of Atlas, the myth darkly hinting in this way at his discovery and description of the sphere.\" {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book III 60.2}}
*\"Atlas was so grateful to Heracles for his kindly deed that he not only gladly gave him such assistance as his Labour called for, but he also instructed him quite freely in the knowledge of astrology. For Atlas had worked out the science of astrology to a degree surpassing others and had ingeniously discovered the spherical nature of the stars, and for that reason was generally believed to be bearing the entire firmament upon his shoulders. Similarly in the case of Heracles, when he had brought to the Greeks the doctrine of the sphere, he gained great fame, as if he had taken over the burden of the firmament which Atlas had borne, since men intimated in this enigmatic way what had actually taken place.\" {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book IV 27.4-5}}
</ref>
<ref name=\"Eusebius\">The \"testimony of Eusebius\" was \"drawn from the most ancient historians\" according to Mercator. Eusebius' ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' gives accounts of Atlas that had been translated from the works of [[Phoenicia|ancient Phoenician]] [[Sanchuniathon]], the original sources for which predate the [[Trojan War]] (i.e. 13th century BCE).

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Atlas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|t|l|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἄτλας}}, ''Átlas'') was a [[Titan (mythology)|titan]] condemned to hold up the celestial heavens for eternity after the [[Titanomachy]]. Atlas also plays a role in the myths of two of the greatest [[List of Greek mythological figures#Heroes|Greek heroes]]: [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]] in [[Roman mythology]]) and [[Perseus]]. According to the ancient Greek poet [[Hesiod]], Atlas stood at the ends of the earth in extreme [[Hesperides|west]].<ref name=\"517–520\"/> Later, he became commonly identified with the [[Atlas Mountains]] in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of [[Mauretania]].<ref name=\"Smith\"/> Atlas was said to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. In antiquity, he was credited with inventing the first [[celestial spheres|celestial sphere]]. In some texts, he is even credited with the invention of [[astronomy]] itself.<ref name=\"Diodorus\"/>

Atlas was the son of the Titan [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]] and the [[Oceanid]] [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]]<ref name=\"Pseudo-Apollodorus\"/> or [[Clymene (mythology)|Clymene]].<ref name=\"Asia\"/> He was a brother of [[Epimetheus]] and [[Prometheus]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roman|first=Luke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOgWfjNIxoMC|title=Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology|last2=Roman|first2=Monica|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2639-5|location=|pages=92|language=en}}</ref> He had many children, mostly daughters, the [[Hesperides]], the [[Hyades (mythology)|Hyades]], the [[Pleiades (Greek mythology)|Pleiades]], and the nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] who lived on the island [[Ogygia]].<ref name=\"Daughter\"/>

The term [[Atlas]] has been used to describe a collection of maps since the 16th century when Flemish geographer [[Gerardus Mercator]] published his work in honor of the mythological Titan.

The \"[[Atlantic Ocean]]\" is derived from \"Sea of Atlas\". In Ancient Greek, Plato's Timaeus dialogue also mentions \"Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος\" (English:\"[[Atlantis]] nisos\") meaning \"Atlas's Island\", giving rise to the English derivative: Atlantis (Atlantean / of Atlas).<ref>https://www.dictionary.com/e/atlantis/</ref>

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of the name ''Atlas'' is uncertain. [[Virgil]] took pleasure in translating etymologies of Greek names by combining them with adjectives that explained them: for Atlas his adjective is ''durus'', \"hard, enduring\",<ref>''[[Aeneid]]'' iv.247: \"''Atlantis duri''\" and other instances; see Robert W. Cruttwell, \"Virgil, Aeneid, iv. 247: 'Atlantis Duri'\" ''The Classical Review'' '''59'''.1 (May 1945), p. 11.</ref> which suggested to George Doig<ref>George Doig, \"Vergil's Art and the Greek Language\" ''The Classical Journal'' '''64'''.1 (October 1968, pp. 1-6) p. 2.</ref> that Virgil was aware of the Greek τλῆναι \"to endure\"; Doig offers the further possibility that Virgil was aware of [[Strabo]]'s remark that the native North African name for this mountain was ''Douris''. Since the Atlas mountains rise in the region inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]], it has been suggested that the name might be taken from one of the [[Berber languages|Berber]], specifically ''ádrār'' 'mountain'.<ref>Strabo, 17.3;</ref>

Traditionally historical linguists etymologize the Ancient Greek word Ἄτλας ([[genitive case|genitive]]: Ἄτλαντος) as comprised from copulative α- and the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*telh₂-'' 'to uphold, support' (whence also τλῆναι), and which was later reshaped to an nt-stem.<ref name=\"Beekes\">{{Cite document|title=Etymological Dictionary of Greek |volume=1 |author-link=Robert Beekes |first=Robert |last=Beekes |first2=Lucien |last2=van Beek |page=163 |year=2010 |publisher=Brill|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->&#123;&#123;inconsistent citations&#125;&#125; }}</ref> However, [[Robert Beekes]] argues that it cannot be expected that this ancient Titan carries an Indo-European name, and that the word is of [[Pre-Greek substrate|Pre-Greek]] origin, and such words often end in ''-ant''.<ref name=\"Beekes\"/>

== Mythology ==
===Punishment===
{{main|Titanomachy}}
Atlas and his brother [[Menoetius (mythology)|Menoetius]] sided with the Titans in their war against the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympians]], the [[Titanomachy]]. When the Titans were defeated, many of them (including Menoetius) were confined to [[Tartarus]], but [[Zeus]] condemned Atlas to stand at the western edge of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia (the Earth)]] and hold up the sky on his shoulders.<ref name=\"517–520\"/> Thus, he was ''Atlas Telamon'', \"enduring Atlas,\" and became a doublet of [[Coeus]], the embodiment of the celestial axis around which the heavens revolve.<ref>The usage in [[Virgil]]'s ''maximum Atlas axem umero torquet stellis ardentibus aptum'' (''Aeneid'', iv.481f , cf vi.796f), combining poetic and parascientific images, is discussed in P. R. Hardie, \"Atlas and Axis\" ''The Classical Quarterly'' N.S. '''33'''.1 (1983:220-228).</ref>

A common misconception today is that Atlas was forced to hold the Earth on his shoulders, but Classical art shows Atlas holding the [[celestial spheres]], not the [[globe|terrestrial globe]]; the solidity of the marble globe borne by the renowned [[Farnese Atlas]] may have aided the conflation, reinforced in the 16th century by the developing usage of ''atlas'' to describe a corpus of [[Atlas|terrestrial maps]].

===Encounter with Perseus===

The Greek poet [[Polyidus]] c. 398 BC<ref>[[Polyeidos (poet)|Polyeidos]], Fragment 837; Ovid, 'Metamorphoses'' 4.627''</ref> tells a tale of Atlas, then a shepherd, encountering [[Perseus]] who [[Petrifaction in mythology and fiction|turned him to stone]]. Ovid later gives a more detailed account of the incident, combining it with the myth of Heracles. In this account Atlas is not a shepherd but a King.<ref>Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', IV.617ff ([http://www.theoi.com/Heros/Perseus.html#Atlas on-line English translation at Theoi Project]).</ref> According to Ovid, Perseus arrives in Atlas' Kingdom and asks for shelter, declaring he is a son of Zeus. Atlas, fearful of a prophecy which warned of a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples from his orchard, refuses Perseus hospitality.<ref name=\"LOTN\"/> In this account, Atlas is turned not just into stone by Perseus, but an entire mountain range: Atlas' head the peak, his shoulders ridges and his hair woods. The prophecy did not relate to Perseus stealing the golden apples but [[Heracles]], another son of Zeus, and Perseus' great-grandson.<ref>{{harvp|Ogden|2008|pp=49, 108, 114}}</ref>

===Encounter with Heracles===
{{main|Heracles}}
[[File:Atlas and Hercules.webp|thumb|Atlas and Hercules]]
One of the [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labours]] of the hero [[Heracles]] was to fetch some of the golden apples which grow in [[Hera]]'s garden, tended by Atlas' reputed daughters, the [[Hesperides]] which were also called the Atlantides, and guarded by the dragon [[Ladon (mythology)|Ladon]]. Heracles went to Atlas and offered to hold up the heavens while Atlas got the apples from his daughters.<ref name=\":0\">[[Diodorus Siculus]]. ''Library, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html 4.27.2]''</ref><ref>{{harvp|Gantz|1993|pp=410-413}}</ref>

Upon his return with the apples, however, Atlas attempted to trick Heracles into carrying the sky permanently by offering to deliver the apples himself, as anyone who purposely took the burden must carry it forever, or until someone else took it away. Heracles, suspecting Atlas did not intend to return, pretended to agree to Atlas' offer, asking only that Atlas take the sky again for a few minutes so Heracles could rearrange his cloak as padding on his shoulders. When Atlas set down the apples and took the heavens upon his shoulders again, Heracles took the apples and ran away.

In some versions,<ref>A lost passage of [[Pindar]] quoted by Strabo (3.5.5) was the earliest reference in this context: \"the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by Heracles\"; the passage in Pindar has not been traced.</ref> Heracles instead built the two great [[Pillars of Hercules]] to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas much as he liberated [[Prometheus]].

====King of Atlantis====
According to [[Plato]], the first king of [[Atlantis]] was also named '''Atlas''', but that Atlas was a son of [[Poseidon]] and the mortal woman Cleito.<ref>[[Plato]], ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''</ref> The works of [[Eusebius]]<ref name=\"Eusebius\"/> and [[Diodorus]]<ref name=\"Diodorus\"/> also give an Atlantean account of Atlas. In these accounts, Atlas' father was [[Uranus]] and his mother was [[Gaia]]. His grandfather was [[Elyon#Sanchuniathon|Elium]] \"King of [[Phoenicia]]\" who lived in [[Byblos]] with his wife [[Baal Berith|Beruth]]. Atlas was raised by his sister, [[Basilea (queen)|Basilia]].<ref>For further comment on Mercator's chosen Titanic genealogy see {{harvp|Keuning|1947}}, {{harvp|Akerman|1994}} and {{harvp|Ramachandran|2015|p=42}}</ref><ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>See {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book III}}, Eusebius' ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' references the same mythology as Diodorus stating \"These then are the principal heads of the theology held among the Atlanteans\".</ref>

====King of Mauretania====
Atlas was also a legendary king of [[Mauretania]], the land of the [[Mauri people|Mauri]] in antiquity roughly corresponding with modern [[Maghreb]]. In the 16th century [[Gerardus Mercator]] put together the first collection of maps to be called an \"[[Atlas]]\" and devoted his book to the \"King of Mauretania\".<ref name=\"Mercator\"/><ref>{{harvp|Grafton|Most|Settis|2010|p=103}}</ref>

Atlas became associated with Northwest Africa over time. He had been connected with the [[Hesperides]], \"Nymphs\" which guarded the [[golden apple]]s, and [[Gorgons]] both of which lived beyond Ocean in the extreme west of the world since [[Hesiod]]'s [[Theogony]].<ref>See {{harvp|Gantz|1993|p=401}} and {{harvp|Ogden|2008|p=47-49}}</ref> [[Diodorus]] and [[Palaephatus]] mention that the Gorgons lived in the Gorgades, islands in the [[Aethiopian Sea]]. The main island was called Cerna and modern day arguments have been advanced that these islands may correspond to [[Cape Verde]] due to [[Phoenicia]]n exploration.<ref>For instance the Phoenician [[Hanno the Navigator]] is said to have sailed as far as [[Mount Cameroon]] in the 5th or 6th century BC. See {{harvp|Lemprière|1833|pp=249-250}} and Ovid, ''The Metamorphoses'', commented by Henry T. Riley {{ISBN|978-1-4209-3395-6}}</ref> The Northwest Africa region emerged as the canonical home of the King via separate sources. In particular, according to Ovid, after Perseus turns Atlas into a mountain range, he flies over [[Aethiopia]], the blood of Medusa's head giving rise to Libyan snakes. By the time of the [[Roman Empire]] the habit of associating Atlas' home to a chain of mountains, the [[Atlas mountains]], which were near [[Mauretania]] and [[Numidia]], was firmly entrenched.<ref>{{harvp|Lemprière|1833|pp=249-250}}</ref>

====Other====
<!-- Hatnote at [[Aril]] redirects here -->
The identifying name ''Aril'' is inscribed on two 5th-century BC Etruscan bronze items: a mirror from [[Vulci]] and a ring from an unknown site.<ref>Paolo Martini, ''Il nome etrusco di Atlante'', (Rome:Università di Roma) 1987 investigates the etymology of ''aril'', rejecting a link to the verbal morpheme ''ar-'' (\"support\") in favor of a Phoenician etymon in an unattested possible form ''*'arrab(a)'', signifying \"guarantor in a commercial transaction\" with the connotation of \"mediator\", related to the Latin borrowing ''arillator'', \"middleman\". This section and note depend on Rex Wallace's review of Martini in ''Language'' '''65'''.1 (March 1989:187–188).</ref> Both objects depict the encounter with Atlas of [[Hercle]]—the Etruscan [[Heracles]]—identified by the inscription; they represent rare instances where a figure from [[Greek mythology]] was imported into [[Etruscan mythology]], but the name was not. The Etruscan name ''Aril'' is etymologically independent.

According to Robert Graves' ''[[The Greek Myths]]'', the [[Pelasgians]] believed the creator goddess [[Eurynome (disambiguation)|Eurynome]] assigned Atlas and [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] to govern the [[Moon (mythology)|moon]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Greek Myths|last=Graves|first=Robert|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0140171990|location=|pages=27|quote=|via=}}</ref>

==Genealogy==
Sources describe Atlas as the father, by different goddesses, of numerous children, mostly daughters. Some of these are assigned conflicting or overlapping identities or parentage in different sources.

==Cultural influence==
{{Main|Atlas (disambiguation)}}
Atlas' best-known cultural association is in [[cartography]]. The first publisher to associate the Titan Atlas with a group of maps was the print-seller [[Antonio Lafreri]], on the engraved title-page he applied to his ''ad hoc'' assemblages of maps, ''Tavole Moderne Di Geografia De La Maggior Parte Del Mondo Di Diversi Autori'' (1572);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mapforum.com/03/lafrscho.htm|author=Ashley Baynton-Williams|title=The 'Lafreri school' of Italian mapmakers|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> however, he did not use the word \"Atlas\" in the title of his work, an innovation of [[Gerardus Mercator]], who dedicated his \"atlas\" specifically to honour the Titan, Atlas, King of [[Mauretania]], a learned philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer.

In psychology, Atlas is used metaphorically to describe [[Atlas personality|the personality of someone whose childhood was characterized by excessive responsibilities]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Vogel|first=L. Z.|last2=Savva|first2=Stavroula|date=1993-12-01|title=Atlas personality|journal=British Journal of Medical Psychology|language=en|volume=66|issue=4|pages=323–330|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8341.1993.tb01758.x|pmid=8123600|issn=2044-8341}}</ref>

<ref name=\"Diodorus\">Referencing [[Diodorus]]:
*\"[Atlas] perfected the science of astrology and was the first to publish to mankind the doctrine of the sphere.  and it was for this reason that the idea was held that the entire heavens were supported upon the shoulders of Atlas, the myth darkly hinting in this way at his discovery and description of the sphere.\" {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book III 60.2}}
*\"Atlas was so grateful to Heracles for his kindly deed that he not only gladly gave him such assistance as his Labour called for, but he also instructed him quite freely in the knowledge of astrology. For Atlas had worked out the science of astrology to a degree surpassing others and had ingeniously discovered the spherical nature of the stars, and for that reason was generally believed to be bearing the entire firmament upon his shoulders. Similarly in the case of Heracles, when he had brought to the Greeks the doctrine of the sphere, he gained great fame, as if he had taken over the burden of the firmament which Atlas had borne, since men intimated in this enigmatic way what had actually taken place.\" {{harvp|''Bibliotheca historica''|loc=Book IV 27.4-5}}
</ref>
<ref name=\"Eusebius\">The \"testimony of Eusebius\" was \"drawn from the most ancient historians\" according to Mercator. Eusebius' ''[[Praeparatio evangelica]]'' gives accounts of Atlas that had been translated from the works of [[Phoenicia|ancient Phoenician]] [[Sanchuniathon]], the original sources for which predate the [[Trojan War]] (i.e. 13th century BCE).

[[File:Hyperlink-Wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|An example of a hyperlink with a mouse pointer hovering above it]]
[[File:Sistema hipertextual.jpg|thumb|Several documents being connected by hyperlinks.]]

In [[computing]], a '''hyperlink''', or simply a '''link''', is a reference to [[Data (computing)|data]] that the [[user (computing)|user]] can follow by [[point and click|clicking]] or [[touchscreen|tapping]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp|title=HTML Links|website=www.w3schools.com|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. [[Hypertext]] is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called [[anchor text]]. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a ''hypertext system'', and to create a hyperlink is ''to hyperlink'' (or simply ''to link''). A user following hyperlinks is said to ''navigate'' or ''browse'' the hypertext.

The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in an online reference work such as [[Wikipedia]], or [[Google]], many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] such as tables of contents, [[footnotes]], [[bibliographies]], [[index (publishing)|indexes]], [[letter (message)|letters]] and [[glossaries]].

In some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as [[HTML element#Anchor|anchors]] and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the [[World Wide Web]] most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab<ref>See https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tabbrows.htm</ref>). Another possibility is [[transclusion]], for which the link target is a document [[:wikt:fragment|fragment]] that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web ''spider'' or [[Web crawler|crawler]].

==Types of links==

===Inline links===
An [[Inline linking|inline link]] displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.

An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a [[thumbnail]], [[Image resolution|low resolution]] [[Preview (computing)|preview]], [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] section, or [[magnification|magnified]] section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with [[desktop publishing|print publishing]] software – e.g., with an [[external link]]. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a [[page layout]].

===Anchor===
An anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|title=Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Virtual Reality: Models, Systems, and Application: First International Conference, MHVR'94, Moscow, Russia September (14–16), 1996.

For instance, it may also be a ''hot area'' in an image ([[image map]] in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a [[Politics of Africa|political map of Africa]] may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping [[Skin (computing)|skins]] or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.

===Fat link===
A '''fat link''' (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\"<ref>\"[http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#extended-link XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.0]\" accessed 2010-1-27</ref>) or a \"multi-tailed link\" <ref>\"HTML, Web Browsers, and Other Paraphernalia\" accessed 2011-08-15 https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143743/http://people.duke.edu/~mshumate/fiction/htt/tools.html#fatlink</ref> is a [[hyperlink]] which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a [[multivalued function]].

==Uses in various technologies==

===HTML===
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the [[Internet]]. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language [[HTML]].

This is what a hyperlink to the home page of the [[W3C organization]] could look like in HTML code:

<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">
<a href=\"http://www.w3.org\">W3C organization website</a>
</syntaxhighlight>
      
This HTML code consists of several [[HTML element|tags]]:
* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag '''<nowiki><a</nowiki>''', and includes a hyperlink reference '''<nowiki>href=\"http://www.w3.org</nowiki>\"''' to the '''URL''' for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)
* The [[URL]] is followed by '''>''', marking the end of the anchor opening tag.
* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.
* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).
* The anchor closing tag ('''<nowiki></a></nowiki>''') terminates the hyperlink code.

[[Webgraph]] is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], formed from [[web page]]s as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.

===XLink: hyperlinks ===
{{Main article|XLink}}

The [[W3C]] [[W3C#Recommendations and Certifications|Recommendation]] called '''[[XLink]]''' describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These '''extended links''' can be ''multidirectional'', linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe ''simple links'', which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.

===Wikis=== <!-- As of September 2016, this header is linked to by the redirect [[Wikilink]], so please don't change the header without adding the current title as an anchor. Also please leave '''wikilinks''' in bold.   -->
{{Glossary term|Wikilink|wikilink}}
While [[wiki]]s may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of [[wiki markup]], a set of [[lightweight markup language]]s specifically for wikis, provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments—in other words, for creating '''wikilinks'''.
[[File:Wiki-linking.png|thumb|alt=Simple image demonstrating how internal [[MediaWiki]] links work (that is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title: two opening square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two closing square brackets.| How internal [[MediaWiki]] links work when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title. ]]

The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] used [[CamelCase]] for this purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of [[Wikipedia]] and is still used in some wikis, such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]], and [[PmWiki]]. A common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the term to be wikilinked. For example, the input \"<nowiki>[[zebras]]</nowiki>\" is converted by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a [[zebras]] article.
Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
* '''Internal wikilinks''' or '''intrawiki links''' lead to pages within the same wiki website.
* '''[[Interwiki links]]''' are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages of other wikis that are associated with the first.
* '''External links''' lead to other webpages (those not covered in the above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that don't yet exist, which are instead shown in [[redlink|red]].<ref>Wikipedia: the missing manual By John Broughton, 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-51516-2}}, [https://archive.org/details/wikipediamissing00brou_0/page/75 p. 75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA75 |date=2018-02-07 }}</ref> Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question mark after the wikilinked term.

===Virtual worlds===
{{main article|Hyperlinks in virtual worlds}}
Hyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D [[virtual world]] networks, including those that use the [[OpenSimulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid |title=Hypergrid – OpenSim |publisher=Opensimulator.org |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> and [[Open Cobalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |title=Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces – Cobalt – DukeWiki |publisher=Wiki.duke.edu |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184439/https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |archivedate=2012-12-21 }}</ref> platforms.

=== Permalinks ===
{{Main|Digital preservation}}
Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlink that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to [[Pointer (computer programming)#Typed pointers and casting|point]] and [[URL redirection#Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs|redirect]] readers to the same [[Web page]], blog post or any online digital media<ref name=\"techopedia.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | title = Definition of Permanent Link (Permalink)  | website = techopedia.com | language = en | access-date = Oct 31, 2018 | archive-url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | archive-date = March 2, 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>.

The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in [[BMC Bioinformatics]] analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters’ [[Web of Science]] [[Science citation index|citation index]], founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<ref>{{cite web | first = Leighton | last = W.

==How hyperlinks work in HTML==
A link from one domain to another is said to be ''outbound'' from its source anchor and [[inbound link|''inbound'']] to its target.

The most common destination anchor is a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] used in the [[World Wide Web]]. This can refer to a document, e.g. a [[webpage]], or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an [[HTML element]] with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a [[fragment identifier]] —   \"#''id attribute''\" — appended.

When linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"''id attribute''\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#''page=386''\".

===Link behavior in web browsers===
A [[web browser]] usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different [[color]], [[font]] or [[Typeface|style]]. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) language.

In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a [[computer mouse|mouse]] [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] may change into a [[hand]] motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the [[user (computing)|user]] activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the [[file type]] and on the browser and its [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], another program may be activated to open the file.

The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:
* '''link destination''' (\"href\" pointing to a URL)
* '''[[Anchor text|link label]]'''
* '''link title'''
* '''link target'''
* '''link class''' or '''link id'''

It uses the [[HTML anchor|HTML element \"a\"]] with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|title=Making a Server (\"HREF\" is for \"hypertext reference\")|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=2012-10-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025220948/http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|archivedate=2012-10-25|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref>) and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"[[Cascading Style Sheets|class]]\" or \"id\":

:<samp>&lt;a href=\"''URL''\" title=\"''link title''\" target=\"''link target''\" class=\"''link class''\"&gt;''link label''&lt;/a&gt;</samp>

To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:

:<code><nowiki><a href=\"http://example.com/\">Example</a></nowiki></code>

In a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.

When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular [[Window (computing)|window]], but in a special [[Mouse hover|hover box]], which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the [[status bar]].

Normally, a link opens in the current [[framing (World Wide Web)|frame]] or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

Creation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.

Another special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.

==History==
[[File:SRI ARC Engelbart Nov 1969.jpg|thumb|Douglas Engelbart and his team at [[SRI International|SRI]], 1969]]
The term \"hyperlink\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by [[Ted Nelson]] at the start of [[Project Xanadu]]. Nelson had been inspired by \"[[As We May Think]]\", a popular 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]]. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the [[Memex]]) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.

In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by [[Autodesk]] in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by [[Douglas Engelbart]] (with [[Jeff Rulifson]] as chief [[programmer]]) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. [[Ben Shneiderman]] working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/ HyperTIES system] in 1983.  HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web.  In 1988, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.{{cn|date=February 2019|reason=First electronic book is a bold claim.}}

A database program [[HyperCard]] was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, [[Windows Help]], which was introduced with [[Microsoft Windows 3.0]], had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single [[Online help|help file]] together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic browser]] (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.

==Legal issues==
{{Main article|Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing}}

While hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.

Contentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.<ref>See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.</ref>

In certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks. After [[litigation]], a [[court]] found for Prodigy, ruling that [[British Telecom]]'s patent did not cover web hyperlinks.<ref>[[CNET]] News.com, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030207070416/http://news.com.com/2100-1033-955001.html Hyperlink patent case fails to click]. August 23, 2002.</ref>

In [[United States]] ''[[jurisprudence]]'', there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or [[copyright infringement|infringing]] (e.g., illegal MP3 copies).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041507/http://www.cybertelecom.org/ip/link.htm Cybertelecom:: Legal to Link?]&nbsp; The ''Internet Archive''.

[[File:Hyperlink-Wikipedia.svg|thumb|250px|An example of a hyperlink with a mouse pointer hovering above it]]
[[File:Sistema hipertextual.jpg|thumb|Several documents being connected by hyperlinks.]]

In [[computing]], a '''hyperlink''', or simply a '''link''', is a reference to [[Data (computing)|data]] that the [[user (computing)|user]] can follow by [[point and click|clicking]] or [[touchscreen|tapping]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp|title=HTML Links|website=www.w3schools.com|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. [[Hypertext]] is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called [[anchor text]]. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a ''hypertext system'', and to create a hyperlink is ''to hyperlink'' (or simply ''to link''). A user following hyperlinks is said to ''navigate'' or ''browse'' the hypertext.

The document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in an online reference work such as [[Wikipedia]], or [[Google]], many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] such as tables of contents, [[footnotes]], [[bibliographies]], [[index (publishing)|indexes]], [[letter (message)|letters]] and [[glossaries]].

In some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as [[HTML element#Anchor|anchors]] and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the [[World Wide Web]] most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new [[Tab (interface)|tab]]<ref>See https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tabbrows.htm</ref>). Another possibility is [[transclusion]], for which the link target is a document [[:wikt:fragment|fragment]] that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web ''spider'' or [[Web crawler|crawler]].

==Types of links==

===Inline links===
An [[Inline linking|inline link]] displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.

An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a [[thumbnail]], [[Image resolution|low resolution]] [[Preview (computing)|preview]], [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] section, or [[magnification|magnified]] section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with [[desktop publishing|print publishing]] software – e.g., with an [[external link]]. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a [[page layout]].

===Anchor===
An anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|title=Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Virtual Reality: Models, Systems, and Application: First International Conference, MHVR'94, Moscow, Russia September (14–16), 1996.

For instance, it may also be a ''hot area'' in an image ([[image map]] in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a [[Politics of Africa|political map of Africa]] may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping [[Skin (computing)|skins]] or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.

===Fat link===
A '''fat link''' (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\"<ref>\"[http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#extended-link XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.0]\" accessed 2010-1-27</ref>) or a \"multi-tailed link\" <ref>\"HTML, Web Browsers, and Other Paraphernalia\" accessed 2011-08-15 https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143743/http://people.duke.edu/~mshumate/fiction/htt/tools.html#fatlink</ref> is a [[hyperlink]] which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a [[multivalued function]].

==Uses in various technologies==

===HTML===
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the [[Internet]]. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language [[HTML]].

This is what a hyperlink to the home page of the [[W3C organization]] could look like in HTML code:

<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">
<a href=\"http://www.w3.org\">W3C organization website</a>
</syntaxhighlight>
      
This HTML code consists of several [[HTML element|tags]]:
* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag '''<nowiki><a</nowiki>''', and includes a hyperlink reference '''<nowiki>href=\"http://www.w3.org</nowiki>\"''' to the '''URL''' for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)
* The [[URL]] is followed by '''>''', marking the end of the anchor opening tag.
* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.
* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).
* The anchor closing tag ('''<nowiki></a></nowiki>''') terminates the hyperlink code.

[[Webgraph]] is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], formed from [[web page]]s as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.

===XLink: hyperlinks ===
{{Main article|XLink}}

The [[W3C]] [[W3C#Recommendations and Certifications|Recommendation]] called '''[[XLink]]''' describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These '''extended links''' can be ''multidirectional'', linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe ''simple links'', which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.

===Wikis=== <!-- As of September 2016, this header is linked to by the redirect [[Wikilink]], so please don't change the header without adding the current title as an anchor. Also please leave '''wikilinks''' in bold.   -->
{{Glossary term|Wikilink|wikilink}}
While [[wiki]]s may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of [[wiki markup]], a set of [[lightweight markup language]]s specifically for wikis, provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments—in other words, for creating '''wikilinks'''.
[[File:Wiki-linking.png|thumb|alt=Simple image demonstrating how internal [[MediaWiki]] links work (that is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title: two opening square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two closing square brackets.| How internal [[MediaWiki]] links work when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title. ]]

The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] used [[CamelCase]] for this purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of [[Wikipedia]] and is still used in some wikis, such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]], and [[PmWiki]]. A common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the term to be wikilinked. For example, the input \"<nowiki>[[zebras]]</nowiki>\" is converted by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a [[zebras]] article.
Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
* '''Internal wikilinks''' or '''intrawiki links''' lead to pages within the same wiki website.
* '''[[Interwiki links]]''' are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages of other wikis that are associated with the first.
* '''External links''' lead to other webpages (those not covered in the above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that don't yet exist, which are instead shown in [[redlink|red]].<ref>Wikipedia: the missing manual By John Broughton, 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-51516-2}}, [https://archive.org/details/wikipediamissing00brou_0/page/75 p. 75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA75 |date=2018-02-07 }}</ref> Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question mark after the wikilinked term.

===Virtual worlds===
{{main article|Hyperlinks in virtual worlds}}
Hyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D [[virtual world]] networks, including those that use the [[OpenSimulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid |title=Hypergrid – OpenSim |publisher=Opensimulator.org |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> and [[Open Cobalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |title=Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces – Cobalt – DukeWiki |publisher=Wiki.duke.edu |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184439/https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |archivedate=2012-12-21 }}</ref> platforms.

=== Permalinks ===
{{Main|Digital preservation}}
Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlink that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to [[Pointer (computer programming)#Typed pointers and casting|point]] and [[URL redirection#Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs|redirect]] readers to the same [[Web page]], blog post or any online digital media<ref name=\"techopedia.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | title = Definition of Permanent Link (Permalink)  | website = techopedia.com | language = en | access-date = Oct 31, 2018 | archive-url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | archive-date = March 2, 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>.

The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in [[BMC Bioinformatics]] analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters’ [[Web of Science]] [[Science citation index|citation index]], founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<ref>{{cite web | first = Leighton | last = W.

==How hyperlinks work in HTML==
A link from one domain to another is said to be ''outbound'' from its source anchor and [[inbound link|''inbound'']] to its target.

The most common destination anchor is a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] used in the [[World Wide Web]]. This can refer to a document, e.g. a [[webpage]], or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an [[HTML element]] with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a [[fragment identifier]] —   \"#''id attribute''\" — appended.

When linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"''id attribute''\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#''page=386''\".

===Link behavior in web browsers===
A [[web browser]] usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different [[color]], [[font]] or [[Typeface|style]]. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) language.

In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a [[computer mouse|mouse]] [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] may change into a [[hand]] motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the [[user (computing)|user]] activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the [[file type]] and on the browser and its [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], another program may be activated to open the file.

The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:
* '''link destination''' (\"href\" pointing to a URL)
* '''[[Anchor text|link label]]'''
* '''link title'''
* '''link target'''
* '''link class''' or '''link id'''

It uses the [[HTML anchor|HTML element \"a\"]] with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|title=Making a Server (\"HREF\" is for \"hypertext reference\")|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=2012-10-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025220948/http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|archivedate=2012-10-25|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref>) and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"[[Cascading Style Sheets|class]]\" or \"id\":

:<samp>&lt;a href=\"''URL''\" title=\"''link title''\" target=\"''link target''\" class=\"''link class''\"&gt;''link label''&lt;/a&gt;</samp>

To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:

:<code><nowiki><a href=\"http://example.com/\">Example</a></nowiki></code>

In a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.

When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular [[Window (computing)|window]], but in a special [[Mouse hover|hover box]], which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the [[status bar]].

Normally, a link opens in the current [[framing (World Wide Web)|frame]] or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

Creation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.

Another special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.

==History==
[[File:SRI ARC Engelbart Nov 1969.jpg|thumb|Douglas Engelbart and his team at [[SRI International|SRI]], 1969]]
The term \"hyperlink\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by [[Ted Nelson]] at the start of [[Project Xanadu]]. Nelson had been inspired by \"[[As We May Think]]\", a popular 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]]. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the [[Memex]]) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.

In a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by [[Autodesk]] in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by [[Douglas Engelbart]] (with [[Jeff Rulifson]] as chief [[programmer]]) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. [[Ben Shneiderman]] working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/ HyperTIES system] in 1983.  HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web.  In 1988, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.{{cn|date=February 2019|reason=First electronic book is a bold claim.}}

A database program [[HyperCard]] was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, [[Windows Help]], which was introduced with [[Microsoft Windows 3.0]], had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single [[Online help|help file]] together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic browser]] (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.

==Legal issues==
{{Main article|Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing}}

While hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.

Contentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.<ref>See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.</ref>

In certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks. After [[litigation]], a [[court]] found for Prodigy, ruling that [[British Telecom]]'s patent did not cover web hyperlinks.<ref>[[CNET]] News.com, [https://web.archive.org/web/20030207070416/http://news.com.com/2100-1033-955001.html Hyperlink patent case fails to click]. August 23, 2002.</ref>

In [[United States]] ''[[jurisprudence]]'', there is a distinction between the mere act of linking to someone else's website, and linking to content that is illegal (e.g., gambling illegal in the US) or [[copyright infringement|infringing]] (e.g., illegal MP3 copies).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629041507/http://www.cybertelecom.org/ip/link.htm Cybertelecom:: Legal to Link?]&nbsp; The ''Internet Archive''.

The cemetery in its original form—the northwestern wooded area—opened in 1839, as part of a plan to provide seven large, modern cemeteries, now known as the \"[[Magnificent Seven, London|Magnificent Seven]]\", around the outside of central London. The inner-city cemeteries, mostly the graveyards attached to individual churches, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. The initial design was by architect and entrepreneur [[Stephen Geary]].

On Monday 20 May 1839, Highgate (West) Cemetery was dedicated to [[James, son of Alphaeus|St. James]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|website=Highgate Cemetery|publisher=Highgate Cemetery|accessdate=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124082617/http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|archive-date=24 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> by the Right Reverend [[Charles James Blomfield]], Lord [[Bishop of London]]. Fifteen acres were consecrated for the use of the [[Church of England]], and two acres set aside for [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. Rights of burial were sold for either limited period or in perpetuity. The first burial was Elizabeth Jackson of Little Windmill Street, [[Soho]], on 26 May.

Highgate, like the others of the Magnificent Seven, soon became a fashionable place for burials and was much admired and visited. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] attitude to death and its presentation led to the creation of a wealth of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] tombs and buildings. It occupies a spectacular south-facing hillside site slightly downhill from the top of the hill of Highgate itself, next to Waterlow Park. In 1854 the area to the east of the original area across Swains Lane was bought to form the eastern part of the cemetery. Both the cemeteries are still used today for burials, but these areas are closed to the public. Most of the open unforested area in the East Cemetery still has fairly few graves on it.

The cemetery's grounds are full of trees, shrubbery and wildflowers, most of which have been planted and grown without human influence. The grounds are a haven for birds and small animals such as foxes.

Because of the Karl Marx association a variety of [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders and thinkers are buried within the cemetery grounds.

Highgate Cemetery was featured in the popular media from the 1960s to the late 1980s for its so-called [[occult]] past, particularly as being the alleged site of the \"[[Highgate Vampire]]\".

==Friends of Highgate Cemetery==
The Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust was set up in 1975 and acquired the freehold of both East and West Cemeteries by 1981, since when they have had responsibility for the maintenance of the location. In 1984 they published ''Highgate Cemetery: Victorian Valhalla'' by [[John Gay (photographer)|John Gay]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/ | title = A Brief History of Highgate Cemetery}}</ref>

==Location==
The [[cemetery]] comprises two sites on either side of Swains Lane in [[Highgate]], [[N postcode area|N6]], next to [[Waterlow Park]]. The main gate is located on Swains Lane just north of Oakshott Avenue. There is another disused gate on Chester Road. The cemetery is in the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]]. The nearest transport link is [[Transport for London]] C11 bus Brookfield Park stop or [[Archway tube station]].

==History and setting==
The cemetery in its original form—the northwestern wooded area—opened in 1839, as part of a plan to provide seven large, modern cemeteries, now known as the \"[[Magnificent Seven, London|Magnificent Seven]]\", around the outside of central London. The inner-city cemeteries, mostly the graveyards attached to individual churches, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. The initial design was by architect and entrepreneur [[Stephen Geary]].

On Monday 20 May 1839, Highgate (West) Cemetery was dedicated to [[James, son of Alphaeus|St. James]]<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|website=Highgate Cemetery|publisher=Highgate Cemetery|accessdate=21 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170124082617/http://highgatecemetery.org/about/history|archive-date=24 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> by the Right Reverend [[Charles James Blomfield]], Lord [[Bishop of London]]. Fifteen acres were consecrated for the use of the [[Church of England]], and two acres set aside for [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. Rights of burial were sold for either limited period or in perpetuity. The first burial was Elizabeth Jackson of Little Windmill Street, [[Soho]], on 26 May.

Highgate, like the others of the Magnificent Seven, soon became a fashionable place for burials and was much admired and visited. The [[Victorian era|Victorian]] attitude to death and its presentation led to the creation of a wealth of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] tombs and buildings. It occupies a spectacular south-facing hillside site slightly downhill from the top of the hill of Highgate itself, next to Waterlow Park. In 1854 the area to the east of the original area across Swains Lane was bought to form the eastern part of the cemetery. Both the cemeteries are still used today for burials, but these areas are closed to the public. Most of the open unforested area in the East Cemetery still has fairly few graves on it.

The cemetery's grounds are full of trees, shrubbery and wildflowers, most of which have been planted and grown without human influence. The grounds are a haven for birds and small animals such as foxes.

Because of the Karl Marx association a variety of [[Socialism|socialist]] leaders and thinkers are buried within the cemetery grounds.

Highgate Cemetery was featured in the popular media from the 1960s to the late 1980s for its so-called [[occult]] past, particularly as being the alleged site of the \"[[Highgate Vampire]]\".

==Friends of Highgate Cemetery==
The Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust was set up in 1975 and acquired the freehold of both East and West Cemeteries by 1981, since when they have had responsibility for the maintenance of the location. In 1984 they published ''Highgate Cemetery: Victorian Valhalla'' by [[John Gay (photographer)|John Gay]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.highgate-cemetery.org/ | title = A Brief History of Highgate Cemetery}}</ref>

Funk & Wagnalls continued to publish revised editions for several years independently of Encarta, but then ceased printing in the late 1990s.

===Launch===
The name ''Encarta'' was created for Microsoft by an advertising agency<ref>Harvard Business School Case Study 'Blown to Bits'</ref> and launched in 1993 as a $395 product,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v9TVJ_G_sk8C&pg=RA1-PA349&dq=encarta+$395+launch+microsoft+1993&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMInp3O6NzmxgIVohOmCh3-jg2n#v=onepage&q=encarta%20%24395%20launch%20microsoft%201993&f=false \"Coming Attractions: Encyclopedias\"], 22 Dec 1992, PC Mag</ref> although it soon dropped to $99, and was often [[software bundling|bundled]] into the price of a new computer purchase.<ref name=STROSS>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/business/03digi.html \"Encyclopedic Knowledge, Then vs. Now\"],  Randall Stross, May 2, 2009, ''New York Times''</ref><ref name=brit>[http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2009/04/encarta-rip-cont-a-reply-from-tom-corddry/ Tom Corddry]: \"''Encarta'' was not given away but sold at retail for about $100, and sold wholesale to PC manufacturers who bundled it with new machines.\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Crisis at Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/greenstein/images/htm/Research/Cases/EncyclopaediaBritannica.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325042059/http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/greenstein/images/htm/Research/Cases/EncyclopaediaBritannica.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-03-25|work=[[Kellogg School of Management]]|publisher=[[Northwestern University]]|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, Microsoft added content from ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and ''New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia'' from [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] into ''Encarta'' after purchasing them. Thus the final Microsoft ''Encarta'' can be considered the successor of the ''Funk and Wagnalls'', ''Collier'', and ''New Merit Scholar'' encyclopedias. None of these formerly successful encyclopedias remained in print for long after being merged into ''Encarta''.

Microsoft introduced several regional versions of ''Encarta'' translated into languages other than English. For example, the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version was introduced in 1999 and suspended in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/brasil/encarta/ |title=Bem-vindo à Microsoft Brasil |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref> The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version was somewhat smaller than the English one, at 42,000 articles.

===Move to the web===
In 2000, the full ''Encarta'' content became available on the [[World Wide Web]] to subscribers, with a subset available for free to anyone.<ref name=STROSS />

===Demise===
In July 2006, Websters Multimedia, a [[Bellevue, Washington]] subsidiary of London-based Websters International Publishers, took over maintenance of ''Encarta'' from Microsoft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webstersmultimedia.com/WhoWeAre.asp |title=Websters International Publishers – Who We Are|publisher=Webstersmultimedia.com|access-date=2012-03-13|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322032031/http://www.webstersmultimedia.com/WhoWeAre.asp|archivedate=2012-03-22}}</ref> The last version was ''Encarta Premium'' 2009, released in August 2008.<ref name=\"Encarta2009\"/>

{{anchor|Closure}}
Microsoft announced in April 2009 that it would cease to sell [[Microsoft Student]] and all editions of ''Encarta Premium'' software products worldwide by June 2009, citing changes in the way people seek information, and in the traditional encyclopedia and reference material market, as the key reasons behind the termination.<ref name=\"EncartaDead\"/> Updates for ''Encarta'' were offered until October 2009.<ref name=\"EncartaDead\"/> Additionally, MSN ''Encarta'' web sites were discontinued around October 31, 2009, with the exception of ''Encarta Japan'' which was discontinued on December 31, 2009. Existing MSN ''Encarta Premium'' (part of [[MSN Dial-up|MSN Premium]]) subscribers were refunded.<ref name=\"EncartaDead\"/>

The demise of ''Encarta'' was widely attributed to competition from the free and user-generated [[Wikipedia]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/162320/what_was_encarta_look_it_up_on_wikipedia.html|title=What Was Encarta?

==Contents and features==
''Encarta''{{'}}s standard edition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/products/encarta/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=001 |title=Microsoft Encarta Product Details |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref> included approximately 50,000 articles, with additional images, videos and sounds. The premium editions contained over 62,000 articles and other [[multimedia]] content, such as 25,000 pictures and illustrations, over 300 videos and animations, and an interactive atlas with 1.8 million locations. Its articles were integrated with multimedia content and could include links to websites selected by its [[editing|editors]]. ''Encarta''{{'}}s articles in general were less lengthy and more summarized than the printed version of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' or the online [[Wikipedia]]. Like most multimedia encyclopedias, ''Encarta''{{'}}s articles tended to provide an overview of the subject rather than an exhaustive coverage and can only be viewed one at a time.

A sidebar could display alternative views, [[essay]]s, journals or original materials relevant to the topic. For example, when reading about [[computer]]s, it featured annals since 1967 of the computer industry. ''Encarta'' also supported [[closed captioning]] for the hearing impaired. A separate program, called ''Encarta Research Organizer'' was included in early versions for gathering and organizing information and constructing a Word document-based report. Later versions included ''Encarta Researcher'', a browser plugin to organize information from ''Encarta'' articles and web pages into research projects. Content copied from ''Encarta'' was appended with a [[copyright]] boilerplate message after the selection. The user interface allowed for viewing content with only images, videos, sounds, animations, 360-degree views, virtual tours, charts and tables or only interactives.

Encarta was originally available for sale on 1 to 5 [[CD-ROM]]s or a [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/1997/04/01/encarta-97-adds-content-extra-cd.aspx|title=Encarta 97 Adds Content, Extra CD|quote=Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia now comes in two versions: the award-winning Encarta 97 Encyclopedia on a single compact disc, and the new two-CD Encarta 97 Encyclopedia, Deluxe Edition.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.microsoft.com/2002/06/27/microsoft-encarta-reference-library-2003-takes-the-work-out-of-homework/|title=Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2003 Takes the Work Out of Homework|quote=The Encarta Reference Library 2003 five-disc CD-ROM and single-disk DVD have an estimated retail price** of $74.95 (U.S.) before a $10 (U.S.) mail-in rebate.}}</ref> Some new PCs were shipped with an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] edition of Encarta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Packard+Bell+ups+the+value+of+its+computers+with+huge+new+software...-a017230846|title=Packard Bell ups the value of its computers with huge new software bundle.|quote=For pure reference, Packard Bell is providing ``Microsoft(R) Encarta(TM) '95,''}}</ref>

''Encarta 2000'' and later had \"Map Treks\", which were tours of geographic features and concepts. Microsoft had a separate product known as ''Encarta Africana'' which was an encyclopedia of black history and culture. It was integrated into the standard ''Encarta Reference'' suite starting with the 2001 version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/aug00/encartaexpandedpr.mspx |title=Award-Winning Encarta Africana Included in Suite for the First Time |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604164331/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/aug00/encartaexpandedpr.mspx |archivedate=2011-06-04 }}</ref> ''Encarta 2002'' and onward feature ''3D Virtual Tours'' of ancient structures, for example the [[Acropolis]]; 2D panoramic images of world wonders or major cities; and a virtual flight feature which allows users to fly a virtual [[airplane]] over a coarsely generated artificial [[landscape]] area. Version ''2002'' also introduced the ability to install the entire encyclopedia locally to the hard disk drive to prevent frequent swapping of discs.

''Encarta 2003'' incorporated literature guides and book summaries, foreign language translation dictionaries, a ''Homework Center'' and ''Chart Maker''. ''Encarta''{{'}}s ''Visual Browser'', available since the 2004 version, presented a user with a list of related topics making them more discoverable. A collection of 32 [[Discovery Channel]] videos were also later added. ''Encarta 2005'' introduced another program called ''Encarta Kids'' aimed at children to make learning fun.

''Encarta'' also included a [[trivia]] game called \"MindMaze\" (accessible through Ctrl+Z) in which the player explores a castle by answering questions whose answers can be found in the encyclopedia's articles. There was also a \"Geography Quiz\" and several other games and quizzes, some quizzes also in ''Encarta Kids''.

For years, ''Encarta'' came in three primary software editions: Standard, Premium, and Reference Library (price and features in that order). Beginning with ''Encarta 2006'', however, when ''Websters Multimedia'' took over its maintenance, ''Encarta'' became a feature of Microsoft Student. Although it was possible to purchase only the ''Encarta'' encyclopedia separately, Microsoft Student bundles together ''Encarta Premium'' with [[Microsoft Math]] (a [[graphing calculator|graphing-calculator]] program) and Learning Essentials, which provides templates for [[Microsoft Office]]. In addition, the Reference Library was discontinued, absorbed into a newer, more comprehensive Premium package. ''Encarta''{{'}}s user interface was shared with Microsoft Student, and was streamlined to reduce clutter with only a Search box which returned relevant results; however it became no longer possible to simply browse all the encyclopedia articles alphabetically.

===World Atlas===
The dynamic maps were generated with the same engine that powered [[Microsoft MapPoint]] software. The map was a [[virtual globe]] that one could freely rotate and magnify to any location down to major streets for big cities. The globe had multiple surfaces displaying political boundaries, physical landmarks, historical maps and statistical information. One could selectively display statistical values on the globe surface or in a tabular form, different sized cities, various geological or man-made features and [[latitude and longitude|reference lines]] in a map.

The maps contained [[hyperlink]]s to related articles (\"Map Trek\") and also supported a \"Dynamic Sensor\" that provides the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], [[toponym|place name]], [[population]] and [[time zone|local time]] for any point on the globe. ''Encarta'' also generated a visible-light moon atlas with names of major [[list of craters on the Moon|craters]] and hyperlinks. However, it did not include a [[planetarium]], but instead had a small interactive [[constellation]]-only map.

In addition to database generated maps, many other illustrative maps in ''Encarta'' (\"Historical Maps\") were drawn by artists. Some more advanced maps were [[interactive]]: for example, the large African map for Africana could display information such as political boundaries or the distribution of African [[flora (plants)|flora]].

===''Encarta Dictionary''===
When ''Encarta'' was released as part of the \"Reference Suite\" in 1998 to 2000, Microsoft bundled \"[[Microsoft Bookshelf]]\" with the other programs (''Encarta Encyclopedia 98 Deluxe Edition'', ''Encarta Desk Atlas'', ''Encarta Virtual Globe 98'', ''Encarta World English Dictionary'', and ''Encarta Research Organizer'').

\"Bookshelf\" was discontinued in 2000, and in later ''Encarta'' editions (''Encarta Suite 2000'' and onward), \"Bookshelf\" was replaced with a dedicated ''Encarta Dictionary'', a superset of its printed version, ''The Encarta World English Dictionary'' (later ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary]]'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Bookshelf: Cannot Connect to a Site When You Click Web Link|url=https://ftp|publisher=Microsoft|access-date=April 13, 2020|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815013448/http://ftp//|archive-date=December 9, 2014}}</ref>

There was some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in \"Bookshelf\" which many found to be a useful reference, such as ''Columbia Dictionary of Quotations'' (replaced with a quotations section in ''Encarta'' that links to relevant articles and people) and an [[Internet Directory]] (although many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist).

Print versions of ''Encarta'' dictionaries have also been published, including:

===Regional versions===
[[Robert McHenry]], while Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', criticized ''Encarta'' for differences in factual content between national versions of ''Encarta'', accusing Microsoft of \"pandering to local prejudices\" instead of presenting subjects objectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html|title=The Microsoft Way|last=McHenry|first=Robert|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080452/http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html|archive-date=2007-09-27}}, essay by Robert McHenry</ref> An article written by [[Bill Gates]] addressed the nature of writing encyclopedias for different regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm|title=The facts depend on where you are coming from|last=Gates|first=Bill|date=April 6, 1997|work=[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|The Sunday Times]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629032909/http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm|archive-date=June 29, 2012|access-date=April 13, 2020}}</ref>

==Technology==
[[File:Student07.JPG|thumb|250px|Microsoft Student with ''Encarta Premium 2007'' running on [[Windows XP]].]]
Before the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] for information browsing, Microsoft recognized the importance of having an engine that supported a [[multimedia]] [[markup language]], full text search, and extensibility using software objects.  The [[hypertext]] display, [[hyperlinking]] and search software was created by a team of [[CD-ROM]] Division developers in the late 1980s who designed it as a generalized engine for uses as diverse as [[online help|interactive help]], [[document management system]]s and as ambitious as a multimedia encyclopedia.

''Encarta'' was able to use various Microsoft technologies because it was extensible with [[Component-based software engineering|software components]] for displaying unique types of multimedia information.  For example, a snap in map engine is adapted from its [[Microsoft MapPoint|MapPoint]] software.  The hypertext and search engine used by ''Encarta'' also powered [[Microsoft Bookshelf]].

''Encarta'' used database technologies to generate much of its multimedia content. For example, ''Encarta'' generated each zoomable map from a global [[geographic information system]] database on demand.

When a user used the [[cut, copy and paste|copy and paste]] function of Microsoft Windows on ''Encarta'' on more than five words, ''Encarta'' automatically appended a [[copyright]] [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] message after the paste.

===User editing===
Early in 2005, Gary Alt announced that the online ''Encarta'' started to allow users to suggest changes to existing articles.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7502883/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/encarta-encyclopedia-tests-edit-system/#.Vate6VSjlUQ \"Encarta Encyclopedia Test Edit System\"], 15 April 2005, Associated Press</ref>

<!-- === Chatbot ===-->
''Encarta''{{'}}s content was accessible using a conversational interface on [[Windows Live Messenger]] via the MSN [[Internet bot|Bot]] \"Encarta Instant Answers\".<ref>MSN screenname: encarta@conversagent.com and encarta@botmetro.net</ref> The bot could answer many encyclopedia related questions directly in the IM window. It used short sentences from the ''Encarta'' website, and sometimes displays full articles in the [[Internet Explorer]]-based browser on the right.  It also could complete simple mathematical and advanced algebra problems. This service was also available in [[German language|German]],<ref>MSN screenname: de.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> [[Spanish language|Spanish]],<ref>MSN screenname: es.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> [[French language|French]]<ref>MSN screenname: fr.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>MSN screenname: jp.encarta@botmetro.net</ref>

===Updates===
Each [[summer]] (in the Northern hemisphere) or [[winter]] (in the Southern hemisphere), Microsoft published a new version of ''Encarta''. However, despite the inclusion of news-related and some supplementary articles, ''Encarta''{{'}}s contents had not been changed substantially in its later years. Besides the yearly update, the installed offline copy could be updated over the Internet for a certain period for free depending on the edition. Some articles (usually about 2,000) were updated to reflect important changes or events. When the update period expired, an advertisement prompting to upgrade to the new version was displayed to the user occasionally.

==Reception==
The editors of ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' nominated ''Microsoft Encarta '95'' for their 1994 \"Best Educational Product\" award, although it lost to the CD-ROM adaptation of ''[[The Way Things Work]]''.<ref name=pcgamerusawards2>{{cite journal|date=March 1995|title=The First Annual ''PC Gamer'' Awards|pages=44, 45, 47, 48, 51|journal=[[PC Gamer]]|author=Staff|volume=2|issue=3}}</ref>

'''''Microsoft Encarta''''' was a [[Digital data|digital]] [[multimedia]] [[encyclopedia]] published by [[Microsoft Corporation]] from 1993 to 2009. Originally sold on [[CD-ROM]] or [[DVD]], it was also later available on the World Wide Web via an annual subscription – although later many articles could also be viewed free online with advertisements.<ref>For the free service, one should use the URL {{cite web |url=http://search.msn.com/encarta/results.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050811233841/http://search.msn.com/encarta/results.aspx |archivedate=2005-08-11 }} (MSN Search Encarta) rather than http://encarta.msn.com {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031074236/http://encarta.msn.com/ |date=2009-10-31 }} (MSN Encarta : Online Encyclopedia, Dictionary, Atlas, and Homework).

Microsoft published similar encyclopedias under the ''Encarta'' trademark in various languages, including [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Localized versions contained contents licensed from national sources and more or less content than the full English version. For example, the Dutch version had content from the Dutch ''[[Winkler Prins]]'' encyclopedia.

In March 2009, Microsoft announced it was discontinuing both the ''Encarta'' disc and online versions.

Funk & Wagnalls continued to publish revised editions for several years independently of Encarta, but then ceased printing in the late 1990s.

===Launch===
The name ''Encarta'' was created for Microsoft by an advertising agency<ref>Harvard Business School Case Study 'Blown to Bits'</ref> and launched in 1993 as a $395 product,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=v9TVJ_G_sk8C&pg=RA1-PA349&dq=encarta+$395+launch+microsoft+1993&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAGoVChMInp3O6NzmxgIVohOmCh3-jg2n#v=onepage&q=encarta%20%24395%20launch%20microsoft%201993&f=false \"Coming Attractions: Encyclopedias\"], 22 Dec 1992, PC Mag</ref> although it soon dropped to $99, and was often [[software bundling|bundled]] into the price of a new computer purchase.<ref name=STROSS>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/03/business/03digi.html \"Encyclopedic Knowledge, Then vs. Now\"],  Randall Stross, May 2, 2009, ''New York Times''</ref><ref name=brit>[http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2009/04/encarta-rip-cont-a-reply-from-tom-corddry/ Tom Corddry]: \"''Encarta'' was not given away but sold at retail for about $100, and sold wholesale to PC manufacturers who bundled it with new machines.\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Crisis at Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/greenstein/images/htm/Research/Cases/EncyclopaediaBritannica.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325042059/http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/greenstein/images/htm/Research/Cases/EncyclopaediaBritannica.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-03-25|work=[[Kellogg School of Management]]|publisher=[[Northwestern University]]|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>

In the late 1990s, Microsoft added content from ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and ''New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia'' from [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] into ''Encarta'' after purchasing them. Thus the final Microsoft ''Encarta'' can be considered the successor of the ''Funk and Wagnalls'', ''Collier'', and ''New Merit Scholar'' encyclopedias. None of these formerly successful encyclopedias remained in print for long after being merged into ''Encarta''.

Microsoft introduced several regional versions of ''Encarta'' translated into languages other than English. For example, the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] version was introduced in 1999 and suspended in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/brasil/encarta/ |title=Bem-vindo à Microsoft Brasil |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref> The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version was somewhat smaller than the English one, at 42,000 articles.

===Move to the web===
In 2000, the full ''Encarta'' content became available on the [[World Wide Web]] to subscribers, with a subset available for free to anyone.<ref name=STROSS />

===Demise===
In July 2006, Websters Multimedia, a [[Bellevue, Washington]] subsidiary of London-based Websters International Publishers, took over maintenance of ''Encarta'' from Microsoft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webstersmultimedia.com/WhoWeAre.asp |title=Websters International Publishers – Who We Are |publisher=Webstersmultimedia.com |accessdate=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322032031/http://www.webstersmultimedia.com/WhoWeAre.asp |archivedate=2012-03-22 }}</ref> The last version was ''Encarta Premium'' 2009, released in August 2008.<ref name=\"Encarta2009\"/>

{{anchor|Closure}}
Microsoft announced in April 2009 that it would cease to sell [[Microsoft Student]] and all editions of ''Encarta Premium'' software products worldwide by June 2009, citing changes in the way people seek information, and in the traditional encyclopedia and reference material market, as the key reasons behind the termination.<ref name=\"EncartaDead\"/> Updates for ''Encarta'' were offered until October 2009.<ref name=\"EncartaDead\"/> Additionally, MSN ''Encarta'' web sites were discontinued around October 31, 2009, with the exception of ''Encarta Japan'' which was discontinued on December 31, 2009. Existing MSN ''Encarta Premium'' (part of [[MSN Dial-up|MSN Premium]]) subscribers were refunded.<ref name=\"EncartaDead\"/>

The demise of ''Encarta'' was widely attributed to competition from the free and user-generated [[Wikipedia]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/162320/what_was_encarta_look_it_up_on_wikipedia.html|title=What Was Encarta?

==Contents and features==
''Encarta''{{'}}s standard edition<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/products/encarta/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=001 |title=Microsoft Encarta Product Details |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-13}}</ref> included approximately 50,000 articles, with additional images, videos and sounds. The premium editions contained over 62,000 articles and other [[multimedia]] content, such as 25,000 pictures and illustrations, over 300 videos and animations, and an interactive atlas with 1.8 million locations. Its articles were integrated with multimedia content and could include links to websites selected by its [[editing|editors]]. ''Encarta''{{'}}s articles in general were less lengthy and more summarized than the printed version of ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' or the online [[Wikipedia]]. Like most multimedia encyclopedias, ''Encarta''{{'}}s articles tended to provide an overview of the subject rather than an exhaustive coverage and can only be viewed one at a time.

A sidebar could display alternative views, [[essay]]s, journals or original materials relevant to the topic. For example, when reading about [[computer]]s, it featured annals since 1967 of the computer industry. ''Encarta'' also supported [[closed captioning]] for the hearing impaired. A separate program, called ''Encarta Research Organizer'' was included in early versions for gathering and organizing information and constructing a Word document-based report. Later versions included ''Encarta Researcher'', a browser plugin to organize information from ''Encarta'' articles and web pages into research projects. Content copied from ''Encarta'' was appended with a [[copyright]] boilerplate message after the selection. The user interface allowed for viewing content with only images, videos, sounds, animations, 360-degree views, virtual tours, charts and tables or only interactives.

Encarta was originally available for sale on 1 to 5 [[CD-ROM]]s or a [[DVD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thejournal.com/articles/1997/04/01/encarta-97-adds-content-extra-cd.aspx|title=Encarta 97 Adds Content, Extra CD|quote=Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia now comes in two versions: the award-winning Encarta 97 Encyclopedia on a single compact disc, and the new two-CD Encarta 97 Encyclopedia, Deluxe Edition.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.microsoft.com/2002/06/27/microsoft-encarta-reference-library-2003-takes-the-work-out-of-homework/|title=Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2003 Takes the Work Out of Homework|quote=The Encarta Reference Library 2003 five-disc CD-ROM and single-disk DVD have an estimated retail price** of $74.95 (U.S.) before a $10 (U.S.) mail-in rebate.}}</ref> Some new PCs were shipped with an [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] edition of Encarta.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Packard+Bell+ups+the+value+of+its+computers+with+huge+new+software...-a017230846|title=Packard Bell ups the value of its computers with huge new software bundle.|quote=For pure reference, Packard Bell is providing ``Microsoft(R) Encarta(TM) '95,''}}</ref>

''Encarta 2000'' and later had \"Map Treks\", which were tours of geographic features and concepts. Microsoft had a separate product known as ''Encarta Africana'' which was an encyclopedia of black history and culture. It was integrated into the standard ''Encarta Reference'' suite starting with the 2001 version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/aug00/encartaexpandedpr.mspx |title=Award-Winning Encarta Africana Included in Suite for the First Time |publisher=Microsoft.com |accessdate=2012-03-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604164331/http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2000/aug00/encartaexpandedpr.mspx |archivedate=2011-06-04 }}</ref> ''Encarta 2002'' and onward feature ''3D Virtual Tours'' of ancient structures, for example the [[Acropolis]]; 2D panoramic images of world wonders or major cities; and a virtual flight feature which allows users to fly a virtual [[airplane]] over a coarsely generated artificial [[landscape]] area. Version ''2002'' also introduced the ability to install the entire encyclopedia locally to the hard disk drive to prevent frequent swapping of discs.

''Encarta 2003'' incorporated literature guides and book summaries, foreign language translation dictionaries, a ''Homework Center'' and ''Chart Maker''. ''Encarta''{{'}}s ''Visual Browser'', available since the 2004 version, presented a user with a list of related topics making them more discoverable. A collection of 32 [[Discovery Channel]] videos were also later added. ''Encarta 2005'' introduced another program called ''Encarta Kids'' aimed at children to make learning fun.

''Encarta'' also included a [[trivia]] game called \"MindMaze\" (accessible through Ctrl+Z) in which the player explores a castle by answering questions whose answers can be found in the encyclopedia's articles. There was also a \"Geography Quiz\" and several other games and quizzes, some quizzes also in ''Encarta Kids''.

For years, ''Encarta'' came in three primary software editions: Standard, Premium, and Reference Library (price and features in that order). Beginning with ''Encarta 2006'', however, when ''Websters Multimedia'' took over its maintenance, ''Encarta'' became a feature of Microsoft Student. Although it was possible to purchase only the ''Encarta'' encyclopedia separately, Microsoft Student bundles together ''Encarta Premium'' with [[Microsoft Math]] (a [[graphing calculator|graphing-calculator]] program) and Learning Essentials, which provides templates for [[Microsoft Office]]. In addition, the Reference Library was discontinued, absorbed into a newer, more comprehensive Premium package. ''Encarta''{{'}}s user interface was shared with Microsoft Student, and was streamlined to reduce clutter with only a Search box which returned relevant results; however it became no longer possible to simply browse all the encyclopedia articles alphabetically.

===World Atlas===
The dynamic maps were generated with the same engine that powered [[Microsoft MapPoint]] software. The map was a [[virtual globe]] that one could freely rotate and magnify to any location down to major streets for big cities. The globe had multiple surfaces displaying political boundaries, physical landmarks, historical maps and statistical information. One could selectively display statistical values on the globe surface or in a tabular form, different sized cities, various geological or man-made features and [[latitude and longitude|reference lines]] in a map.

The maps contained [[hyperlink]]s to related articles (\"Map Trek\") and also supported a \"Dynamic Sensor\" that provides the [[latitude]], [[longitude]], [[toponym|place name]], [[population]] and [[time zone|local time]] for any point on the globe. ''Encarta'' also generated a visible-light moon atlas with names of major [[list of craters on the Moon|craters]] and hyperlinks. However, it did not include a [[planetarium]], but instead had a small interactive [[constellation]]-only map.

In addition to database generated maps, many other illustrative maps in ''Encarta'' (\"Historical Maps\") were drawn by artists. Some more advanced maps were [[interactive]]: for example, the large African map for Africana could display information such as political boundaries or the distribution of African [[flora (plants)|flora]].

===''Encarta Dictionary''===
When ''Encarta'' was released as part of the \"Reference Suite\" in 1998 to 2000, Microsoft bundled \"[[Microsoft Bookshelf]]\" with the other programs (''Encarta Encyclopedia 98 Deluxe Edition'', ''Encarta Desk Atlas'', ''Encarta Virtual Globe 98'', ''Encarta World English Dictionary'', and ''Encarta Research Organizer'').

\"Bookshelf\" was discontinued in 2000, and in later ''Encarta'' editions (''Encarta Suite 2000'' and onward), \"Bookshelf\" was replaced with a dedicated ''Encarta Dictionary'', a superset of its printed version, ''The Encarta World English Dictionary'' (later ''[[Encarta Webster's Dictionary]]'').<ref>{{cite web|title=Bookshelf: Cannot Connect to a Site When You Click Web Link |url=https://ftp |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150815013448/http://ftp// |archivedate=August 15, 2015 }}</ref>

There was some controversy over the decision, since the dictionary lacks the other books provided in \"Bookshelf\" which many found to be a useful reference, such as ''Columbia Dictionary of Quotations'' (replaced with a quotations section in ''Encarta'' that links to relevant articles and people) and an [[Internet Directory]] (although many of the sites listed in offline directories no longer exist).

Print versions of ''Encarta'' dictionaries have also been published, including:

===Regional versions===
[[Robert McHenry]], while Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', criticized ''Encarta'' for differences in factual content between national versions of ''Encarta'', accusing Microsoft of \"pandering to local prejudices\" instead of presenting subjects objectively.<ref>[http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html \"The Microsoft Way\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927080452/http://www.howtoknow.com/contragates.html |date=2007-09-27 }}, essay by Robert McHenry</ref> An article written by [[Bill Gates]] addressed the nature of writing encyclopedias for different regions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm |title=\"The facts depend on where you are coming from\" |accessdate=2004-09-13 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629032909/http://www.btimes.co.za/97/0406/tech/tech6.htm |archivedate=June 29, 2012 }}, essay by Bill Gates reprinted in [[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|''The Sunday Times'']] of South Africa, April 6, 1997, archived in 2012 and accessed Jan 9 2014.</ref>

==Technology==
[[File:Student07.JPG|thumb|250px|Microsoft Student with ''Encarta Premium 2007'' running on [[Windows XP]].]]
Before the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] for information browsing, Microsoft recognized the importance of having an engine that supported a [[multimedia]] [[markup language]], full text search, and extensibility using software objects.  The [[hypertext]] display, [[hyperlinking]] and search software was created by a team of [[CD-ROM]] Division developers in the late 1980s who designed it as a generalized engine for uses as diverse as [[online help|interactive help]], [[document management system]]s and as ambitious as a multimedia encyclopedia.

''Encarta'' was able to use various Microsoft technologies because it was extensible with [[Component-based software engineering|software components]] for displaying unique types of multimedia information.  For example, a snap in map engine is adapted from its [[Microsoft MapPoint|MapPoint]] software.  The hypertext and search engine used by ''Encarta'' also powered [[Microsoft Bookshelf]].

''Encarta'' used database technologies to generate much of its multimedia content. For example, ''Encarta'' generated each zoomable map from a global [[geographic information system]] database on demand.

When a user used the [[cut, copy and paste|copy and paste]] function of Microsoft Windows on ''Encarta'' on more than five words, ''Encarta'' automatically appended a [[copyright]] [[boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]] message after the paste.

===User editing===
Early in 2005, Gary Alt announced that the online ''Encarta'' started to allow users to suggest changes to existing articles.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7502883/ns/technology_and_science-tech_and_gadgets/t/encarta-encyclopedia-tests-edit-system/#.Vate6VSjlUQ \"Encarta Encyclopedia Test Edit System\"], 15 April 2005, Associated Press</ref>

<!-- === Chatbot ===-->
''Encarta''{{'}}s content was accessible using a conversational interface on [[Windows Live Messenger]] via the MSN [[Internet bot|Bot]] \"Encarta Instant Answers\".<ref>MSN screenname: encarta@conversagent.com and encarta@botmetro.net</ref> The bot could answer many encyclopedia related questions directly in the IM window. It used short sentences from the ''Encarta'' website, and sometimes displays full articles in the [[Internet Explorer]]-based browser on the right.  It also could complete simple mathematical and advanced algebra problems. This service was also available in [[German language|German]],<ref>MSN screenname: de.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> [[Spanish language|Spanish]],<ref>MSN screenname: es.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> [[French language|French]]<ref>MSN screenname: fr.encarta@botmetro.net</ref> and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>MSN screenname: jp.encarta@botmetro.net</ref>

===Updates===
Each [[summer]] (in the Northern hemisphere) or [[winter]] (in the Southern hemisphere), Microsoft published a new version of ''Encarta''. However, despite the inclusion of news-related and some supplementary articles, ''Encarta''{{'}}s contents had not been changed substantially in its later years. Besides the yearly update, the installed offline copy could be updated over the Internet for a certain period for free depending on the edition. Some articles (usually about 2,000) were updated to reflect important changes or events. When the update period expired, an advertisement prompting to upgrade to the new version was displayed to the user occasionally.

==Reception==
The editors of ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' nominated ''Microsoft Encarta '95'' for their 1994 \"Best Educational Product\" award, although it lost to the CD-ROM adaptation of ''[[The Way Things Work]]''.<ref name=pcgamerusawards2>{{cite journal |date=March 1995 | title=The First Annual ''PC Gamer'' Awards | pages=44, 45, 47, 48, 51 | journal=[[PC Gamer]] | author=Staff | volume=2 | issue=3 }}</ref>

'''Cachexia''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|k|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|ə}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/cachexia|title=Cachexia &#124; Definition of Cachexia by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries &#124; English}}</ref>) is a complex syndrome associated with an underlying illness causing ongoing [[muscle loss]] that is not entirely reversed with [[nutritional supplementation]]. A range of diseases can cause cachexia, most commonly [[cancer]], [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure,]] [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[AIDS]]. Systemic inflammation from these conditions can cause detrimental changes to metabolism and body composition. In contrast to weight loss from inadequate caloric intake, cachexia causes mostly muscle loss instead of fat loss. Diagnosis of cachexia can be difficult due to the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria. Cachexia can improve with treatment of the underlying illness but other treatment approaches have limited benefit. Cachexia is associated with increased mortality and poor quality of life.

The term is from [[Greek language|Greek]] κακός ''kakos'', \"bad\", and ἕξις ''hexis'', \"condition\".

==Causes==
Cachexia can be caused by diverse medical conditions, but is most often associated with end-stage [[cancer]], known as ''cancer cachexia''. About 50% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia.

==Mechanism==
The exact mechanism in which these diseases cause cachexia is poorly understood, and likely is multifactorial with multiple disease pathways involved. [[Inflammatory cytokine|Inflammatory cytokines]] appear to play a central role including [[TNF-alpha]] (which is also nicknamed 'cachexin' or 'cachectin'), [[Interferon|interferon gamma]]<!-- not needed (IFNγ),--> and [[interleukin 6]]<!-- not needed (IL-6)-->. [[TNF-alpha]] has been shown to have direct catabolic effect on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through the [[ubiquitin proteasome pathway]]. This mechanism involves the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] leading to upregulation of the transcription factor [[NF-κB]]. NF-κB is a known regulator of the genes that encode cytokines and cytokine receptors. The increased production of cytokines induces proteolysis and breakdown of [[myofibrillar]] proteins.<ref name=Kumar/> Systemic inflammation also causes reduced protein synthesis through inhibition of the Akt/[[mTOR]] pathway.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Argilés|first=Josep M.|last2=Campos|first2=Nefertiti|last3=Lopez-Pedrosa|first3=José M.|last4=Rueda|first4=Ricardo|last5=Rodriguez-Mañas|first5=Leocadio|date=2016|title=Skeletal Muscle Regulates Metabolism via Interorgan Crosstalk: Roles in Health and Disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Directors Association|volume=17|issue=9|pages=789–796|doi=10.1016/j.jamda.2016.04.019|issn=1538-9375|pmid=27324808}}</ref>

Although many different tissues and cell types may be responsible for the increase in circulating cytokines, evidence indicates tumors themselves are an important source of factors that may promote cachexia in cancer. Tumor-derived molecules such as lipid mobilizing factor, [[proteolysis-inducing factor]], and [[Uncoupling protein|mitochondrial uncoupling proteins]] may induce protein degradation and contribute to cachexia.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martignoni ME, Kunze P, Friess H | title = Cancer cachexia | journal = Molecular Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 36 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14613583 | pmc = 280692 | doi = 10.1186/1476-4598-2-36 }}</ref> Uncontrolled inflammation in cachexia can lead to an elevated resting metabolic rate, further increasing the demands for protein and energy sources.<ref name=\":7\" />

There is also evidence of alteration in feeding control loops in cachexia. High levels of [[leptin]], a hormone secreted by adipocytes, block the release of [[neuropeptide Y]], which is the most potent feeding-stimulatory peptide in the [[hypothalamic]] [[orexigenic]] network, leading to decreased energy intake despite the high metabolic demand for nutrients.<ref name=\":0\" />

==Diagnosis==
Diagnostic guidelines and criteria have only recently been proposed despite the prevalence of cachexia and varying criteria, the primary features of cachexia include progressive depletion of muscle and fat mass, reduced food intake, abnormal metabolism of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, reduced quality of life, and increased physical impairment.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Peterson SJ, Mozer M | title = Differentiating Sarcopenia and Cachexia Among Patients With Cancer | journal = Nutrition in Clinical Practice | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 30–39 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28124947 | doi = 10.1177/0884533616680354 }}</ref>

Historically, body weight changes were used as the primary metrics of cachexia, including low [[body mass index]] and involuntary weight loss of more than 10%. Using weight alone is limited by the presence of edema, tumor mass and the high prevalence of obesity in the general population.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dev R | title = Measuring cachexia-diagnostic criteria | journal = Annals of Palliative Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–32 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30525765 | doi = 10.21037/apm.2018.08.07 }}</ref> Weight-based criteria do not take into account changes in body composition, especially loss of lean body mass. 

In the attempt to include a broader evaluation of the burden of cachexia, diagnostic criteria using assessments of laboratory metrics and symptoms in addition to weight have been proposed. The criteria included weight loss of at least 5% in 12 months or low [[body mass index]] (less than 22 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with at least three of the following features: decreased muscle strength, fatigue, anorexia, low fat‐free mass index, or abnormal biochemistry (increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low serum albumin).<ref name=\":1\" />

Laboratory markers are used in evaluation of people with cachexia, including [[albumin]], prealbumin, [[C-reactive protein]], or [[hemoglobin]]. However, laboratory metrics and cut-off values are not standardized across different diagnostic criteria. [[Acute phase reactant|Acute phase reactants]] (IL-6, IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-8, interferon-g) are sometimes measured but correlate poorly with outcomes. There are no [[biomarkers]] to identify people with cancer who may develop cachexia.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> 

In the effort to better classify cachexia severity, several scoring systems have been proposed including the Cachexia Staging Score (CSS) and Cachexia Score (CASCO). The CSS takes into account weight loss, subjective reporting of muscle function, performance status, appetite loss, and laboratory changes to categorize patients into non-cachexia, pre-cachexia, cachexia and refractory cachexia. The Cachexia SCOre (CASCO) is another validated score that includes evaluation of body weight loss and composition, inflammation, metabolic disturbances, immunosuppression, physical performance, anorexia, and quality of life.<ref name=\":3\" />

Evaluation of changes in body composition is limited by the difficulty in measuring muscle mass and health in a non-invasive and cost-effective way. Imaging with quantification of muscle mass has been investigated including [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]], computed tomography, [[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry|Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] but are not widely used.<ref name=\":3\" />
===Definition===
Identification, treatment and research of cachexia has historically been limited by the lack of a widely accepted definition of cachexia. In 2011, an international consensus group adopted a definition of cachexia as “a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that can be partially but not entirely reversed by conventional nutritional support.”<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fearon K, Strasser F, Anker SD, Bosaeus I, Bruera E, Fainsinger RL, Jatoi A, Loprinzi C, MacDonald N, Mantovani G, Davis M, Muscaritoli M, Ottery F, Radbruch L, Ravasco P, Walsh D, Wilcock A, Kaasa S, Baracos VE | display-authors = 6 | title = Definition and classification of cancer cachexia: an international consensus | journal = The Lancet. Oncology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 489–95 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21296615 | doi = 10.1016/s1470-2045(10)70218-7 }}</ref>

Cachexia differs from weight loss due to malnutrition from [[malabsorption]], [[anorexia nervosa]], or anorexia due to [[major depressive disorder]]. Weight loss from inadequate caloric intake generally causes fat loss before muscle loss, whereas cachexia causes predominantly muscle wasting. Cachexia is also distinct from [[sarcopenia]], or age-related muscle loss, although they often co-exist.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans WJ, Morley JE, Argilés J, Bales C, Baracos V, Guttridge D, Jatoi A, Kalantar-Zadeh K, Lochs H, Mantovani G, Marks D, Mitch WE, Muscaritoli M, Najand A, Ponikowski P, Rossi Fanelli F, Schambelan M, Schols A, Schuster M, Thomas D, Wolfe R, Anker SD | display-authors = 6 | title = Cachexia: a new definition | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 793–9 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18718696 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2008.06.013 }}</ref>

==Treatment==

The management of cachexia depends on the underlying cause, the general prognosis, and needs of the person affected.<ref name=Care-2009>{{cite web|last=DHHS|first=2009|title=Care Management Guidelines Fatigue, Anorexia and Cachexia|url=http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/36942/Fatigue_Anorexia_Cachexia_Final290909_PCSSubComm.pdf|access-date=23 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514022343/http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/36942/Fatigue_Anorexia_Cachexia_Final290909_PCSSubComm.pdf#|archive-date=2014-05-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> The most effective approach to cachexia is treating the underlying disease process. An example is the reduction in cachexia from AIDS by [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/guide/aids-wasting-syndrome|title=AIDS Wasting Syndrome|website=WebMD}}</ref> However this is often not possible or may be inadequate to reverse the cachexia syndrome in other diseases. Approaches to mitigate the muscle loss include exercise, nutritional therapies, and medications.

===Exercise=== 

Therapy that includes regular physical exercise is recommended for the treatment of cachexia due to the positive effects of exercise on skeletal muscle.<ref name=\"pmid25424884\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grande AJ, Silva V, Riera R, Medeiros A, Vitoriano SG, Peccin MS, Maddocks M | title = Exercise for cancer cachexia in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 11 | pages = CD010804 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25424884 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010804.pub2 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid26401466\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grande AJ, Silva V, Maddocks M | title = Exercise for cancer cachexia in adults: Executive summary of a Cochrane Collaboration systematic review | journal = Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–11 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26401466 | pmc = 4575551 | doi = 10.1002/jcsm.12055 }}</ref> Individuals with cachexia generally report low levels of physical activity and few engage in an exercise routine, owing to low motivation to exercise and a belief that exercising may worsen their symptoms or cause harm.<ref name=\"pmid29568412\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferioli M, Zauli G, Martelli AM, Vitale M, McCubrey JA, Ultimo S, Capitani S, Neri LM | title = Impact of physical exercise in cancer survivors during and after antineoplastic treatments | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 9 | issue = 17 | pages = 14005–14034 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29568412 | pmc = 5862633 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.24456 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid28758698\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wasley D, Gale N, Roberts S, Backx K, Nelson A, van Deursen R, Byrne A | title = Patients with established cancer cachexia lack the motivation and self-efficacy to undertake regular structured exercise | journal = Psycho-Oncology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 458–464 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28758698 | doi = 10.1002/pon.4512 | url = http://orca.cf.ac.uk/103309/1/Structured%20exercise%20and%20patients%20with%20cancer%20cachexia%20main%20document%20with%20bold%20revisions%20final17.pdf }}</ref>

===Medications===
Appetite stimulant medications are used to treat cachexia to increase food intake, but are not effective in stopping muscle wasting and may have detrimental side effects. Appetite stimulants include [[Glucocorticoid|glucocorticoids]], [[Cannabinoid|cannabinoids]], or [[progestin]]s such as [[megestrol acetate]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Gagnon\" /><ref name=\"epcrc-2010\" /> Anti-emetics such as [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists]] are also commonly used in cancer cachexia if nausea is a prominent symptom.<ref name=\"Kumar\" />

[[Anabolic-androgenic steroid]]s like [[oxandrolone]] may be beneficial in cachexia but their use is recommended for a maximum of two weeks since a longer duration of treatment increases [[side effect]]s.<ref name=\"epcrc-2010\" /><ref name=\"Mantovani2007\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQyGxrmQ17AC&pg=PA673|title=Cachexia and Wasting: A Modern Approach|author=Giovanni Mantovani|date=6 October 2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-88-470-0552-5|pages=673–}}</ref>

===Nutrition===
The increased metabolic rate and appetite suppression common in cachexia can compound muscle loss.<ref name=\":7\" /> Studies using a calorie-dense protein supplementation have suggested at least weight stabilization can be achieved, although improvements in lean body mass have not been observed in these studies.<ref name=Kumar>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar NB, Kazi A, Smith T, Crocker T, Yu D, Reich RR, Reddy K, Hastings S, Exterman M, Balducci L, Dalton K, Bepler G | title = Cancer cachexia: traditional therapies and novel molecular mechanism-based approaches to treatment | journal = Current Treatment Options in Oncology | volume = 11 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 107–17 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21128029 | pmc = 3016925 | doi = 10.1007/s11864-010-0127-z }}</ref>

=== Supplements ===
Administration of exogenous amino acids have been investigated to serve as a protein-sparing metabolic fuel by providing substrates for both muscle metabolism and [[gluconeogenesis]]. The branched-chain amino acids [[leucine]] and [[valine]] may have potential in inhibiting overexpression of protein breakdown pathways.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eley HL, Russell ST, Tisdale MJ | title = Effect of branched-chain amino acids on muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 407 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–20 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17623010 | pmc = 2267397 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20070651 }}</ref> The amino acid [[glutamine]] has been used as a component of oral supplementation to reverse cachexia in people with advanced cancer<ref name=\"May\">{{cite journal | vauthors = May PE, Barber A, D'Olimpio JT, Hourihane A, Abumrad NN | title = Reversal of cancer-related wasting using oral supplementation with a combination of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, arginine, and glutamine | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 183 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–9 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11975938 | doi = 10.1016/s0002-9610(02)00823-1 }}</ref> or [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=\"WebMD\">{{cite web|title=Glutamine|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-878-glutamine.aspx?activeingredientid=878&activeingredientname=glutamine|website=WebMD|publisher=WebMD, LLC|access-date=2015-03-15}}</ref>

[[β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate]] (HMB) is a metabolite of leucine that acts as a signaling molecule to stimulate protein synthesis. Studies showed positive results for chronic pulmonary disease, hip fracture, and in AIDS‐related and cancer‐related cachexia. However, many of these clinical studies used HMB as a component of combination treatment with glutamine, arginine, leucine, higher dietary protein and/or vitamins, which limits the assessment of the efficacy of HMB alone.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Brioche T, Pagano AF, Py G, Chopard A|date=August 2016|title=Muscle wasting and aging: Experimental models, fatty infiltrations, and prevention|journal=Molecular Aspects of Medicine|volume=50|pages=56–87|doi=10.1016/j.mam.2016.04.006|pmid=27106402}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Holeček|first=Milan|date=Aug 2017|title=Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation and skeletal muscle in healthy and muscle-wasting conditions: HMB supplementation and muscle|journal=Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=529–541|doi=10.1002/jcsm.12208|pmc=5566641|pmid=28493406}}</ref>
==Epidemiology==
Accurate [[epidemiology|epidemiological data]] on the prevalence of cachexia is lacking due to changing diagnostic criteria and under-identification of people with the disorder.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal | vauthors = von Haehling S, Anker SD | title = Cachexia as a major underestimated and unmet medical need: facts and numbers | journal = Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 21475699 | pmc = 3060651 | doi = 10.1007/s13539-010-0002-6 }}</ref> It is estimated that cachexia from any disease is estimated to affect more than 5 million people in the United States.<ref name=\":2\" /> The prevalence of cachexia is growing and estimated at about 1% of the population. The prevalence is lower in Asia but due to the larger population, represents a similar burden. Cachexia is also a significant problem in South America and Africa.<ref name=\":5\" />

The most frequent causes of cachexia in the United States by population prevalence are: 1) [[COPD]], 2) heart failure, 3) cancer cachexia, 4) [[chronic kidney disease]]. The prevalence of cachexia ranges from 15–60% among people with cancer, increasing to an estimated 80% in terminal cancer.<ref name=\":8\" /> This wide range is attributed to differences in cachexia definition, variability in cancer populations, and timing of diagnosis.<ref name=\":2\" /> Although the prevalence of cachexia among people with COPD or heart failure is lower (estimated 5% to 20%), the large number of people with these conditions dramatically increases the total cachexia burden.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> 

Cachexia contributes to significant loss of function and healthcare utilization. Estimates using the [[National Inpatient Sample]] in the United States suggest that cachexia accounted for 177,640 hospital stays in 2016.<ref>Barrett ML, Bailey MK, Owens PL.

'''Cachexia''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|k|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|ə}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/cachexia|title=Cachexia &#124; Definition of Cachexia by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries &#124; English}}</ref>) is a complex syndrome associated with an underlying illness causing ongoing [[muscle loss]] that is not entirely reversed with [[nutritional supplementation]]. A range of diseases can cause cachexia, most commonly [[cancer]], [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure,]] [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], [[chronic kidney disease]] and [[AIDS]]. Systemic inflammation from these conditions can cause detrimental changes to metabolism and body composition. In contrast to weight loss from inadequate caloric intake, cachexia causes mostly muscle loss instead of fat loss. Diagnosis of cachexia can be difficult due to the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria. Cachexia can improve with treatment of the underlying illness but other treatment approaches have limited benefit. Cachexia is associated with increased mortality and poor quality of life.

The term is from [[Greek language|Greek]] κακός ''kakos'', \"bad\", and ἕξις ''hexis'', \"condition\".

==Causes==
Cachexia can be caused by diverse medical conditions, but is most often associated with end-stage [[cancer]], known as ''cancer cachexia''. About 50% of all cancer patients suffer from cachexia. Those with upper gastrointestinal and pancreatic cancers have the highest frequency of developing a cachexic symptom. Prevalence of cachexia rises in more advanced stages and is estimated to affect 80% of terminal cancer patients.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Fearon KC, Moses AG | title = Cancer cachexia | journal = International Journal of Cardiology | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–81 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12163211 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00235-8 }}</ref> 

[[Congestive heart failure]], [[AIDS]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,]] and [[chronic kidney disease]] are other conditions that often cause cachexia.<ref name=Ebner-2013>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebner N, Springer J, Kalantar-Zadeh K, Lainscak M, Doehner W, Anker SD, von Haehling S | title = Mechanism and novel therapeutic approaches to wasting in chronic disease | journal = Maturitas | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 199–206 | date = July 2013 | pmid = 23664695 | doi = 10.1016/j.maturitas.2013.03.014 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/3420540 }}</ref> Cachexia can also be the result of advanced stages of [[cystic fibrosis]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[motor neuron disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], [[dementia]], [[tuberculosis]], [[multiple system atrophy]], [[mercury poisoning]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and [[celiac disease]] as well as other systemic diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Meresse B, Ripoche J, Heyman M, Cerf-Bensussan N | title = Celiac disease: from oral tolerance to intestinal inflammation, autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis | journal = Mucosal Immunology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 8–23 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19079330 | doi = 10.1038/mi.2008.75 }}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Morley JE, Thomas DR, Wilson MM | title = Cachexia: pathophysiology and clinical relevance | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 735–43 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16600922 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/83.4.735 }}</ref>

==Mechanism==
The exact mechanism in which these diseases cause cachexia is poorly understood, and likely is multifactorial with multiple disease pathways involved. [[Inflammatory cytokine|Inflammatory cytokines]] appear to play a central role including [[TNF-alpha]] (which is also nicknamed 'cachexin' or 'cachectin'), [[Interferon|interferon gamma]]<!-- not needed (IFNγ),--> and [[interleukin 6]]<!-- not needed (IL-6)-->. [[TNF-alpha]] has been shown to have direct catabolic effect on skeletal muscle and adipose tissue through the [[ubiquitin proteasome pathway]]. This mechanism involves the formation of [[reactive oxygen species]] leading to upregulation of the transcription factor [[NF-κB]]. NF-κB is a known regulator of the genes that encode cytokines and cytokine receptors. The increased production of cytokines induces proteolysis and breakdown of [[myofibrillar]] proteins.<ref name=Kumar/> Systemic inflammation also causes reduced protein synthesis through inhibition of the Akt/[[mTOR]] pathway.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Argilés|first=Josep M.|last2=Campos|first2=Nefertiti|last3=Lopez-Pedrosa|first3=José M.|last4=Rueda|first4=Ricardo|last5=Rodriguez-Mañas|first5=Leocadio|date=2016|title=Skeletal Muscle Regulates Metabolism via Interorgan Crosstalk: Roles in Health and Disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Directors Association|volume=17|issue=9|pages=789–796|doi=10.1016/j.jamda.2016.04.019|issn=1538-9375|pmid=27324808}}</ref>

Although many different tissues and cell types may be responsible for the increase in circulating cytokines, evidence indicates tumors themselves are an important source of factors that may promote cachexia in cancer. Tumor-derived molecules such as lipid mobilizing factor, [[proteolysis-inducing factor]], and [[Uncoupling protein|mitochondrial uncoupling proteins]] may induce protein degradation and contribute to cachexia.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Martignoni ME, Kunze P, Friess H | title = Cancer cachexia | journal = Molecular Cancer | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 36 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14613583 | pmc = 280692 | doi = 10.1186/1476-4598-2-36 }}</ref> Uncontrolled inflammation in cachexia can lead to an elevated resting metabolic rate, further increasing the demands for protein and energy sources.<ref name=\":7\" />

There is also evidence of alteration in feeding control loops in cachexia. High levels of [[leptin]], a hormone secreted by adipocytes, block the release of [[neuropeptide Y]], which is the most potent feeding-stimulatory peptide in the [[hypothalamic]] [[orexigenic]] network, leading to decreased energy intake despite the high metabolic demand for nutrients.<ref name=\":0\" />

==Diagnosis==
Diagnostic guidelines and criteria have only recently been proposed despite the prevalence of cachexia and varying criteria, the primary features of cachexia include progressive depletion of muscle and fat mass, reduced food intake, abnormal metabolism of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, reduced quality of life, and increased physical impairment.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Peterson SJ, Mozer M | title = Differentiating Sarcopenia and Cachexia Among Patients With Cancer | journal = Nutrition in Clinical Practice | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 30–39 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28124947 | doi = 10.1177/0884533616680354 }}</ref>

Historically, body weight changes were used as the primary metrics of cachexia, including low [[body mass index]] and involuntary weight loss of more than 10%. Using weight alone is limited by the presence of edema, tumor mass and the high prevalence of obesity in the general population.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dev R | title = Measuring cachexia-diagnostic criteria | journal = Annals of Palliative Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 24–32 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30525765 | doi = 10.21037/apm.2018.08.07 }}</ref> Weight-based criteria do not take into account changes in body composition, especially loss of lean body mass. 

In the attempt to include a broader evaluation of the burden of cachexia, diagnostic criteria using assessments of laboratory metrics and symptoms in addition to weight have been proposed. The criteria included weight loss of at least 5% in 12 months or low [[body mass index]] (less than 22 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with at least three of the following features: decreased muscle strength, fatigue, anorexia, low fat‐free mass index, or abnormal biochemistry (increased inflammatory markers, anemia, low serum albumin).<ref name=\":1\" />

Laboratory markers are used in evaluation of people with cachexia, including [[albumin]], prealbumin, [[C-reactive protein]], or [[hemoglobin]]. However, laboratory metrics and cut-off values are not standardized across different diagnostic criteria. [[Acute phase reactant|Acute phase reactants]] (IL-6, IL-1b, tumor necrosis factor-a, IL-8, interferon-g) are sometimes measured but correlate poorly with outcomes. There are no [[biomarkers]] to identify people with cancer who may develop cachexia.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> 

In the effort to better classify cachexia severity, several scoring systems have been proposed including the Cachexia Staging Score (CSS) and Cachexia Score (CASCO). The CSS takes into account weight loss, subjective reporting of muscle function, performance status, appetite loss, and laboratory changes to categorize patients into non-cachexia, pre-cachexia, cachexia and refractory cachexia. The Cachexia SCOre (CASCO) is another validated score that includes evaluation of body weight loss and composition, inflammation, metabolic disturbances, immunosuppression, physical performance, anorexia, and quality of life.<ref name=\":3\" />

Evaluation of changes in body composition is limited by the difficulty in measuring muscle mass and health in a non-invasive and cost-effective way. Imaging with quantification of muscle mass has been investigated including [[bioelectrical impedance analysis]], computed tomography, [[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry|Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] but are not widely used.<ref name=\":3\" />
===Definition===
Identification, treatment and research of cachexia has historically been limited by the lack of a widely accepted definition of cachexia. In 2011, an international consensus group adopted a definition of cachexia as “a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass (with or without loss of fat mass) that can be partially but not entirely reversed by conventional nutritional support.”<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fearon K, Strasser F, Anker SD, Bosaeus I, Bruera E, Fainsinger RL, Jatoi A, Loprinzi C, MacDonald N, Mantovani G, Davis M, Muscaritoli M, Ottery F, Radbruch L, Ravasco P, Walsh D, Wilcock A, Kaasa S, Baracos VE | display-authors = 6 | title = Definition and classification of cancer cachexia: an international consensus | journal = The Lancet. Oncology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 489–95 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21296615 | doi = 10.1016/s1470-2045(10)70218-7 }}</ref>

Cachexia differs from weight loss due to malnutrition from [[malabsorption]], [[anorexia nervosa]], or anorexia due to [[major depressive disorder]]. Weight loss from inadequate caloric intake generally causes fat loss before muscle loss, whereas cachexia causes predominantly muscle wasting. Cachexia is also distinct from [[sarcopenia]], or age-related muscle loss, although they often co-exist.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Evans WJ, Morley JE, Argilés J, Bales C, Baracos V, Guttridge D, Jatoi A, Kalantar-Zadeh K, Lochs H, Mantovani G, Marks D, Mitch WE, Muscaritoli M, Najand A, Ponikowski P, Rossi Fanelli F, Schambelan M, Schols A, Schuster M, Thomas D, Wolfe R, Anker SD | display-authors = 6 | title = Cachexia: a new definition | journal = Clinical Nutrition | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 793–9 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18718696 | doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2008.06.013 }}</ref>

==Treatment==

The management of cachexia depends on the underlying cause, the general prognosis, and needs of the person affected.<ref name=Care-2009>{{cite web|last=DHHS|first=2009|title=Care Management Guidelines Fatigue, Anorexia and Cachexia|url=http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/36942/Fatigue_Anorexia_Cachexia_Final290909_PCSSubComm.pdf|access-date=23 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514022343/http://www.dhhs.tas.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/36942/Fatigue_Anorexia_Cachexia_Final290909_PCSSubComm.pdf#|archive-date=2014-05-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> The most effective approach to cachexia is treating the underlying disease process. An example is the reduction in cachexia from AIDS by [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webmd.com/hiv-aids/guide/aids-wasting-syndrome|title=AIDS Wasting Syndrome|website=WebMD}}</ref> However this is often not possible or may be inadequate to reverse the cachexia syndrome in other diseases. Approaches to mitigate the muscle loss include exercise, nutritional therapies, and medications.

===Exercise=== 

Therapy that includes regular physical exercise is recommended for the treatment of cachexia due to the positive effects of exercise on skeletal muscle.<ref name=\"pmid25424884\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grande AJ, Silva V, Riera R, Medeiros A, Vitoriano SG, Peccin MS, Maddocks M | title = Exercise for cancer cachexia in adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume =  | issue = 11 | pages = CD010804 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 25424884 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010804.pub2 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid26401466\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Grande AJ, Silva V, Maddocks M | title = Exercise for cancer cachexia in adults: Executive summary of a Cochrane Collaboration systematic review | journal = Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 208–11 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26401466 | pmc = 4575551 | doi = 10.1002/jcsm.12055 }}</ref> Individuals with cachexia generally report low levels of physical activity and few engage in an exercise routine, owing to low motivation to exercise and a belief that exercising may worsen their symptoms or cause harm.<ref name=\"pmid29568412\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferioli M, Zauli G, Martelli AM, Vitale M, McCubrey JA, Ultimo S, Capitani S, Neri LM | title = Impact of physical exercise in cancer survivors during and after antineoplastic treatments | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 9 | issue = 17 | pages = 14005–14034 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29568412 | pmc = 5862633 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.24456 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid28758698\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wasley D, Gale N, Roberts S, Backx K, Nelson A, van Deursen R, Byrne A | title = Patients with established cancer cachexia lack the motivation and self-efficacy to undertake regular structured exercise | journal = Psycho-Oncology | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 458–464 | date = February 2018 | pmid = 28758698 | doi = 10.1002/pon.4512 | url = http://orca.cf.ac.uk/103309/1/Structured%20exercise%20and%20patients%20with%20cancer%20cachexia%20main%20document%20with%20bold%20revisions%20final17.pdf }}</ref>

===Medications===
Appetite stimulant medications are used to treat cachexia to increase food intake, but are not effective in stopping muscle wasting and may have detrimental side effects. Appetite stimulants include [[Glucocorticoid|glucocorticoids]], [[Cannabinoid|cannabinoids]], or [[progestin]]s such as [[megestrol acetate]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\"Gagnon\" /><ref name=\"epcrc-2010\" /> Anti-emetics such as [[5-HT3 antagonist|5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonists]] are also commonly used in cancer cachexia if nausea is a prominent symptom.<ref name=\"Kumar\" />

[[Anabolic-androgenic steroid]]s like [[oxandrolone]] may be beneficial in cachexia but their use is recommended for a maximum of two weeks since a longer duration of treatment increases [[side effect]]s.<ref name=\"epcrc-2010\" /><ref name=\"Mantovani2007\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQyGxrmQ17AC&pg=PA673|title=Cachexia and Wasting: A Modern Approach|author=Giovanni Mantovani|date=6 October 2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-88-470-0552-5|pages=673–}}</ref>

===Nutrition===
The increased metabolic rate and appetite suppression common in cachexia can compound muscle loss.<ref name=\":7\" /> Studies using a calorie-dense protein supplementation have suggested at least weight stabilization can be achieved, although improvements in lean body mass have not been observed in these studies.<ref name=Kumar>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar NB, Kazi A, Smith T, Crocker T, Yu D, Reich RR, Reddy K, Hastings S, Exterman M, Balducci L, Dalton K, Bepler G | title = Cancer cachexia: traditional therapies and novel molecular mechanism-based approaches to treatment | journal = Current Treatment Options in Oncology | volume = 11 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 107–17 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21128029 | pmc = 3016925 | doi = 10.1007/s11864-010-0127-z }}</ref>

=== Supplements ===
Administration of exogenous amino acids have been investigated to serve as a protein-sparing metabolic fuel by providing substrates for both muscle metabolism and [[gluconeogenesis]]. The branched-chain amino acids [[leucine]] and [[valine]] may have potential in inhibiting overexpression of protein breakdown pathways.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Eley HL, Russell ST, Tisdale MJ | title = Effect of branched-chain amino acids on muscle atrophy in cancer cachexia | journal = The Biochemical Journal | volume = 407 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–20 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17623010 | pmc = 2267397 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20070651 }}</ref> The amino acid [[glutamine]] has been used as a component of oral supplementation to reverse cachexia in people with advanced cancer<ref name=\"May\">{{cite journal | vauthors = May PE, Barber A, D'Olimpio JT, Hourihane A, Abumrad NN | title = Reversal of cancer-related wasting using oral supplementation with a combination of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, arginine, and glutamine | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 183 | issue = 4 | pages = 471–9 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11975938 | doi = 10.1016/s0002-9610(02)00823-1 }}</ref> or [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref name=\"WebMD\">{{cite web|title=Glutamine|url=http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-878-glutamine.aspx?activeingredientid=878&activeingredientname=glutamine|website=WebMD|publisher=WebMD, LLC|access-date=2015-03-15}}</ref>

[[β-hydroxy β-methylbutyrate]] (HMB) is a metabolite of leucine that acts as a signaling molecule to stimulate protein synthesis. Studies showed positive results for chronic pulmonary disease, hip fracture, and in AIDS‐related and cancer‐related cachexia. However, many of these clinical studies used HMB as a component of combination treatment with glutamine, arginine, leucine, higher dietary protein and/or vitamins, which limits the assessment of the efficacy of HMB alone.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Brioche T, Pagano AF, Py G, Chopard A|date=August 2016|title=Muscle wasting and aging: Experimental models, fatty infiltrations, and prevention|journal=Molecular Aspects of Medicine|volume=50|pages=56–87|doi=10.1016/j.mam.2016.04.006|pmid=27106402}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Holeček|first=Milan|date=Aug 2017|title=Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate supplementation and skeletal muscle in healthy and muscle-wasting conditions: HMB supplementation and muscle|journal=Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=529–541|doi=10.1002/jcsm.12208|pmc=5566641|pmid=28493406}}</ref>
==Epidemiology==
Accurate [[epidemiology|epidemiological data]] on the prevalence of cachexia is lacking due to changing diagnostic criteria and under-identification of people with the disorder.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal | vauthors = von Haehling S, Anker SD | title = Cachexia as a major underestimated and unmet medical need: facts and numbers | journal = Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 21475699 | pmc = 3060651 | doi = 10.1007/s13539-010-0002-6 }}</ref> It is estimated that cachexia from any disease is estimated to affect more than 5 million people in the United States.<ref name=\":2\" /> The prevalence of cachexia is growing and estimated at about 1% of the population. The prevalence is lower in Asia but due to the larger population, represents a similar burden. Cachexia is also a significant problem in South America and Africa.<ref name=\":5\" />

The most frequent causes of cachexia in the United States by population prevalence are: 1) [[COPD]], 2) heart failure, 3) cancer cachexia, 4) [[chronic kidney disease]]. The prevalence of cachexia ranges from 15–60% among people with cancer, increasing to an estimated 80% in terminal cancer.<ref name=\":8\" /> This wide range is attributed to differences in cachexia definition, variability in cancer populations, and timing of diagnosis.<ref name=\":2\" /> Although the prevalence of cachexia among people with COPD or heart failure is lower (estimated 5% to 20%), the large number of people with these conditions dramatically increases the total cachexia burden.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> 

Cachexia contributes to significant loss of function and healthcare utilization. Estimates using the [[National Inpatient Sample]] in the United States suggest that cachexia accounted for 177,640 hospital stays in 2016.<ref>Barrett ML, Bailey MK, Owens PL.

===Multimodal therapy===
Despite the extensive investigation into single therapeutic targets for cachexia, the most effective treatments use multi-targeted therapies. In Europe, a combination of non-drug approaches including physical training, nutritional counseling, and [[psychotherapeutic]] intervention are used in belief this approach may be more effective than monotherapy.<ref name=\"epcrc-2010\">{{cite web|url=http://www.epcrc.org/guidelines.php?p=cachexia|title=New European Guidelines: CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES ON CANCER CACHEXIA IN ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS|last=European Palliative Care Research Collaborative|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502215044/http://www.epcrc.org/guidelines.php?p=cachexia|archive-date=2 May 2014|access-date=23 February 2014}}</ref> Administration of anti-inflammatory drugs showed efficacy and safety in the treatment of people with advanced cancer  cachexia.<ref name=\"Argiles\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Argilés JM, Busquets S, López-Soriano FJ | title = Anti-inflammatory therapies in cancer cachexia | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 668 Suppl 1 | pages = S81–6 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21835173 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.07.007 }}</ref>

With time, \"Little Russia\" developed into a political and geographical concept in Russia, referring to most of the territory of modern-day [[Ukraine]] before the 20th century. Accordingly, derivatives such as \"Little Russian\" ({{lang-ru|Малороссы}}, {{lang|ru-Latn|Malorossy}}) were commonly applied to the people, language, and culture of the area. Prior to the revolutionary events of 1917, a large part of the region's élite population adopted a [[Little Russian identity]] that competed with the local Ukrainian identity.

After the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in 1917, and with the amalgamation of Ukrainian territories into one administrative unit (the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]), the term started to recede from common use. Its subsequent usage has been regarded as derogatory by Ukrainians.<ref name=\"Steele1994\">{{cite book|last= Steele|first= Jonathan|authorlink= Jonathan Steele|title= Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev, and the Mirage of Democracy|url= https://archive.org/details/eternalrussiayel00stee|url-access= registration|accessdate= 3 December 2016|year= 1994|publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0-674-26837-1|page= [https://archive.org/details/eternalrussiayel00stee/page/216 216]|quote=Several centuries later, when Moscow became the main colonizing force, Ukrainians were given a label which they were to find insulting.

The toponym translates as ''Little'' or ''Lesser Rus’'' and is adapted from the [[Greek language|Greek]] term, used in medieval times by [[Patriarch|Patriarchs]] of [[Constantinople]] since the 14th century (it first appeared in church documents in 1335).

In the post-medieval period, the name ''Little Rus''' was first used by the [[Eastern Orthodox]] clergy of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], e.g. by influential cleric and writer Ioan Vyshensky (1600, 1608), [[Michael_I_of_Kiev_(metropolitan)|Metropolitan Matthew of Kiev and All Rus']] (1606), Bishop Ioann (Biretskoy) of [[Przemyśl|Peremyshl]], [[Isaiah_Kopinsky|Metropolitan Isaiah (Kopinsky)]] of Kiev, [[Archimandrite]] Zacharias Kopystensky<ref>[[:de:Zacharias Kopystenski]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} of [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], etc.<ref name=Rusyna276>Русина О.

The term was adopted in the 17th century by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] to refer to the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] of [[Left-bank Ukraine]], when the latter fell under Russian protection after the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654). From 1654 to 1721, the official title of Russian [[Tsar|tsars]] contained the language (literal translation) ''\"The Sovereign of all [[Etymology of Rus and derivatives|Rus']]: [[Great Russia|the Great]], the Little, and [[Belarus|the White]].\"''

The term ''Little Rus''' has been used in letters of the [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Cossack Hetmans]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]<ref>«…Самой столицы Киева, також части сие Малые Руси нашия». \"Воссоединение Украины с Россией.

The usage of the name was later broadened to apply loosely to the parts of [[Right-bank Ukraine]] when it was annexed by Russia at the end of the 18th century upon the [[partitions of Poland]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[History of the administrative division of Russia|Russian Imperial administrative units]] known as the [[Little Russia Governorate (1764–1781)|Little Russian Governorate]] and eponymous [[General Governorship]] were formed and existed for several decades before being split and renamed in subsequent administrative reforms.

Up to the very end of the 19th century, ''Little Russia'' was the prevailing term for much of the modern territory of Ukraine controlled by the [[Russian Empire]], as well as for its people and their language. This can be seen from its usage in numerous scholarly, literary and artistic works. [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophile]] historians [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]], [[Nikolay Kostomarov]], Dmytro Bahaliy, and [[Volodymyr Antonovych]] acknowledged the fact that during the Russo-Polish wars, ''Ukraine'' had only a geographical meaning, referring to the borderlands of both states, but ''Little Russia'' was the [[ethnonym]] of Little (Southern) Russian people.<ref name=Khrapachevsky>In his private diary Taras Shevchenko wrote \"Little Russia\" or \"Little Russian\" twenty one times, and \"Ukraine\" 3 times (\"Ukrainian\" – never) and (\"Kozak\" – 74).

The term ''Little Russian language'' was used by the state authorities in the first [[Russian Empire Census]], conducted in 1897.

==From Little Russia to Ukraine==
{{details|Name of Ukraine}}
{{History of Ukraine}}
{{History of Russia}}
The term ''Little Russia,'' which traces its origin to medieval times, was once widely used as the name for the geographic territory.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The first appearance of the name ''Ukraine'' (''Ukrayina'') was in 12th-century chronicles;{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} it was used sporadically from the mid-17th century until it was reintroduced in the 19th century by several writers making a conscious effort to awaken Ukrainian national awareness.<ref name=UkrainiansEnc>[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/U/K/Ukrainians.htm Ukrainians] in the [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/ Encyclopedia of Ukraine]</ref> But it was not until the 20th century when the modern term ''Ukraine'' started to prevail, while ''Little Russia'' gradually fell out of use.

==Modern context==
The term ''Little Russia'' (Rus' Minor) is now anachronistic when used to refer to the country Ukraine and the modern Ukrainian nation, its language, culture, etc. Such usage is typically perceived as conveying an imperialist view that the Ukrainian territory and people (\"Little Russians\") belong to \"one, indivisible Russia.\"<ref>Analysis of the events of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine by Prof. Y. Petrovsky-Shtern [http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20051/22 Retrieved] May 23, 2007</ref> Today, many Ukrainians consider the term disparaging, indicative of an \"older brother\" attitude,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} and of imperial Russian (and [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]]) suppression of Ukrainian nationalism. It has continued to be used in Russian nationalist discourse, in which modern Ukrainians are presented as a single people in a united [[Russian Empire|Russian nation]].<ref name=Smolin>{{in lang|ru}} Mikhail Smolin, \"[http://rusidea.org/?a=37004 Преодоление «украинства» и общерусское единство](Overcoming the \"Ukrainianness\" and the all-Russian unity), «Вестник Юго-Западной Руси», №1, 2006 г.</ref> This has provoked new hostility toward and disapproval of the term by some Ukrainians.<ref name=UkrainiansEnc/>

==\"Little Russianness\"==

The concept of \"Little Russianness\" ({{lang-uk|малоросійство|translit=malorosiystvo}}) is defined by some Ukrainian authors as a provincial complex they see in parts of the Ukrainian community due to its lengthy existence within the Russian Empire. They describe it as an \"indifferent, and sometimes a negative stance towards Ukrainian national-statehood traditions and aspirations, and often as active support of Russian culture and of Russian imperial policies.\"<ref name=Dovidn>Ihor Pidkova (editor), Roman Shust (editor), \"[http://history.franko.lviv.ua/dovidnyk.htm Dovidnyk z istorii Ukrainy]\", 3-Volumes, \"[http://history.franko.lviv.ua/IIm.htm Малоросійство]\" (t. 2), Kiev, 1993–1999, {{ISBN|5-7707-5190-8}} (t. 1), {{ISBN|5-7707-8552-7}} (t. 2), {{ISBN|966-504-237-8}} (t. 3).</ref> [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]], who used the terms ''Little Russia'' and ''Little Russian'' in his historical works,<ref name=DrahoMalorossiya/> applied the term ''Little Russianness'' to Russified Ukrainians, whose national character was formed under \"alien pressure and influence\" and who consequently adopted the \"worse qualities of other nationalities and lost the better ones of their own.\"<ref name=Dovidn/> Ukrainian conservative ideologue and politician [[Vyacheslav Lypynsky]] defined the term as \"the malaise of statelessness.\"<ref>Ihor Hyrych. \"Den\". Lypynsky on the imperative of political independence [http://www.day.kiev.ua/261013/ Retrieved] May 23, 2007</ref> The same inferiority complex has been said to apply to the Ukrainians of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] with respect to [[Poland]] (''gente ruthenus, natione polonus''). The related term ''Magyarony'' has been used to describe [[Magyarization|Magyarized]] Rusyns in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] who advocated for the union of that region with [[Hungary]].<ref name=Dovidn/>

The term \"Little Russians\" has also been used to denote stereotypically uneducated, rustic Ukrainians exhibiting little or no self-esteem. The uncouth stage persona of popular Ukrainian singer and performer [[Verka Serduchka|Andriy Mykhailovych Danylko]] is an embodiment of this stereotype; his [[Surzhyk]]-speaking [[Drag_queen|drag]] persona [[Verka Serduchka]] has also been seen as perpetuating this demeaning image.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} Serhiy Hrabovsky. \"Telekritika\".

==Proposed state of \"Little Russia\"==
On 18 July 2017, the head of the self-proclaimed state [[Donetsk People's Republic]], [[Alexander Zakharchenko]], announced its intention to form a federation with the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] (LPR) called ''Little Russia'' (''Malorossiya'').

On 22 July, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' claimed that the idea behind the 18 July announcement had actually came from circles close to the [[Moscow_Kremlin|Kremlin]] via the Russian nationalist [[Zakhar Prilepin]]. Prilepin said in an interview that the rationale behind the proposed state was that the separatists no longer could be called such because they were now supporting a unified state.<ref>[https://www.ft.com/content/8443f586-6de7-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa?

On 9 August, Zakharchenko stated that the proposed state would not be named \"Malorossiya\" (\"Little Russia\") because \"many feel repulsed by\" the name.<ref>[https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/separatists-leader-zakharchenko-rules-malorossiya-name.html Separatists leader Zakharchenko rules out Malorossiya as name], [[Kyiv Post]] (10 August 2017)<br>[https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-donetsk-zakharchenko-dumps-malorossia/28669230.html Russia-Backed Separatist Leader Says 'Little Russia' A Bust],

The [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] called the northern and southern parts of [[Kievan Rus'|''Rus’'']] lands {{lang|grc|Μεγάλη Ῥωσσία}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Megálē Rhōssía}})<ref>{{Cite book|last=Vasmer|first=Max|authorlink=Max Vasmer|title=Etymological dictionary of the Russian language|publisher=Progress|year=1986|location=Moscow|volume=1|page=289|url=http://etymolog.ruslang.ru/vasmer.php?id=289&vol=1|language=ru}}</ref> – [[Great Russia|Greater Rus’]]) and {{lang|grc|Μικρὰ Ῥωσσία}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Mikrà Rhōssía}} – Lesser or Little Rus’), respectively.

In the post-medieval period, the name ''Little Rus''' was first used by the [[Eastern Orthodox]] clergy of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], e.g. by influential cleric and writer Ioan Vyshensky (1600, 1608), [[Michael_I_of_Kiev_(metropolitan)|Metropolitan Matthew of Kiev and All Rus']] (1606), Bishop Ioann (Biretskoy) of [[Przemyśl|Peremyshl]], [[Isaiah_Kopinsky|Metropolitan Isaiah (Kopinsky)]] of Kiev, [[Archimandrite]] Zacharias Kopystensky<ref>[[:de:Zacharias Kopystenski]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}} of [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]], etc.<ref name=Rusyna276>Русина О.

The term was adopted in the 17th century by the [[Tsardom of Russia]] to refer to the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] of [[Left-bank Ukraine]], when the latter fell under Russian protection after the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] (1654). From 1654 to 1721, the official title of Russian [[Tsar|tsars]] contained the language (literal translation) ''\"The Sovereign of all [[Etymology of Rus and derivatives|Rus']]: [[Great Russia|the Great]], the Little, and [[Belarus|the White]].\"''

The term ''Little Rus''' has been used in letters of the [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Cossack Hetmans]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]<ref>«…Самой столицы Киева, також части сие Малые Руси нашия». \"Воссоединение Украины с Россией.

The usage of the name was later broadened to apply loosely to the parts of [[Right-bank Ukraine]] when it was annexed by Russia at the end of the 18th century upon the [[partitions of Poland]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[History of the administrative division of Russia|Russian Imperial administrative units]] known as the [[Little Russia Governorate (1764–1781)|Little Russian Governorate]] and eponymous [[General Governorship]] were formed and existed for several decades before being split and renamed in subsequent administrative reforms.

Up to the very end of the 19th century, ''Little Russia'' was the prevailing term for much of the modern territory of Ukraine controlled by the [[Russian Empire]], as well as for its people and their language. This can be seen from its usage in numerous scholarly, literary and artistic works. [[Ukrainophilia|Ukrainophile]] historians [[Mykhaylo Maksymovych]], [[Nikolay Kostomarov]], Dmytro Bahaliy, and [[Volodymyr Antonovych]] acknowledged the fact that during the Russo-Polish wars, ''Ukraine'' had only a geographical meaning, referring to the borderlands of both states, but ''Little Russia'' was the [[ethnonym]] of Little (Southern) Russian people.<ref name=Khrapachevsky>In his private diary Taras Shevchenko wrote \"Little Russia\" or \"Little Russian\" twenty one times, and \"Ukraine\" 3 times (\"Ukrainian\" – never) and (\"Kozak\" – 74). At the same time in his poetry he used only \"Ukraine\" (and \"Ukrainian\" – never).

The term ''Little Russian language'' was used by the state authorities in the first [[Russian Empire Census]], conducted in 1897.

==From Little Russia to Ukraine==
{{details|Name of Ukraine}}
{{History of Ukraine}}
{{History of Russia}}
The term ''Little Russia,'' which traces its origin to medieval times, was once widely used as the name for the geographic territory.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The first appearance of the name ''Ukraine'' (''Ukrayina'') was in 12th-century chronicles;{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} it was used sporadically from the mid-17th century until it was reintroduced in the 19th century by several writers making a conscious effort to awaken Ukrainian national awareness.<ref name=UkrainiansEnc>[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/U/K/Ukrainians.htm Ukrainians] in the [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/ Encyclopedia of Ukraine]</ref> But it was not until the 20th century when the modern term ''Ukraine'' started to prevail, while ''Little Russia'' gradually fell out of use.

==Modern context==
The term ''Little Russia'' (Rus' Minor) is now anachronistic when used to refer to the country Ukraine and the modern Ukrainian nation, its language, culture, etc. Such usage is typically perceived as conveying an imperialist view that the Ukrainian territory and people (\"Little Russians\") belong to \"one, indivisible Russia.\"<ref>Analysis of the events of the Orange Revolution in Ukraine by Prof. Y. Petrovsky-Shtern [http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20051/22 Retrieved] May 23, 2007</ref> Today, many Ukrainian nationalists consider the term disparaging, indicative of an \"older brother\" attitude,{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} and of imperial Russian (and [[Soviet Empire|Soviet]]) suppression of Ukrainian nationalism. It has continued to be used in Russian nationalist discourse, in which modern Ukrainians are presented as a single people in a united [[Russian Empire|Russian nation]].<ref name=Smolin>{{in lang|ru}} Mikhail Smolin, \"[http://rusidea.org/?a=37004 Преодоление «украинства» и общерусское единство](Overcoming the \"Ukrainianness\" and the all-Russian unity), «Вестник Юго-Западной Руси», №1, 2006 г.</ref> This has provoked new hostility toward and disapproval of the term by some Ukrainians.<ref name=UkrainiansEnc/>

==\"Little Russianness\"==

The concept of \"Little Russianness\" ({{lang-uk|малоросійство|translit=malorosiystvo}}) is defined by some Ukrainian authors as a provincial complex they see in parts of the Ukrainian community due to its lengthy existence within the Russian Empire. They describe it as an \"indifferent, and sometimes a negative stance towards Ukrainian national-statehood traditions and aspirations, and often as active support of Russian culture and of Russian imperial policies.\"<ref name=Dovidn>Ihor Pidkova (editor), Roman Shust (editor), \"[http://history.franko.lviv.ua/dovidnyk.htm Dovidnyk z istorii Ukrainy]\", 3-Volumes, \"[http://history.franko.lviv.ua/IIm.htm Малоросійство]\" (t. 2), Kiev, 1993–1999, {{ISBN|5-7707-5190-8}} (t. 1), {{ISBN|5-7707-8552-7}} (t. 2), {{ISBN|966-504-237-8}} (t. 3).</ref> [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]], who used the terms ''Little Russia'' and ''Little Russian'' in his historical works,<ref name=DrahoMalorossiya/> applied the term ''Little Russianness'' to Russified Ukrainians, whose national character was formed under \"alien pressure and influence\" and who consequently adopted the \"worse qualities of other nationalities and lost the better ones of their own.\"<ref name=Dovidn/> Ukrainian conservative ideologue and politician [[Vyacheslav Lypynsky]] defined the term as \"the malaise of statelessness.\"<ref>Ihor Hyrych. \"Den\". Lypynsky on the imperative of political independence [http://www.day.kiev.ua/261013/ Retrieved] May 23, 2007</ref> The same inferiority complex has been said to apply to the Ukrainians of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] with respect to [[Poland]] (''gente ruthenus, natione polonus''). The related term ''Magyarony'' has been used to describe [[Magyarization|Magyarized]] Rusyns in [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] who advocated for the union of that region with [[Hungary]].<ref name=Dovidn/>

The term \"Little Russians\" has also been used to denote stereotypically uneducated, rustic Ukrainians exhibiting little or no self-esteem. The uncouth stage persona of popular Ukrainian singer and performer [[Verka Serduchka|Andriy Mykhailovych Danylko]] is an embodiment of this stereotype; his [[Surzhyk]]-speaking [[Drag_queen|drag]] persona [[Verka Serduchka]] has also been seen as perpetuating this demeaning image.<ref>{{in lang|uk}} Serhiy Hrabovsky. \"Telekritika\".

==Proposed state of \"Little Russia\"==
On 18 July 2017, the head of the self-proclaimed state [[Donetsk People's Republic]], [[Alexander Zakharchenko]], announced its intention to form a federation with the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] (LPR) called ''Little Russia'' (''Malorossiya''). Its goal was to absorb the \"former Ukraine,\" which he declared a \"[[failed state]].\"<ref name=\"telegraphjul17\">{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/07/18/separatists-ukraine-declare-creation-new-state-malorossiya/amp/ | title=Separatists in Ukraine declare creation of new 'state' Malorossiya | publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date=18 July 2017 | accessdate=18 July 2017 | author=Litvinova, Daria}}</ref><ref>[https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-separatists-malorussia-criticism-zakharchenko-plotnitsky-poroshenko/28623190.html Ukraine Separatists Criticized Over Call For Creation Of 'Little Russia'], [[Radio Free Europe]] (18 July 2017)</ref> A constitution was published and a flag designed for the new state.<ref>[https://medium.com/dfrlab/from-malorossiya-with-love-8765ed30242d From “Malorossiya” With Love?], [[Atlantic Council]]'s Digital Forensic Research Lab (18 July 2017)</ref> The same day, the press service of the LPR released a statement from LPR leader [[Igor Plotnitsky]], stating that the LPR was \"not taking part in the project.\"<ref>[http://tass.com/politics/956825 Malorossiya project is personal initiative of self-proclaimed republic's leader — Kremlin], [[TASS news agency]] (18 July 2017)</ref> Russian authorities publicly rejected the proposal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-40653913|title=Russia rejects new Donetsk rebel 'state'|date=2017-07-19|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-GB}}</ref>

On 22 July, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' claimed that the idea behind the 18 July announcement had actually came from circles close to the [[Moscow_Kremlin|Kremlin]] via the Russian nationalist [[Zakhar Prilepin]]. Prilepin said in an interview that the rationale behind the proposed state was that the separatists no longer could be called such because they were now supporting a unified state.<ref>[https://www.ft.com/content/8443f586-6de7-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa?

On 9 August, Zakharchenko stated that the proposed state would not be named \"Malorossiya\" (\"Little Russia\") because \"many feel repulsed by\" the name.<ref>[https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine-politics/separatists-leader-zakharchenko-rules-malorossiya-name.html Separatists leader Zakharchenko rules out Malorossiya as name], [[Kyiv Post]] (10 August 2017)<br>[https://www.rferl.org/a/ukraine-russia-donetsk-zakharchenko-dumps-malorossia/28669230.html Russia-Backed Separatist Leader Says 'Little Russia' A Bust],

Yang debuted in 1991 at the age of 22 with a song titled \"Rebecca\". \"Rebecca\" and \"Help me Cupid!\" were performed on the air, but not a big hit. His 2nd full length album was released in 1992. He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />

He was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S. 

Active in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.

In 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". V2 meant his \"Version 2\". He was in active under the name of JIY instead of his real name, Yang Joon-il. He lied about his age and made a big change in his look.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news1.kr/articles/?3860343|title='배철수 잼' 양준일, 험난했던 인생사→신드롬에 대한 솔직 고백까지(종합)|date=2020-03-02|website=뉴스1|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    

In 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\".

==Career==
When he was in [[Glendale High School (Glendale, California)|Glendale High School]] in LA, he was persuaded to make a debut as an entertainer by the late Hollywood actor [[Soon-Tek Oh|Soon-tek Oh]], who was a member to the same church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tenasia.hankyung.com/topic/article/2020012937744|title=故 오순택 누구?...양준일과 미국서 깊은 인연 {{!}} 텐아시아|last=tenasia.hankyung.com|first=Digital|date=2020-01-29|website=텐아시아 연예뉴스|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Yang was a soloist in his high school choir. He took classes at [https://www.jrpowersphilly.com/ John Robert Powers Modeling, Acting Agency & Finishing School] in [[Philadelphia]] to prepare for his debut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mk.co.kr/star/broadcasting-service/view/2020/02/191812/|title=‘배철수 잼’ 양준일, 발라드 가수 데뷔 비하인드...‘리베카’ 어쿠스틱 버전 공개[종합]|website=스타투데이|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> 

He entered [[University of Southern California]] [[USC Marshall School of Business|Marshall School of Business]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/201912311633093457|title=[코리아타임스 뉴스] 시간여행자 양준일, 30년이 지나서야 인정받다|date=2020-01-01|website=한국일보|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> During his studies, he was selected by Lee Beom-hee, who was the famous composer of the day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.issueinfact.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=13883|title=양준일 리베카 신드롬 열풍 “역주행 아이콘 양준일 누구?”|date=2019-12-26|website=이슈인팩트|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Yang dropped out to debut as a singer in Korea in 1990.

Yang debuted in 1991 at the age of 22 with a song titled \"Rebecca\". \"Rebecca\" and \"Help me Cupid!\" were performed on the air, but not a big hit. His 2nd full length album was released in 1992. He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />

He was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S. 

Active in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.

In 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". V2 meant his \"Version 2\". He was in active under the name of JIY instead of his real name, Yang Joon-il. He lied about his age and made a big change in his look.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news1.kr/articles/?3860343|title='배철수 잼' 양준일, 험난했던 인생사→신드롬에 대한 솔직 고백까지(종합)|date=2020-03-02|website=뉴스1|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    

In 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\". Still slim in figure and soulful in his performance, he dazzled the audience and show hosts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2020/03/682_280113.html|title=Yang Joon-il, a musician living ahead of his time, finally recognized 30 year later|date=2019-12-10|website=koreatimes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> When asked his next plans amid this viral syndrome, he simply said: \"I don't make any plans; I just focus on fully living every moment. If there's any plans, I hope to live as a humble husband and dad.\" When the show hosts asked him to give a message to 20-year-old himself living 30 years ago, Yang said: \"I know nothing will happen how you want. But don't worry, everything will come out perfectly in the end.\"<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /> After his fame skyrocketed again after his appearance on the show, he quit his job at the restaurant to focus on his entertainment career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/12/g-dragon-of-the-90s-yang-joon-il-visits-jtbcs-news-room-after-his-surging-popularity-says-he-was-working-at-a-restaurant-in-florida|title='G-Dragon of the 90s' Yang Joon Il visits JTBC's 'News Room' after his surging popularity, says he was working at a restaurant in Florida|website=allkpop|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> 

On December 25, Christmas Day, he appeared on [[JTBC Newsroom]]. He said \"It's like a dream every day\", \"I've been trying to get rid of my prejudice against myself, which is full of my mind as if I had to abandon my unhappiness before I was happy.\"  \"There are no more tears\" Yang said, adding that his powerful fandom, which claims to be a support group, is also a big boost to Yang.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.habkorea.net/celebrity-of-celebrity-yang-joon-il-syndrome-in-korea/|title=Celebrity of celebrity, Yang Joon-il Syndrome in Korea {{!}} HaB Korea.net|date=2019-12-26|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>

==History==
The first non-Native American settlers arrived in what is now Whitley County in 1835.  They arrived as a result of the end of the [[Black Hawk War]] as well as the completion of the [[Erie Canal]].  They consisted entirely of settlers from [[New England]]. These were \"[[Yankee]]\" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the [[English people|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled [[New England]] in the colonial era.  They were primarily members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]] though due to the [[Second Great Awakening]] many of them had converted to [[Methodism]] and some had become [[Baptists]] before coming to what is now Whitley County.  When the [[New England]] settlers arrived in what is now Whitley County there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie. Whitley County was formed in 1838. It was named for Col. [[William Whitley]], who was killed in the [[Battle of the Thames]] in the [[War of 1812]].  In the late 1870s immigrants began arriving from [[Germany]] and [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S.

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana bar. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Whitely County is part of [[Indiana's 3rd congressional district]] and in 2008 was represented by [[Mark Souder]] in the [[United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://souder.house.gov/|title=US Congressman Mark Souder|publisher=US Congress|accessdate=2008-10-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009142714/http://souder.house.gov/|archivedate=2008-10-09}}</ref>

==History==
The first non-Native American settlers arrived in what is now Whitley County in 1835.  They arrived as a result of the end of the [[Black Hawk War]] as well as the completion of the [[Erie Canal]].  They consisted entirely of settlers from [[New England]]. These were \"[[Yankee]]\" settlers, that is to say they were descended from the [[English people|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled [[New England]] in the colonial era.  They were primarily members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]] though due to the [[Second Great Awakening]] many of them had converted to [[Methodism]] and some had become [[Baptists]] before coming to what is now Whitley County.  When the [[New England]] settlers arrived in what is now Whitley County there was nothing but a dense virgin forest and wild prairie. Whitley County was formed in 1838. It was named for Col. [[William Whitley]], who was killed in the [[Battle of the Thames]] in the [[War of 1812]].  In the late 1870s immigrants began arriving from [[Germany]] and [[Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S.

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana bar. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Whitely County is part of [[Indiana's 3rd congressional district]] and in 2008 was represented by [[Mark Souder]] in the [[United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://souder.house.gov/|title=US Congressman Mark Souder|publisher=US Congress|accessdate=2008-10-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009142714/http://souder.house.gov/|archivedate=2008-10-09}}</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov|author-link=Indiana Code }}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= Indiana Code |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov|author-link= Indiana Code }}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversee different parts of the county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov|author-link=Indiana Code }}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= Indiana Code |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov|author-link= Indiana Code }}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversee different parts of the county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

'''Classical Chinese''', also known as '''Literary Chinese''',{{efn|Some sources distinguish between Classical Chinese as strictly the language of the ancient classics and Literary Chinese as the classical style of writing used throughout Chinese history prior to the [[May Fourth Movement]] (see \"[[Classical Chinese#Definitions|Definitions]]\")}} is the language of the classic literature from the end of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] through to the end of the [[Han dynasty]], a written form of [[Old Chinese]]. Classical Chinese is a traditional style of [[written Chinese]] that evolved from the classical language, making it different from any modern [[Chinese spoken language|spoken form of Chinese]]. Literary Chinese was used for almost all formal writing in [[China]] until the early 20th century, and also, during various periods, in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]. Among Chinese speakers, Literary Chinese has been largely replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], a style of writing that is similar to modern spoken [[Mandarin Chinese]], while speakers of non-Chinese languages have largely abandoned Literary Chinese in favor of local vernaculars.

Literary Chinese is known as ''{{lang|ja-Latn|[[kanbun]]}}'' ({{lang|ja|漢文}}) in Japanese, ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[hanmun]]}}'' in Korean (but see also ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[gugyeol]]}}'') and ''{{lang|vi|cổ văn}}'' ({{lang|vi-Hani|古文}})<ref name=\"Nguyễn Tri Tài 2002 p5\">{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tri Tài |date=2002 |title=Giáo trình tiếng Hán. Tập I: Cơ sở |publisher=Nhà xuất bản Đại học Quốc gia Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh |page=5}}</ref> or ''{{lang|vi|văn ngôn}}'' ({{lang|vi-Hani|文言}})<ref name=\"Nguyễn Tri Tài 2002 p5\"/> in Vietnamese.

== Definitions ==
Strictly speaking, Classical Chinese refers to the written language of the classical period of Chinese literature, from the end of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (early 5th century BC) to the end of the [[Han dynasty]] (AD 220),<ref>{{cite book | title = Chinese | author = Jerry Norman | authorlink=Jerry Norman (sinologist) | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | pages = xi, 83 | isbn = 0-521-29653-6}}</ref> while Literary Chinese is the form of written Chinese used from the end of the [[Han Dynasty]] to the early 20th century, when it was replaced by vernacular written Chinese. It is often also referred to as \"Classical Chinese\", but [[Sinology|sinologists]] generally distinguish it from the language of the early period. During this period the dialects of China became more and more disparate and thus the Classical written language became less and less representative of the [[varieties of Chinese]] (cf. [[Classical Latin]], which was contemporary to the Han Dynasty, and the [[Romance languages]] of Europe). Although authors sought to write in the style of the Classics, the similarity decreased over the centuries due to their imperfect understanding of the older language, the influence of their own speech, and the addition of new words.<ref>Norman (1988), pp. 83–84, 108–109.</ref>

This situation, the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|use of Literary Chinese throughout the Chinese cultural sphere]] despite the existence of disparate regional vernaculars, is called [[diglossia]].  It can be compared to the position of [[Classical Arabic]] relative to the various [[Varieties of Arabic|regional vernaculars]] in Arab lands, or of [[Latin]] in medieval Europe. The Romance languages continued to evolve, influencing Latin texts of the same period, so that by the [[Middle Ages]], [[Medieval Latin]] included many usages that would have baffled the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The coexistence of Classical Chinese and the native languages of Japan, Korea and Vietnam can be compared to the use of Latin in nations that natively speak non-Latin-derived [[Germanic languages]] or [[Slavic languages]], to the position of Arabic in [[Persia]] or the position of the Indic language, [[Sanskrit]], in South India and Southeast Asia. However, the non-phonetic [[Chinese characters|Chinese writing system]] causes a unique situation where the modern pronunciation of the classical language is far more divergent (and heterogeneous, depending on the native – not necessarily Chinese – tongue of the reader) than in analogous cases, complicating understanding and study of Classical Chinese further compared to other classical languages.

Christian missionaries coined the term Wen-li ({{zh|t=文理|p=wénlǐ|w=wen-li}}) for Literary Chinese.
Though composed from Chinese roots, this term was never used in that sense in Chinese,<ref>{{cite book

The original meaning is \"principles of literature (or: writing),\" but by the missionaries of the last century it was coined to stand for classical Chinese.

== Pronunciation ==
{{Further information|Old Chinese phonology|Middle Chinese}}
[[Image:Old chinese.PNG|right|thumb|The shape of the [[Oracle bone script]] character for \"person\" may have influenced that for \"harvest\" (which later came to mean \"year\").  Today, they are pronounced ''rén'' and ''nián'' in Mandarin, but their hypothesized pronunciations in [[Old Chinese]] were very similar, which may explain the resemblance.  For example, in the recent [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese#Baxter–Sagart (2014)|Baxter-Sagart reconstruction]]<ref>http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/</ref>, they were {{IPA|/niŋ/}} and {{IPA|/nˤiŋ/}}, respectively, becoming {{IPA|/nʲin/}} and {{IPA|/nin/}} in [[Early Middle Chinese]].]]
[[Chinese character]]s are not [[alphabet|alphabetic]] and only rarely reflect [[sound changes]].  The tentative reconstruction of [[Old Chinese]] is an endeavor only a few centuries old. As a result, Classical Chinese is not read with a reconstruction of Old Chinese pronunciation; instead, it is always read with the pronunciations of characters categorized and listed in the Phonology Dictionary (韻書; [[pinyin]]: ''yùnshū'', \"[[Rime dictionary|rhyme book]]\") officially published by the Governments, originally based upon the Middle Chinese pronunciation of [[Luoyang]] in the 2nd to 4th centuries.  With the progress of time, every dynasty has updated and modified the official Phonology Dictionary.  By the time of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and [[Ming Dynasty]], the Phonology Dictionary was based on early Mandarin.  But since the [[Imperial Examination]] required the composition of [[Shi (poetry)|Shi]] genre, in non-Mandarin speaking parts of China such as [[Zhejiang]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], pronunciation is either based on everyday speech as in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]; or, in some varieties of Chinese (e.g. [[Southern Min]]), with a special set of pronunciations used for Classical Chinese or \"formal\" vocabulary and usage borrowed from Classical Chinese usage.  In practice, all varieties of Chinese combine these two extremes. Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, also have words that are pronounced one way in colloquial usage and another way when used in Classical Chinese or in specialized terms coming from Classical Chinese, though the system is not as extensive as that of Southern Min or [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. (See [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]])

[[Japanese language|Japanese]],  [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] readers of Classical Chinese use systems of pronunciation specific to their own languages. For example, Japanese speakers use ''On'yomi'' pronunciation when reading the [[kanji]] of words of Chinese origin such as 銀行 (ginkō) or the name for the city of Tōkyō (東京), but use ''Kun'yomi'' when the kanji represents a native word such as the reading of 行 in 行く (iku) or the reading of both characters in the name for the city of Ōsaka (大阪), and a system that aids Japanese speakers with Classical Chinese word order.

Since the pronunciation of all modern varieties of Chinese is different from Old Chinese or other forms of historical Chinese (such as [[Middle Chinese]]), characters that once [[rhyme]]d in poetry may not rhyme any longer, or vice versa. Poetry and other rhyme-based writing thus becomes less coherent than the original reading must have been. However, some modern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] have certain phonological characteristics that are closer to the older pronunciations than others, as shown by the preservation of certain rhyme structures. Some{{who|date=October 2019}} believe Classical Chinese literature, especially poetry, sounds better when read in certain varieties that are believed to be closer to older pronunciations, such as Cantonese or Southern Min, because the rhyming is often lost due to sound shifts in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].

Another phenomenon that is common in reading Classical Chinese is [[homophone|homophony]] (words that sound the same). More than 2,500 years of sound change separates Classical Chinese from any modern variety, so when reading Classical Chinese in any modern variety of Chinese (especially Mandarin) or in Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, many characters which originally had different pronunciations have become [[homonym]]s. There is a famous Classical Chinese poem written in the early 20th century by the linguist [[Chao Yuen Ren]] called the ''[[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]]'', which contains only words that are now pronounced {{IPA-cmn|ʂɨ|}} with various tones in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. It was written to show how Classical Chinese has become an impractical language for speakers of modern Chinese because Classical Chinese when spoken aloud is largely incomprehensible. However the poem is perfectly comprehensible when read silently because Literary Chinese, by its very nature as a ''written'' language using a [[logographic]] writing system, can often get away with using homophones that even in spoken Old Chinese would not have been distinguishable in any way.

The situation is analogous to that of some English words that are spelled differently but sound the same, such as \"meet\" and \"meat\", which were pronounced {{IPA-enm|meːt|}} and {{IPA|[mɛːt]}} respectively during the time of [[Chaucer]], as shown by their spelling. However, such homophones are far more common in Literary Chinese than in English. For example, the following distinct Old Chinese words are now all pronounced ''yì'' in Mandarin: ''*ŋjajs'' 議 \"discuss\", ''*ŋjət'' 仡 \"powerful\", ''*ʔjup'' 邑 \"city\", ''*ʔjək'' 億 \"100,000,000\", ''*ʔjəks'' 意 \"thought\", ''*ʔjek'' 益 \"increase\", ''*ʔjik'' 抑 \"press down\", ''*jak'' 弈 \"Chinese chess\", ''*ljit'' 逸 \"flee\", ''*ljək'' 翼 \"wing\", ''*ljek'' 易 \"change\", ''*ljeks'' 易 \"easy\" and ''*slek'' 蜴 \"lizard\".<ref>{{cite book

Romanizations have been devised giving distinct spellings for the words of Classical Chinese, together with rules for pronunciation in various modern varieties.
The earliest was the Romanisation Interdialectique (1931–2) of French missionaries [[Henri Lamasse]], of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]], and Ernest Jasmin, based on [[Middle Chinese]], followed by linguist [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]]'s ''wényán luómǎzì'' (1940) based on [[Old Chinese]], and Chao's [[General Chinese Romanization]] (1975).
However none of these systems has seen extensive use.<ref>{{cite book | first = David Prager | last = Branner | contribution = Some composite phonological systems in Chinese | pages = 209–232 | editor-first = David Prager | editor-last = Branner | title = The Chinese rime tables: linguistic philosophy and historical-comparative phonology | series = Current Issues in Linguistic Theory | volume = 271 | publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Company | publication-place = Amsterdam | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-90-272-4785-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Modern Chinese: history and sociolinguistics | first = Ping | last = Chen | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-521-64572-0 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/modernchinesehis00chen/page/173 173–174] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/modernchinesehis00chen/page/173 }}</ref>

== Grammar and lexicon ==
{{main article|Classical Chinese grammar}}
Classical Chinese is distinguished from written vernacular Chinese in its style, which appears extremely concise and compact to modern Chinese speakers, and to some extent in the use of different [[lexicon|lexical items]] (vocabulary). An essay in Classical Chinese, for example, might use half as many [[Chinese character]]s as in vernacular Chinese to relate the same content.

In terms of conciseness and compactness, Classical Chinese rarely uses words composed of two Chinese characters; nearly all words are of one [[syllable]] only. This stands directly in contrast with modern Northern Chinese varieties including Mandarin, in which two-syllable, three-syllable, and four-syllable words are extremely common, whilst although two-syllable words are also quite common within modern Southern Chinese varieties, they are still more archaic in that they use more one-syllable words than Northern Chinese varieties. This phenomenon exists, in part, because polysyllabic words evolved in Chinese to disambiguate homophones that result from sound changes. This is similar to such phenomena in English as the [[pin–pen merger|''pen–pin'' merger]] of many dialects in the American south and the [[Cot–caught merger|''caught-cot'' merger]] of most dialects of American English: because the words \"pin\" and \"pen\", as well as \"caught\" and \"cot\", sound alike in such dialects of English, a certain degree of confusion can occur unless one adds qualifiers like \"ink pen\" and \"stick pin.\" Similarly, Chinese has acquired many polysyllabic words in order to disambiguate monosyllabic words that sounded different in earlier forms of Chinese but identical in one region or another during later periods. Because Classical Chinese is based on the literary examples of ancient Chinese literature, it has almost none of the two-syllable words present in modern Chinese varieties.

Classical Chinese has more [[pronoun]]s compared to the modern vernacular. In particular, whereas Mandarin has one general character to refer to the first-person pronoun (\"I\"/\"me\"), Literary Chinese has several, many of which are used as part of [[honorific]] language (see [[Chinese honorifics]]).

In [[syntax]], Classical Chinese is always ready to drop subjects and objects when a reference to them is understood ([[Pro-drop language|pragmatically inferable]]). Also, words are not restrictively categorized into [[parts of speech]]: nouns are commonly used as verbs, adjectives as nouns, and so on. There is no [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] in Classical Chinese, \"是\" ([[pinyin]]: ''shì'') is a copula in modern Chinese but in old Chinese it was originally a near [[demonstrative]] (\"this\"); the modern Chinese for \"this\" is \"這\" ([[pinyin]]: ''zhè'').

Beyond grammar and vocabulary differences, Classical Chinese can be distinguished by literary and cultural differences: an effort to maintain [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and rhythm, even in prose works, and extensive use of literary and cultural allusions, thereby also contributing to brevity.

Many final particles (歇語字 ''xiēyǔzì'') and interrogative particles are found in Literary Chinese.<ref>{{cite book

== Modern use ==
[[Image:LetterFromKhubilaiToJapan1266.jpg|280px|thumb|Classical Chinese was used in international communication between the [[Mongol Empire]] and [[Japan]]. This letter, dated 1266, was sent to [[Khubilai Khan]] from the \"King of Japan\" (日本國王)<!--The text within the image reads 日本國王, \"The King of Japan\".

Classical Chinese was the main form used in Chinese literary works until the [[May Fourth Movement]] (1919), and was also used extensively in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Classical Chinese was used to write the [[Hunmin Jeongeum]] proclamation in which the modern Korean alphabet ([[hangul]]) was promulgated and the essay by [[Hu Shih]] in which he argued against using Classical Chinese and in favor of [[written vernacular Chinese]].  (The latter parallels [[De vulgari eloquentia|the essay]] written by [[Dante]] in ''Latin'' in which he expounded the virtues of the vernacular ''Italian''.)  Exceptions to the use of Classical Chinese were vernacular novels such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.

Most government documents in the [[Republic of China]] were written in Classical Chinese until reforms in the 1970s, in a reform movement spearheaded by President [[Yen Chia-kan]] to shift the written style to [[vernacular Chinese]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Feng-fu|last=Tsao|chapter=The language planning situation in Taiwan|pages=60–106|editor1-last=Baldauf|editor1-first=Richard B.|editor2-first=Robert B.|editor2-last=Kaplan|title=Language planning in Nepal, Taiwan, and Sweden|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2000|volume=115|isbn=978-1-85359-483-0}} pages 75–76.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cheong|first=Ching|title=Will Taiwan break away: the rise of Taiwanese nationalism|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001|pages=187|isbn=978-981-02-4486-6}}</ref>

Today, pure Classical Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial occasions. The ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]'' (中華民國國歌), for example, is in Classical Chinese. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts, or [[sutra]]s, are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed or translated from [[Sanskrit]] sources.  In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese. For example, most official notices and formal letters are written with a number of stock Classical Chinese expressions (e.g. salutation, closing). Personal letters, on the other hand, are mostly written in vernacular, but with some Classical phrases, depending on the subject matter, the writer's level of education, etc. With the exception of professional scholars and enthusiasts, most people today cannot write in full Classical Chinese with ease.

Most Chinese people with at least a middle school education are able to read basic Classical Chinese, because the ability to read (but not write) Classical Chinese is part of the Chinese [[middle school]] and [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] [[curricula]] and is part of the college entrance examination. Classical Chinese is taught primarily by presenting a classical Chinese work and including a vernacular gloss that explains the meaning of phrases. Tests on classical Chinese usually ask the student to express the meaning of a paragraph in vernacular Chinese. They often take the form of comprehension questions.

The contemporary use of Classical Chinese in [[Japan]] is mainly in the field of education and the study of literature. Learning the Japanese way ([[kanbun]]) of decoding Classical Chinese is part of the [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] curriculum in Japan.<ref>{{cite book| title =中学校 高等学校 学習指導要領 国語科編（試案）| chapter =第七章 国語科における漢文の学習指導| url =http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| year =1951| author =文部省| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091215230001/http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| archivedate =2009-12-15}}</ref>

Classical Chinese is not a part of middle school and high school [[curricula]] in the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Vietnam]] nowadays.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The use of Classical Chinese in these regions is limited and is mainly in the field of [[Chinese classics|Classical studies]].

In addition, many works of [[literature]] in Classical Chinese (such as [[Tang poetry]]) have been major [[cultural]] influences. However, even with knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, Classical Chinese can be difficult to understand by native speakers of modern Chinese, because of its heavy use of literary [[reference]]s and [[allusion]]s as well as its extremely abbreviated style.

'''Classical Chinese''', also known as '''Literary Chinese''',{{efn|Some sources distinguish between Classical Chinese as strictly the language of the ancient classics and Literary Chinese as the classical style of writing used throughout Chinese history prior to the [[May Fourth Movement]] (see \"[[Classical Chinese#Definitions|Definitions]]\")}} is the language of the classic literature from the end of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] through to the end of the [[Han dynasty]], a written form of [[Old Chinese]]. Classical Chinese is a traditional style of [[written Chinese]] that evolved from the classical language, making it different from any modern [[Chinese spoken language|spoken form of Chinese]]. Literary Chinese was used for almost all formal writing in [[China]] until the early 20th century, and also, during various periods, in [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]]. Among Chinese speakers, Literary Chinese has been largely replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], a style of writing that is similar to modern spoken [[Mandarin Chinese]], while speakers of non-Chinese languages have largely abandoned Literary Chinese in favor of local vernaculars.

Literary Chinese is known as ''{{lang|ja-Latn|[[kanbun]]}}'' ({{lang|ja|漢文}}) in Japanese, ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[hanmun]]}}'' in Korean (but see also ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[gugyeol]]}}'') and ''{{lang|vi|cổ văn}}'' ({{lang|vi-Hani|古文}})<ref name=\"Nguyễn Tri Tài 2002 p5\">{{cite book |last=Nguyễn |first=Tri Tài |date=2002 |title=Giáo trình tiếng Hán.

== Definitions ==
Strictly speaking, Classical Chinese refers to the written language of the classical period of Chinese literature, from the end of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (early 5th century BC) to the end of the [[Han dynasty]] (AD 220),<ref>{{cite book | title = Chinese | author = Jerry Norman | authorlink=Jerry Norman (sinologist) | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1988 | pages = xi, 83 | isbn = 0-521-29653-6}}</ref> while Literary Chinese is the form of written Chinese used from the end of the [[Han Dynasty]] to the early 20th century, when it was replaced by vernacular written Chinese. It is often also referred to as \"Classical Chinese\", but [[Sinology|sinologists]] generally distinguish it from the language of the early period. During this period the dialects of China became more and more disparate and thus the Classical written language became less and less representative of the [[varieties of Chinese]] (cf. [[Classical Latin]], which was contemporary to the Han Dynasty, and the [[Romance languages]] of Europe). Although authors sought to write in the style of the Classics, the similarity decreased over the centuries due to their imperfect understanding of the older language, the influence of their own speech, and the addition of new words.<ref>Norman (1988), pp. 83–84, 108–109.</ref>

This situation, the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|use of Literary Chinese throughout the Chinese cultural sphere]] despite the existence of disparate regional vernaculars, is called [[diglossia]].  It can be compared to the position of [[Classical Arabic]] relative to the various [[Varieties of Arabic|regional vernaculars]] in Arab lands, or of [[Latin]] in medieval Europe. The Romance languages continued to evolve, influencing Latin texts of the same period, so that by the [[Middle Ages]], [[Medieval Latin]] included many usages that would have baffled the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The coexistence of Classical Chinese and the native languages of Japan, Korea and Vietnam can be compared to the use of Latin in nations that natively speak non-Latin-derived [[Germanic languages]] or [[Slavic languages]], to the position of Arabic in [[Persia]] or the position of the Indic language, [[Sanskrit]], in South India and Southeast Asia. However, the non-phonetic [[Chinese characters|Chinese writing system]] causes a unique situation where the modern pronunciation of the classical language is far more divergent (and heterogeneous, depending on the native – not necessarily Chinese – tongue of the reader) than in analogous cases, complicating understanding and study of Classical Chinese further compared to other classical languages.

Christian missionaries coined the term Wen-li ({{zh|t=文理|p=wénlǐ|w=wen-li}}) for Literary Chinese.
Though composed from Chinese roots, this term was never used in that sense in Chinese,<ref>{{cite book

For sinologues outside the missionary circle, the term \"wenli\" was not acceptable (\"... what the missionaries persist in calling wen li, meaning thereby the book language as opposed to the colloquial\"— Giles 1881/82, 151).

== Pronunciation ==
{{Further information|Old Chinese phonology|Middle Chinese}}
[[Image:Old chinese.PNG|right|thumb|The shape of the [[Oracle bone script]] character for \"person\" may have influenced that for \"harvest\" (which later came to mean \"year\").  Today, they are pronounced ''rén'' and ''nián'' in Mandarin, but their hypothesized pronunciations in [[Old Chinese]] were very similar, which may explain the resemblance.  For example, in the recent [[Reconstructions of Old Chinese#Baxter–Sagart (2014)|Baxter-Sagart reconstruction]]<ref>http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/</ref>, they were {{IPA|/niŋ/}} and {{IPA|/nˤiŋ/}}, respectively, becoming {{IPA|/nʲin/}} and {{IPA|/nin/}} in [[Early Middle Chinese]].]]
[[Chinese character]]s are not [[alphabet|alphabetic]] and only rarely reflect [[sound changes]].  The tentative reconstruction of [[Old Chinese]] is an endeavor only a few centuries old. As a result, Classical Chinese is not read with a reconstruction of Old Chinese pronunciation; instead, it is always read with the pronunciations of characters categorized and listed in the Phonology Dictionary (韻書; [[pinyin]]: ''yùnshū'', \"[[Rime dictionary|rhyme book]]\") officially published by the Governments, originally based upon the Middle Chinese pronunciation of [[Luoyang]] in the 2nd to 4th centuries.  With the progress of time, every dynasty has updated and modified the official Phonology Dictionary.  By the time of the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and [[Ming Dynasty]], the Phonology Dictionary was based on early Mandarin.  But since the [[Imperial Examination]] required the composition of [[Shi (poetry)|Shi]] genre, in non-Mandarin speaking parts of China such as [[Zhejiang]], [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]], pronunciation is either based on everyday speech as in [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]]; or, in some varieties of Chinese (e.g. [[Southern Min]]), with a special set of pronunciations used for Classical Chinese or \"formal\" vocabulary and usage borrowed from Classical Chinese usage.  In practice, all varieties of Chinese combine these two extremes. Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, also have words that are pronounced one way in colloquial usage and another way when used in Classical Chinese or in specialized terms coming from Classical Chinese, though the system is not as extensive as that of Southern Min or [[Wu Chinese|Wu]]. (See [[Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters]])

[[Japanese language|Japanese]],  [[Korean language|Korean]] or [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] readers of Classical Chinese use systems of pronunciation specific to their own languages. For example, Japanese speakers use ''On'yomi'' pronunciation when reading the [[kanji]] of words of Chinese origin such as 銀行 (ginkō) or the name for the city of Tōkyō (東京), but use ''Kun'yomi'' when the kanji represents a native word such as the reading of 行 in 行く (iku) or the reading of both characters in the name for the city of Ōsaka (大阪), and a system that aids Japanese speakers with Classical Chinese word order.

Since the pronunciation of all modern varieties of Chinese is different from Old Chinese or other forms of historical Chinese (such as [[Middle Chinese]]), characters that once [[rhyme]]d in poetry may not rhyme any longer, or vice versa. Poetry and other rhyme-based writing thus becomes less coherent than the original reading must have been. However, some modern [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] have certain phonological characteristics that are closer to the older pronunciations than others, as shown by the preservation of certain rhyme structures. Some{{who|date=October 2019}} believe Classical Chinese literature, especially poetry, sounds better when read in certain varieties that are believed to be closer to older pronunciations, such as Cantonese or Southern Min, because the rhyming is often lost due to sound shifts in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]].

Another phenomenon that is common in reading Classical Chinese is [[homophone|homophony]] (words that sound the same). More than 2,500 years of sound change separates Classical Chinese from any modern variety, so when reading Classical Chinese in any modern variety of Chinese (especially Mandarin) or in Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, many characters which originally had different pronunciations have become [[homonym]]s. There is a famous Classical Chinese poem written in the early 20th century by the linguist [[Chao Yuen Ren]] called the ''[[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]]'', which contains only words that are now pronounced {{IPA-cmn|ʂɨ|}} with various tones in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. It was written to show how Classical Chinese has become an impractical language for speakers of modern Chinese because Classical Chinese when spoken aloud is largely incomprehensible. However the poem is perfectly comprehensible when read silently because Literary Chinese, by its very nature as a ''written'' language using a [[logographic]] writing system, can often get away with using homophones that even in spoken Old Chinese would not have been distinguishable in any way.

The situation is analogous to that of some English words that are spelled differently but sound the same, such as \"meet\" and \"meat\", which were pronounced {{IPA-enm|meːt|}} and {{IPA|[mɛːt]}} respectively during the time of [[Chaucer]], as shown by their spelling. However, such homophones are far more common in Literary Chinese than in English. For example, the following distinct Old Chinese words are now all pronounced ''yì'' in Mandarin: ''*ŋjajs'' 議 \"discuss\", ''*ŋjət'' 仡 \"powerful\", ''*ʔjup'' 邑 \"city\", ''*ʔjək'' 億 \"100,000,000\", ''*ʔjəks'' 意 \"thought\", ''*ʔjek'' 益 \"increase\", ''*ʔjik'' 抑 \"press down\", ''*jak'' 弈 \"Chinese chess\", ''*ljit'' 逸 \"flee\", ''*ljək'' 翼 \"wing\", ''*ljek'' 易 \"change\", ''*ljeks'' 易 \"easy\" and ''*slek'' 蜴 \"lizard\".<ref>{{cite book

Romanizations have been devised giving distinct spellings for the words of Classical Chinese, together with rules for pronunciation in various modern varieties.
The earliest was the Romanisation Interdialectique (1931–2) of French missionaries [[Henri Lamasse]], of the [[Paris Foreign Missions Society]], and Ernest Jasmin, based on [[Middle Chinese]], followed by linguist [[Wang Li (linguist)|Wang Li]]'s ''wényán luómǎzì'' (1940) based on [[Old Chinese]], and Chao's [[General Chinese Romanization]] (1975).
However none of these systems has seen extensive use.<ref>{{cite book | first = David Prager | last = Branner | contribution = Some composite phonological systems in Chinese | pages = 209–232 | editor-first = David Prager | editor-last = Branner | title = The Chinese rime tables: linguistic philosophy and historical-comparative phonology | series = Current Issues in Linguistic Theory | volume = 271 | publisher = John Benjamins Publishing Company | publication-place = Amsterdam | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-90-272-4785-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title = Modern Chinese: history and sociolinguistics | first = Ping | last = Chen | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-521-64572-0 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/modernchinesehis00chen/page/173 173–174] | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/modernchinesehis00chen/page/173 }}</ref>

== Grammar and lexicon ==
{{main article|Classical Chinese grammar}}
Classical Chinese is distinguished from written vernacular Chinese in its style, which appears extremely concise and compact to modern Chinese speakers, and to some extent in the use of different [[lexicon|lexical items]] (vocabulary). An essay in Classical Chinese, for example, might use half as many [[Chinese character]]s as in vernacular Chinese to relate the same content.

In terms of conciseness and compactness, Classical Chinese rarely uses words composed of two Chinese characters; nearly all words are of one [[syllable]] only. This stands directly in contrast with modern Northern Chinese varieties including Mandarin, in which two-syllable, three-syllable, and four-syllable words are extremely common, whilst although two-syllable words are also quite common within modern Southern Chinese varieties, they are still more archaic in that they use more one-syllable words than Northern Chinese varieties. This phenomenon exists, in part, because polysyllabic words evolved in Chinese to disambiguate homophones that result from sound changes. This is similar to such phenomena in English as the [[pin–pen merger|''pen–pin'' merger]] of many dialects in the American south and the [[Cot–caught merger|''caught-cot'' merger]] of most dialects of American English: because the words \"pin\" and \"pen\", as well as \"caught\" and \"cot\", sound alike in such dialects of English, a certain degree of confusion can occur unless one adds qualifiers like \"ink pen\" and \"stick pin.\" Similarly, Chinese has acquired many polysyllabic words in order to disambiguate monosyllabic words that sounded different in earlier forms of Chinese but identical in one region or another during later periods. Because Classical Chinese is based on the literary examples of ancient Chinese literature, it has almost none of the two-syllable words present in modern Chinese varieties.

Classical Chinese has more [[pronoun]]s compared to the modern vernacular. In particular, whereas Mandarin has one general character to refer to the first-person pronoun (\"I\"/\"me\"), Literary Chinese has several, many of which are used as part of [[honorific]] language (see [[Chinese honorifics]]).

In [[syntax]], Classical Chinese is always ready to drop subjects and objects when a reference to them is understood ([[Pro-drop language|pragmatically inferable]]). Also, words are not restrictively categorized into [[parts of speech]]: nouns are commonly used as verbs, adjectives as nouns, and so on. There is no [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] in Classical Chinese, \"是\" ([[pinyin]]: ''shì'') is a copula in modern Chinese but in old Chinese it was originally a near [[demonstrative]] (\"this\"); the modern Chinese for \"this\" is \"這\" ([[pinyin]]: ''zhè'').

Beyond grammar and vocabulary differences, Classical Chinese can be distinguished by literary and cultural differences: an effort to maintain [[parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and rhythm, even in prose works, and extensive use of literary and cultural allusions, thereby also contributing to brevity.

Many final particles (歇語字 ''xiēyǔzì'') and interrogative particles are found in Literary Chinese.<ref>{{cite book

== Modern use ==
[[Image:LetterFromKhubilaiToJapan1266.jpg|280px|thumb|Classical Chinese was used in international communication between the [[Mongol Empire]] and [[Japan]]. This letter, dated 1266, was sent to [[Khubilai Khan]] from the \"King of Japan\" (日本國王)<!--The text within the image reads 日本國王, \"The King of Japan\".

Classical Chinese was the main form used in Chinese literary works until the [[May Fourth Movement]] (1919), and was also used extensively in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Classical Chinese was used to write the [[Hunmin Jeongeum]] proclamation in which the modern Korean alphabet ([[hangul]]) was promulgated and the essay by [[Hu Shih]] in which he argued against using Classical Chinese and in favor of [[written vernacular Chinese]].  (The latter parallels [[De vulgari eloquentia|the essay]] written by [[Dante]] in ''Latin'' in which he expounded the virtues of the vernacular ''Italian''.)  Exceptions to the use of Classical Chinese were vernacular novels such as ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]''.

Most government documents in the [[Republic of China]] were written in Classical Chinese until reforms in the 1970s, in a reform movement spearheaded by President [[Yen Chia-kan]] to shift the written style to [[vernacular Chinese]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Feng-fu|last=Tsao|chapter=The language planning situation in Taiwan|pages=60–106|editor1-last=Baldauf|editor1-first=Richard B.|editor2-first=Robert B.|editor2-last=Kaplan|title=Language planning in Nepal, Taiwan, and Sweden|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2000|volume=115|isbn=978-1-85359-483-0}} pages 75–76.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Cheong|first=Ching|title=Will Taiwan break away: the rise of Taiwanese nationalism|publisher=World Scientific|year=2001|pages=187|isbn=978-981-02-4486-6}}</ref>

Today, pure Classical Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial occasions. The ''[[National Anthem of the Republic of China]]'' (中華民國國歌), for example, is in Classical Chinese. [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts, or [[sutra]]s, are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed or translated from [[Sanskrit]] sources.  In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese. For example, most official notices and formal letters are written with a number of stock Classical Chinese expressions (e.g. salutation, closing). Personal letters, on the other hand, are mostly written in vernacular, but with some Classical phrases, depending on the subject matter, the writer's level of education, etc. With the exception of professional scholars and enthusiasts, most people today cannot write in full Classical Chinese with ease.

Most Chinese people with at least a middle school education are able to read basic Classical Chinese, because the ability to read (but not write) Classical Chinese is part of the Chinese [[middle school]] and [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] [[curricula]] and is part of the college entrance examination. Classical Chinese is taught primarily by presenting a classical Chinese work and including a vernacular gloss that explains the meaning of phrases. Tests on classical Chinese usually ask the student to express the meaning of a paragraph in vernacular Chinese, using multiple choice. They often take the form of comprehension questions.

The contemporary use of Classical Chinese in [[Japan]] is mainly in the field of education and the study of literature. Learning the Japanese way ([[kanbun]]) of decoding Classical Chinese is part of the [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] curriculum in Japan.<ref>{{cite book| title =中学校 高等学校 学習指導要領 国語科編（試案）| chapter =第七章 国語科における漢文の学習指導| url =http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| year =1951| author =文部省| url-status =dead| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091215230001/http://www.nicer.go.jp/guideline/old/s27jhj2/| archivedate =2009-12-15}}</ref>

Classical Chinese is not a part of middle school and high school [[curricula]] in the [[Korean peninsula]] and [[Vietnam]] nowadays.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The use of Classical Chinese in these regions is limited and is mainly in the field of [[Chinese classics|Classical studies]].

In addition, many works of [[literature]] in Classical Chinese (such as [[Tang poetry]]) have been major [[cultural]] influences. However, even with knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, Classical Chinese can be difficult to understand by native speakers of modern Chinese, because of its heavy use of literary [[reference]]s and [[allusion]]s as well as its extremely abbreviated style.

The '''1998 Stanley Cup Finals''' was the [[Stanley Cup Finals|championship series]] of the [[National Hockey League]]'s (NHL) [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98 season]], and the culmination of the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]]. It was contested by the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion and defending Stanley Cup champion [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Washington Capitals]]. It was the 105th year of the [[Stanley Cup]] being contested. The series was the Capitals' first appearance in a Stanley Cup Final since the franchise's inception in 1974. The Red Wings won the series for the second year in a row, four games to none. It was the Wings' ninth Stanley Cup, and the most recent time when a Finals concluded with a sweep (as of 2019). This was also the last time until {{scfy|2002}} that a Stanley Cup Finals ended after an [[NBA Finals]] in the same season had concluded. Detroit coach [[Scotty Bowman]] won his eighth Stanley Cup in that capacity (having previously done so with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in {{scfy|1973}}, {{scfy|1976}}, {{scfy|1977}}, {{scfy|1978}}, and {{scfy|1979}}, the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in {{scfy|1992}}, and the Wings [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|the previous year]]), tying him with former Canadiens coach [[Toe Blake]] for the record of most Cups won by a coach (which he would break when he helped the Red Wings win the 2002 Cup).

==Motivation to win a second straight title==
Just six days after sweeping the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the 1997 Finals, Red Wings defenceman [[Vladimir Konstantinov]] and masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov sustained serious brain injuries when the limousine in which they were riding crashed. [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] was also in the limousine but was not seriously injured. The Red Wings subsequently dedicated their 1997–98 season to the two injured members and wore a patch on their jerseys bearing the players' initials. When the Red Wings were presented with the Stanley Cup, they wheeled Konstantinov onto the ice and placed the Cup in his lap. They also took him for a victory lap around the rink.

==Paths to the Finals==
{{details|1998 Stanley Cup playoffs}}
{{see also|1997–98 Detroit Red Wings season|1997–98 Washington Capitals season}}
Detroit advanced to the Finals by defeating the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], [[St. Louis Blues]], and [[Dallas Stars]] in six games each.

Washington defeated the [[Boston Bruins]] 4–2, the [[Ottawa Senators]] 4–1, and the [[Buffalo Sabres]] 4–2.

==Game summaries==
In this series, Capitals head coach [[Ron Wilson (ice hockey b. 1955)|Ron Wilson]] became the first person to head coach in both an Olympics and a Stanley Cup Final in the same year, having coached team USA at the [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano Olympics]]. [[Peter Laviolette]] would join him in this feat in {{scfy|2006}} while with the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] during their championship season, having coached the American ice hockey team during the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Torino Olympics]].

===Game one===
At home, Detroit took an early lead in the first period and scored two goals within two minutes and 14 seconds of each other. The Red Wings were able to hold off a Washington assault and take the first game of the series with a score of 2–1.

===Game two===
It looked as if the Capitals were to tie the series with a 4–2 lead in the third period, but after a Detroit goal to make it 4–3, Capitals forward [[Esa Tikkanen]] had a
scoring opportunity midway through the third period that would have likely put Detroit away before the venue changed back to Washington's MCI Center, and also would have changed the entire dynamic of the series, but he missed the open net shot. Detroit then rallied late in the third period to tie the game and send it into overtime. [[Kris Draper]] scored with four minutes left in the first overtime to give the Red Wings a 5–4 victory and a 2–0 lead in the series.

===Game three===
Detroit scored in the first 35 seconds to take an early lead which held up until the third period. The Capitals tied the game midway through the third period, but [[Sergei Fedorov]] scored to give the Wings a three games to none lead in the series.

===Game four===
In game four, Detroit was dominant throughout to win the game by a score of 4–1 and sweep the series. When the Cup was awarded, [[Vladimir Konstantinov]] was brought onto the ice in his wheelchair and joined the celebration with his team.

===Stanley Cup engravings===
* Konstantinov's career ended in a car accident. The Red Wings still recognized him as part of the team and got permission from the league to have his name engraved.
* Wally Crossman was the oldest person engraved on the Stanley Cup at age 87.
* Detroit wanted to include a record 55 names on the Stanley Cup in 1997–98. Following that request, the NHL decided to limit the number of names to 52 to make sure all names fit on the Cup. Players who play in Stanley Cup Finals, or play at least 41 regular season games for the winning team, must be included on the Cup each year. Other players who do not officially qualify may also be included if requested by the team. There are no rules for which non-players must be included on the Stanley Cup, only a limit on total number of names going on the cup. No player who officially qualifies may be left off to include more non-players.
'''Included on the team picture, but left off the Stanley Cup'''
* #34 [[Norm Maracle]]† (G – 4 games played), #21 [[Darryl Laplante]]† (D – played 2 games) did not qualify to win the Stanley Cup. Both players spent majority of the season of in the minors.  Maracle played 66 games in goal for Adirondack while Darryl Laplante played 77 on defence. 
*Art Mnatsusakanov†, Johnny Remejes†, Mike Vella† (Dressing Room Asst.) – all 5 members were awarded Stanley Cup Rings

==Aftermath==
The following season, the Red Wings would reach the Western Conference Semifinals, only to be ousted by the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in six games. The Red Wings would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals until [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|four years later]], when they defeated the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in five games. The Washington Capitals, however, missed the playoffs the following year. The Capitals would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals until [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals|20 years later]], when they would win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history after defeating the [[Expansion team|expansion]] [[Vegas Golden Knights]] in five games.

The '''1998 Stanley Cup Finals''' was the [[Stanley Cup Finals|championship series]] of the [[National Hockey League]]'s (NHL) [[1997–98 NHL season|1997–98 season]], and the culmination of the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]]. It was contested by the [[Western Conference (NHL)|Western Conference]] champion and defending Stanley Cup champion [[Detroit Red Wings]] and the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[Washington Capitals]]. It was the 105th year of the [[Stanley Cup]] being contested. The series was the Capitals' first appearance in a Stanley Cup Final since the franchise's inception in 1974. The Red Wings won the series for the second year in a row, four games to none. It was the Wings' ninth Stanley Cup, and the most recent time when a Finals concluded with a sweep (as of 2019). This was also the last time until {{scfy|2002}} that a Stanley Cup Finals ended after an [[NBA Finals]] in the same season had concluded. Detroit coach [[Scotty Bowman]] won his eighth Stanley Cup in that capacity (having previously done so with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in {{scfy|1973}}, {{scfy|1976}}, {{scfy|1977}}, {{scfy|1978}}, and {{scfy|1979}}, the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in {{scfy|1992}}, and the Wings [[1997 Stanley Cup Finals|the previous year]]), tying him with former Canadiens coach [[Toe Blake]] for the record of most Cups won by a coach (which he would break when he helped the Red Wings win the 2002 Cup).

==Motivation to win a second straight title==
Just six days after sweeping the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in the 1997 Finals, Red Wings defenceman [[Vladimir Konstantinov]] and masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov sustained serious brain injuries when the limousine in which they were riding crashed. [[Viacheslav Fetisov]] was also in the limousine but was not seriously injured. The Red Wings subsequently dedicated their 1997–98 season to the two injured members and wore a patch on their jerseys bearing the players' initials. When the Red Wings were presented with the Stanley Cup, they wheeled Konstantinov onto the ice and placed the Cup in his lap. They also took him for a victory lap around the rink.

==Paths to the Finals==
{{details|1998 Stanley Cup playoffs}}
{{see also|1997–98 Detroit Red Wings season|1997–98 Washington Capitals season}}
Detroit advanced to the Finals by defeating the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], [[St. Louis Blues]], and [[Dallas Stars]] in six games each.

Washington defeated the [[Boston Bruins]] 4–2, the [[Ottawa Senators]] 4–1, and the [[Buffalo Sabres]] 4–2.

==Game summaries==
In this series, Capitals head coach [[Ron Wilson (ice hockey b. 1955)|Ron Wilson]] became the first person to head coach in both an Olympics and a Stanley Cup Final in the same year, having coached team USA at the [[1998 Winter Olympics|Nagano Olympics]]. [[Peter Laviolette]] would join him in this feat in {{scfy|2006}} while with the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] during their championship season, having coached the American ice hockey team during the [[2006 Winter Olympics|Torino Olympics]].

===Game one===
At home, Detroit took an early lead in the first period and scored two goals within two minutes and 14 seconds of each other. The Red Wings were able to hold off a Washington assault and take the first game of the series with a score of 2–1.

===Game two===
It looked as if the Capitals were to tie the series with a 4–2 lead in the third period, but after a Detroit goal to make it 4–3, Capitals forward [[Esa Tikkanen]] had a shot midway through the third period that would have likely put Detroit away before the venue changed back to Washington's MCI Center, and also would have changed the entire dynamic of the series, but he missed the open net shot. Detroit then rallied late in the third period to tie the game and send it into overtime. [[Kris Draper]] scored with four minutes left in the first overtime to give the Red Wings a 5–4 victory and a 2–0 lead in the series.

===Game three===
Detroit scored in the first 35 seconds to take an early lead which held up until the third period. The Capitals tied the game midway through the third period, but [[Sergei Fedorov]] scored to give the Wings a three games to none lead in the series.

===Game four===
In game four, Detroit was dominant throughout to win the game by a score of 4–1 and sweep the series. When the Cup was awarded, [[Vladimir Konstantinov]] was brought onto the ice in his wheelchair and joined the celebration with his team.

===Stanley Cup engravings===
* Konstantinov's career ended in a car accident. The Red Wings still recognized him as part of the team and got permission from the league to have his name engraved.
* Wally Crossman was the oldest person engraved on the Stanley Cup at age 87.
* Detroit wanted to include a record 55 names on the Stanley Cup in 1997–98. Following that request, the NHL decided to limit the number of names to 52 to make sure all names fit on the Cup. Players who play in Stanley Cup Finals, or play at least 41 regular season games for the winning team, must be included on the Cup each year. Other players who do not officially qualify may also be included if requested by the team. There are no rules for which non-players must be included on the Stanley Cup, only a limit on total number of names going on the cup. No player who officially qualifies may be left off to include more non-players.
'''Included on the team picture, but left off the Stanley Cup'''
* #34 [[Norm Maracle]]† (G – 4 games played), #21 [[Darryl Laplante]]† (D – played 2 games) did not qualify to win the Stanley Cup. Both players spent majority of the season of in the minors.  Maracle played 66 games in goal for Adirondack while Darryl Laplante played 77 on defence. 
*Art Mnatsusakanov†, Johnny Remejes†, Mike Vella† (Dressing Room Asst.) – all 5 members were awarded Stanley Cup Rings

==Aftermath==
The following season, the Red Wings would reach the Western Conference Semifinals, only to be ousted by the [[Colorado Avalanche]] in six games. The Red Wings would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals until [[2002 Stanley Cup Finals|four years later]], when they defeated the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] in five games. The Washington Capitals, however, missed the playoffs the following year. The Capitals would not return to the Stanley Cup Finals until [[2018 Stanley Cup Finals|20 years later]], when they would win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history after defeating the [[Expansion team|expansion]] [[Vegas Golden Knights]] in five games.

'''Peter John Kay''' (born 2 July 1973) is an English [[comedian]] and [[actor]]. Kay has written, produced, and acted in several television and film projects, and authored three books.

Born and brought up in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]], Kay studied media performance at the [[University of Salford]]. He began working part-time as a stand-up comedian, winning the North West Comedian of the Year award. In 1997, he won [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[So You Think You're Funny]]'' contest and the following year was nominated for a [[Perrier Award]] for his show at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]. With his public profile raised, in 2000, he co-wrote and starred in ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]'' for [[Channel 4]]. This resulted in a spin-off sitcom, ''[[Phoenix Nights]]'', which ran for two series from 2001–02, and in turn generated another spin-off, ''[[Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere]]'', in 2004. In 2005, he recorded a promotional video in which he mimed to [[Tony Christie]]'s 1971 hit \"[[Is This the Way to Amarillo]]\"; the song then reached number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming that year's best-selling single in the UK.

In 2008, Kay co-wrote and starred in ''[[Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'', a parody of several British [[reality television]] shows. As the series' fictional protagonist Geraldine McQueen, he released the single \"[[The Winner's Song]]\", which reached number 2 in the UK singles chart. His 2010–11 [[stand-up comedy]] tour was officially inaugurated into the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most successful of all time,<ref name=\"guin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/9/peter-kay-breaks-record-for-most-tickets-sold-for-a-stand-up-comedy-tour-44691|title=Peter Kay breaks record for Most tickets sold for a stand-up comedy tour|publisher=Guinness World Records|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref> playing to over 1.2 million people. He co-wrote and starred in ''[[Peter Kay's Car Share]]'', a sitcom screened by the [[BBC]] for two series between 2015–17. He also starred in the 2015 BBC sitcom ''[[Cradle to Grave]]''. 

In 2016, Kay won the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Male Comedy Performance|BAFTA TV Award for Best Male Comedy Performance]], the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy|BAFTA TV Award for Best Scripted Comedy]] and the [[21st National Television Awards|National Television Award for Best Comedy]] for ''Car Share''. He also received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Salford]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://salfordonline.com/28509-funnyman-peter-kay-receives-salford-honorary-doctorate.html|title=Comedian Peter Kay receives Salford honorary doctorate |website=Salfordonline.com|date=20 July 2016|language=en-GB|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2019}}
Kay was born and brought up in the [[Farnworth]] area of [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]],<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.smoothradio.com/features/peter-kay-facts/|title=10 Peter Kay facts all his fans should know|work=Smooth|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}</ref> where he attended [[Mount Saint Joseph School]], leaving with one [[GCSE]] in art. His father, Michael, was an engineer who died just before Peter's career took off.<ref name=\":0\" /> His mother, Deirdre O'Neill, is a Roman Catholic from [[Coalisland]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/laughter-lines-sure-our-peter-kay-gets-them-from-tyrone-28573987.html|title=Laughter lines? Sure ‘our’ Peter Kay gets them from Tyrone|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and Peter was brought up in her faith. He took several minor jobs, including working in a toilet roll factory, a [[Netto (store)|Netto supermarket]], [[Manchester Arena]], a cash and carry, a cinema, a petrol station and a bingo hall, which later inspired episodes for ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]''.

He began a degree course at the [[University of Liverpool]] in Drama, Theatre Studies and English Literature.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>  Struggling with the course, he changed to studying a [[Higher National Diploma]] (HND) in media performance (including stand-up) at the [[University of Salford]]'s Adelphi Campus School of Media, Music and Performance.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  In recognition of his contribution to the entertainment industry, Kay went on to receive an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree from his [[alma mater]] on 19 July 2016, at Salford's Lowry Theatre.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

His first stand-up was the competition the North West Comedian of the Year, which was held in [[Manchester]] and hosted by [[Dave Spikey]], who would later be the co-star and co-writer of ''[[Phoenix Nights]]''. Kay was last on the bill and won the competition, beating [[Johnny Vegas]]. Kay has said that he sought a career in comedy. However, he continued to work part-time as an usher at his local cinema in Bolton whilst performing stand-up locally. When the cinema closed, he was presented with the choice of finding another job or moving into comedy full-time.

After he entered and won Channel 4's ''[[So You Think You're Funny?]]'' contest in 1997, his first semi-professional stand-up appearances were at the 1998 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], where he received a prestigious [[Perrier Award]] nomination. During this time, he also appeared at various other clubs, such as London's [[The Comedy Store (London)|Comedy Store]].

Although this led to a certain level of public recognition, it was only after his first live video show Live at the Top of the Tower in 2000 that Kay attained mainstream recognition. During this period, he appeared on several chat shows, such as ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' and ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', on the latter of which he had previously served as warm-up. It was at this time that production also began on ''Phoenix Nights''. Subsequent advertisements for [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's]] bitter which imitate the style of ''Phoenix Nights'' saw Kay develop his catchphrases \"'ave it!\" and \"two lamb bhunas\".

In a Bolton nightclub in 1998, Kay met Susan Gargan whilst he was working at the local cinema. They married in 2001 after being in a relationship for three years. They have remained very private about their children. They have a teenage son, Charlie Michael Kay (that they named after their fathers, with Charlie being the name of Susan's late father). They are also thought to have other children.<ref name=\":0\" />

===1997–2000: Early career===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2015}}
Kay's first TV project was in a 1997 episode of ''New Voices'', a comedy series which showcased rising talent. His episode, \"Two Minutes\", written by Johanne McAndrew, saw him play a getaway driver as two of his friends attempted to rob a pub of its takings. In 1997, he played a delivery driver in the BBC drama ''[[Born to Run (TV series)|Born to Run]]''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrvAsNTKKYQ</ref> After presenting a slot titled \"Peter Kay's World of Entertainment\" on BBC Two's ''[[The Sunday Show]]'', Kay made an episode of Channel 4's ''[[Comedy Lab]]'', \"The Services\", in 1998, which won a [[Royal Television Society]] award for best newcomer. This served as a pilot for ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]''. Following the series' success, Kay and his co-writers – [[Neil Fitzmaurice]] and [[Dave Spikey]] – used the episode \"In the Club\" as the basis for ''Phoenix Nights'', which was an immediate hit. Set in a newly refurbished social club run by Brian Potter, the first series was filmed in part at St Gregory's Social Club in [[Farnworth]], [[Greater Manchester]], where the exterior, hallways and function suite were used.

In 2004, Kay followed the success with ''[[Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere]]'', a spin-off of ''Phoenix Nights''. The show featured the bouncer characters from the show—played by Kay and [[Paddy McGuinness]]—and at times also featured other characters from ''Phoenix Nights''. Six episodes were made and broadcast from November to December 2004 by Channel 4. In 2005, Kay was awarded a [[Rose d'Or]] at the international television festival in [[Montreux]] for Best Performance by an Actor.

On 17 April 2006, Channel 4 broadcast a \"Peter Kay Night\", showing out-takes from ''Phoenix Nights'' (previously featured on DVD), a behind-the-scenes documentary \"180&nbsp;– A Tour Documentary\" which followed Kay behind the scenes of his ''Mum Wants a Bungalow'' tour and screened the whole Peter Kay Live in Manchester Arena show. In 2008, he returned to television after an absence of four years with the BAFTA-winning satire of reality talent shows, ''[[Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'', which he co-wrote with Paul Coleman. The two-hour special was screened on Channel 4 on 17 October 2008. Kay won his second Royal Television Society award for best actor for playing Geraldine McQueen, a transsexual dinner lady from Ireland.

===2000–2011: Stage shows===
Kay has released several DVDs of live performances, including  \"Live at the Top of the Tower'', ''Live at the Bolton Albert Halls'' (which holds the record as biggest selling British stand-up DVD), ''Peter Kay: The Live Collections'' (the previous two combined), ''Peter Kay: Live at Manchester Arena'', and ''Peter Kay Live – The Tour That Didn't Tour Tour'' (which was recorded during his fifteen-night sold-out run at [[The O2 Arena]] in London).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===BBC work===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2015}}
In 2007, Kay followed this success with a cover version of \"[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]\", originally by [[the Proclaimers]], for Comic Relief. The video featured a celebration of British talent. In 2009, Kay switched his musical fund-raising to Children in Need with the release of Peter Kay's All Star Animated Band, which had taken two years to complete. He brought together over 100 animated children's characters in a six-minute animated medley. These characters included [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[Bob the Builder]] and [[Paddington Bear]]. It also featured some of the characters' original voice artists including [[Bernard Cribbins]], [[Neil Morrissey]], [[Ken Barrie]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The video was premiered on BBC1 on 20 November 2009.

Kay returned his support to Comic Relief in 2011 with a cover version of \"I Know Him So Well\". The song was re-recorded by multi-platinum selling singer [[Susan Boyle]] and Kay in the guise of Geraldine McQueen from ''Britain's Got the Pop Factor''. The video which accompanied the single was also directed by Kay and identically parodied the original video shot for shot. It premiered on Comic Relief on Friday, 18 March 2011.

In May 2015 his own sitcom ''[[Peter Kay's Car Share]]'' began to air. The series was a success and a second series was commissioned to start in April 2017. In October 2015, he starred in ''[[Cradle to Grave]]'' another BBC sitcom based on [[Danny Baker]]'s life as a teenager.

===Return to stand-up===
In November 2009, after an absence of seven years, Kay announced a return to stand-up with four (later extended to 20) dates at the [[Manchester Arena]] the following April with a show entitled [[The Tour That Doesn't Tour Tour...Now On Tour]]. Demand for tickets caused him to announce soon after that the show would be toured. In January 2012, the tour entered the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as the most successful stand-up comedy tour of all time, playing to a total of 1.2 million people.<ref name=\"guin\"/>

Kay's tour faced criticism when his disabled fans were hit with bills of up to £39 on premium phone lines booking tour tickets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/peter-kays-disabled-fans-hit-11586550|title=Peter Kay’s disabled fans hit with bills up to £39 on premium rate ticket line|first=Stephen|last=Hayward|date=25 November 2017|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>

In November 2017, Kay announced his intention to return to stand-up with his first tour in eight years. ''Peter Kay Live: Have Gags, Will Travel'' was scheduled to begin touring in 2018, beginning with the [[Genting Arena]] in April before touring at venues such as [[SSE Hydro]], [[Manchester Arena]], [[The O2 Arena]], [[First Direct Arena]], [[SSE Arena Belfast]], [[Sheffield Arena]] and [[Echo Arena Liverpool]]. On 13 December 2017, Kay announced that he was cancelling all future work projects (including ''Peter Kay Live: Have Gags Will Travel'' tour) for family reasons.<ref name=\"BBC News 13 December 2017\">{{cite news | title= Peter Kay cancels comeback comedy tour for family reasons |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42339698| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 13 December 2017| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 13 December 2017 }}</ref> He has asked that the media respect his and his family's privacy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/peter-kay-cancels-first-tour-11687075|title=Peter Kay cancels first tour in eight years - scrapping all 100 dates|last=Kindon|first=Frances|date=13 December 2017|website=Mirror.co.uk|access-date=13 December 2017}}</ref> The tour hit criticism again regarding phone calls as fans were charged 62p per minute to call premium rate phone lines to claim ticket refunds.<ref>https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/15/peter-kay-fans-angry-charged-get-refunds-cancelled-tour-7161802/</ref>

===Theatre work===
In February 2007, Kay played flamboyant gay director Roger DeBris in the [[Mel Brooks]] musical ''The Producers'' at Manchester's [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]] for 120 shows.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Guest appearances===
He appeared in the first episode of the 2002 series of ''[[Linda Green]]'', playing a pizza delivery man who ended up being something of a soulmate to the eponymous heroine. He has had two roles in ''[[Coronation Street]]''. The first, in the late 1990s, was a brief appearance as a shopfitter, but in January 2004 he co-wrote his scenes, appearing alongside [[Sally Lindsay]], who played [[Shelley Unwin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443153|title=Peter Kay|website=IMDb.com|access-date=24 July 2016}}</ref>

On 17 June 2006, Kay appeared in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[Love & Monsters]]\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> His character, the sinister Victor Kennedy, proved to be an alien called the Abzorbaloff in disguise. Kay was included in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'s'' \"[[Happy List]]\" in 2009 as \"simply Britain's best comedian\", and – as an exception to their general rule – was included again in 2010 for also raising funds for Children in Need.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-ios-happy-list-2009-the-100-1671055.html|title=The IoS Happy List 2009 - the 100|date=19 April 2009|website=Independent.co.u|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-ios-happy-list-2010-the-100-1953745.html|title=The IoS Happy List 2010 - the 100|date=25 April 2010|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>

On 9 September 2017, Kay took part in the \"We Are Manchester\" benefit concert to mark the reopening of [[Manchester Arena]] following [[Manchester Arena bombing|the terrorist attack in May 2017]]. He gave a speech to the crowd before introducing the concert's headline act [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

'''Peter John Kay''' (born 2 July 1973) is an English [[comedian]] and [[actor]]. Kay has written, produced, and acted in several television and film projects, and authored three books.

Born and brought up in [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]], Kay studied media performance at the [[University of Salford]]. He began working part-time as a stand-up comedian, winning the North West Comedian of the Year award. In 1997, he won [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[So You Think You're Funny]]'' contest and the following year was nominated for a [[Perrier Award]] for his show at the [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]]. With his public profile raised, in 2000, he co-wrote and starred in ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]'' for [[Channel 4]]. This resulted in a spin-off sitcom, ''[[Phoenix Nights]]'', which ran for two series from 2001–02, and in turn generated another spin-off, ''[[Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere]]'', in 2004. In 2005, he recorded a promotional video in which he mimed to [[Tony Christie]]'s 1971 hit \"[[Is This the Way to Amarillo]]\"; the song then reached number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming that year's best-selling single in the UK.

In 2008, Kay co-wrote and starred in ''[[Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'', a parody of several British [[reality television]] shows. As the series' fictional protagonist Geraldine McQueen, he released the single \"[[The Winner's Song]]\", which reached number 2 in the UK singles chart. His 2010–11 [[stand-up comedy]] tour was officially inaugurated into the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most successful of all time,<ref name=\"guin\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/9/peter-kay-breaks-record-for-most-tickets-sold-for-a-stand-up-comedy-tour-44691|title=Peter Kay breaks record for Most tickets sold for a stand-up comedy tour|publisher=Guinness World Records|date=7 September 2012|accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref> playing to over 1.2 million people. He co-wrote and starred in ''[[Peter Kay's Car Share]]'', a sitcom screened by the [[BBC]] for two series between 2015–17. He also starred in the 2015 BBC sitcom ''[[Cradle to Grave]]''. 

In 2016, Kay won the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Male Comedy Performance|BAFTA TV Award for Best Male Comedy Performance]], the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Situation Comedy|BAFTA TV Award for Best Scripted Comedy]] and the [[21st National Television Awards|National Television Award for Best Comedy]] for ''Car Share''. He also received an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Salford]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://salfordonline.com/28509-funnyman-peter-kay-receives-salford-honorary-doctorate.html|title=Comedian Peter Kay receives Salford honorary doctorate |website=Salfordonline.com|date=20 July 2016|language=en-GB|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref>

==Early life==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=August 2019}}
Kay was born and brought up in the [[Farnworth]] area of [[Bolton]], [[Lancashire]],<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.smoothradio.com/features/peter-kay-facts/|title=10 Peter Kay facts all his fans should know|work=Smooth|access-date=2018-06-11|language=en}}</ref> where he attended [[Mount Saint Joseph School]], leaving with one [[GCSE]] in art. His father, Michael, was an engineer who died just before Peter's career took off.<ref name=\":0\" /> His mother, Deirdre O'Neill, is a Roman Catholic from [[Coalisland]], [[County Tyrone]], [[Northern Ireland]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/laughter-lines-sure-our-peter-kay-gets-them-from-tyrone-28573987.html|title=Laughter lines? Sure ‘our’ Peter Kay gets them from Tyrone|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> and Peter was brought up in her faith. He took several minor jobs, including working in a toilet roll factory, a [[Netto (store)|Netto supermarket]], [[Manchester Arena]], a cash and carry, a cinema, a petrol station and a bingo hall, which later inspired episodes for ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]''.

He began a degree course at the [[University of Liverpool]] in Drama, Theatre Studies and English Literature.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>  Struggling with the course, he changed to studying a [[Higher National Diploma]] (HND) in media performance (including stand-up) at the [[University of Salford]]'s Adelphi Campus School of Media, Music and Performance.<ref name=\"auto\"/>  In recognition of his contribution to the entertainment industry, Kay went on to receive an Honorary Doctor of Arts degree from his [[alma mater]] on 19 July 2016, at Salford's Lowry Theatre.<ref name=\"auto\"/>

His first stand-up was the competition the North West Comedian of the Year, which was held in [[Manchester]] and hosted by [[Dave Spikey]], who would later be the co-star and co-writer of ''[[Phoenix Nights]]''. Kay was last on the bill and won the competition, beating [[Johnny Vegas]]. Kay has said that he sought a career in comedy. However, he continued to work part-time as an usher at his local cinema in Bolton whilst performing stand-up locally. When the cinema closed, he was presented with the choice of finding another job or moving into comedy full-time.

After he entered and won Channel 4's ''[[So You Think You're Funny?]]'' contest in 1997, his first semi-professional stand-up appearances were at the 1998 [[Edinburgh Fringe Festival]], where he received a prestigious [[Perrier Award]] nomination. During this time, he also appeared at various other clubs, such as London's [[The Comedy Store (London)|Comedy Store]].

Although this led to a certain level of public recognition, it was only after his first live video show Live at the Top of the Tower in 2000 that Kay attained mainstream recognition. During this period, he appeared on several chat shows, such as ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'' and ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'', on the latter of which he had previously served as warm-up. It was at this time that production also began on ''Phoenix Nights''. Subsequent advertisements for [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's]] bitter which imitate the style of ''Phoenix Nights'' saw Kay develop his catchphrases \"'ave it!\" and \"two lamb bhunas\".

In a Bolton nightclub in 1998, Kay met Susan Gargan whilst he was working at the local cinema. They married in 2001 after being in a relationship for three years. They have remained very private about their children. They have a teenage son, Charlie Michael Kay (that they named after their fathers, with Charlie being the name of Susan's late father). They are also thought to have other children.<ref name=\":0\" />

===1997–2000: Early career===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2015}}
Kay's first TV project was in a 1997 episode of ''New Voices'', a comedy series which showcased rising talent. His episode, \"Two Minutes\", written by Johanne McAndrew, saw him play a getaway driver as two of his friends attempted to rob a pub of its takings. In 1997, he played a delivery driver in the BBC drama ''[[Born to Run (TV series)|Born to Run]]''.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrvAsNTKKYQ</ref> After presenting a slot titled \"Peter Kay's World of Entertainment\" on BBC Two's ''[[The Sunday Show]]'', Kay made an episode of Channel 4's ''[[Comedy Lab]]'', \"The Services\", in 1998, which won a [[Royal Television Society]] award for best newcomer. This served as a pilot for ''[[That Peter Kay Thing]]''. Following the series' success, Kay and his co-writers – [[Neil Fitzmaurice]] and [[Dave Spikey]] – used the episode \"In the Club\" as the basis for ''Phoenix Nights'', which was an immediate hit. Set in a newly refurbished social club run by Brian Potter, the first series was filmed in part at St Gregory's Social Club in [[Farnworth]], [[Greater Manchester]], where the exterior, hallways and function suite were used.

In 2004, Kay followed the success with ''[[Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere]]'', a spin-off of ''Phoenix Nights''. The show featured the bouncer characters from the show—played by Kay and [[Paddy McGuinness]]—and at times also featured other characters from ''Phoenix Nights''. Six episodes were made and broadcast from November to December 2004 by Channel 4. In 2005, Kay was awarded a [[Rose d'Or]] at the international television festival in [[Montreux]] for Best Performance by an Actor.

On 17 April 2006, Channel 4 broadcast a \"Peter Kay Night\", showing out-takes from ''Phoenix Nights'' (previously featured on DVD), a behind-the-scenes documentary \"180&nbsp;– A Tour Documentary\" which followed Kay behind the scenes of his ''Mum Wants a Bungalow'' tour and screened the whole Peter Kay Live in Manchester Arena show. In 2008, he returned to television after an absence of four years with the BAFTA-winning satire of reality talent shows, ''[[Peter Kay's Britain's Got the Pop Factor... and Possibly a New Celebrity Jesus Christ Soapstar Superstar Strictly on Ice]]'', which he co-wrote with Paul Coleman. The two-hour special was screened on Channel 4 on 17 October 2008. Kay won his second Royal Television Society award for best actor for playing Geraldine McQueen, a transsexual dinner lady from Ireland.

===2000–2011: Stage shows===
Kay has released several DVDs of live performances, including  \"Live at the Top of the Tower'', ''Live at the Bolton Albert Halls'' (which holds the record as biggest selling British stand-up DVD), ''Peter Kay: The Live Collections'' (the previous two combined), ''Peter Kay: Live at Manchester Arena'', and ''Peter Kay Live – The Tour That Didn't Tour Tour'' (which was recorded during his fifteen-night sold-out run at [[The O2 Arena]] in London).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===BBC work===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2015}}
In 2007, Kay followed this success with a cover version of \"[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]\", originally by [[the Proclaimers]], for Comic Relief. The video featured a celebration of British talent. In 2009, Kay switched his musical fund-raising to Children in Need with the release of Peter Kay's All Star Animated Band, which had taken two years to complete. He brought together over 100 animated children's characters in a six-minute animated medley. These characters included [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[Bob the Builder]] and [[Paddington Bear]]. It also featured some of the characters' original voice artists including [[Bernard Cribbins]], [[Neil Morrissey]], [[Ken Barrie]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The video was premiered on BBC1 on 20 November 2009.

Kay returned his support to Comic Relief in 2011 with a cover version of \"I Know Him So Well\". The song was re-recorded by multi-platinum selling singer [[Susan Boyle]] and Kay in the guise of Geraldine McQueen from ''Britain's Got the Pop Factor''. The video which accompanied the single was also directed by Kay and identically parodied the original video shot for shot. It premiered on Comic Relief on Friday, 18 March 2011.

In May 2015 his own sitcom ''[[Peter Kay's Car Share]]'' began to air. The series was a success and a second series was commissioned to start in April 2017. In October 2015, he starred in ''[[Cradle to Grave]]'' another BBC sitcom based on [[Danny Baker]]'s life as a teenager.

===Return to stand-up===
In November 2009, after an absence of seven years, Kay announced a return to stand-up with four (later extended to 20) dates at the [[Manchester Arena]] the following April with a show entitled [[The Tour That Doesn't Tour Tour...Now On Tour]]. Demand for tickets caused him to announce soon after that the show would be toured. In January 2012, the tour entered the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as the most successful stand-up comedy tour of all time, playing to a total of 1.2 million people.<ref name=\"guin\"/>

Kay's tour faced criticism when his disabled fans were hit with bills of up to £39 on premium phone lines booking tour tickets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/peter-kays-disabled-fans-hit-11586550|title=Peter Kay’s disabled fans hit with bills up to £39 on premium rate ticket line|first=Stephen|last=Hayward|date=25 November 2017|work=Daily Mirror|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>

In November 2017, Kay announced his intention to return to stand-up with his first tour in eight years. ''Peter Kay Live: Have Gags, Will Travel'' was scheduled to begin touring in 2018, beginning with the [[Genting Arena]] in April before touring at venues such as [[SSE Hydro]], [[Manchester Arena]], [[The O2 Arena]], [[First Direct Arena]], [[SSE Arena Belfast]], [[Sheffield Arena]] and [[Echo Arena Liverpool]]. On 13 December 2017, Kay announced that he was cancelling all future work projects (including ''Peter Kay Live: Have Gags Will Travel'' tour) for family reasons.<ref name=\"BBC News 13 December 2017\">{{cite news | title= Peter Kay cancels comeback comedy tour for family reasons |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-42339698| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 13 December 2017| website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 13 December 2017 }}</ref> He has asked that the media respect his and his family's privacy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/peter-kay-cancels-first-tour-11687075|title=Peter Kay cancels first tour in eight years - scrapping all 100 dates|last=Kindon|first=Frances|date=13 December 2017|website=Mirror.co.uk|access-date=13 December 2017}}</ref> The tour hit criticism again regarding phone calls as fans were charged 62p per minute to call premium rate phone lines to claim ticket refunds.<ref>https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/15/peter-kay-fans-angry-charged-get-refunds-cancelled-tour-7161802/</ref>

===Theatre work===
In February 2007, Kay played flamboyant gay director Roger DeBris in the [[Mel Brooks]] musical ''The Producers'' at Manchester's [[Palace Theatre, Manchester|Palace Theatre]] for 120 shows.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Guest appearances===
He appeared in the first episode of the 2002 series of ''[[Linda Green]]'', playing a pizza delivery man who ended up being something of a soulmate to the eponymous heroine. He has had two roles in ''[[Coronation Street]]''. The first, in the late 1990s, was a brief appearance as a shopfitter, but in January 2004 he co-wrote his scenes, appearing alongside [[Sally Lindsay]], who played [[Shelley Unwin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0443153|title=Peter Kay|website=IMDb.com|access-date=24 July 2016}}</ref>

On 17 June 2006, Kay appeared in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[Love & Monsters]]\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> His character, the sinister Victor Kennedy, proved to be an alien called the Abzorbaloff in disguise. Kay was included in the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'s'' \"[[Happy List]]\" in 2009 as \"simply Britain's best comedian\", and – as an exception to their general rule – was included again in 2010 for also raising funds for Children in Need.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-ios-happy-list-2009-the-100-1671055.html|title=The IoS Happy List 2009 - the 100|date=19 April 2009|website=Independent.co.u|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-ios-happy-list-2010-the-100-1953745.html|title=The IoS Happy List 2010 - the 100|date=25 April 2010|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>

On 9 September 2017, Kay took part in the \"We Are Manchester\" benefit concert to mark the reopening of [[Manchester Arena]] following [[Manchester Arena bombing|the terrorist attack in May 2017]]. He gave a speech to the crowd before introducing the concert's headline act [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==Background==
{{See also|The Walt Disney Company#Corporate history}}
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day The Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as the '''Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio''', by filmmaker [[Walt Disney]] and his business partner and brother, [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]], in 1923.

The creation of [[Mickey Mouse]] and subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio which was renamed as '''The Walt Disney Studio''' at the Hyperion Studio in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1926.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company (1926)|work=kpolsson.com}}</ref> In 1929, it was renamed again to [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film, [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']], which becomes a huge financial success.<ref name=\"GablerBook\">{{cite book|last= Gabler|first= Neal|year= 2007|title= Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|location= New York |publisher=Random House|isbn= 0-679-75747-3|pages= 276–277}}</ref> With the profits from ''Snow White'', Walt relocated to [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|a third studio]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schroeder|first=Russel|title=Walt Disney: His Life in Pictures|url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisney00russ|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Disney Press|location=New York}}</ref>

In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such as ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]'' (1941) and ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946).<ref name=fu>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-walt-disney-company-history/|work=Company Profiles|publisher=fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release of [[Seal Island (film)|''Seal Island'']] (1948), the first of the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series and a subsequent [[Academy Award]] winner for [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live-Action Short Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/123954/The-Best-of-Walt-Disney-s-True-Life-Adventures/overview|title=The Best of Walt Disney's True-Life Adventures (1975)|website=NY Times Movies|publisher=New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109213719/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/123954/The-Best-of-Walt-Disney-s-True-Life-Adventures/overview|archive-date=2016-01-09|url-status=dead|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/141404/Seal-Island/details|title=New York Times: Seal Island|website=NY Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901035958/https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/141404/Seal-Island/details|archive-date=2013-09-01|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref>

==History==

Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release of [[Treasure Island (1950 film)|''Treasure Island'']]'','' considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Studios|url=http://thewaltdisneycompany.com:80/disney-companies/studio-entertainment|website=Disney Corporate|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors as [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] and [[United Artists]] and formed their own distribution company, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]].<ref name=\"bbg\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a0MG17nO.PG8&refer=home|title=Disney to Drop Buena Vista Brand Name, People Say (Update1)|last=Fixmer|first=Andy|date=April 25, 2007|work=Bloomberg News|accessdate=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918060836/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a0MG17nO.PG8&refer=home|archive-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

==Background==
{{See also|The Walt Disney Company#Corporate history}}
The studio's predecessor (and the modern-day The Walt Disney Company's as a whole) was founded as the '''Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio''', by filmmaker [[Walt Disney]] and his business partner and brother, [[Roy O. Disney|Roy]], in 1923.

The creation of [[Mickey Mouse]] and subsequent short films and merchandise generated revenue for the studio which was renamed as '''The Walt Disney Studio''' at the Hyperion Studio in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kpolsson.com/disnehis/disn1926.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company (1926)|work=kpolsson.com}}</ref> In 1929, it was renamed again to [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]. The studio's streak of success continued in the 1930s, culminating with the 1937 release of the first feature-length animated film, [[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'']], which becomes a huge financial success.<ref name=\"GablerBook\">{{cite book|last= Gabler|first= Neal|year= 2007|title= Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|location= New York |publisher=Random House|isbn= 0-679-75747-3|pages= 276–277}}</ref> With the profits from ''Snow White'', Walt relocated to [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|a third studio]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Schroeder|first=Russel|title=Walt Disney: His Life in Pictures|url=https://archive.org/details/waltdisney00russ|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Disney Press|location=New York}}</ref>

In the 1940s, Disney began experimenting with full-length live-action films, with the introduction of hybrid live action-animated films such as ''[[The Reluctant Dragon (1941 film)|The Reluctant Dragon]]'' (1941) and ''[[Song of the South]]'' (1946).<ref name=fu>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/the-walt-disney-company-history/|work=Company Profiles|publisher=fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=November 6, 2012}}</ref> That same decade, the studio began producing nature documentaries with the release of [[Seal Island (film)|''Seal Island'']] (1948), the first of the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' series and a subsequent [[Academy Award]] winner for [[Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film|Best Live-Action Short Film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/123954/The-Best-of-Walt-Disney-s-True-Life-Adventures/overview|title=The Best of Walt Disney's True-Life Adventures (1975)|website=NY Times Movies|publisher=New York Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109213719/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/123954/The-Best-of-Walt-Disney-s-True-Life-Adventures/overview|archive-date=2016-01-09|url-status=dead|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/141404/Seal-Island/details|title=New York Times: Seal Island|website=NY Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901035958/https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/141404/Seal-Island/details|archive-date=2013-09-01|url-status=dead|accessdate=2008-05-18}}</ref>

==History==

Walt Disney Productions had its first fully live-action film in 1950 with the release of [[Treasure Island (1950 film)|''Treasure Island'']]'','' considered by Disney to be the official conception for what would eventually evolve into the modern-day Walt Disney Pictures.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Studios|url=http://thewaltdisneycompany.com:80/disney-companies/studio-entertainment|website=Disney Corporate|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}</ref> By 1953, the company ended their agreements with such third-party distributors as [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] and [[United Artists]] and formed their own distribution company, [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Buena Vista Distribution]].<ref name=\"bbg\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a0MG17nO.PG8&refer=home|title=Disney to Drop Buena Vista Brand Name, People Say (Update1)|last=Fixmer|first=Andy|date=April 25, 2007|work=Bloomberg News|accessdate=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918060836/https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=a0MG17nO.PG8&refer=home|archive-date=September 18, 2011}}</ref>

She is of Norwegian,<ref>Cf. among others the death announcement for Ingvald Taft in ''Nordisk Tidende'' December 26, 1957, in which one of his grandsons, Clifford Johnson, was mentioned, as well as ''Nordisk Tidende'' December 11, 1941 (marriage of Clifford's parents Reuben Johnson and Evelyn Taft) and ''Nordisk Tidende'' January 5, 1950 (which among others tells that Ingvald Taft originally came from Arendal, Norway, while his late wife (Victoria Kristensen), came from Vanse outside Farsund, Norway). See also Victoria's christening in [https://media.digitalarkivet.no/en/kb20060601040090 Vest-Agder county, Vanse in Vanse, Parish register (official) no. A 12 (1879–1903), Born and baptised 1887, Page 84, no. 20], cf. Victoria's petition for naturalization of September 22, 1922, Ancestry.com. New York, State and Federal Naturalization Records, 1794–1940.</ref> Swedish, Danish, Irish, Scottish, and Native American descent. When she was nine days old, her father started a new job and the family moved to [[Franklin, Michigan]].

==Career==
Johnson's career began at age six, when she played the role of Chrissy Seaver on the [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Growing Pains]]'' from 1990 to 1992. The character's [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|age was accelerated]] from a toddler between seasons for plotting purposes. By the time she was 12, Johnson had been in the casts of eight TV series. She later reprised her role as Chrissy in ''[[The Growing Pains Movie]]'' and ''[[Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers]]''. In the one season series ''[[Phenom (TV series)|Phenom]]'' (1993–94), she played the mischievous younger sister of a rising teenage tennis star. Johnson appeared in the 1994 sitcom ''[[All-American Girl (1994 TV series)|All-American Girl]]'', which also lasted for only one season. She played DJ's overbearing girlfriend Lisa in the 1995 ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' episode \"The Blaming of the Shrew\".  During the 1995–1996 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] lineup, she played Gracie Wallace in the sitcom ''[[Maybe This Time (TV series)|Maybe This Time]]'' as the daughter of [[Marie Osmond]] and granddaughter of [[Betty White]] and love interest of [[Dane Cook]]. She played Alex Marshall, the daughter of [[Mel Gibson]]'s character, in the 2000 comedy ''[[What Women Want]]''. In 2008, she became a regular on the drama ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'' as Sharlee Cates. In 2009, Johnson appeared in \"Omega\", the season one finale of [[Joss Whedon]]'s ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''.

In 2012, she appeared in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (also directed by Whedon) as a waitress who is saved by [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers/Captain America]] ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]). She was intended to appear in future films as his newest love interest (as implied in a brief scene in the film), but that plan was shelved and instead actress [[Emily VanCamp]]'s [[Sharon Carter]] character became involved with Rogers. Although her role was minor, the [[Blu-ray]] edition of ''The Avengers'' contains some deleted scenes that expand her role in the movie and further her interactions with Rogers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2012/08/the-avengers-deleted-scene-sees-captain.html|website=Flickeringmyth.com|title=The Avengers deleted scene sees Captain America as a man out of time|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/former-growing-pains-child-star-small-important-avengers-172437386.html|website=Movies.yahoo.com|title=Former 'Growing Pains' child star has small-but-important 'Avengers' role|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Early life==
Johnson was born in [[Camarillo, California]], the youngest child of Nancy Spruiell Johnson, an independent film producer, and Clifford Johnson, the captain of an exploration ship. She is of Norwegian,<ref>Cf. among others the death announcement for Ingvald Taft in ''Nordisk Tidende'' December 26, 1957, in which one of his grandsons, Clifford Johnson, was mentioned, as well as ''Nordisk Tidende'' December 11, 1941 (marriage of Clifford's parents Reuben Johnson and Evelyn Taft) and ''Nordisk Tidende'' January 5, 1950 (which among others tells that Ingvald Taft originally came from Arendal, Norway, while his late wife (Victoria Kristensen), came from Vanse outside Farsund, Norway). See also Victoria's christening in [https://media.digitalarkivet.no/en/kb20060601040090 Vest-Agder county, Vanse in Vanse, Parish register (official) no. A 12 (1879–1903), Born and baptised 1887, Page 84, no. 20], cf. Victoria's petition for naturalization of September 22, 1922, Ancestry.com. New York, State and Federal Naturalization Records, 1794–1940.</ref> Swedish, Danish, Irish, Scottish, and Native American descent. When she was nine days old, her father started a new job and the family moved to [[Franklin, Michigan]].

==Career==
Johnson's career began at age six, when she played the role of Chrissy Seaver on the [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Growing Pains]]'' from 1990 to 1992. The character's [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|age was accelerated]] from a toddler between seasons for plotting purposes. By the time she was 12, Johnson had been in the casts of eight TV series. She later reprised her role as Chrissy in ''[[The Growing Pains Movie]]'' and ''[[Growing Pains: Return of the Seavers]]''. In the one season series ''[[Phenom (TV series)|Phenom]]'' (1993–94), she played the mischievous younger sister of a rising teenage tennis star. Johnson appeared in the 1994 sitcom ''[[All-American Girl (1994 TV series)|All-American Girl]]'', which also lasted for only one season. She played DJ's overbearing girlfriend Lisa in the 1995 ''[[Roseanne (TV series)|Roseanne]]'' episode \"The Blaming of the Shrew\".  During the 1995–1996 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] lineup, she played Gracie Wallace in the sitcom ''[[Maybe This Time (TV series)|Maybe This Time]]'' as the daughter of [[Marie Osmond]] and grand-daughter of [[Betty White]] and love interest of [[Dane Cook]]. She played Alex Marshall, the daughter of [[Mel Gibson]]'s character, in the 2000 comedy ''[[What Women Want]]''. In 2008, she became a regular on the drama ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]'' as Sharlee Cates. In 2009, Johnson appeared in \"Omega\", the season one finale of [[Joss Whedon]]'s ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''.

In 2012, she appeared in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (also directed by Whedon) as a waitress who is saved by [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers/Captain America]] ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]). She was intended to appear in future films as his newest love interest (as implied in a brief scene in the film), but that plan was shelved and instead actress [[Emily VanCamp]]'s [[Sharon Carter]] character became involved with Rogers. Although her role was minor, the [[Blu-ray]] edition of ''The Avengers'' contains some deleted scenes that expand her role in the movie and further her interactions with Rogers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flickeringmyth.com/2012/08/the-avengers-deleted-scene-sees-captain.html|website=Flickeringmyth.com|title=The Avengers deleted scene sees Captain America as a man out of time|date=August 30, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/former-growing-pains-child-star-small-important-avengers-172437386.html|website=Movies.yahoo.com|title=Former 'Growing Pains' child star has small-but-important 'Avengers' role|date=May 4, 2012|accessdate=February 2, 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Sun Yat Sen 1907.png|thumb|[[Sun Yat-sen]], one of the leaders of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] which overthrew the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1912. Photo taken in 1907]]

'''Anti-Qing sentiment''' refers to a sentiment principally held by [[Han_Chinese|Han Chinese]] against the [[Manchu]] ruling class during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1912), which was accused by a number of opponents of being barbarian. The Qing was accused of destroying traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] culture by forcing Han to wear their hair in a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] style. It was blamed for suppressing Chinese science, [[Qing conquest theory|causing China to be transformed]] from the world's premiere power to a poor, extremely backwards nation teared apart by a club of faraway imperialist powers. The people of the [[Eight Banners]] lived off [[Social welfare in China|government pensions]] unlike the general Han civilian population.

The rallying slogan of anti-Qing activists was (\"Fǎn Qīng fù Míng\" \"Oppose Qing and restore [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]\"), related to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] slogan \"Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners\".

In the broadest sense, an anti-Qing activist was anyone who engaged in anti-Manchu [[direct action]]. This included people from many mainstream political movements and uprisings, such as the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], [[White Lotus Rebellion]], [[Taiping Rebellion]], [[Panthay Rebellion]], [[Nian_Rebellion|Nian Rebellion]], [[Xinhai Revolution]], [[Revive China Society]], [[Tongmenghui]], and others.

{{Main|Koxinga|Southern Ming|Kingdom of Tungning}}

The Ming loyalist general [[Zheng Chenggong]], better known by his title Koxinga, led a military movement to oppose the [[Qing dynasty]] from 1646 to 1662. He established the [[Kingdom of Tungning]] on the island of [[Taiwan]].

=== Joseon ===

{{Main|First Manchu invasion of Korea|Second Manchu invasion of Korea}}

[[Joseon]] Korea operated within the Ming [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary system]] and had a strong alliance with the Ming during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]]. This put Joseon in a dilemma when both [[Nurhaci]] and the Ming requested support. [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting the Ming, a longstanding ally.

In 1623 King Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by [[Injo of Joseon|King Injo]] (r. 1623–1649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters. Reversing his predecessor's foreign policy, the new king decided to support the Ming openly, but a rebellion led by military commander [[Yi Gwal]] erupted in 1624 and wrecked Joseon's military defenses in the north. Even after the rebellion had been suppressed, King Injo had to devote military forces to ensure the stability of the capital, leaving fewer soldiers to defend the northern borders.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\">{{harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=349}}</ref>

The Manchus invaded Korea twice, in 1627 and 1636, eventually forcing Joseon to sever its ties with the Ming and instead to become a tributary of the Manchus. However, popular opposition to the Manchus remained in Korea. Joseon continued to use the Ming calendar rather than the Qing calendar, and Koreans continued to wear Ming-style clothing and hairstyles, rather than the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]]. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Joseon Koreans saw themselves as continuing the traditions of [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name=\"Holcombe\">{{harvnb|Holcombe|2011|p=176}}</ref>

== Anti-Qing rebellions ==

=== Mongol Rebellions ===
The [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Mongols under Qing rule]] were divided into three primary groups- the Inner Mongols, the Outer [[Khalkha Mongols]], and the [[Oirats|Eastern Oirat Mongols]].

The Inner Mongolian [[Chahar Mongols|Chahar]] Khan [[Ligdan Khan]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son [[Ejei Khan]] surrendered to the Qing in 1636 and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, 親王), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in [[Shenyang]] and the [[Kangxi Emperor]] gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.

The Khalkha Mongols were more reluctant to come under Qing rule, only submitting to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] after they came under an invasion from the Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar Khanate]] under its leader [[Galdan]].

The Oirat [[Khoshut]] [[Upper Mongols]] in [[Qinghai]] rebelled against the Qing during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] but were crushed and defeated.

[[File:Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue.JPG|thumb|Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue in Ulan-Bator]]

The Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] in the [[Dzungar Khanate]] offered outright resistance and war against the Qing for decades until they Qing annihilated the Dzungars in the [[Dzungar genocide]]. Khalkha Mongol rebels under Prince [[Chingünjav]] had plotted with the Dzungar leader [[Amursana]] and led a rebellion against the Qing at the same time as the Dzungars. The Qing crushed the rebellion and executed Chingünjav and his entire family.

During the Xinhai Revolution, the Outer Khalkha Mongols staged an uprising against the Qing and expelled the Manchu [[Amban]]s.

=== Taiping Rebellion ===
{{Main|Taiping Rebellion|Taiping Heavenly Kingdom}}

[[File:Hong Xiuquan.jpg|thumb|A drawing of Hong Xiuquan as the \"Heavenly King\" (ca. 1860)]]

[[Hong Xiuquan]] was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Chinese who was the leader of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850–1864) against the Qing dynasty. He proclaimed himself to be the [[Heavenly King]], established the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] and called [[Jesus Christ]] his brother.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==== Genocide and extermination of Manchus ====
Driven by their fierce hatred of Manchus, the Taiping launched a [[genocide]] campaign against the Manchus to exterminate their entire race. The past history was revived like the [[Transition_from_Ming_to_Qing|transition from Ming to Qing]] and [[Jin–Song Wars]] to boost hatred for the Manchus.

In every area they captured during the [[Taiping Rebellion]], the Taiping immediately rushed into the Manchu fort in order to kill all the Manchus. One Qing loyalist observed in the province of [[Hunan]] of the genocidal massacres committed by Taiping forces against the Manchus and wrote of the \"pitiful Manchus\", the Manchu men, women and children who were exterminated by the Taiping with their swords. Once [[Hefei]] capitulated, the Taiping forces rushed into the Manchu quarter shouting \"Kill the demons (Manchus)!\" while exterminating all the Manchus living there. [[Ningbo]]'s entire Manchu population was also annihilated.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wm4CuSvIYiEC&pg=PA139&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false| title=The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom: Rebellion and the Blasphemy of Empire | author=Thomas H.

After conquering Nanjing, Taiping forces stormed the Manchu fort, killing some 40,000 Manchus, which was the city's entire population of Manchus.<ref>{{cite book |author=Matthew White |author-link=Matthew White (historian) |title=Atrocities: The 100 Deadliest Episodes in Human History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0-fQHlaIpR4C&pg=PA289 |year=2011 |publisher=W.

=== Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856) ===
{{Main|Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856)}}
When news reached their ears that the Taipings succeeded in conquered Nanjing, the anti-Manchu [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]] saw this as an opportunity and possibility of overthrowing the Manchus to restore Han rule over China, and began the [[Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856)]]. These rebels were called 'Red Turbans' because of the red headscarves they wore.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Triad Societies: Western Accounts of the History, Sociology and Linguistics of Chinese Secret Societies, Volume 5 | page=59| author=Kingsley Bolton and Christopher Hutton | year=2010}}</ref>

The Red Turban Rebellion was initially quite successful as the rebels gained control of a considerable amount of territory. On July 1854, [[Foshan]] was occupied by the rebel.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yO8zPqi0_JYC&pg=PA630#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Middle Kingdom, Volume II, Part 2 | page=630| author=Samuel Wells Williams| author-link=Samuel Wells Williams }}</ref> In a desperate attempt to the eradicate any facilities which may support the Red Turbans, the Qing forces burnt the northern suburbs in [[Guangzhou]] to prevent it from sheltering the rebels.

The rebellion was ultimately defeated in 1856, which was followed by the mass execution of suspected sympathisers and participants of the rebellion.

=== Panthay Rebellion ===
{{Main|Panthay Rebellion}}

Born in Sichuan province in West China in 1885 to a merchant family, Zou (1885–1905) received a classical education but refused to sit for the civil service exams. He worked as a seal carver while pursuing classical studies. He gradually became interested in Western ideas and went to Japan to study in 1901, where he was exposed to radical revolutionary and anti-Manchu ideas.

Here are some quotations of Zou Rong:

\"Sweep away millennia of despotism in all its forms, throw off millennia of slavishness, annihilate the five million and more of the furry and horned Manchu race, cleanse ourselves of 260 years of harsh and unremitting pain\"<br />
\"I do not begrudge repeating over and over again that internally we are slaves of the Manchus and suffering from their tyranny, externally we are being harassed by the Powers, and we are doubly enslaved.\"<br />
\"Kill the emperor set up by the Manchus as a warning to the myriad generations that despotic government is not to be revived.\"<br />

'''Anti-Qing sentiment''' ({{zh|t=反清|p=fǎn Qīng}}) refers to a sentiment principally held in [[China]] against the [[Manchu]] ruling during the [[Qing dynasty]] (1636–1912), which was accused by a number of opponents of being barbarian. The Qing was accused of destroying traditional [[Han Chinese|Han]] culture by forcing Han to wear their hair in a [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]] in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] style. It was blamed for suppressing Chinese science, [[Qing conquest theory|causing China to be transformed]] from the world's premiere power to a poor, backwards nation. The people of the [[Eight Banners]] lived off [[Social welfare in China|government pensions]] unlike the general Han civilian population.

The rallying slogan of anti-Qing activists was \"Fǎn Qīng fù Míng\" (simplified Chinese: 反清复明; traditional Chinese: 反清復明; literally: \"Oppose Qing and restore [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]\"), related to the [[Boxer Rebellion]] slogan \"Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners\" (\"扶清滅洋 fú Qīng miè yáng\").

In the broadest sense, an anti-Qing activist was anyone who engaged in anti-Manchu [[direct action]]. This included people from many mainstream political movements and uprisings, such as [[Taiping Rebellion]], the [[Xinhai Revolution]], the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], the [[Revive China Society]], the [[Tongmenghui]], the [[Panthay Rebellion]], [[White Lotus Rebellion]], and others.

=== Joseon ===

{{Main|First Manchu invasion of Korea|Second Manchu invasion of Korea}}

[[Joseon]] Korea operated within the Ming [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary system]] and had a strong alliance with the Ming during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]]. This put Joseon in a dilemma when both [[Nurhaci]] and the Ming requested support. [[Gwanghaegun of Joseon]] tried to maintain neutrality, but most of his officials opposed him for not supporting the Ming, a longstanding ally.

In 1623 King Gwanghaegun was deposed and replaced by [[Injo of Joseon|King Injo]] (r. 1623–1649), who banished Gwanghaejun's supporters. Reversing his predecessor's foreign policy, the new king decided to support the Ming openly, but a rebellion led by military commander [[Yi Gwal]] erupted in 1624 and wrecked Joseon's military defenses in the north. Even after the rebellion had been suppressed, King Injo had to devote military forces to ensure the stability of the capital, leaving fewer soldiers to defend the northern borders.<ref name=\"Ebrey 349\">{{harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=349}}</ref>

The Manchus invaded Korea twice, in 1627 and 1636, eventually forcing Joseon to sever its ties with the Ming and instead to become a tributary of the Manchus. However, popular opposition to the Manchus remained in Korea. Joseon continued to use the Ming calendar rather than the Qing calendar, and Koreans continued to wear Ming-style clothing and hairstyles, rather than the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue]]. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, Joseon Koreans saw themselves as continuing the traditions of [[Neo-Confucianism]].<ref name=\"Holcombe\">{{harvnb|Holcombe|2011|p=176}}</ref>

== Anti-Qing rebellions ==

=== Mongol Rebellions ===
The [[Mongolia under Qing rule|Mongols under Qing rule]] were divided into three primary groups- the Inner Mongols, the Outer [[Khalkha Mongols]], and the [[Oirats|Eastern Oirat Mongols]].

The Inner Mongolian [[Chahar Mongols|Chahar]] Khan [[Ligdan Khan]], a descendant of Genghis Khan, opposed and fought against the Qing until he died of smallpox in 1634. Thereafter, the Inner Mongols under his son [[Ejei Khan]] surrendered to the Qing in 1636 and was given the title of Prince (Qin Wang, 親王), and Inner Mongolian nobility became closely tied to the Qing royal family and intermarried with them extensively. Ejei Khan died in 1661 and was succeeded by his brother Abunai. After Abunai showed disaffection with Manchu Qing rule, he was placed under house arrested in 1669 in [[Shenyang]] and the [[Kangxi Emperor]] gave his title to his son Borni. Abunai then bid his time and then he and his brother Lubuzung revolted against the Qing in 1675 during the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], with 3,000 Chahar Mongol followers joining in on the revolt. The Qing then crushed the rebels in a battle on April 20, 1675, killing Abunai and all his followers. Their title was abolished, all Chahar Mongol royal males were executed even if they were born to Manchu Qing princesses, and all Chahar Mongol royal females were sold into slavery except the Manchu Qing princesses. The Chahar Mongols were then put under the direct control of the Qing Emperor unlike the other Inner Mongol leagues which maintained their autonomy.

The Khalkha Mongols were more reluctant to come under Qing rule, only submitting to the [[Kangxi Emperor]] after they came under an invasion from the Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar Khanate]] under its leader [[Galdan]].

The Oirat [[Khoshut]] [[Upper Mongols]] in [[Qinghai]] rebelled against the Qing during the reign of the [[Yongzheng Emperor]] but were crushed and defeated.

[[File:Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue.JPG|thumb|Hotgoid Chingunjav Statue in Ulan-Bator]]

The Oirat Mongol [[Dzungar people|Dzungars]] in the [[Dzungar Khanate]] offered outright resistance and war against the Qing for decades until they Qing annihilated the Dzungars in the [[Dzungar genocide]]. Khalkha Mongol rebels under Prince [[Chingünjav]] had plotted with the Dzungar leader [[Amursana]] and led a rebellion against the Qing at the same time as the Dzungars. The Qing crushed the rebellion and executed Chingünjav and his entire family.

During the Xinhai Revolution, the Outer Khalkha Mongols staged an uprising against the Qing and expelled the Manchu [[Amban]]s.

[[Hong Xiuquan]] (洪秀全, Hóng Xiùquán) was a [[Hakka people|Hakka]] Chinese who was the leader of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850–1864) against the Qing dynasty. He proclaimed himself to be the [[Heavenly King]], established the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] and called [[Jesus Christ]] his brother.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==== Genocide and extermination of Manchus ====
Driven by their fierce hatred of Manchus, the Taiping launched a massive [[genocide]] campaign against the Manchus to exterminate their entire race.

The genocide of Manchus was incredible, in every area they captured, the Taiping immediately rushed into the Manchu fort in order to kill all the Manchus. One Qing loyalist observed in the province of [[Hunan]] of the genocidal massacres committed by Taiping forces against the Manchus and wrote of the \"pitiful Manchus\", the Manchu men, women and children who were exterminated by the Taiping with their swords. Once [[Hefei]] capitulated, the Taiping forces rushed into the Manchu quarter shouting \"Kill the demons (Manchus)!\" while exterminating all the Manchus living there. [[Ningbo]]'s entire Manchu population was also annihilated.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wm4CuSvIYiEC&pg=PA139&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false| title=The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom: Rebellion and the Blasphemy of Empire | author=Thomas H.

When news reached their ears that the Taipings succeeded in conquered Nanjing, the anti-Manchu [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] in the [[Pearl River Delta]] saw this as an opportunity and possibility of overthrowing the Manchus to restore Han rule over China, and began the [[Red Turban Rebellion (1854–1856)]]. These rebels were called 'Red Turbans' because of the red headscarves they wore.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Triad Societies: Western Accounts of the History, Sociology and Linguistics of Chinese Secret Societies, Volume 5 | page=59| author=Kingsley Bolton and Christopher Hutton | year=2010}}</ref>

The Red Turban Rebellion was initially quite successful as the rebels gained control of a considerable amount of territory. On July 1854, [[Foshan]] was occupied by the rebel.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yO8zPqi0_JYC&pg=PA630#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Middle Kingdom, Volume II, Part 2 | page=630| author=Samuel Wells Williams| author-link=Samuel Wells Williams }}</ref> In a desperate attempt to the eradicate any facilities which may support the Red Turbans, the Qing forces burnt the northern suburbs in [[Guangzhou]] to prevent it from sheltering the rebels.

The rebellion was ultimately defeated in 1856, which was followed by the mass execution of suspected sympathisers and participants of the rebellion.

=== Zou Rong ===
{{Main|Zou Rong}}
Born in Sichuan province in West China in 1885 to a merchant family, Zou (1885–1905) received a classical education but refused to sit for the civil service exams. He worked as a seal carver while pursuing classical studies. He gradually became interested in Western ideas and went to Japan to study in 1901, where he was exposed to radical revolutionary and anti-Manchu ideas.

Here are some quotations of Zou Rong:

\"Sweep away millennia of despotism in all its forms, throw off millennia of slavishness, annihilate the five million and more of the furry and horned Manchu race, cleanse ourselves of 260 years of harsh and unremitting pain\"<br />
\"I do not begrudge repeating over and over again that internally we are slaves of the Manchus and suffering from their tyranny, externally we are being harassed by the Powers, and we are doubly enslaved.\"<br />
\"Kill the emperor set up by the Manchus as a warning to the myriad generations that despotic government is not to be revived.\"<br />
\"Settle the name of the country as the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chss.iup.edu/baumler/zourong.html |title=Zou Rong The Revolutionary Army |accessdate=2008-12-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926224557/http://www.chss.iup.edu/baumler/zourong.html |archivedate=2008-09-26 }}</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit [[court clerk]] Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

The '''Salian dynasty''' or '''Salic dynasty''' ({{lang-de|Salier}}) was a [[dynasty]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The dynasty provided four [[kings of Germany]] (1024–1125), all of whom went on to be crowned [[Holy Roman emperors]] (1027–1125).

After the death of the last [[Ottonian]] emperor in 1024, the [[Kingdom of Germany]] and later the entire [[Holy Roman Empire]] passed to [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], a Salian. He was followed by three more Salian rulers: [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. They established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.

==Origins and name==

[[File:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|right|Family tree of the imperial dynasties of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: Carolingians, Ottonians, Salians and Hohenstaufen.]]

Modern historians suppose that the Salians descended from the [[Widonids]], a prominent noble kindred emerging in the 7th&nbsp;century. Their estates were located at the confluence of rivers [[Moselle]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] and they supported the [[Carolingians]]. The Widonids' eastward expansion towards the river [[Rhine]] started after they founded [[Hornbach Abbey]] in the [[Bliesgau]] around 750. Hornbach remained their [[proprietary church|proprietary monastery]] and royal grants to the abbey established their presence in the [[Wormsgau]]. As time passed, several branches split off the Widonids. The late 9th-century Holy Roman Emperor [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy (or Wido) of Spoleto]] descended from one of these branches, the Lambertines. The Salians' forefathers remained in [[Duchy of Franconia|Rhenish Franconia]]. {{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=7–9}}

[[Wipo of Burgundy]], the biographer of the first Salian monarch, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II]], described Conrad's father and uncle as \"distinguished noble lords from Rhenish Franconia\", but without calling them Salians around 1044. Wipo added that Conrad's mother, [[Adelaide of Metz]], \"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of [[Troy]]\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the royal [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relatinship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as [[Salic law]]. A less likely [[etimology]] links the appelation to the old German world ''sal'' (\"lordship\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=5–6}}

The term ''reges salici'' (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}} A list of monarchs and archbishop from [[Mainz]], which was completed around 1139–40, is the first extant document to contain it. Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], a maternal descendant of the Salian monarchs, also used the term in his ''Chronicle or History of the Two Cities'' in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=15}} In a narrow sense, only the four German monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the same appelation have already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}}

All male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named [[Conrad (name)|Conrad]] or [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]. Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II's grandfather, [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]], established this tradition in the late 10th&nbsp;century. He named his eldest son, [[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]], after his maternal great-grandfather, King [[Henry the Fowler]]; and he gave the name of his father, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], to one of his younger sons, [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]]. Conrad the Red was most probably named for King [[Conrad I of Germany]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=323}}

===Werner===

[[File:HRR 10Jh.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map of Central Europe|Map of the Holy Roman Empire in the 10th and 11th centuries: Germany ''(blue)'', Italy ''(grey)'', Burgundy ''(orange to the West)'', Bohemia ''(orange to the East)'', Papal States ''(purple)''.]]

[[Werner V (Salian)|Count Werner]] who held estates in the [[Nahegau]], [[Speyergau]] and Wormsgau early in the 10th&nbsp;century is the Salian monarchs' first certainly identified ancestor. His family links to the Widonids cannot be securely established, but his patrimonial lands and his close relationship with the Hornbach Abbey provide indirect evidence of his Widonid ancestry. He married a kinswoman, most probably a sister, of King Conrad&nbsp;I of Germany. This marriage alliance with the [[Conradines]] introduced Conrad as a [[leading name]] in his family.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=9}}

===Conrad the Red===
{{Main|Conrad the Red}}

Werner's son, Conrad the Red, inherited his father Franconian estates. His family links with the Conradines facilitated his acquisition of large portions of their domains after King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;I of Germany]] crushed their revolt in 939. The Conradines lost their preeminent position in Franconia and Conrad the Red emerged as Otto&nbsp;I's principal supporter in the region. He was awarded with the [[Duchy of Lotharingia]] in 944 or 945 and he married the King's daughter, [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Luidgard]], in 947. The marriage forged a link between the royal [[Ottonian dynasty]] and the Salians. He lost Lotharingia after he joined a revolt against his father-in-law in 953 or 954. He died fighting against the invading [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lech]] in 955. The contemporaneous [[Widukind of Corvey]] praised him for his bravery. He was buried in the [[Worms Cathedral]], although mainly bishops and kings had so far been buried in cathedrals.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=6, 9}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18, 361 (note 22)}}

===Otto of Worms===
{{Main|Otto I, Duke of Carinthia}}

Conrad the Red's son, Otto of Worms, founded favour with his maternal granfather, King (from 962 Emperor) Otto&nbsp;I. Still a minor, he was mentioned as a count in the [[Nahegau]] in 956. He also seized Wormsgau, Speyergau, [[Niddagau]], [[Elsenzgau]], [[Kraichgau]] and [[Pfinzgau]], thus uniting almost all lands between the rivers Rhine and [[Neckar]] by the time Otto&nbsp;I deceased in 973. The parentage of his wife, Judith, is uncertain: she may have been related either to [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]], to Count Henry of Arlon, or to [[Burkhard, Margrave of Austria|Burchard, Margrave in the Eastern Marches]]. Otto&nbsp;I's son and successor, Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;II]], was obviously worried aboukt the concentration of lands in his nephew's hands in Franconia. The Emperor appointed Otto of Worms to administer the faraway [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona]] in 978. The Emperor also persuaded Otto to cede his right to administer justice in Worms and also parts of his revenues in the town to the [[Bishop of Worms|local bishop]]. Otto was persuaded to renounce Carinthia and Verona, but he was lavishly compensated with a large forest in [[Wasgau]], the royal palace at [[Kaiserslautern]] and the properiatery rights over [[Weissenburg Abbey, Alsace|Weissenburg Abbey]]. He could also preserve the title of duke, thus he was the first duke to bear the title without ruling a duchy in Germany. Otto was the cousin of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]], thus he had a strong claim to the throne after the Emperor's death, but he concluded an agreement with the Ottonian candidate, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry of Bavaria]] in 1002. Henry restored Carinthia to Otto in 1002 and he ruled the duchy until his death in 1004.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=11, 14, 184, 190 (notes 10 and 12)}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18–19, 23, 361 (note 20)}}

Henry was Otto of Worms's eldest son. His wife, Adelaide, was born into a prominent Lotharingian family, being the daughter of Richard, Count of Metz. Their son, Conrad, would be the first Salian monarch, but Henry could not transfer his seniority rights to his son, because he predeceased his father most probably in 990 or 991.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=14}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}

===Conrad of Carinthia===

{{Main|Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia}}

After Henry of Worms' premature death, his seniority rights shifted to his younger brother, Conrad, enabling him to inherit the major part of the patrimonial lands from his father.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=14, 20}} Conrad married a daughter of [[Herman II, Duke of Swabia]], [[Matilda of Swabia|Matilda]] most probably in 1002. Two years later, he succeeded his father as Duke of Carinthia—the duchy passed from father to son for the first time on this occasion. His rule in Carinthia is poorly documented and he died in 1011.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=23–25, 363 (note 59)}}

===Pope Gregory V===

{{Main|Pope Gregory V}}

Bruno—the future Pope Gregory&nbsp;V—was a younger son of Otto of Worms.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}} His father's cousin, Otto&nbsp;III, placed him on the papal throne in 996, ignoring the provisions of his own ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'' on papal elections. Bruno, who was the first German pope, assumed his papal name in memory of [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. He crowned Otto&nbsp;III emperor on the [[Feast of the Ascension]] in the same year. The Roman aristocrat [[Crescentius the Younger]] expelled him from Rome, but the Emperor crushed the revolt and restored the papal throne to Gregory&nbsp;V. The Pope died at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven in 999.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=190 (note 1)}}{{sfn|Schutz|2010|pp=84, 88}}

===William of Strasbourg===

{{Main|William I (bishop of Strasbourg)}}

William was Otto of Worms' youngest son. After serving in the royal court as archchaplain to Queen [[Gisela of Swabia|Gisella]], William was made [[bishop of Strasbourg]] in 1028 or 1029. The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg|see of Strasbourg]] was one of the wealthiest German bishoprics. His tenure was almost uneventful and he died in 1046 or 1047.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18, 272–273}}

===Conrad the Younger===

{{Main|Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia}}

Conrad, the elder son of Duke Conrad I of Carinthia and Matilda of Swabia, was born between 1002 and 1005. He was underage when his father died in 1011. He inherited his father's patrimonial lands, but Emperor Henry&nbsp;II made [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Adalbero of Eppelstein]] the new duke of Carinthia.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=20)}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=25, 363 (note 59)}} After Emperor Henry&nbsp;II died in 1024, both Conrad and his cousin, Conrad the Elder, laid claim to the throne and Conrad the Elder was elected the new monarch.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=115}}

==Salian monarchy==
After the death of the last Saxon Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] the first Salian regent Conrad II was elected by the majority of the [[Prince-elector]]s and was crowned German king in [[Mainz]] on 8 September 1024. Early in 1026 Conrad went to [[Milan]], where [[Archbishop Aribert of Milan|Ariberto]], [[archbishop of Milan]], crowned him [[king of Italy]]. When [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Provençal nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Zürich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors.

Already in 1028 Conrad II had his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign [[Speyer Cathedral]] was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052–1055. 1046 Henry ended the [[Schism (religion)|papal schism]], freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.

The early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the [[Catholic Church|Church]], a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] (or ''Investiture Dispute''), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], demanded that Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to [[Canossa]] in northern [[Italy]] in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an [[antipope]] ([[Antipope Clement III]]) in 1080.

The monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] coincided with the final phase of the great [[Investiture Controversy]], which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.

According to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of the other princes, only on those living within his family's territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire – in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire's intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in [[France]] and [[Italy]]. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.

The first [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] was a grandson of the Salian [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. ([[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], Henry IV's daughter and Henry V's sister, was the heiress of Salian dynasty's lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty and her second marriage the ducal [[Babenberg]] potentates of [[Duchy of Austria]] which was elevated much due to such connections [[Privilegium Minus]].){{huh|date=April 2017}}

The '''Salian dynasty''' or '''Salic dynasty''' ({{lang-de|Salier}}) was a [[dynasty]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. The dynasty provided four [[kings of Germany]] (1024–1125), all of whom went on to be crowned [[Holy Roman emperors]] (1027–1125).

After the death of the last [[Ottonian]] emperor in 1024, the [[Kingdom of Germany]] and later the entire [[Holy Roman Empire]] passed to [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]], a Salian. He was followed by three more Salian rulers: [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], and [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]]. They established their monarchy as a major European power. They achieved the development of a permanent administrative system based on a class of public officials answerable to the crown.

==Origins and name==

[[File:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|right|Family tree of the imperial dynasties of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]: Carolingians, Ottonians, Salians and Hohenstaufen.]]

Modern historians suppose that the Salians descended from the [[Widonids]], a prominent noble kindred emerging in the 7th&nbsp;century. Their estates were located at the confluence of rivers [[Moselle]] and [[Saar (river)|Saar]] and they supported the [[Carolingians]]. The Widonids' eastward expansion towards the river [[Rhine]] started after they founded [[Hornbach Abbey]] in the [[Bliesgau]] around 750. Hornbach remained their [[proprietary church|proprietary monastery]] and royal grants to the abbey established their presence in the [[Wormsgau]]. As time passed, several branches split off the Widonids. The late 9th-century Holy Roman Emperor [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy (or Wido) of Spoleto]] descended from one of these branches, the Lambertines. The Salians' forefathers remained in [[Duchy of Franconia|Rhenish Franconia]]. {{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=7–9}}

[[Wipo of Burgundy]], the biographer of the first Salian monarch, [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II]], described Conrad's father and uncle as \"distinguished noble lords from Rhenish Franconia\", but without calling them Salians around 1044. Wipo added that Conrad's mother, [[Adelaide of Metz]], \"supposedly descended from the ancient royal house of [[Troy]]\". The statement made a connection between Conrad and the royal [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]] who had claimed a Troyan ancestry for themselves. Historian Stefan Weinfurter proposes that the putative relatinship between the Salians and the Merovingians gave rise to the family name, because the Salian Franks had been the most renowned Frankish group. Their memory was preserved through a Frankish law code, known as [[Salic law]]. A less likely [[etimology]] links the appelation to the old German world ''sal'' (\"lordship\"), proposing that the name can be traced to the Salian monarchs' well-documented inclination towards hierarchical structures.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=5–6}}

The term ''reges salici'' (or Salian kings) was most probably coined early in the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}} A list of monarchs and archbishop from [[Mainz]], which was completed around 1139–40, is the first extant document to contain it. Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], a maternal descendant of the Salian monarchs, also used the term in his ''Chronicle or History of the Two Cities'' in the middle of the 12th&nbsp;century.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=15}} In a narrow sense, only the four German monarchs who ruled from 1024 to 1125 could be called Salians, but the same appelation have already been expanded to their ancestors by modern historians.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=5}}

All male members of the family who were destined to a secular career were named [[Conrad (name)|Conrad]] or [[Henry (given name)|Henry]]. Emperor Conrad&nbsp;II's grandfather, [[Otto I, Duke of Carinthia|Otto of Worms]], established this tradition in the late 10th&nbsp;century. He named his eldest son, [[Henry of Speyer|Henry of Worms]], after his maternal great-grandfather, King [[Henry the Fowler]]; and he gave the name of his father, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], to one of his younger sons, [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]]. Conrad the Red was most probably named for King [[Conrad I of Germany]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=323}}

===Werner===

[[File:HRR 10Jh.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Map of Central Europe|Map of the Holy Roman Empire in the 10th and 11th centuries: Germany ''(blue)'', Italy ''(grey)'', Burgundy ''(orange to the West)'', Bohemia ''(orange to the East)'', Papal States ''(purple)''.]]

[[Werner V (Salian)|Count Werner]] who held estates in the [[Nahegau]], [[Speyergau]] and Wormsgau early in the 10th&nbsp;century is the Salian monarchs' first certainly identified ancestor. His family links to the Widonids cannot be securely established, but his patrimonial lands and his close relationship with the Hornbach Abbey provide indirect evidence of his Widonid ancestry. He married a kinswoman, most probably a sister, of King Conrad&nbsp;I of Germany. This marriage alliance with the [[Conradines]] introduced Conrad as a [[leading name]] in his family.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=9}}

===Conrad the Red===
{{Main|Conrad the Red}}

Werner's son, Conrad the Red, inherited his father Franconian estates. His family links with the Conradines facilitated his acquisition of large portions of their domains after King [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;I of Germany]] crushed their revolt in 939. The Conradines lost their preeminent position in Franconia and Conrad the Red emerged as Otto&nbsp;I's principal supporter in the region. He was awarded with the [[Duchy of Lotharingia]] in 944 or 945 and he married the King's daughter, [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Luidgard]], in 947. The marriage forged a link between the royal [[Ottonian dynasty]] and the Salians. He lost Lotharingia after he joined a revolt against his father-in-law in 953 or 954. He died fighting against the invading [[Magyars]] in the [[Battle of Lech]] in 955. The contemporaneous [[Widukind of Corvey]] praised him for his bravery. He was buried in the [[Worms Cathedral]], although mainly bishops and kings had so far been buried in cathedrals.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=6, 9}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18, 361 (note 22)}}

===Otto of Worms===
{{Main|Otto I, Duke of Carinthia}}

Conrad the Red's son, Otto of Worms, founded favour with his maternal granfather, King (from 962 Emperor) Otto&nbsp;I. Still a minor, he was mentioned as a count in the [[Nahegau]] in 956. He also seized Wormsgau, Speyergau, [[Niddagau]], [[Elsenzgau]], [[Kraichgau]] and [[Pfinzgau]], thus uniting almost all lands between the rivers Rhine and [[Neckar]] by the time Otto&nbsp;I deceased in 973. The parentage of his wife, Judith, is uncertain: she may have been related either to [[Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria]], to Count Henry of Arlon, or to [[Burkhard, Margrave of Austria|Burchard, Margrave in the Eastern Marches]]. Otto&nbsp;I's son and successor, Emperor [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;II]], was obviously worried aboukt the concentration of lands in his nephew's hands in Franconia. The Emperor appointed Otto of Worms to administer the faraway [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[March of Verona]] in 978. The Emperor also persuaded Otto to cede his right to administer justice in Worms and also parts of his revenues in the town to the [[Bishop of Worms|local bishop]]. Otto was persuaded to renounce Carinthia and Verona, but he was lavishly compensated with a large forest in [[Wasgau]], the royal palace at [[Kaiserslautern]] and the properiatery rights over [[Weissenburg Abbey, Alsace|Weissenburg Abbey]]. He could also preserve the title of duke, thus he was the first duke to bear the title without ruling a duchy in Germany. Otto was the cousin of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor]], thus he had a strong claim to the throne after the Emperor's death, but he concluded an agreement with the Ottonian candidate, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry of Bavaria]] in 1002. Henry restored Carinthia to Otto in 1002 and he ruled the duchy until his death in 1004.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=11, 14, 184, 190 (notes 10 and 12)}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=18–19, 23, 361 (note 20)}}

Henry was Otto of Worms's eldest son. His wife, Adelaide, was born into a prominent Lotharingian family, being the daughter of Richard, Count of Metz. Their son, Conrad, would be the first Salian monarch, but Henry could not transfer his seniority rights to his son, because he predeceased his father most probably in 990 or 991.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=14}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}

===Conrad of Carinthia===

{{Main|Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia}}

After Henry of Worms' premature death, his seniority rights shifted to his younger brother, Conrad, enabling him to inherit the major part of the patrimonial lands from his father.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|pp=14, 20}} Conrad married a daughter of [[Herman II, Duke of Swabia]], [[Matilda of Swabia|Matilda]] most probably in 1002. Two years later, he succeeded his father as Duke of Carinthia—the duchy passed from father to son for the first time on this occasion. His rule in Carinthia is poorly documented and he died in 1011.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=23–25, 363 (note 59)}}

===Pope Gregory V===

{{Main|Pope Gregory V}}

Bruno—the future Pope Gregory&nbsp;V—was a younger son of Otto of Worms.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}} His father's cousin, Otto&nbsp;III, placed him on the papal throne in 996, ignoring the provisions of his own ''[[Diploma Ottonianum]]'' on papal elections. Bruno, who was the first German pope, assumed his papal name in memory of [[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]. He crowned Otto&nbsp;III emperor on the [[Feast of the Ascension]] in the same year. The Roman aristocrat [[Crescentius the Younger]] expelled him from Rome, but the Emperor crushed the revolt and restored the papal throne to Gregory&nbsp;V. The Pope died at the age of twenty-six or twenty-seven in 999.{{sfn|Weinfurter|1999|p=190 (note 1)}}{{sfn|Schutz|2010|pp=84, 88}}

==Salian monarchy==
After the death of the last Saxon Emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] the first Salian regent Conrad II was elected by the majority of the [[Prince-elector]]s and was crowned German king in [[Mainz]] on 8 September 1024. Early in 1026 Conrad went to [[Milan]], where [[Archbishop Aribert of Milan|Ariberto]], [[archbishop of Milan]], crowned him [[king of Italy]]. When [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died 1032, Conrad II also claimed this kingship on the basis of an inheritance Henry II had extorted from the former in 1006. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Provençal nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Zürich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy would become known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors.

Already in 1028 Conrad II had his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] elected and anointed king of Germany. Henry's tenure led to an overstatement of previously unknown sacral kingship. So during this reign [[Speyer Cathedral]] was expanded to be the largest church in Western Christendom. Henry's conception of a legitimate power of royal disposition in the duchies was successful against the dukes, and thus secured royal control. However, in [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], this led to years of conflict, from which Henry emerged as the winner. But also in southern Germany a powerful opposition group was formed in the years 1052–1055. 1046 Henry ended the [[Schism (religion)|papal schism]], freed the Papacy from dependence on the Roman nobility, and laid the basis for its universal applicability. His early death in 1056 was long regarded as a disaster for the Empire.
[[File:SpeyererDom vonSuedWesten.JPG|left|thumb|[[Speyer Cathedral]], burial place of all Salian Emperors]]
The early Salians owed much of their success to their alliance with the [[Catholic Church|Church]], a policy begun by Otto I, which gave them the material support they needed to subdue rebellious dukes. In time, however, the Church came to regret this close relationship. The alliance broke down in 1075 during what came to be known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] (or ''Investiture Dispute''), a struggle in which the reformist Pope, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], demanded that Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] renounce his rights over the Church in Germany. The pope also attacked the concept of monarchy by divine right and gained the support of significant elements of the German nobility interested in limiting imperial absolutism. More important, the pope forbade ecclesiastical officials under pain of excommunication to support Henry as they had so freely done in the past. In the end, Henry IV journeyed to [[Canossa]] in northern [[Italy]] in 1077 to do penance and to receive absolution from the pope. However, he resumed the practice of lay investiture (appointment of religious officials by civil authorities) and arranged the election of an [[antipope]] ([[Antipope Clement III]]) in 1080.

The monarch's struggle with the papacy resulted in a war that ravaged through the Holy Roman Empire from 1077 until the [[Concordat of Worms]] in 1122. The reign of the last ruler of the Salian dynasty [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry V]] coincided with the final phase of the great [[Investiture Controversy]], which had pitted pope against emperor. By the settlement of the Concordat of Worms, Henry V surrendered to the demands of the second generation of [[Gregorian reform]]ers. This agreement stipulated that the pope would appoint high church officials but gave the German king the right to veto the papal choices. Imperial control of Italy was lost for a time, and the imperial crown became dependent on the political support of competing aristocratic factions. Feudalism also became more widespread as freemen sought protection by swearing allegiance to a lord. These powerful local rulers, having thereby acquired extensive territories and large military retinues, took over administration within their territories and organized it around an increasing number of castles. The most powerful of these local rulers came to be called princes rather than dukes.

According to the laws of the feudal system of the Holy Roman Empire, the king had no claims on the vassals of the other princes, only on those living within his family's territory. Lacking the support of the formerly independent vassals and weakened by the increasing hostility of the Church, the monarchy lost its pre-eminence. Thus the Investiture Contest strengthened local power in the Holy Roman Empire – in contrast to the trend in France and England, where centralized royal power grew. The Investiture Contest had an additional effect. The long struggle between emperor and pope hurt the Holy Roman Empire's intellectual life, in this period largely confined to monasteries, and the empire no longer led or even kept pace with developments occurring in [[France]] and [[Italy]]. For instance, no universities were founded in the Holy Roman Empire until the fourteenth century.

The first [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] king [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] was a grandson of the Salian [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. ([[Agnes of Waiblingen|Agnes]], Henry IV's daughter and Henry V's sister, was the heiress of Salian dynasty's lands: her first marriage produced the royal and imperial [[Hohenstaufen]] dynasty and her second marriage the ducal [[Babenberg]] potentates of [[Duchy of Austria]] which was elevated much due to such connections [[Privilegium Minus]].){{huh|date=April 2017}}

In [[television program|television]] and [[radio program]]ming, a '''serial''' has a continuing plot that unfolds in a sequential episode-by-episode fashion. Serials typically follow main [[story arc]]s that span entire [[television season]]s or even the full run of the series, which distinguishes them from traditional episodic television that relies on more stand-alone episodes. Worldwide, the [[soap opera]] is the most prominent form of serial [[dramatic programming]].

Serials rely on keeping the full nature of the story hidden and revealing elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more. Often these shows employ [[recapping]] segments at the beginning and [[cliffhanger]]s at the end of each episode. Such shows also place a demand on viewers to tune in to every episode to follow the plot.<ref name=\"nyt070724\">{{cite news | author = Alessandra Stanley | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/arts/television/24stan.html?fta=y | title = Smile and Smile and Still Be a Villain  | date = July 24, 2007 |work=The New York Times | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> The invention of recording devices such as [[VCR]]s and [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]] has made following this type of show easier, which has resulted in increased success and popularity. Prior to the advent of DVRs, television networks shunned serials in prime time as they made [[broadcast programming]] [[rerun]]s more difficult and television producers shunned them because they were tougher to go into [[broadcast syndication]] years down the road.

Serials contrast with episodic television, with plots relying on a more independent stand-alone format. [[Procedural drama]] television programs are commonly episodic.<ref name=\"NYTimesEpisodic\">{{cite news|last=Hale|first=Mike|title=The, Yes, Upside of Broadcast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/arts/television/the-new-season-the-upside-of-broadcast-tv.html|accessdate=January 7, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|last=Poniewozik|first=James|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2008/12/04/i-have-seen-dollhouse/|title=Tuned In|date=December 4, 2008|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=December 6, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"ct090227\"/>

Shorter serial programs known as [[telenovela]]s (and earlier, [[radionovela]]s), originating and often produced in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking [[Latin America]], have become popular worldwide.

==Terminology==
The term \"serial\" refers to the intrinsic property of a series{{spaced ndash}}namely its [[sequence|order]]. In literature, the term is used as a noun to refer to a format (within a [[genre]]) by which a story is told in contiguous (typically [[chronological]]) installments in sequential issues of a single [[periodical]] publication.

More generally, \"serial\" is applied in [[library and information science]] to materials \"in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.\"<ref name=\"Reitz\">Reitz, Joan M. (2004). [http://lu.com/odlis/odlis_s.cfm ''Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science'']. Retrieved March 15, 2006</ref>

The term has been used for a radio or television production with a continuously evolving, unified plot and set of characters, spread over multiple episodes.  In the United States, daytime soap operas have long had a serial structure. Television [[mini-series]] also commonly come in a serial form. Starting in the mid-1970s, series with soap opera-like stories began to be aired in prime time (e.g. ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''). In the 1990s, shows like ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' began to use a more serial structure, and now there are a much wider range of shows in serial form.<ref>Jason Mittell. 2015.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2009}}

The serial beginning with the advent of
[[Film|movie serials]] of the early 20th century. With the emergence of television and subsequent decline of the movie-going audience, production of movie serials ceased due to the decreasing revenues. But the serial lived on, moving instead to the small screen and the world of [[Broadcast syndication]] television [[rerun]]s.

===Soap operas===
The television serial format as known today originated in radio, in the form of children's adventure shows and daily 15-minute programs known as ''soap operas'' (so-called because many of these shows were [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by soap companies, such as [[Colgate-Palmolive]] and [[Procter & Gamble]]). Soap operas were specifically engineered to appeal to women (with the intention of increasing sale of soap). They usually ran from Monday through Friday at exactly the same time every day. A show called The Smith Family which ran only one night a week on WENR in Chicago during the early 1930s was credited as the \"great-granddaddy of the soap operas\" by radio historian Francis Chase, Jr. One of the other shows that helped pioneer the daytime soap opera/serial was ''The [[Guiding Light]]'', which debuted on [[NBC]] radio in 1937, and then switched to [[CBS]] Television in 1952. ''The Guiding Light''{{'s}} final episode aired on September 18, 2009, having a total of 15,762 episodes air on CBS. Some of the characters in soap operas have been portrayed as long-suffering (a common theme even in some of today's serials along with the social and economical issues of the day). Children's adventure serials were more like [[film serial]]s, with continuing characters involved in exploits with episodes that often ended in a cliffhanger situation; [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] were a particularly popular format for children's serials on the radio.

''Guiding Light'' and such other daytime television program serials such as ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', ''[[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]]'', ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and ''[[All My Children]]'' were popular in the Golden and Silver Ages of television and still are today.

Aside from the social issues, the style and presentation of these shows have changed. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s the drama was underscored with traditional organ music, and in the 1970s and the 1980s a full orchestra provided the score, the daytime dramas of today use cutting-edged synth-driven music (in a way, music for soaps has come full-circle, from the keyboard to the keyboard).

The nighttime serials are a different story, though the concept is also nothing new. In the 1960s, ABC aired the first real breakthrough nighttime serial, ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', inspired by the novel and theatrical film of the same name. After its cancellation, the format went somewhat dormant until Norman Lear produced ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]'' in 1976. In 1977, ABC created another comedy soap (aptly called ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]''). Although the show was controversial for its time (with a homosexual character among its cast roster), it was (and still is today) a cult classic.

The success of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' popularized serial storylines on prime-time television. Its end-of-season [[cliffhanger]]s, such as \"[[Who shot J. R.?]]\" and \"Bobby in the Shower?\",<ref name=\"marshall201810\">{{Cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Max |date=2018-09-19 |title=‘Dallas’ at 40: The Inside Story Behind the Show That Changed Texas Forever |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/dallas-at-40-the-inside-story-behind-the-show-that-changed-texas-forever/ |magazine=Texas Monthly |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> influenced other shows like ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (ABC's answer to ''Dallas''), ''[[Knots Landing]]'', ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[The Colbys]]'', ''[[Flamingo Road (TV series)|Flamingo Road]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[The Yellow Rose]]'', ''[[Bare Essence]]'', and ''[[Berrenger's]]''. There were some serial shows such as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' that did not officially fit into this category, but were nonetheless ratings hits season after season.

While the last of the 1980s nighttime soaps ended during the first years of the following decade, then a second wave came with series like ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Models, Inc.]]'', ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'' and ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]''. But as the 1990s came to a close, the primetime soap as an official format gradually faded away, where it largely seems to remain as of the middle of the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.

===Other dramas===
Serialized storytelling can also be seen in other dramas. Heavily serialized dramas include  '' [[Star Trek Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Babylon 5]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'', and ''[[Downton Abbey]]''. Series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Streets]]'', ''[[The Good Wife]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]'' fall somewhere in-between, featuring a new case each week that is solved by the end of the episode, but also having an overarching mystery that receives focus in many episodes. The more serialized its storytelling, the less likely a show is to fare well in repeats. The format places a demand on episodes to be run in order, without which story arcs stretching over many episodes may be difficult for new viewers to delve into. ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' also falls into the category while each season involves a new mystery that spans an entire season (and on one occasion, half the season) while planting hints throughout the episodes until the climax in the finale.

To a lesser extent, series such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''<ref name=\"hybrid\">{{cite news | author = Rob Owen | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09032/943438-67.stm | title = Fox's 'House' celebrates its 100th episode | date = February 1, 2009 | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | accessdate = February 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"procedural at its core\">{{cite news | author = Michael Ausiello | url = http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | title = Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Grey's,' 'House,' 'Big Love,' 'Fringe,' 'NCIS,' '24,' 'Gossip Girl,' 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Heroes,' 'Smallville,' and more! | date = February 11, 2009 | work = Entertainment Weekly | accessdate = February 12, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110628171858/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | archivedate = June 28, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''<ref name=\"fringe\">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/oct/10/jjabrams-ustelevision | title = JJ Abrams live webchat here | date = October 10, 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate = February 2, 2009  | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}</ref> may also feature ongoing story arcs, but episodes are more self-encapsulated and so the series fall into a more conventional drama category. ''Fringe'' has experimented with \"myth-alones\", a hybrid that attempts to advance the story arc in a self-contained episode.<ref name=\"comiccon\"/>

In addition, it has been noted that the use of [[cliffhanger]]s is still prevalent in adventure shows; however, they are now typically used just before a commercial break and the viewer need only wait a few minutes to see its resolution. In addition, many series have also made extensive use of the traditional end-of-episode cliffhanger format. This is most common in [[season finale]]s which often end in a cliffhanger that would only be resolved in the next season's premiere.

Over the course of its run, a show may change its focus. Matt Cherniss, executive vice president of programming at Fox says: \"Sometimes early on, being a little more episodic allows more people into the room. And as the show goes on, by its nature, it might find itself becoming a little more serialized.\"<ref name=\"ct090227\">{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/has-tv-lost-its-nerve-when-it-comes-to-complex-dramas.html | title = Has TV lost its nerve when it comes to complex dramas? | date = February 27, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> Early in their runs, shows such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',<ref name=\"ct090227\"/> ''Buffy'', ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''<ref name=\"indep090515\">{{cite news | author = Sarah Hughes | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html | title = Buffy's creator makes his valley of the dolls  | date = May 15, 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate = May 16, 2009 }}</ref> and ''[[Torchwood]]'' put greater emphasis on the \"story-of-the-week\", but over time story arcs begin to dominate. In contrast, ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' became more focused on standalone stories in later seasons, because of pressures by network executives.<ref name=\"fringe\"/>

== Effect of serialization on commercial success ==
Complex [[story arc]]s may have a negative effect on ratings by making entry more difficult for new viewers as well as confusing fans who have missed an episode.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Networks see them as riskier than dramas that focus on a self-contained story of the week.<ref name=\"risky\">{{cite news | author = James Hibberd | url = http://www.thrfeed.com/2009/03/qa-ron-moore-on-battlestar-series-finale.html# | title = Q&A: Ron Moore on 'Battlestar' series finale | date = March 13, 2009 | work = THRfeed | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> Tom O'Neil of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' notes: \"They're chancy because these shows are hard to join midway through.\"<ref name=\"gd080921\">{{cite news | author = Tom O'Neil | url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2008/09/glenn-close-dam.html | title = TRANSCRIPT: The Envelope chat with Glenn Close | date = September 21, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate = February 12, 2009}}</ref> {{asof|2012}} CBS has not aired a serial drama in many years, in part because of the success of its non-serial [[procedural (genre)|procedural]]s.<ref name=\"carter20120514\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/business/media/as-talent-flees-to-cable-networks-fight-back.html?pagewanted=all | title=As Talent Flees to Cable, Networks Fight Back | work=The New York Times | date=2012-05-14 | accessdate=May 14, 2012 | author=Carter, Bill | pages=B1}}</ref>

Scott Collins of the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated that \"serialized storytelling ... though popular with hard-core fans and many critics, requires more dedication from viewers and has almost certainly tamped down ratings for many shows\". He quoted an ad executive who states that close-ended story lines \"[make] it easier for new viewers to tune in and figure out what's going on\".<ref name=\"cbssucess\">{{cite news | author = Scott Collins | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-channel17-2008nov17,0,734832.story? | title = How does CBS spell success?

You have to wait until you can get the whole thing on DVD and catch up with it. If that blood is on our hands, I feel kind of badly about it.

Another problem is that many fans prefer to record these shows and [[binge-watching|binge watch]] the whole season in one session.<ref name=\"gd080921\"/> These viewers are not included in TV ratings as they are much less likely to watch commercials than live viewers. The move away from live viewing and toward DVR or internet-streaming services has hurt many shows' prospects because there are fewer or no commercials and they may be fast-forwarded or out-of-date.<ref name=\"decline\">{{cite news | author = Flint, Joe | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-0512-drama-20110512,0,7051380.story | title = A dramatic decline for network dramas | date = May 12, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref>

Concerned about the toll on ratings of complex story arcs, networks sometimes ask showrunners to reduce serialization. Network executives believe that standalone episodes serve as a better jumping on point for new viewers, although this may result in a conflict with regular watchers who tend to prefer more focus on story arcs.<ref name=\"comiccon\">{{cite news | author = Prudom, Laura | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/07/24/comic-con-v-fringe-and-vampire-diaries-round-up/ | title = Comic-Con: 'V,' 'Fringe' and 'Vampire Diaries' Round-Up | date = July 24, 2010 | work = [[TV Squad]] | accessdate = July 26, 2010}}</ref>
''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' began as a more serialized show but later became more stand-alone under network pressure.<ref name=\"fringe\"/> During season 3 of the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', showrunner [[Ronald D. Moore]] was also pressured to make episodes more stand-alone. This move resulted in negative criticism from both fans and critics, and Moore revealed in the Season 3 finale podcast that the network finally accepted that standalone episodes simply do not work for the story he is trying to tell.<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast.php?seas=3 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122212713/http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast.php?seas=3 |date=January 22, 2009 }}</ref>
Moore has also stated that the network was reluctant to greenlight ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' mainly because story-arc-heavy series notoriously have difficulty in picking up new viewers, as compared to a series composed of mostly standalone episodes.<ref>''Battlestar Galactica Season 3 Companion''</ref>

According to [[Todd A. Kessler]], the second season of ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' will be less serialized in order to render the show more accessible to new viewers.<ref name=\"variety080616\">{{cite news | author = Michael Schneider | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987533.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&nid=2562 | title = William Hurt joins FX's 'Damages' | date = June 16, 2008 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref>
[[Tim Kring]], creator of ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', has also suggested that his show may move away from serialized storytelling: \"I think the show needs to move towards [standalone episodes] in order to survive.\"<ref name=\"ign081117\">{{cite news | author = Eric Goldman | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/931/931067p1.html | title = Could Heroes Move Away From Serialization? | date = November 17, 2008 | work = [[IGN]] | accessdate = March 2, 2009}}</ref>

Networks also discourage complex story arcs because they are less successful in reruns, and because standalone episodes can be rerun without concern for order.<ref name=\"thrfeedwhedon\">{{cite news |first=James |last=Hibberd | url = http://www.thrfeed.com/blogs/live-feed/joss-whedon-talks-dollhouse-renewal-51641 | title = Joss Whedon talks 'Dollhouse' renewal | date = May 18, 2009 | work = Hollywood Reporter THR feed | accessdate = March 1, 2014}}</ref>

and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''<ref name=\"ct090227\"/> have expressed concern that declining ratings may lead to a major reduction in serialized storytelling. To highlight the situation, in the 2006–2007 season, no fewer than five high-concept serials were introduced, including ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'', ''[[Kidnapped (TV series)|Kidnapped]]'', ''[[Vanished]]'', ''[[The Nine (TV series)|The Nine]]'', and ''[[Drive (2007 TV series)|Drive]]'', all of which experienced fairly quick cancellation due to low ratings.<ref name=\"starnews070524\">{{cite news | url = http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20070524/COLUMNIST11/705240442/-1/ae03 | title = Soggy Serials | date = May 24, 2007 | work = [[Star News Online]] | accessdate = December 16, 2009}}</ref>
In 2010 and 2011, more high-profile, high-cost serials failed to achieve success, including ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'', ''[[The Event]]'', and ''[[FlashForward]]''.

Some reviewers have also noted that serialized dramas are at a disadvantage at major awards shows such as the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s. Such shows generally have to submit an atypical self-contained episode in order to gain recognition.<ref name=\"la080819\">{{cite news | author = Tom O'Neil | url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2008/08/article-7148635.html | title = Early, gutsy Emmy predix: 'Mad Men' vs. 'Damages' | date = August 19, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate = February 20, 2009}}</ref>
Despite this, since 2000, every winner of the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series]] has been a Serial Drama: ''[[The West Wing]]'' (2000–2003), ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (2004, 2007), ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' (2005), ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' (2006), ''[[Mad Men]]'' (2008–2011), ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' (2012), ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' (2013–2014), ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' (2015-2016), and ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (2017).

In terms of DVD sales, however, strongly serialized shows often perform better than shows which are strongly procedural.

In [[television program|television]] and [[radio program]]ming, a '''serial''' has a continuing plot that unfolds in a sequential episode-by-episode fashion. Serials typically follow main [[story arc]]s that span entire [[television season]]s or even the full run of the series, which distinguishes them from traditional episodic television that relies on more stand-alone episodes. Worldwide, the [[soap opera]] is the most prominent form of serial [[dramatic programming]].

Serials rely on keeping the full nature of the story hidden and revealing elements episode by episode to keep viewers tuning in to learn more. Often these shows employ [[recapping]] segments at the beginning and [[cliffhanger]]s at the end of each episode. Such shows also place a demand on viewers to tune in to every episode to follow the plot.<ref name=\"nyt070724\">{{cite news | author = Alessandra Stanley | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/24/arts/television/24stan.html?fta=y | title = Smile and Smile and Still Be a Villain  | date = July 24, 2007 |work=The New York Times | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> The invention of recording devices such as [[VCR]]s and [[Digital video recorder|DVRs]] has made following this type of show easier, which has resulted in increased success and popularity. Prior to the advent of DVRs, television networks shunned serials in prime time as they made [[broadcast programming]] [[rerun]]s more difficult and television producers shunned them because they were tougher to go into [[broadcast syndication]] years down the road.

Serials contrast with episodic television, with plots relying on a more independent stand-alone format. [[Procedural drama]] television programs are commonly episodic.<ref name=\"NYTimesEpisodic\">{{cite news|last=Hale|first=Mike|title=The, Yes, Upside of Broadcast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/arts/television/the-new-season-the-upside-of-broadcast-tv.html|accessdate=January 7, 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 6, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|last=Poniewozik|first=James|url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2008/12/04/i-have-seen-dollhouse/|title=Tuned In|date=December 4, 2008|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=December 6, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"ct090227\"/>

Shorter serial programs known as [[telenovela]]s (and earlier, [[radionovela]]s), originating and often produced in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking [[Latin America]], have become popular worldwide.

==Terminology==
The term \"serial\" refers to the intrinsic property of a series{{spaced ndash}}namely its [[sequence|order]]. In literature, the term is used as a noun to refer to a format (within a [[genre]]) by which a story is told in contiguous (typically [[chronological]]) installments in sequential issues of a single [[periodical]] publication.

More generally, \"serial\" is applied in [[library and information science]] to materials \"in any medium issued under the same title in a succession of discrete parts, usually numbered (or dated) and appearing at regular or irregular intervals with no predetermined conclusion.\"<ref name=\"Reitz\">Reitz, Joan M. (2004). [http://lu.com/odlis/odlis_s.cfm ''Online Dictionary for Library and Information Science'']. Retrieved March 15, 2006</ref>

The term has been used for a radio or television production with a continuously evolving, unified plot and set of characters, spread over multiple episodes.  In the United States, daytime soap operas have long had a serial structure. Television [[mini-series]] also commonly come in a serial form. Starting in the mid-1970s, series with soap opera-like stories began to be aired in prime time (e.g. ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''). In the 1990s, shows like ''[[The X-Files]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' began to use a more serial structure, and now there are a much wider range of shows in serial form.<ref>Jason Mittell. 2015.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2009}}

The serial beginning with the advent of
[[Film|movie serials]] of the early 20th century. With the emergence of television and subsequent decline of the movie-going audience, production of movie serials ceased due to the decreasing revenues. But the serial lived on, moving instead to the small screen and the world of [[Broadcast syndication]] television [[rerun]]s.

===Soap operas===
The television serial format as known today originated in radio, in the form of children's adventure shows and daily 15-minute programs known as ''soap operas'' (so-called because many of these shows were [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsored]] by soap companies, such as [[Colgate-Palmolive]] and [[Procter & Gamble]]). Soap operas were specifically engineered to appeal to women (with the intention of increasing sale of soap). They usually ran from Monday through Friday at exactly the same time every day. A show called The Smith Family which ran only one night a week on WENR in Chicago during the early 1930s was credited as the \"great-granddaddy of the soap operas\" by radio historian Francis Chase, Jr. One of the other shows that helped pioneer the daytime soap opera/serial was ''The [[Guiding Light]]'', which debuted on [[NBC]] radio in 1937, and then switched to [[CBS]] Television in 1952. ''The Guiding Light''{{'s}} final episode aired on September 18, 2009, having a total of 15,762 episodes air on CBS. Some of the characters in soap operas have been portrayed as long-suffering (a common theme even in some of today's serials along with the social and economical issues of the day). Children's adventure serials were more like [[film serial]]s, with continuing characters involved in exploits with episodes that often ended in a cliffhanger situation; [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] were a particularly popular format for children's serials on the radio.

''Guiding Light'' and such other daytime television program serials such as ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'', ''[[The Doctors (soap opera)|The Doctors]]'', ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', ''[[One Life to Live]]'', and ''[[All My Children]]'' were popular in the Golden and Silver Ages of television and still are today.

Aside from the social issues, the style and presentation of these shows have changed. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s the drama was underscored with traditional organ music, and in the 1970s and the 1980s a full orchestra provided the score, the daytime dramas of today use cutting-edged synth-driven music (in a way, music for soaps has come full-circle, from the keyboard to the keyboard).

The nighttime serials are a different story, though the concept is also nothing new. In the 1960s, ABC aired the first real breakthrough nighttime serial, ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', inspired by the novel and theatrical film of the same name. After its cancellation, the format went somewhat dormant until Norman Lear produced ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]'' in 1976. In 1977, ABC created another comedy soap (aptly called ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]''). Although the show was controversial for its time (with a homosexual character among its cast roster), it was (and still is today) a cult classic.

The success of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' popularized serial storylines on prime-time television. Its end-of-season [[cliffhanger]]s, such as \"[[Who shot J. R.?]]\" and \"Bobby in the Shower?\",<ref name=\"marshall201810\">{{Cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Max |date=2018-09-19 |title=‘Dallas’ at 40: The Inside Story Behind the Show That Changed Texas Forever |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/dallas-at-40-the-inside-story-behind-the-show-that-changed-texas-forever/ |magazine=Texas Monthly |language=en-US |access-date=2018-09-21}}</ref> influenced other shows like ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' (ABC's answer to ''Dallas''), ''[[Knots Landing]]'', ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[The Colbys]]'', ''[[Flamingo Road (TV series)|Flamingo Road]]'', ''[[Hotel (U.S. TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[The Yellow Rose]]'', ''[[Bare Essence]]'', and ''[[Berrenger's]]''. There were some serial shows such as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' that did not officially fit into this category, but were nonetheless ratings hits season after season.

While the last of the 1980s nighttime soaps ended during the first years of the following decade, then a second wave came with series like ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', ''[[Melrose Place]]'', ''[[Models, Inc.]]'', ''[[Savannah (TV series)|Savannah]]'' and ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]''. But as the 1990s came to a close, the primetime soap as an official format gradually faded away, where it largely seems to remain as of the middle of the first decade of the 21st century in the United States.

===Other dramas===
Serialized storytelling can also be seen in other dramas. Heavily serialized dramas include  '' [[Star Trek Deep Space Nine]]'', ''[[Babylon 5]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'', ''[[The Wire]]'', and ''[[Downton Abbey]]''. Series such as ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Streets]]'', ''[[The Good Wife]]'', and ''[[The X-Files]]'' fall somewhere in-between, featuring a new case each week that is solved by the end of the episode, but also having an overarching mystery that receives focus in many episodes. The more serialized its storytelling, the less likely a show is to fare well in repeats. The format places a demand on episodes to be run in order, without which story arcs stretching over many episodes may be difficult for new viewers to delve into. ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' also falls into the category while each season involves a new mystery that spans an entire season (and on one occasion, half the season) while planting hints throughout the episodes until the climax in the finale.

To a lesser extent, series such as ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''<ref name=\"hybrid\">{{cite news | author = Rob Owen | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09032/943438-67.stm | title = Fox's 'House' celebrates its 100th episode | date = February 1, 2009 | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | accessdate = February 12, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"procedural at its core\">{{cite news | author = Michael Ausiello | url = http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | title = Ask Ausiello: Spoilers on 'Grey's,' 'House,' 'Big Love,' 'Fringe,' 'NCIS,' '24,' 'Gossip Girl,' 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Heroes,' 'Smallville,' and more! | date = February 11, 2009 | work = Entertainment Weekly | accessdate = February 12, 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110628171858/http://ausiellofiles.ew.com/2009/02/ask-ausiello--1.html | archivedate = June 28, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]''<ref name=\"fringe\">{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2008/oct/10/jjabrams-ustelevision | title = JJ Abrams live webchat here | date = October 10, 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London | accessdate = February 2, 2009  | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}</ref> may also feature ongoing story arcs, but episodes are more self-encapsulated and so the series fall into a more conventional drama category. ''Fringe'' has experimented with \"myth-alones\", a hybrid that attempts to advance the story arc in a self-contained episode.<ref name=\"comiccon\"/>

In addition, it has been noted that the use of [[cliffhanger]]s is still prevalent in adventure shows; however, they are now typically used just before a commercial break and the viewer need only wait a few minutes to see its resolution. In addition, many series have also made extensive use of the traditional end-of-episode cliffhanger format. This is most common in [[season finale]]s which often end in a cliffhanger that would only be resolved in the next season's premiere.

Over the course of its run, a show may change its focus. Matt Cherniss, executive vice president of programming at Fox says: \"Sometimes early on, being a little more episodic allows more people into the room. And as the show goes on, by its nature, it might find itself becoming a little more serialized.\"<ref name=\"ct090227\">{{cite news | author = Maureen Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/has-tv-lost-its-nerve-when-it-comes-to-complex-dramas.html | title = Has TV lost its nerve when it comes to complex dramas? | date = February 27, 2009 |work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref> Early in their runs, shows such as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'',<ref name=\"ct090227\"/> ''Buffy'', ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]''<ref name=\"indep090515\">{{cite news | author = Sarah Hughes | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/buffys-creator-makes-his-valley-of-the-dolls-1684993.html | title = Buffy's creator makes his valley of the dolls  | date = May 15, 2009 |work=The Independent |location=London | accessdate = May 16, 2009 }}</ref> and ''[[Torchwood]]'' put greater emphasis on the \"story-of-the-week\", but over time story arcs begin to dominate. In contrast, ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' became more focused on standalone stories in later seasons, because of pressures by network executives.<ref name=\"fringe\"/>

== Effect of serialization on commercial success ==
Complex [[story arc]]s may have a negative effect on ratings by making entry more difficult for new viewers as well as confusing fans who have missed an episode.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> Networks see them as riskier than dramas that focus on a self-contained story of the week.<ref name=\"risky\">{{cite news | author = James Hibberd | url = http://www.thrfeed.com/2009/03/qa-ron-moore-on-battlestar-series-finale.html# | title = Q&A: Ron Moore on 'Battlestar' series finale | date = March 13, 2009 | work = THRfeed | accessdate = March 13, 2009}}</ref> Tom O'Neil of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' notes: \"They're chancy because these shows are hard to join midway through.\"<ref name=\"gd080921\">{{cite news | author = Tom O'Neil | url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2008/09/glenn-close-dam.html | title = TRANSCRIPT: The Envelope chat with Glenn Close | date = September 21, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate = February 12, 2009}}</ref> {{asof|2012}} CBS has not aired a serial drama in many years, in part because of the success of its non-serial [[procedural (genre)|procedural]]s.<ref name=\"carter20120514\">{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/14/business/media/as-talent-flees-to-cable-networks-fight-back.html?pagewanted=all | title=As Talent Flees to Cable, Networks Fight Back | work=The New York Times | date=2012-05-14 | accessdate=May 14, 2012 | author=Carter, Bill | pages=B1}}</ref>

Scott Collins of the ''Los Angeles Times'' stated that \"serialized storytelling ... though popular with hard-core fans and many critics, requires more dedication from viewers and has almost certainly tamped down ratings for many shows\". He quoted an ad executive who states that close-ended story lines \"[make] it easier for new viewers to tune in and figure out what's going on\".<ref name=\"cbssucess\">{{cite news | author = Scott Collins | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/tv/la-et-channel17-2008nov17,0,734832.story? | title = How does CBS spell success?

Another problem is that many fans prefer to record these shows and [[binge-watching|binge watch]] the whole season in one session.<ref name=\"gd080921\"/> These viewers are not included in TV ratings as they are much less likely to watch commercials than live viewers. The move away from live viewing and toward DVR or internet-streaming services has hurt many shows' prospects because there are fewer or no commercials and they may be fast-forwarded or out-of-date.<ref name=\"decline\">{{cite news | author = Flint, Joe | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-0512-drama-20110512,0,7051380.story | title = A dramatic decline for network dramas | date = May 12, 2011 |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate = May 12, 2011}}</ref>

Concerned about the toll on ratings of complex story arcs, networks sometimes ask showrunners to reduce serialization. Network executives believe that standalone episodes serve as a better jumping on point for new viewers, although this may result in a conflict with regular watchers who tend to prefer more focus on story arcs.<ref name=\"comiccon\">{{cite news | author = Prudom, Laura | url = http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/07/24/comic-con-v-fringe-and-vampire-diaries-round-up/ | title = Comic-Con: 'V,' 'Fringe' and 'Vampire Diaries' Round-Up | date = July 24, 2010 | work = [[TV Squad]] | accessdate = July 26, 2010}}</ref>
''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' began as a more serialized show but later became more stand-alone under network pressure.<ref name=\"fringe\"/> During season 3 of the re-imagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', showrunner [[Ronald D. Moore]] was also pressured to make episodes more stand-alone. This move resulted in negative criticism from both fans and critics, and Moore revealed in the Season 3 finale podcast that the network finally accepted that standalone episodes simply do not work for the story he is trying to tell.<ref>[http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast.php?seas=3 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122212713/http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/downloads/podcast.php?seas=3 |date=January 22, 2009 }}</ref>
Moore has also stated that the network was reluctant to greenlight ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'' mainly because story-arc-heavy series notoriously have difficulty in picking up new viewers, as compared to a series composed of mostly standalone episodes.<ref>''Battlestar Galactica Season 3 Companion''</ref>

According to [[Todd A. Kessler]], the second season of ''[[Damages (TV series)|Damages]]'' will be less serialized in order to render the show more accessible to new viewers.<ref name=\"variety080616\">{{cite news | author = Michael Schneider | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987533.html?categoryid=14&cs=1&nid=2562 | title = William Hurt joins FX's 'Damages' | date = June 16, 2008 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = February 27, 2009}}</ref>
[[Tim Kring]], creator of ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', has also suggested that his show may move away from serialized storytelling: \"I think the show needs to move towards [standalone episodes] in order to survive.\"<ref name=\"ign081117\">{{cite news | author = Eric Goldman | url = http://tv.ign.com/articles/931/931067p1.html | title = Could Heroes Move Away From Serialization? | date = November 17, 2008 | work = [[IGN]] | accessdate = March 2, 2009}}</ref>

Networks also discourage complex story arcs because they are less successful in reruns, and because standalone episodes can be rerun without concern for order.<ref name=\"thrfeedwhedon\">{{cite news |first=James |last=Hibberd | url = http://www.thrfeed.com/blogs/live-feed/joss-whedon-talks-dollhouse-renewal-51641 | title = Joss Whedon talks 'Dollhouse' renewal | date = May 18, 2009 | work = Hollywood Reporter THR feed | accessdate = March 1, 2014}}</ref>

and ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''<ref name=\"ct090227\"/> have expressed concern that declining ratings may lead to a major reduction in serialized storytelling. To highlight the situation, in the 2006–2007 season, no fewer than five high-concept serials were introduced, including ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'', ''[[Kidnapped (TV series)|Kidnapped]]'', ''[[Vanished]]'', ''[[The Nine (TV series)|The Nine]]'', and ''[[Drive (2007 TV series)|Drive]]'', all of which experienced fairly quick cancellation due to low ratings.<ref name=\"starnews070524\">{{cite news | url = http://www.starnewsonline.com/article/20070524/COLUMNIST11/705240442/-1/ae03 | title = Soggy Serials | date = May 24, 2007 | work = [[Star News Online]] | accessdate = December 16, 2009}}</ref>
In 2010 and 2011, more high-profile, high-cost serials failed to achieve success, including ''[[V (2009 TV series)|V]]'', ''[[The Event]]'', and ''[[FlashForward]]''.

Some reviewers have also noted that serialized dramas are at a disadvantage at major awards shows such as the [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s. Such shows generally have to submit an atypical self-contained episode in order to gain recognition.<ref name=\"la080819\">{{cite news | author = Tom O'Neil | url = http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2008/08/article-7148635.html | title = Early, gutsy Emmy predix: 'Mad Men' vs. 'Damages' | date = August 19, 2008 |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate = February 20, 2009}}</ref>
Despite this, since 2000, every winner of the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series]] has been a [[Serial (radio and television)#Popular serial dramas|Serial Drama]]: ''[[The West Wing]]'' (2000–2003), ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (2004, 2007), ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' (2005), ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' (2006), ''[[Mad Men]]'' (2008–2011), ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'' (2012), ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' (2013–2014), ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' (2015-2016), and ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' (2017).

In terms of DVD sales, however, strongly serialized shows often perform better than shows which are strongly procedural.

==Career==
When he was in [[Glendale High School (Glendale, California)|Glendale High School]] in LA, he was persuaded to make a debut as an entertainer by the late Hollywood actor [[Soon-Tek Oh|Soon-tek Oh]], who was a member to the same church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tenasia.hankyung.com/topic/article/2020012937744|title=故 오순택 누구?...양준일과 미국서 깊은 인연 {{!}} 텐아시아|last=tenasia.hankyung.com|first=Digital|date=2020-01-29|website=텐아시아 연예뉴스|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Yang was a soloist in his high school choir. He took classes at [https://www.jrpowersphilly.com/ John Robert Powers Modeling, Acting Agency & Finishing School] in [[Philadelphia]] to prepare for his debut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mk.co.kr/star/broadcasting-service/view/2020/02/191812/|title=‘배철수 잼’ 양준일, 발라드 가수 데뷔 비하인드...‘리베카’ 어쿠스틱 버전 공개[종합]|website=스타투데이|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> 

He entered [[University of Southern California]] [[USC Marshall School of Business|Marshall School of Business]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/201912311633093457|title=[코리아타임스 뉴스] 시간여행자 양준일, 30년이 지나서야 인정받다|date=2020-01-01|website=한국일보|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> During his studies, he was selected by Lee Beom-hee, who was the famous composer of the day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.issueinfact.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=13883|title=양준일 리베카 신드롬 열풍 “역주행 아이콘 양준일 누구?”|date=2019-12-26|website=이슈인팩트|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Yang dropped out to debut as a singer in Korea in 1990.

Yang debuted in 1991 at the age of 22 with a song titled \"Rebecca\". \"Rebecca\" and \"Help me Cupid!\" were performed on the air, but not a big hit. His 2nd full length album was released in 1992. He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />

He was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S. 

Active in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.

In 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". V2 meant his \"Version 2\". He was in active under the name of JIY instead of his real name, Yang Joon-il. He lied about his age and made a big change in his look.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news1.kr/articles/?3860343|title='배철수 잼' 양준일, 험난했던 인생사→신드롬에 대한 솔직 고백까지(종합)|date=2020-03-02|website=뉴스1|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    

In 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\". Still slim in figure and soulful in his performance, he dazzled the audience and show hosts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2020/03/682_280113.html|title=Yang Joon-il, a musician living ahead of his time, finally recognized 30 year later|date=2019-12-10|website=koreatimes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> When asked his next plans amid this viral syndrome, he simply said: \"I don't make any plans; I just focus on fully living every moment. If there's any plans, I hope to live as a humble husband and dad.\" When the show hosts asked him to give a message to 20-year-old himself living 30 years ago, Yang said: \"I know nothing will happen how you want. But don't worry, everything will come out perfectly in the end.\"<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /> After his fame skyrocketed again after his appearance on the show, he quit his job at the restaurant to focus on his entertainment career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/12/g-dragon-of-the-90s-yang-joon-il-visits-jtbcs-news-room-after-his-surging-popularity-says-he-was-working-at-a-restaurant-in-florida|title='G-Dragon of the 90s' Yang Joon Il visits JTBC's 'News Room' after his surging popularity, says he was working at a restaurant in Florida|website=allkpop|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> 

On December 25, Christmas Day, he appeared on [[JTBC Newsroom]]. He said \"It's like a dream every day\", \"I've been trying to get rid of my prejudice against myself, which is full of my mind as if I had to abandon my unhappiness before I was happy.\"  \"There are no more tears\" Yang said, adding that his powerful fandom, which claims to be a support group, is also a big boost to Yang.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.habkorea.net/celebrity-of-celebrity-yang-joon-il-syndrome-in-korea/|title=Celebrity of celebrity, Yang Joon-il Syndrome in Korea {{!}} HaB Korea.net|date=2019-12-26|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>

==Career==
When he was in [[Glendale High School (Glendale, California)|Glendale High School]] in LA, he was persuaded to make a debut as an entertainer by the late Hollywood actor [[Soon-Tek Oh|Soon-tek Oh]], who was a member to the same church.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tenasia.hankyung.com/topic/article/2020012937744|title=故 오순택 누구?...양준일과 미국서 깊은 인연 {{!}} 텐아시아|last=tenasia.hankyung.com|first=Digital|date=2020-01-29|website=텐아시아 연예뉴스|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref> Yang was a soloist in his high school choir.

Yang debuted in 1991 at the age of 22 with a song titled \"Rebecca\". \"Rebecca\" and \"Help me Cupid!\" were performed on the air, but not a big hit. His 2nd full length album was released in 1992. He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /><ref name=\"koreajoongangdaily\" /><ref name=\"yonhap\" />

He was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S. 

Active in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.

In 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". V2 meant his \"Version 2\". He was in active under the name of JIY instead of his real name, Yang Joon-il. He lied about his age and made a big change in his look.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news1.kr/articles/?3860343|title='배철수 잼' 양준일, 험난했던 인생사→신드롬에 대한 솔직 고백까지(종합)|date=2020-03-02|website=뉴스1|language=ko|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years.  In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    

In 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\". Still slim in figure and soulful in his performance, he dazzled the audience and show hosts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2020/03/682_280113.html|title=Yang Joon-il, a musician living ahead of his time, finally recognized 30 year later|date=2019-12-10|website=koreatimes|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> When asked his next plans amid this viral syndrome, he simply said: \"I don't make any plans; I just focus on fully living every moment. If there's any plans, I hope to live as a humble husband and dad.\" When the show hosts asked him to give a message to 20-year-old himself living 30 years ago, Yang said: \"I know nothing will happen how you want. But don't worry, everything will come out perfectly in the end.\"<ref name=\"koreatimes\" /> After his fame skyrocketed again after his appearance on the show, he quit his job at the restaurant to focus on his entertainment career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allkpop.com/article/2019/12/g-dragon-of-the-90s-yang-joon-il-visits-jtbcs-news-room-after-his-surging-popularity-says-he-was-working-at-a-restaurant-in-florida|title='G-Dragon of the 90s' Yang Joon Il visits JTBC's 'News Room' after his surging popularity, says he was working at a restaurant in Florida|website=allkpop|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> 

On December 25, Christmas Day, he appeared on [[JTBC Newsroom]]. He said \"It's like a dream every day\", \"I've been trying to get rid of my prejudice against myself, which is full of my mind as if I had to abandon my unhappiness before I was happy.\"  \"There are no more tears\" Yang said, adding that his powerful fandom, which claims to be a support group, is also a big boost to Yang.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.habkorea.net/celebrity-of-celebrity-yang-joon-il-syndrome-in-korea/|title=Celebrity of celebrity, Yang Joon-il Syndrome in Korea {{!}} HaB Korea.net|date=2019-12-26|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>

==History==
Wells County was formed in 1837. It was named for Capt. [[William Wells (soldier)|William A. Wells]], who was captured by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as a young boy and adopted by the [[Miami tribe|Miami]] chief [[Michikinikwa|Little Turtle]]. He eventually became a scout for Gen. [[Anthony Wayne|\"Mad Anthony\" Wayne]]. Capt. Wells was killed by [[Potawatomi]] allied with the British at the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] at the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]]. The Potawatomi ate Capt. Wells' heart to gain part of his courage.

There was also an accident that occurred at the [[clock tower]] of the county courthouse.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} While either fixing or building the roof, a man fell to the grounds of Main Street. He landed on his legs, and he lived for about a week before dying. The force of the fall thrust his [[human pelvis|pelvis]] into his [[rib cage]]. Had he fallen any other way, he would have died on the spot.

{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

==History==
Wells County was formed in 1837. It was named for Capt. [[William Wells (soldier)|William A. Wells]], who was captured by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] as a young boy and adopted by the [[Miami tribe|Miami]] chief [[Michikinikwa|Little Turtle]]. He eventually became a scout for Gen. [[Anthony Wayne|\"Mad Anthony\" Wayne]]. Capt. Wells was killed by [[Potawatomi]] allied with the British at the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]] at the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]]. The Potawatomi ate Capt. Wells' heart to gain part of his courage.

There was also an accident that occurred at the [[clock tower]] of the county courthouse.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} While either fixing or building the roof, a man fell to the grounds of Main Street. He landed on his legs, and he lived for about a week before dying. The force of the fall thrust his [[human pelvis|pelvis]] into his [[rib cage]]. Had he fallen any other way, he would have died on the spot.

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county maintains a [[small claims court]] that can handle some civil cases. The judge on the court is elected to a term of four years and must be a member of the Indiana Bar Association. The judge is assisted by a constable who is also elected to a four-year term. In some cases, court decisions can be appealed to the state level [[circuit court]].<ref name = inc2102/>

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]], and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>
