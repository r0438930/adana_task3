Alcott quickly completed a second volume (titled '''''Good Wives''''' in the United Kingdom, although this name originated from the publisher and not from Alcott), and it was also successful. The two volumes were issued in 1880 as a single novel titled ''Little Women.''\n\nAlcott wrote two sequels to her popular work, both of which also featured the March sisters: ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) and ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886). The novel addresses three major themes: \"domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine's individual identity.\"<ref name=Elbert>{{cite book |author=Elbert, Sarah |title=A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott's Place in American Culture |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick |year=1987 |isbn=0-8135-1199-2}}</ref>{{rp|200}} According to [[Sarah Elbert]], Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from Romantic children's fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new format.

Having lost all his money, their father is acting as a [[pastor]] in the [[American Civil War]], far from home. The women face their first Christmas without him.\n\nMeg and Jo March, the elder two, have to work in order to support the family: Meg teaches a nearby family of four children;  Jo assists her aged [[great-aunt]] March, a wealthy widow living in a [[mansion]], Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is a tomboy who writes; Beth is a peacemaker and a pianist; Amy is an artist who longs for elegance and fine society.\n\nJo is impulsive and quick to anger. One of her challenges is trying to control her anger, a challenge that her mother experiences. She advises Jo to speak with forethought before leaving to travel to [[Washington, DC|Washington]], where her husband has [[pneumonia]].\n\nTheir neighbor, Mr. Laurence, who is charmed by Beth, gives her a piano. Beth contracts [[scarlet fever]] after spending time with a poor family where three children die. Jo tends Beth in her illness. Beth recovers, but never fully. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March, replacing Jo, while Beth is ill and still infectious.\n\nJo has success in earning money with her writing. Meg spends two weeks with friends, where there are parties for the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, Mr. Laurence's grandson, is invited to one of the dances, as Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor. Brooke goes to Washington to help Mr. March. While with the March parents, Brooke confesses his love for Meg. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to be married. Brooke agrees to wait.  He [[enlist]]s and serves a year or so in the war. After he is wounded, he returns to find work so he can buy a house ready for when he marries Meg. Laurie goes off to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns from the war.\n\n===Part Two===\n(Published separately in the United Kingdom as ''Good Wives'')\n\nThree years later, Meg and John marry and learn how to live together. When they have twins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel left out. Laurie graduates from college, having put in the effort to do well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy goes on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak and her spirits are down. When trying to uncover the reason for Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it's with Beth but soon senses it's with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie but she loves him like a brother and that she could not love him in a romantic way.\n\nJo decides she wants a bit of adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will forget his feelings. She spends six months with a friend of her mother in New York City, serving as [[governess]] for her two children. The family runs a boarding house. She takes German lessons with Professor Bhaer, who lives in the house. He has come to America from Berlin to care for the orphaned sons of his sister. For extra money, Jo writes stories without a moral, which disappoints Bhaer. He persuades her to give up poorly written sensational stories as her time in New York comes to an end. When she returns, Laurie proposes marriage and she declines.\n\nLaurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's health has seriously deteriorated. Jo devotes her time to the care of her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe, and he slowly falls in love with her as he begins to see her in a new light. She is unimpressed by the aimless, idle and forlorn attitude he has adopted since being rejected by Jo, and inspires him to find his purpose and do something worthwhile with his life. With the news of Beth's death, they meet for consolation and their romance grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return with just Laurie and his grandfather, so they marry before returning home from Europe.\n\nProfessor Bhaer goes to the Marches' and stays for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo. Jo accepts. When Aunt March dies, she leaves Plumfield to Jo. Jo and Bhaer turn the house into a school for boys. They have two sons of their own, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and her five grandchildren.\n\n==Characters==\n===Margaret \"Meg\" March===\nMeg, the eldest sister, is 16 when the story starts.

Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls.

But eventually she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew \"heavy.\" Beth's final sickness has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone.

Somewhat temperamental and prone to being judgmental, she disapproves of the family's poverty, their charitable work, and their general disregard for the more superficial aspects of society's ways. Her vociferous disapproval of Meg's impending engagement to the impoverished Mr. Brooke becomes the proverbial \"last straw\" that actually causes Meg to accept his proposal.

According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a \"scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood\", which led more women to look toward \"literature for self-authorization.

Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote that ''Little Women'' was the beginning of \"a decline in the radical power of women's fiction\", partly because women's fiction was being idealized with a \"hearth and home\" children's story.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|197}} Women's literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed that ''Little Women'' was the beginning of this \"downward spiral\". But Elbert says that ''Little Women'' did not \"belittle women's fiction\" and that Alcott stayed true to her \"Romantic birthright\".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\n''Little Women'''s popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown \"within the familiar construct of domesticity\".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|220}} While Alcott had been commissioned to \"write a story for girls\", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a \"new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys' adventure stories\".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3\u20134}}\n\nOne reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States.

After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her \"who the little women marry\".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}} The unresolved ending added to the popularity of ''Little Women''. Sicherman said that the unsatisfying ending worked to \"keep the story alive\" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}} \"Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writing ''Little Women''.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd, Anne E.|title=Writing for Immortality: Women Writers and the Emergence of High Literary Culture in America|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|year=2004|page=72|isbn=0-8018-7875-6}}</ref> Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie's hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband.

Alcott quickly completed a second volume (titled '''''Good Wives''''' in the United Kingdom, although this name originated from the publisher and not from Alcott), and it was also successful. The two volumes were issued in 1880 as a single novel titled ''Little Women.''\n\nAlcott wrote two sequels to her popular work, both of which also featured the March sisters: ''[[Little Men]]'' (1871) and ''[[Jo's Boys]]'' (1886). The novel addresses three major themes: \"domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine's individual identity.\"<ref name=Elbert>{{cite book |author=Elbert, Sarah |title=A Hunger for Home: Louisa May Alcott's Place in American Culture |publisher=Rutgers University Press |location=New Brunswick |year=1987 |isbn=0-8135-1199-2}}</ref>{{rp|200}} According to [[Sarah Elbert]], Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from Romantic children's fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new format.

Having lost all his money, their father is acting as a [[pastor]] in the [[American Civil War]], far from home. The women face their first Christmas without him.\n\nMeg and Jo March, the elder two, have to work in order to support the family: Meg teaches a nearby family of four children;  Jo assists her aged [[great-aunt]] March, a wealthy widow living in a [[mansion]], Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is a tomboy who writes; Beth is a peacemaker and a pianist; Amy is an artist who longs for elegance and fine society.\n\nJo is impulsive and quick to anger. One of her challenges is trying to control her anger, a challenge that her mother experiences. She advises Jo to speak with forethought before leaving to travel to [[Washington, DC|Washington]], where her husband has [[pneumonia]].\n\nTheir neighbor, Mr. Laurence, who is charmed by Beth, gives her a piano. Beth contracts [[scarlet fever]] after spending time with a poor family where three children die. Jo tends Beth in her illness. Beth recovers, but never fully. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March, replacing Jo, while Beth is ill and still infectious.\n\nJo has success in earning money with her writing. Meg spends two weeks with friends, where there are parties for the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, Mr. Laurence's grandson, is invited to one of the dances, as Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor. Brooke goes to Washington to help Mr. March. While with the March parents, Brooke confesses his love for Meg. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to be married. Brooke agrees to wait.  He [[enlist]]s and serves a year or so in the war. After he is wounded, he returns to find work so he can buy a house ready for when he marries Meg. Laurie goes off to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns from the war.\n\n===Part Two===\n(Published separately in the United Kingdom as ''Good Wives'')\n\nThree years later, Meg and John marry and learn how to live together. When they have twins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel left out. Laurie graduates from college, having put in the effort to do well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy goes on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak and her spirits are down. When trying to uncover the reason for Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it's with Beth but soon senses it's with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie but she loves him like a brother and that she could not love him in a romantic way.\n\nJo decides she wants a bit of adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will forget his feelings. She spends six months with a friend of her mother in New York City, serving as [[governess]] for her two children. The family runs a boarding house. She takes German lessons with Professor Bhaer, who lives in the house. He has come to America from Berlin to care for the orphaned sons of his sister. For extra money, Jo writes stories without a moral, which disappoints Bhaer. He persuades her to give up poorly written sensational stories as her time in New York comes to an end. When she returns, Laurie proposes marriage and she declines.\n\nLaurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's health has seriously deteriorated. Jo devotes her time to the care of her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe, and he slowly falls in love with her as he begins to see her in a new light. She is unimpressed by the aimless, idle and forlorn attitude he has adopted since being rejected by Jo, and inspires him to find his purpose and do something worthwhile with his life. With the news of Beth's death, they meet for consolation and their romance grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return with just Laurie and his grandfather, so they marry before returning home from Europe.\n\nProfessor Bhaer goes to the Marches' and stays for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo. Jo accepts. When Aunt March dies, she leaves Plumfield to Jo. Jo and Bhaer turn the house into a school for boys. They have two sons of their own, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter.

Ultimately, Amy is shown to work very hard to gain what she wants in life, and to make the most of her success while she has it.\n\nDue to her early selfishness (when her friends knew she would not share any pickled lime) and attachment to material things, Amy has been described as the least likable of the four sisters, but she is also the only one who strives to excel at art purely for self-expression, in contrast to Jo, who sometimes writes for financial gain.<ref name=\"Hollander\">{{cite book |last=Hollander |first=Anne |title=Feeding the Eye |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hp2T9MX15IkC&pg=PA233#v=onepage&q=Little%20women%20minor%20characters |year=2000 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0520226593 |page=233}}</ref>\n\n===Additional characters===\n[[File:The March Sisters.png|thumb|''The March Sisters'' by [[Pablo Marcos]]]]\n*Margaret \"Marmee\" March \u2013 The girls' mother and head of household while her husband is away.

Both  Laurie's mother and father died young, so as a boy Laurie was taken in by his grandfather. Preparing to enter Harvard, Laurie is being tutored by John Brooke. He is described as attractive and charming, with black eyes, brown skin, and curly black hair. He later falls in love with Amy and they marry; they have one child, a little girl named after Beth: Elizabeth \"Bess\" Laurence. Sometimes Jo calls Laurie \"Teddy\".

Somewhat temperamental and prone to being judgmental, she disapproves of the family's poverty, their charitable work, and their general disregard for the more superficial aspects of society's ways.

Chesterton]] notes that in ''Little Women'', Alcott \"anticipated [[Literary realism|realism]] by twenty or thirty years\", and that Fritz's proposal to Jo, and her acceptance, \"is one of the really human things in human literature.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Chesterton, G. K.|authorlink=G. K. Chesterton|chapter=Louisa Alcott|title=A Handful of Authors|year=1953}}</ref> Gregory S. Jackson said that Alcott's use of realism belongs to the American Protestant pedagogical tradition, which includes a range of religious literary traditions with which Alcott was familiar. He has copies in his book of nineteenth-century images of devotional children's guides which provide background for the game of \"pilgrims progress\" that Alcott uses in her plot of Book One.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jackson, Gregory S.|title=The Word and Its Witness: The Spiritualization of American Realism|location=Chicago|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=2009|pages=125\u201356|isbn=978-0-226-39004-8}}</ref>\n\n''Little Women'' was well received upon first publication. According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a \"scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood\", which led more women to look toward \"literature for self-authorization. This is especially true during adolescence.\"<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|2}} ''Little Women'' became \"the paradigmatic text for young women of the era and one in which family literary culture is prominently featured.\"<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3}} Adult elements of women's fiction in ''Little Women'' included \"a change of heart necessary\" for the female protagonist to evolve in the story.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|199}}\n\nIn the late 20th century some scholars criticized the novel. Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote that ''Little Women'' was the beginning of \"a decline in the radical power of women's fiction\", partly because women's fiction was being idealized with a \"hearth and home\" children's story.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|197}} Women's literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed that ''Little Women'' was the beginning of this \"downward spiral\". But Elbert says that ''Little Women'' did not \"belittle women's fiction\" and that Alcott stayed true to her \"Romantic birthright\".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|198\u2013199}}\n\n''Little Women'''s popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown \"within the familiar construct of domesticity\".<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|220}} While Alcott had been commissioned to \"write a story for girls\", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a \"new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys' adventure stories\".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3\u20134}}\n\nOne reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States. Through the March sisters, women could relate and dream where they may not have before.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|3\u20134}} \"Both the passion ''Little Women'' has engendered in diverse readers and its ability to survive its era and transcend its genre point to a text of unusual permeability.\"<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|35}}\n\nAt the time, young girls perceived that marriage was their end goal. After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her \"who the little women marry\".<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}} The unresolved ending added to the popularity of ''Little Women''. Sicherman said that the unsatisfying ending worked to \"keep the story alive\" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings.<ref name=Sicherman/>{{rp|21}} \"Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writing ''Little Women''.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Boyd, Anne E.|title=Writing for Immortality: Women Writers and the Emergence of High Literary Culture in America|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|year=2004|page=72|isbn=0-8018-7875-6}}</ref> Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie's hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband.

These sisters, and in particular Jo, were apprehensive about adulthood because they were afraid that, by conforming to what society wanted, they would lose their special individuality.<ref name=Elbert/>{{rp|199}}\n\nAlcott's Jo also made professional writing imaginable for generations of women. Writers as diverse as [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], [[Margaret Atwood]], and [[J.K. Rowling]] have noted the influence of Jo March on their artistic development.
