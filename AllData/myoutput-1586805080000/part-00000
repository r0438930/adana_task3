located in the northeastern corner of the country in the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]] region. It is [[Salient (geography)|surrounded]] by [[Paraguay]] to the northwest, [[Brazil]] to the north, east and south, and [[Corrientes Province]] of Argentina to the southwest.\n\nThis was an early area of [[Roman Catholic]] [[missionary]] activity by the [[Society of Jesus]] in what was then called the Province of Paraguay, beginning in the early 17th century. In 1984 the ruins of four mission sites in Argentina were designated [[World Heritage Sites]] by UNESCO.<ref>{{cite web|url={{wdl|2835}} |author=Garriga, Antonio |date=1713 |title=Instruccion practica para ordenar santamente la vid\u00e0; que ofrece el P.

At the time of European encounter, it was occupied by the [[Kaingang]] and [[Xokleng people|Xokleng]], later followed by the [[Guarani people|Guarani]]. The first European to visit the region, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], discovered Apip\u00e9 Falls while navigating the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] in December 1527. In 1541 [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]] reached the [[Iguazu Falls|Iguaz\u00fa Falls]].\n\nIn the 17th century, members of the [[Society of Jesus]] came to the region as missionaries. They began to establish a string of [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit ''Reductions'']], most notably that of [[San Ignacio Min\u00ed|San Ignacio]]. In a few years they set up 30 mission villages. They taught the Guarani western-style agriculture and crafts. Their crafts were sold and traded along the river and they shared in the Reductions' prosperity.\n\nIn 1759 the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] government, at the insistence of its anti-Jesuit [[Secretary of State]], the [[Marquis de Pombal]], ordered all Reductions closed in [[colonial Brazil|its territory]] (which then included much of present-day Misiones Province). The Marquis eventually prevailed in 1773 on Pope [[Clement XIV]] to have the Jesuit Order [[Suppression of the Jesuits|suppressed]].  With the abandoning of the missions, the prosperous trade surrounding these Reductions quickly vanished. Colonists imposed a brutal [[plantation]] economy in the region, forcing the Guarani to act as slave labor.\n\n[[Image:Puerto de Posadas 1892.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Steamer on the riverbank at Posadas, 1892.]]\n\nIn 1814, [[Gervasio Posadas]], the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Director]] of the [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata]], declared Misiones annexed to Argentina's [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] (at this time Argentina was quasi-independent but nominally still a Spanish colony). Argentina did not exert ''de facto'' control over Misiones, which was claimed by several countries and effectively governed itself. In 1830 Argentine military forces from [[Corrientes Province]] took control of Misiones.\n\nIn 1838 [[Paraguay]] occupied Misiones, claiming the area on the basis that the Misiones population consisted of indigenous Guarani, the major ethnic group of Paraguay. In 1865 Paraguayan forces invaded Misiones again in what became the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] (1864\u20131870). Following the defeat of Paraguay and its peace agreement with Argentina (eventually signed in 1876), Paraguay gave up its claim to the Misiones territory.\n\nAlthough Argentina had claimed Misiones since 1814, academics tend to interpret Argentine possession of Misiones as beginning with the defeat of Paraguay in the War of the Triple Alliance. Bethell writes that \"the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|treaty of alliance]] [i.e. against Paraguay] contained secret clauses providing for the annexation of disputed territory in northern Paraguay by Brazil and regions in the east and west of Paraguay by Argentina... After a long and harrowing war (1865\u201370), Argentina got it from a prostrate Paraguay territory in Misiones.\"<ref>Bethell ''Argentina since Independence'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, pp. 45\u20136</ref> Scobie states that \"the political status of Misiones remained vague\" and that Argentina gained the region \"as a by-product of the Paraguayan war in the 1860s\".<ref>Scobie ''Argentina'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1964, pages 22\u20133</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ukranian immigrants cropping yerba mate in Tres Capones, Misiones.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] immigrants harvest [[yerba mate]] in 1920. Despite challenging conditions, Misiones attracted considerable European immigration in the early 20th-century.]]\n\nThe [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] left Paraguay much impoverished, and Misiones benefited economically from belonging to Argentina. In 1876 the Argentine President [[Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda]], assisted by his close friend, General Pietro Canestro (an Italian nobleman who devoted much of his life and wealth to the achievement and sustainability of the peace in the region), proclaimed the [[Immigration in Argentina|Immigration and Colonization Law]]. This law fostered the immigration of European colonists in order to populate the vast unspoiled Argentinian territories.\n\nSeveral colonizing companies formed under this law. One of them, Adolf Schwelm's ''Eldorado Colonizaci\u00f3n y Explotaci\u00f3n de Bosques Ltda. S.A.'', founded the city of [[Eldorado, Misiones|Eldorado]] in 1919 with a port on the Upper Paran\u00e1. Its agricultural colonies and experimental farms, the orange- and grapefruit-tree plantations, and the cultivation of yerba mate, the mills and the dryers for such product are characteristic of this area. [[Swedish-Argentines]] became well known for growing [[yerba mate]].\n\nMisiones received many immigrants, mostly from Europe, coming mainly via Southern Brazil. Some came from Buenos Aires, and from Eastern Europe, in particular large numbers of [[Polish minority in Argentina|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians of Argentina|Ukrainian]]s. Since then{{when|date=February 2016}}, Misiones has continued to benefit economically and has developed politically within Argentina. It has been successfully integrated into the Argentine state.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} {{As of | 2016}} control of the province is not contested. On December 10, 1953 the \"National Territory of Misiones\" gained [[provinces of Argentina|provincial]] status in accordance with Law 14.294, and its constitution was approved on April 21, 1958.\n\nMisiones received more attention from national policy-makers following an international agreement (1973) to construct the [[Yacyret\u00e1]] hydroelectric dam on a point in the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] shared by Paraguay and Corrientes Province. When the dam became fully operative in the 1990s, the Paran\u00e1's waters all along the Misiones shores rose. They flooded lands that the dam's authorities had failed to clear and condition adequately, resulting in the onset of mosquito-transmitted illnesses, such as [[leishmaniasis]], [[yellow fever]], [[dengue]], and [[malaria]]. The entire Misiones shores along the Paran\u00e1 River is now confined by two dams, one of them Yaciret\u00e1, downstream of the river, and the other [[Itaipu dam|Itaip\u00fa]], located in Brazil and Paraguay, upstream of the river and north of [[Puerto Iguaz\u00fa]]. {{As of | 2016}} Argentina is pursuing an agreement with Paraguay to expand the reservoir works in order to double the facility's [[Electricity sector in Argentina|electricity production]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Misiones - Ruta Nacional 12.jpg|thumb|right|240px|View along Route 12, near [[Puerto Iguazu]].]]\nMisiones is the second smallest province after [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]].\n[[File:Misiones - Parque provincial Salto Encantado desde ruta 7 (2).jpg|thumb|240px|[[Alto Paran\u00e1 Atlantic forests]]]]\nThe Misiones plateau includes a part of Brazil across the border. The rocks contain significant quantities of iron which forms a part of the soil, giving it a reddish color. At the center of the plateau rises the Sierra de Misiones, its highest peak, 843 m, near Bernardo de Irigoyen, in the Cerro Rinc\u00f3n.\n\nThe province is embraced by three big rivers including the [[Paran\u00e1 River|Paran\u00e1]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and [[Iguaz\u00fa River|Iguaz\u00fa]]. [[Iguazu Falls]] are spectacular [[waterfall]]s on the Iguaz\u00fa River in the northwest corner of the province, near the city of [[Puerto Iguaz\u00fa]]. Misiones shares the falls with the Brazilian state of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] (in that nation's Southern Region). Meanwhile, the international border with [[Paraguay]] is close by.\n\n== Climate ==\n{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}\n\nThe province has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characterized by a lack of a dry season and abundant rainfall throughout the year.<ref name=turismoclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330035342/http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archivedate=30 March 2017 |title=Geograf\u00eda |publisher=Ministerio de Turismo |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], it is classified as ''Cfa''.<ref name=IRNclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925103809/http://www.mineria.gov.ar/estudios/irn/misiones/m-1.asp |archivedate=25 September 2011 |title=Provincia de Misiones\u2013Clima y Meteorologia |publisher=Secretaria de Mineria de la Nacion (Argentina) |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> There are four distinct seasons although winters and autumns are fairly short.<ref name=IRNclima/> The mean annual temperature is around {{convert|21|C|F|0}}.<ref name=turismoclima/> June\u2013August typically register the coldest days when temperatures can fall below {{convert|10|C|F|0}}.<ref name=turismoclima/> However, rare incursions of polar air into the province from the south can lead to frost.<ref name=IRNclima/> Summers are hot with temperatures exceeding {{convert|32|C|F|0}} from December to February.<ref name=turismoclima/> One of the main characteristic is the presence of hills in the central and northern parts of the province leading to lower temperatures as a result of the higher elevation.<ref name=IRNclima/> Average annual rainfall ranges from a low of {{convert|1870|mm|in|0}} in the south to {{convert|2360|mm|in|0}} in the north.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} The rainfall pattern in the province has a [[bimodal]] distribution with two peaks occurring in Spring and Autumn with winters being the driest.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} The exceptions are the north and higher altitude areas where precipitation is well distributed throughout the year.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} Snowfall has occurred at the higher hills.<ref name=IRNclima/> For example, during the winter of 1975, snowfall was observed and accumulated in Bernando de Irigoyen, one of the coldest towns in the province due to its high altitude {{convert|815|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IRNclima/> Owing to the humid climate and high rainfall, relative humidity is high.<ref name=IRNclima/>\n\nThe vegetation is the so-called \"{{Interlanguage link multi|Selva Misionera|es|3=Selva misionera}}\". Part of it has been transformed by mankind to implant cultures and ranching. The original biome is protected in [[Iguaz\u00fa National Park]], part of the [[Alto Paran\u00e1 Atlantic forests]], in turn part of the [[Atlantic Forest]] [[biome]].\n\n== Population ==\nThere are 1,101,593 people living in Misiones according to the national census of 2010. A part of the population is descendant of indigenous peoples (especially [[Guaranis]]) and also Spanish who reached during the colonization and mixed with natives. Another part of the residents are descendants of European [[Immigration to Argentina|immigrants]]. Unlike many regions of Argentina, where the immigrants came through [[Buenos Aires]], most of the immigrants who settled in Misiones came through [[Southern Brazil]]. The ethnic groups who settled in Misiones after Spaniards are [[Italian people|Italians]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]], [[Russian people|Russians]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Danish people|Danes]] and a small number of [[Arabs]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and, recently, [[Laotians]] (in the late 1970s) and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (in the 2000s). From the 1960s, the province has also received immigrants from [[Brazil]] (mostly descendants of [[East Europeans]]) and [[Paraguay]] (mostly descendants both of indigenous peoples and Spaniards).\n\nThe literacy rate is 91.4%.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[Image:Aeropuerto Internacional de Puerto Iguaz\u00fa PLANTA BAJA.JPG|thumb|240px|right|Terminal at [[Cataratas del Iguaz\u00fa International Airport|Puerto Iguazu International Airport]].]]\n[[Image:Yerba-mate-misiones.JPG|thumb|left|Yerba mate plantation.]]\n\nMisiones' [[economics|economy]], like most in northern Argentina, is relatively underdeveloped yet fairly well-diversified. Its 2006 output was estimated at US$4.8 billion (which shall be around US$7.2 billion in 2011, according to Argentina's economical growing) or US$4,940 per capita (around US$6,500 in 2011), over 40% below the national average.<ref>[http://www.iader.org.ar/ I.A.D.E.R<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThough its rainy, erosion-prone geography discourages [[intensive crop farming]], [[agriculture]] makes an important contribution to the province's economy, adding about 10% to the total. Misiones' thick forests have long provided for the ample production of roundwood without excessive impact on its [[ecosystem]]. The principal exploited trees are the [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paran\u00e1 pine]], Guatamb\u00fa, Cedar, Petirib\u00ed, Incense, Cane water-pipe, Anchico, Eucalyptus and Gueyc\u00e1.\n\nMisiones' chief source of agricultural income, however, has long been the cultivation of [[yerba mate]]: Misiones is Argentina's leading producer (yielding about half a million tons, annually).  [[Tea]], citrus fruit and, in minor amounts, [[tobacco]], sugar cane, rice, coffee, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coconut]] are also cultivated in Misiones.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nLight [[manufacturing]] and [[tourism]] also contribute to the local economy, each adding about 13% to the total.\n\n== Government ==\n[[Image:Casa-de-gobierno-misiones.jpg|thumb|Governor's offices, Posadas]]\nThe provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.\n{{main|\tChamber of Representatives of Misiones |Governor of Misiones Province }}\nThe Constitution of Misiones Province forms the formal law of the province.\n[[File:Bandera de ceremonias de la Unidad Regional IX (Jard\u00edn Am\u00e9rica) - Polic\u00eda de Misiones.jpg|thumb|Misiones Provincial Police]]\nIn Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the [[Argentine Federal Police]] but the additional work is carried out by the [[Misiones Provincial Police]].\n\n== Political division ==\n[[Image:Depmisiones.jpg|thumb|Misiones Province, Political Division]]\n\nThe province is divided in 17 [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] (Spanish: ''departamentos''):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

located in the northeastern corner of the country in the [[Mesopotamia, Argentina|Mesopotamia]] region. It is [[Salient (geography)|surrounded]] by [[Paraguay]] to the northwest, [[Brazil]] to the north, east and south, and [[Corrientes Province]] of Argentina to the southwest.\n\nThis was an early area of [[Roman Catholic]] [[missionary]] activity by the [[Society of Jesus]] in what was then called the Province of Paraguay, beginning in the early 17th century. In 1984 the ruins of four mission sites in Argentina were designated [[World Heritage Sites]] by UNESCO.<ref>{{cite web|url={{wdl|2835}} |author=Garriga, Antonio |date=1713 |title=Instruccion practica para ordenar santamente la vid\u00e0; que ofrece el P.

At the time of European encounter, it was occupied by the [[Kaingang]] and [[Xokleng people|Xokleng]], later followed by the [[Guarani people|Guarani]]. The first European to visit the region, [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]], discovered Apip\u00e9 Falls while navigating the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] in December 1527. In 1541 [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]] reached the [[Iguazu Falls|Iguaz\u00fa Falls]].\n\nIn the 17th century, members of the [[Society of Jesus]] came to the region as missionaries. They began to establish a string of [[Jesuit Reductions|Jesuit ''Reductions'']], most notably that of [[San Ignacio Min\u00ed|San Ignacio]]. In a few years they set up 30 mission villages. They taught the Guarani western-style agriculture and crafts. Their crafts were sold and traded along the river and they shared in the Reductions' prosperity.\n\nIn 1759 the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] government, at the insistence of its anti-Jesuit [[Secretary of State]], the [[Marquis de Pombal]], ordered all Reductions closed in [[colonial Brazil|its territory]] (which then included much of present-day Misiones Province). The Marquis eventually prevailed in 1773 on Pope [[Clement XIV]] to have the Jesuit Order [[Suppression of the Jesuits|suppressed]].  With the abandoning of the missions, the prosperous trade surrounding these Reductions quickly vanished. Colonists imposed a brutal [[plantation]] economy in the region, forcing the Guarani to act as slave labor.\n\n[[Image:Puerto de Posadas 1892.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Steamer on the riverbank at Posadas, 1892.]]\n\nIn 1814, [[Gervasio Posadas]], the [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Director]] of the [[United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata]], declared Misiones annexed to Argentina's [[Corrientes Province|Corrientes]] (at this time Argentina was quasi-independent but nominally still a Spanish colony). Argentina did not exert ''de facto'' control over Misiones, which was claimed by several countries and effectively governed itself. In 1830 Argentine military forces from [[Corrientes Province]] took control of Misiones.\n\nIn 1838 [[Paraguay]] occupied Misiones, claiming the area on the basis that the Misiones population consisted of indigenous Guarani, the major ethnic group of Paraguay. In 1865 Paraguayan forces invaded Misiones again in what became the [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] (1864\u20131870). Following the defeat of Paraguay and its peace agreement with Argentina (eventually signed in 1876), Paraguay gave up its claim to the Misiones territory.\n\nAlthough Argentina had claimed Misiones since 1814, academics tend to interpret Argentine possession of Misiones as beginning with the defeat of Paraguay in the War of the Triple Alliance. Bethell writes that \"the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|treaty of alliance]] [i.e. against Paraguay] contained secret clauses providing for the annexation of disputed territory in northern Paraguay by Brazil and regions in the east and west of Paraguay by Argentina... After a long and harrowing war (1865\u201370), Argentina got it from a prostrate Paraguay territory in Misiones.\"<ref>Bethell ''Argentina since Independence'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 1993, pp. 45\u20136</ref> Scobie states that \"the political status of Misiones remained vague\" and that Argentina gained the region \"as a by-product of the Paraguayan war in the 1860s\".<ref>Scobie ''Argentina'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1964, pages 22\u20133</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ukranian immigrants cropping yerba mate in Tres Capones, Misiones.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] immigrants harvest [[yerba mate]] in 1920. Despite challenging conditions, Misiones attracted considerable European immigration in the early 20th-century.]]\n\nThe [[Paraguayan War|War of the Triple Alliance]] left Paraguay much impoverished, and Misiones benefited economically from belonging to Argentina. In 1876 the Argentine President [[Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda]], assisted by his close friend, General Pietro Canestro (an Italian nobleman who devoted much of his life and wealth to the achievement and sustainability of the peace in the region), proclaimed the [[Immigration in Argentina|Immigration and Colonization Law]]. This law fostered the immigration of European colonists in order to populate the vast unspoiled Argentinian territories.\n\nSeveral colonizing companies formed under this law. One of them, Adolf Schwelm's ''Eldorado Colonizaci\u00f3n y Explotaci\u00f3n de Bosques Ltda. S.A.'', founded the city of [[Eldorado, Misiones|Eldorado]] in 1919 with a port on the Upper Paran\u00e1. Its agricultural colonies and experimental farms, the orange- and grapefruit-tree plantations, and the cultivation of yerba mate, the mills and the dryers for such product are characteristic of this area. [[Swedish-Argentines]] became well known for growing [[yerba mate]].\n\nMisiones received many immigrants, mostly from Europe, coming mainly via Southern Brazil. Some came from Buenos Aires, and from Eastern Europe, in particular large numbers of [[Polish minority in Argentina|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians of Argentina|Ukrainian]]s. Since then{{when|date=February 2016}}, Misiones has continued to benefit economically and has developed politically within Argentina. It has been successfully integrated into the Argentine state.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} {{As of | 2016}} control of the province is not contested. On December 10, 1953 the \"National Territory of Misiones\" gained [[provinces of Argentina|provincial]] status in accordance with Law 14.294, and its constitution was approved on April 21, 1958.\n\nMisiones received more attention from national policy-makers following an international agreement (1973) to construct the [[Yacyret\u00e1]] hydroelectric dam on a point in the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] shared by Paraguay and Corrientes Province. When the dam became fully operative in the 1990s, the Paran\u00e1's waters all along the Misiones shores rose. They flooded lands that the dam's authorities had failed to clear and condition adequately, resulting in the onset of mosquito-transmitted illnesses, such as [[leishmaniasis]], [[yellow fever]], [[dengue]], and [[malaria]]. The entire Misiones shores along the Paran\u00e1 River is now confined by two dams, one of them Yaciret\u00e1, downstream of the river, and the other [[Itaipu dam|Itaip\u00fa]], located in Brazil and Paraguay, upstream of the river and north of [[Puerto Iguaz\u00fa]]. {{As of | 2016}} Argentina is pursuing an agreement with Paraguay to expand the reservoir works in order to double the facility's [[Electricity sector in Argentina|electricity production]].\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Misiones - Ruta Nacional 12.jpg|thumb|right|240px|View along Route 12, near [[Puerto Iguazu]].]]\nMisiones is the second smallest province after [[Tucum\u00e1n Province|Tucum\u00e1n]].\n[[File:Misiones - Parque provincial Salto Encantado desde ruta 7 (2).jpg|thumb|240px|[[Alto Paran\u00e1 Atlantic forests]]]]\nThe Misiones plateau includes a part of Brazil across the border. The rocks contain significant quantities of iron which forms a part of the soil, giving it a reddish color. At the center of the plateau rises the Sierra de Misiones, its highest peak, 843 m, near Bernardo de Irigoyen, in the Cerro Rinc\u00f3n.\n\nThe province is embraced by three big rivers including the [[Paran\u00e1 River|Paran\u00e1]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and [[Iguaz\u00fa River|Iguaz\u00fa]]. [[Iguazu Falls]] are spectacular [[waterfall]]s on the Iguaz\u00fa River in the northwest corner of the province, near the city of [[Puerto Iguaz\u00fa]]. Misiones shares the falls with the Brazilian state of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Paran\u00e1]] (in that nation's Southern Region). Meanwhile, the international border with [[Paraguay]] is close by.\n\n== Climate ==\n{{see also|Climate of Argentina|Climatic regions of Argentina}}\n\nThe province has a [[humid subtropical climate]] characterized by a lack of a dry season and abundant rainfall throughout the year.<ref name=turismoclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170330035342/http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archivedate=30 March 2017 |title=Geograf\u00eda |publisher=Ministerio de Turismo |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], it is classified as ''Cfa''.<ref name=IRNclima>{{cite web|url=http://www.misiones.tur.ar/es/geografia/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925103809/http://www.mineria.gov.ar/estudios/irn/misiones/m-1.asp |archivedate=25 September 2011 |title=Provincia de Misiones\u2013Clima y Meteorologia |publisher=Secretaria de Mineria de la Nacion (Argentina) |language=Spanish |accessdate=29 March 2017}}</ref> There are four distinct seasons although winters and autumns are fairly short.<ref name=IRNclima/> The mean annual temperature is around {{convert|21|C|F|0}}.<ref name=turismoclima/> June\u2013August typically register the coldest days when temperatures can fall below {{convert|10|C|F|0}}.<ref name=turismoclima/> However, rare incursions of polar air into the province from the south can lead to frost.<ref name=IRNclima/> Summers are hot with temperatures exceeding {{convert|32|C|F|0}} from December to February.<ref name=turismoclima/> One of the main characteristic is the presence of hills in the central and northern parts of the province leading to lower temperatures as a result of the higher elevation.<ref name=IRNclima/> Average annual rainfall ranges from a low of {{convert|1870|mm|in|0}} in the south to {{convert|2360|mm|in|0}} in the north.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} The rainfall pattern in the province has a [[bimodal]] distribution with two peaks occurring in Spring and Autumn with winters being the driest.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} The exceptions are the north and higher altitude areas where precipitation is well distributed throughout the year.{{sfn|Rubio|2018|p=185}} Snowfall has occurred at the higher hills.<ref name=IRNclima/> For example, during the winter of 1975, snowfall was observed and accumulated in Bernando de Irigoyen, one of the coldest towns in the province due to its high altitude {{convert|815|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=IRNclima/> Owing to the humid climate and high rainfall, relative humidity is high.<ref name=IRNclima/>\n\nThe vegetation is the so-called \"{{Interlanguage link multi|Selva Misionera|es|3=Selva misionera}}\". Part of it has been transformed by mankind to implant cultures and ranching. The original biome is protected in [[Iguaz\u00fa National Park]], part of the [[Alto Paran\u00e1 Atlantic forests]], in turn part of the [[Atlantic Forest]] [[biome]].\n\n== Population ==\nThere are 1,101,593 people living in Misiones according to the national census of 2010. A part of the population is descendant of indigenous peoples (especially [[Guaranis]]) and also Spanish who reached during the colonization and mixed with natives. Another part of the residents are descendants of European [[Immigration to Argentina|immigrants]]. Unlike many regions of Argentina, where the immigrants came through [[Buenos Aires]], most of the immigrants who settled in Misiones came through [[Southern Brazil]]. The ethnic groups who settled in Misiones after Spaniards are [[Italian people|Italians]], [[German people|Germans]], [[Poles]], [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]], [[Swiss (people)|Swiss]], [[Russian people|Russians]], [[Swedish people|Swedes]], [[Danish people|Danes]] and a small number of [[Arabs]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and, recently, [[Laotians]] (in the late 1970s) and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (in the 2000s). From the 1960s, the province has also received immigrants from [[Brazil]] (mostly descendants of East Europeans) and [[Paraguay]] (mostly descendants both of indigenous peoples and Spaniards).\n\nThe literacy rate is 91.4%.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[Image:Aeropuerto Internacional de Puerto Iguaz\u00fa PLANTA BAJA.JPG|thumb|240px|right|Terminal at [[Cataratas del Iguaz\u00fa International Airport|Puerto Iguazu International Airport]].]]\n[[Image:Yerba-mate-misiones.JPG|thumb|left|Yerba mate plantation.]]\n\nMisiones' [[economics|economy]], like most in northern Argentina, is relatively underdeveloped yet fairly well-diversified. Its 2006 output was estimated at US$4.8 billion (which shall be around US$7.2 billion in 2011, according to Argentina's economical growing) or US$4,940 per capita (around US$6,500 in 2011), over 40% below the national average.<ref>[http://www.iader.org.ar/ I.A.D.E.R<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThough its rainy, erosion-prone geography discourages [[intensive crop farming]], [[agriculture]] makes an important contribution to the province's economy, adding about 10% to the total. Misiones' thick forests have long provided for the ample production of roundwood without excessive impact on its [[ecosystem]]. The principal exploited trees are the [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paran\u00e1 pine]], Guatamb\u00fa, Cedar, Petirib\u00ed, Incense, Cane water-pipe, Anchico, Eucalyptus and Gueyc\u00e1.\n\nMisiones' chief source of agricultural income, however, has long been the cultivation of [[yerba mate]]: Misiones is Argentina's leading producer (yielding about half a million tons, annually).  [[Tea]], citrus fruit and, in minor amounts, [[tobacco]], sugar cane, rice, coffee, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coconut]] are also cultivated in Misiones.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nLight [[manufacturing]] and [[tourism]] also contribute to the local economy, each adding about 13% to the total.\n\n== Government ==\n[[Image:Casa-de-gobierno-misiones.jpg|thumb|Governor's offices, Posadas]]\nThe provincial government is divided into the usual three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoint the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court.\n{{main|\tChamber of Representatives of Misiones |Governor of Misiones Province }}\nThe Constitution of Misiones Province forms the formal law of the province.\n[[File:Bandera de ceremonias de la Unidad Regional IX (Jard\u00edn Am\u00e9rica) - Polic\u00eda de Misiones.jpg|thumb|Misiones Provincial Police]]\nIn Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the [[Argentine Federal Police]] but the additional work is carried out by the [[Misiones Provincial Police]].\n\n== Political division ==\n[[Image:Depmisiones.jpg|thumb|Misiones Province, Political Division]]\n\nThe province is divided in 17 [[Departments of Argentina|departments]] (Spanish: ''departamentos''):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
