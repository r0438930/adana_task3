Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique.

Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Engine ====\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails.

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water\u2014the \"deep vee\" hull, designed by Ray Hunt, found in approximately 75% of modern power boats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[Diesel engine|diesel engines]].

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique.

Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat.

The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].
