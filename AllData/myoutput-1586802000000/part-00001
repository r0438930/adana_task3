In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion.

The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the [[Dongola Reach]] was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper [[Dongola Reach]]. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of [[Amun]] at the rebuilt [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta [[stele]] at [[Elephantine]], places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Mero\u00eb around 300 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2,75,112,114\u2013117,120}}</ref>\n\nThe Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves.

Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state.

At the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (mid-sixteenth century BC), Egypt faced the twin existential threats\u2014the [[Hyksos]] in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of [[Amenhotep I]] (1514\u20131493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as [[archery|archers]], \"Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to [[Upper Nubia]] to destroy the Nubian bowmen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings from Ancient Egypt|last=Wilkinson|first=Toby|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2016|isbn=978-0-141-39595-1|location=United Kingdom|pages=19}}</ref> The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush.\n\nEgypt's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of [[Canaan]], had fallen to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), and then the resurgent [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935\u2013605 BC). The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], from the 10th century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern [[Mesopotamia]], and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the [[Near East]], and much of [[Anatolia]], the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[History of Iran#Early Iron Age|early Iron Age Iran]].\n\nIn 945 BC, [[Shoshenq I]] and [[Libu]] princes took control of the Nile Delta and founded the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt]], also known as the Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200&nbsp;years. Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions. In 711, Shoshenq made [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] his northern capital.<ref>Van, de M. M.

One theory is that this represents the monarchs breaking away from the power of the priests at Napata. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], a Kushite king, \"[[Ergamenes]]\", defied the priests and had them slaughtered. This story may refer to the first ruler to be buried at Mero\u00eb with a similar name such as [[Arqamani]],<ref>Fage, J.

In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html|title=Meroitic script|website=www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Prince Arikankharer Slaying His Enemies, Meroitic, beginning of first century AD, sandstone - Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7535.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Meroitic prince smiting his enemies (early first century AD)]][[Strabo]] describes a war with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century BC.

Indeed, it seems that [[Gaius Petronius|Petronius's]] attack might have had a revitalizing influence on the kingdom. Just three years later, in 22 BC, a large Kushite force moved northward with intention of attacking Qasr Ibrim.{{r|jackson2002}}{{rp|149}}\n[[File:Lion temple relief, Naga (Sudan).jpg|thumb|260px|Copy of relief from [[Naqa]] depicting [[Amanitore]] (second from left), [[Natakamani]] (second from right) and two princes approaching a three-headed [[Apedemak]].]]\nAlerted to the advance, Petronius again marched south and managed to reach Qasr Ibrim and bolster its defences before the invading Kushites arrived. Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius.

It became extinct about 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the [[Meroitic alphabet]]: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a [[stylus]] and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of [[bilingual]] texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180\u2013170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen [[Shanakdakhete]]. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.<ref name=\"Howf\">{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=History of Writing|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861895887|pages=133\u2013134|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iYMXnSko5QwC|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the [[Meroitic alphabet|Meroitic]], consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. Meroitic is an [[alphabet]] originally derived from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] that was used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Mero\u00eb/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700\u2013300 BC), and first appears in the second century BC.

In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion.

By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper [[Dongola Reach]]. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of [[Amun]] at the rebuilt [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta [[stele]] at [[Elephantine]], places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century.

Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state.

At the end of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (mid-sixteenth century BC), Egypt faced the twin existential threats\u2014the [[Hyksos]] in the North and the Kushites in the South. Taken from the autobiographical inscriptions on the walls of his tomb-chapel, the Egyptians undertook campaigns to defeat Kush and conquer Nubia under the rule of [[Amenhotep I]] (1514\u20131493 BC). In Ahmose's writings, the Kushites are described as [[archery|archers]], \"Now after his Majesty had slain the Bedoin of Asia, he sailed upstream to [[Upper Nubia]] to destroy the Nubian bowmen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Writings from Ancient Egypt|last=Wilkinson|first=Toby|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2016|isbn=978-0-141-39595-1|location=United Kingdom|pages=19}}</ref> The tomb writings contain two other references to the Nubian bowmen of Kush.\n\nEgypt's international prestige had declined considerably towards the end of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Its historical allies, the inhabitants of [[Canaan]], had fallen to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365-1020 BC), and then the resurgent [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (935\u2013605 BC). The [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], from the 10th century BC onwards, had once more expanded from northern [[Mesopotamia]], and conquered a vast empire, including the whole of the [[Near East]], and much of [[Anatolia]], the eastern [[Mediterranean]], the [[Caucasus]] and [[History of Iran#Early Iron Age|early Iron Age Iran]].\n\nIn 945 BC, [[Shoshenq I]] and [[Libu]] princes took control of the Nile Delta and founded the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt]], also known as the Libyan or Bubastite dynasty, which would rule for some 200&nbsp;years.

In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars. It is not as yet possible to connect the Meroitic language with other known languages.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/nubia/mwriting.html|title=Meroitic script|website=www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Prince Arikankharer Slaying His Enemies, Meroitic, beginning of first century AD, sandstone - Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7535.JPG|left|thumb|160px|Meroitic prince smiting his enemies (early first century AD)]][[Strabo]] describes a war with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century BC.

Although the ancient sources give no description of the ensuing battle, we know that at some point the Kushites sent ambassadors to negotiate a peace settlement with Petronius.

It became extinct about 400 AD. The language was written in two forms of the [[Meroitic alphabet]]: Meroitic Cursive, which was written with a [[stylus]] and was used for general record-keeping; and Meroitic Hieroglyphic, which was carved in stone or used for royal or religious documents. It is not well understood due to the scarcity of [[bilingual]] texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180\u2013170 BC. These hieroglyphics were found engraved on the temple of Queen [[Shanakdakhete]]. Meroitic Cursive is written horizontally, and reads from right to left like all Semitic orthographies.<ref name=\"Howf\">{{cite book|last1=Fischer|first1=Steven Roger|title=History of Writing|date=2004|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1861895887|pages=133\u2013134|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iYMXnSko5QwC|accessdate=16 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the 3rd century BC, a new indigenous alphabet, the [[Meroitic alphabet|Meroitic]], consisting of twenty-three letters, replaced Egyptian script. Meroitic is an [[alphabet]] originally derived from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] that was used to write the Meroitic language of the Kingdom of Mero\u00eb/Kush. It was developed in the Napatan Period (about 700\u2013300 BC), and first appears in the second century BC.
