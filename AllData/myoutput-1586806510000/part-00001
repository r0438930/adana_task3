The show concentrates on the adventures of Rudy, his sidekick Snap, and classmate, Penny Sanchez, within the ChalkZone.\n\n''ChalkZone'' originally aired as part of [[Fred Seibert]]'s ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' animated shorts showcase in 1998. The series ran on Nickelodeon from March 22, 2002, through August 23, 2008, with 40 episodes in total. It was produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]].\n\n==Premise==\nRudy Tabootie (voiced by [[E. G. Daily]]) is a 10-year-old fifth-grader who loves to draw, but Reggie Bullnerd ([[Candi Milo]]), the school bully, is always teasing him or getting him into trouble with Mr. Wilter (Robert Cait), Rudy's grumpy school teacher who strongly dislikes cartoons especially Rudy's passion for art. One day while in detention, Rudy discovers a piece of \"White Lightning\" chalk, which allows access to the ChalkZone, a place where everything and everyone that has ever been drawn in chalk and erased takes form as living or is tangible. He soon makes friends with Snap (Candi Milo), a small, blue, [[humanoid]] drawing made by Rudy when he was only eight. Snap wears a superhero uniform and is very adventurous and witty. Rudy only lets one other person know about ChalkZone, his best friend and crush Penny Sanchez (speaking voice, [[Hynden Walch]]; singing voice, [[Robbyn Kirmss\u00e8]]), who acts as the [[genius]] of the group.\n\nWhile in ChalkZone, the trio are introduced to Cyclops ([[Rodger Bumpass]]), the kilt-wearing guardian of the magic chalk mines where Rudy obtains his magic chalk (Rudy later draws a second eye for him and renames him \"Biclops\"); Queen Rapsheeba (Rosslynn Taylor), ChalkZone's song artist whom Snap has a crush on; and Blocky (Candi Milo; Robert Cait), a light green block friend of Snap's and Rudy's first-ever drawing. They are also faced with villains such as Skrawl ([[Jim Cummings]]), a drawing who blames Rudy for being ugly and wants to destroy him; and the Craniacs ([[Rob Paulsen]]), a series of robot drawings obsessed with collecting futuristic devices.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of ChalkZone episodes}}\n{{:List of ChalkZone episodes}}\n\n==Cast==\n* [[E.G.

The concept's origin dated back during the production of [[Hanna Barbera]]'s ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' where Seibert initially wanted Huber to develop a cartoon for the showcase and assigned him with Burnett, who was writing for ''[[Cow & Chicken]]'' at the time, to develop a pilot for a potential series.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyfMOLKS5Wk Keep on Chalkin' with Bill Burnett - Chatterbox 1/13/20 - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Development fell through at the last minute from the result of [[Warner Bros. Animation]] acquiring Hanna Barbera Cartoons. The concept came back when Seibert developed Frederator Studios and was pitched as a short on Nickelodeon's ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' before getting the greenlight in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Cartoon Show Will Honor Irreverence|first=Harlene|last=Ellin|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-18/news/9807180055_1_looney-tunes-bugs-bunny-shorts|date=July 18, 1998|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215095446/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-18/news/9807180055_1_looney-tunes-bugs-bunny-shorts|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1999, ''ChalkZone'' became the first spin-off of ''Oh Yeah!

Frederator Studios announced in 2005 that the series had been cancelled at 40 episodes.\n\nThe show is remembered for featuring one-minute music videos sung by Rudy and his friends at the end of each episode. Several songs Bill Burnett created prior to ChalkZone's production, i.e. Insect Aside and Dream Alotta Dreams, were implanted into the series. A popular rumor about the show is that it was based on [[Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings]]. In fact, Bill Burnett debunked this in a 2013 interview, revealing that he was not even aware of the series' existence until after ''ChalkZone'' entered production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old School Lane's Nickelodeon Tribute: Interview with Bill Burnett|url=http://oldschoollane.blogspot.com/2013/01/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute_4384.html|website=Old School Lane|accessdate=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005201028/http://oldschoollane.blogspot.com/2013/01/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute_4384.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|date=2013-01-28}}</ref> Although Burnett did mention that [[Harold and the Purple Crayon]] was an influence on Larry's idea for the \"boy with magic chalk\" concept. A one-hour special, \"The Big Blow Up\", premiered on August 6, 2004. The final season featured new character designs with a slimmer line quality and a zooming chalk transition as new artists and oversea studios were used for the remainder of the series.\n\nThe show had three different variations of the theme song released to the public, one from the 2001 Nickelodeon album, \"The Newest Nicktoons\", which used a synthesizer instead of a guitar and had an early version of Penny's voice which was a demo Bill Burnett created in order for the song to get the green-light, an early version of the final version from the album \"ChalkZone: In The Zone\", where the guitar was used and Penny's early voice was still used, and the final version which was shown on regular episodes. Bill Burnett's original idea for the concepts' score was something in akin to simplistic children's toy instrument melodies to fit the show's children's \"chalk-drawing\" theme, but the Nickelodeon crew suggested a more techno rock-based score to give the show a huge contrast from the premise. Steve Rucker was brought into the music composition team and some of his compositions were later re-written upon request by Burnett and Moon to fit the series better, much to his discourage.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe pilot for the series first aired on December 31, 1999, as part of Nickelodeon's annual New Year's Eve block,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=19 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010202151100/http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|archivedate=February 2, 2001}}</ref> but due to being delayed by Nickelodeon for undisclosed reasons, the series made its official premiere on March 22, 2002, as the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-ChalkZone/|title=Nickelodeon Chalks Up More ChalkZone|first=Ryan|last=Ball|date=May 8, 2003|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215093427/http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-chalkzone/|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817185332/http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 17, 2002|title=Nickelodeon Draws Best Kid Ratings in Four Years, Ranks as Number-One Net for First Quarter '02, SpongeBob SquarePants and ChalkZone Etch Out Top-Rated Territory, Kids Find The Fairly OddParents Fairly Fascinating|date=April 2, 2002|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>\n\nThe show aired in reruns on \"[[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]]\" for more than a year from February 1, 2003, to September 11, 2004.

The concept's origin dated back during the production of [[Hanna Barbera]]'s ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' where Seibert initially wanted Huber to develop a cartoon for the showcase and assigned him with Burnett, who was writing for ''[[Cow & Chicken]]'' at the time, to develop a pilot for a potential series.<ref name=autogenerated1>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyfMOLKS5Wk Keep on Chalkin' with Bill Burnett - Chatterbox 1/13/20 - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Development fell through at the last minute from the result of [[Warner Bros. Animation]] acquiring Hanna Barbera Cartoons. The concept came back when Seibert developed Frederator Studios and was pitched as a short on Nickelodeon's ''[[Oh Yeah! Cartoons]]'' before getting the greenlight in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=New Cartoon Show Will Honor Irreverence|first=Harlene|last=Ellin|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-18/news/9807180055_1_looney-tunes-bugs-bunny-shorts|date=July 18, 1998|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Tribune Company|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215095446/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-18/news/9807180055_1_looney-tunes-bugs-bunny-shorts|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1999, ''ChalkZone'' became the first spin-off of ''Oh Yeah!

Frederator Studios announced in 2005 that the series had been cancelled at 40 episodes.\n\nThe show is remembered for featuring one-minute music videos sung by Rudy and his friends at the end of each episode. Several songs Bill Burnett created prior to ChalkZone's production, i.e. Insect Aside and Dream Alotta Dreams, were implanted into the series. A popular rumor about the show is that it was based on [[Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings]]. In fact, Bill Burnett debunked this in a 2013 interview, revealing that he was not even aware of the series' existence until after ''ChalkZone'' entered production.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old School Lane's Nickelodeon Tribute: Interview with Bill Burnett|url=http://oldschoollane.blogspot.com/2013/01/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute_4384.html|website=Old School Lane|accessdate=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005201028/http://oldschoollane.blogspot.com/2013/01/old-school-lanes-nickelodeon-tribute_4384.html|archive-date=5 October 2016|url-status=live|date=2013-01-28}}</ref> Although Burnett did mention that [[Harold and the Purple Crayon]] was an influence on Larry's idea for the \"boy with magic chalk\" concept. A one-hour special, \"The Big Blow Up\", premiered on August 6, 2004. The final season featured new character designs with a slimmer line quality and a zooming chalk transition as new artists and oversea studios were used for the remainder of the series.\n\nThe show had three different variations of the theme song released to the public, one from the 2001 Nickelodeon album, \"The Newest Nicktoons\", which used a synthesizer instead of a guitar and had an early version of Penny's voice which was a demo Bill Burnett created in order for the song to get the green-light, an early version of the final version from the album \"ChalkZone: In The Zone\", where the guitar was used and Penny's early voice was still used, and the final version which was shown on regular episodes. Bill Burnett's original idea for the concepts' score was something in akin to simplistic children's toy instrument melodies to fit the show's children's \"chalk-drawing\" theme, but the Nickelodeon crew suggested a more techno rock-based score to give the show a huge contrast from the premise. Steve Rucker was brought into the music composition team and some of his compositions were later re-written upon request by Burnett and Moon to fit the series better, much to his discourage.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe pilot for the series first aired on December 31, 1999, as part of Nickelodeon's annual New Year's Eve block,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Rugrats Timeline|url=http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|website=Rugratonline.com|accessdate=19 August 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010202151100/http://www.rugratonline.com/timeline.htm|archivedate=February 2, 2001}}</ref> but due to being delayed by Nickelodeon for undisclosed reasons, the series made its official premiere on March 22, 2002, as the highest-rated premiere in Nickelodeon's history up to that point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-ChalkZone/|title=Nickelodeon Chalks Up More ChalkZone|first=Ryan|last=Ball|date=May 8, 2003|work=[[Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=2012-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215093427/http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-chalks-up-more-chalkzone/|archive-date=December 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020817185332/http://www.viacom.com/press.tin?ixPressRelease=80003771|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 17, 2002|title=Nickelodeon Draws Best Kid Ratings in Four Years, Ranks as Number-One Net for First Quarter '02, SpongeBob SquarePants and ChalkZone Etch Out Top-Rated Territory, Kids Find The Fairly OddParents Fairly Fascinating|date=April 2, 2002|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]]|accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref>\n\nThe show aired in reruns on \"[[Nickelodeon on CBS|Nick on CBS]]\" for more than a year from February 1, 2003, to September 11, 2004.

''ChalkZone'' reruns aired on [[NickSplat]] (then known as \"The Splat\") for two nights only on November 12 and 13, 2016 as part of a block that ran every weekend from August until December commemorating the 25th anniversary of the [[Nicktoons]] franchise. As of October 2018, NickSplat \u2013including ''ChalkZone''\u2013 has been a subscription channel based on [[VRV (streaming service)|VRV]].\n\n==Home media==\nDuring the show's original run, there weren't any DVD releases specifically for ''ChalkZone''. The episode \"Future Zone\" was released on the Nickstravaganza! VHS. Three episodes (\"Gift Adrift\", \"French Fry Falls\", and \"Eschucha Mi Corazon\") were released for the Nickstravaganza! 2 DVD (only \"French Fry Falls\" was included on the VHS). The Christmas episode, \"When Santas Collide\", was featured on the 2006 DVD Nick Picks Holiday. A Complete Series DVD set for ChalkZone was finally released through Amazon.com's CreateSpace manufacture-on-demand program on October 13, 2014; despite the title, however, it is missing the episode \"The Smooch\" due to music licensing issues.
