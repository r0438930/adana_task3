The family belongs to an Oppressed-caste community (Kaikadi) and earns its living by doing menial jobs. Owing to the caste-ridden power structure of the village society, the boy's father has a fearful and submissive personality which is exploited by the upper-caste villagers.\n\nJabya is disillusioned by the predicament of his family and shows interest in school where he has also fallen in one-sided love with a forward caste girl named Shalini (nickname: Shalu) (Rajeshwari Kharat) who he has never talked to but tries desperately to get her to notice him.\n\nThe plot opens with Jabya and his school friend Pirya (Suraj Pawar) armed with a slingshot trying to catch a bird (the Black Sparrow) in the wilderness. However, the bird call that punctuates the film is that of the Red Wattled Lapwing (Titawi), which is supposed to bring bad luck. The black sparrow, with its distinctive forked tail, and the call of the red wattled lapwing occur repeatedly throughout the film. The duo keep trying to catch the bird in the entire film for an unknown reason which is later explained in the film. According to a local legend, it is believed that when the ash obtained by burning the black sparrow is sprinkled on someone, it hypnotizes them to fall in love with the person sprinkling it.\n\nJabya also befriends a bicycle mechanic named Chankya (Nagraj Manjule) who sees his young self in the boy. Chankya had once married a girl but she was soon forcefully taken away by her brother and left him beaten very badly. Since then he has renounced family life and taken up refuge in spirituality, mysticism and liquor. Jabya seeks support from Chankya in his quest to obtain his love, which Chankya readily extends. Perhaps the idea of sprinkling the ash of black sparrow on Shalu is suggested to Jabya by Chankya himself. The idea, however, is executed only in Jabya's dream.\n\nBack in the village, Jabya's family members comply as they are exploited and dehumanized by the villagers over and over again. In the film's climax, Jabya finally acknowledges the existence of the kingdom and the boundaries of its residents (castes). He realises that he himself is the odd one out who is trying to assimilate in a world that prefers to stay within their own boundaries (a form of security).\n\nHe understands that his own boundaries have collapsed in his attempts to assimilate with the other castes and has thus become vulnerable to their attacks. Reaching self-awareness for the first time in his life, he suddenly explodes in rage and grabs a rock and throws it at his oppressors, thus re-establishing his boundary. His personal quest to assimilate with the others now broken by himself.\n\n==Cast==\n* Somnath Awghade as Jambuwant Kachru Mane (Jabya)\n* Suraj Pawar as a Piraji (Pirya)\n* Chhaya Kadam as Nani\n* [[Kishor Kadam]] as a Kachru Mane (Nana)\n* [[Rajeshwari Kharat]] as Shalu\n* Bhushan Manjule as Dada Patil\n* [[Nagraj Manjule]] as a Chankya (Chankeshwar Sathe)\n* Sohail Shaikh as Sangram\n* Sanjay Chaudhri as Teacher\n* Vikas Pandurang Patil as a Navhi\n* Prashant Kamble\n* Jyoti Subhash\n* Suhas Sirsat\n* Moinuddin Inamdar as a principal\n* Pooja Dolas as a Vedant's mother\n* Shruti Awate as a Rani\n* Sakshi Vyavhare as a Dhurpa\n* Pravin Tarde as a Sarpanch\n* Suresh Vishwakarma\n\n==Crew==\n*Story, screenplay, dialogues & direction \u2013 Nagraj Manjule\n*Producers \u2013 Nilesh Navlakha and [[Vivek Kajaria]]\n*Executive producer \u2013 Vivek Wagh\n*Costume designers \u2013 Gargee Kulkarni and Priyanka Dubey\n*Art director \u2013 Santosh Sankhad\n*Sound design \u2013 Nimish Chheda\n*Chief assistant director \u2013 Gargee Kulkarni and Kutub Inamdar\n*Assistant editor \u2013 Kutub Inamdar\n*On location sound \u2013 Christopher Robleto Harvey\n\n==Production and release==\nThe film was praised at the Mumbai International Film Festival and was subsequently picked up by Zee Entertainment for distribution rights in Maharashtra in 125 to 150 screens.
