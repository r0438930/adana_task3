It was filmed in 1979, and was released in Europe in 1980 and in the United States on April 3, 1981 through [[20th Century Fox]].\n\n==Plot==\nBo Hooper (Lewis), a clown, finds himself unemployed when the circus where he works suddenly closes.  He winds up living with his sister ([[Susan Oliver]]), against the wishes of her husband Robert ([[Roger C. Carmel]]).  From there he goes from job to job, wreaking havoc along the way.  He finally finds some stability as a postal worker, until he finds out that his boss is his girlfriend's father.  The father hates all mail carriers because his daughter's ex-husband was one, so he tries to wreck Bo's life, but Bo overcomes the odds and succeeds not only at work, but at impressing the father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jerry Lewis]] as Bo Hooper\n* [[Susan Oliver]] as Claire Trent\n* [[Roger C.
