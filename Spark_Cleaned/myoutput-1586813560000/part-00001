On February 16, 2020, Lloyd D. Nabors Demolition company demolished it to make way for a $2.5 billion mixed-use project. The building quickly became an Internet meme and a social media hotspot for selfies. People went to Dallas from all over Texas to take photos with it, much like people do when visiting the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2020/02/20/leaning-tower-dallas-citys-accidental-tourist-destination/4825127002/ | title=Leaning Tower of Dallas survived demolition to become city's accidental Instagram star  | publisher=USA Today | accessdate= April 7, 2020}}</ref>.\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe building was built in 1971 and was the Southland Corporation Office Tower.

He said, \"[It had] a cast-in-place concrete core, we call it a slip-form concrete core. And that became the stabilizing element for the building. So it's sort of like the tree trunk of a tree.
