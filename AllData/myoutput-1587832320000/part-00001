{"title_page": "Foreign language", "text_new": "{{short description|Non native language}}\n{{for|possible languages of extraterrestrials|alien language}}\nA '''foreign language''' is a [[language]] originally from another country than the speaker. However, there must be a defined distinction between foreign and [[second language]]. It is also a language not spoken in the native country of the person referred to, i.e., an [[English language|English]] speaker living in [[Spain]] can say that [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a foreign language to them, or a [[Japanese language|Japanese]] speaker living in the [[United States]] can say that English is a foreign language to them.

These children can be said to have two, three or more mother tongues: neither language is foreign to that child, even if one language is a foreign language for the vast majority of people in the child's birth country. For example, a child learning English from his [[England|English]] father and Irish at school in Ireland can speak both English and Irish, but neither is a foreign language to them. This is common in countries such as [[India]], [[South Africa]], or [[Canada]] due to these countries having multiple official languages.\n\nIn general, it is believed that children have advantage to learning a foreign language over adults.

Children early on have different ways of expressing themselves, such that they better understand there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.\n\n==Foreign language ''versus'' second language==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2019}}\n\nAlthough significant differences between the definitions of second language and foreign language may be hard to find as the two terms are often taken as synonyms, research has been carried out to shed light on the differentiating traits of the two. The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and TEFL (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows the attention different researchers have paid to the concepts of foreign language and second language.\n\nRichards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide the following information about second language:\n\n\"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's [[native language]] [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfills many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home).\"\n\nThey also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).\n\nCrystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).\n\nStern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after [[World War II]] in international organisations, such as [[UNESCO]], in order to meet [[nationalist]] susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.\n\nFasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.\n\nSo, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).\n\nA 'second language' usually has [[official language|official status]] or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, [[Persian language|Persian]] is a second language for [[Kurdish people]], but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]]. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian person]] goes to [[United States]], then English becomes a second language for them. Thus, British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language, and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. Meanwhile, people in Kurdistan can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.\n\nThe purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.\n\nThere are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. They can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.\n\nSecond language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.\n\n[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.\n\nThe major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:\n\n# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.\n# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.\n# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.\n# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.\n# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.\n\nThere are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.\n\n===Acquisition versus learning===\nThere is often a distinction between [[language acquisition|acquisition]] and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught, and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.\n\nThe distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.\n\nNevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the US]] can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[First language]]\n* [[Foreign language influences in English]]\n* [[Fremdsprachen und Hochschule]]\n* [[International auxiliary language]]\n* [[Language education]]\n* [[Language exchange]]\n* [[Language Resource Center]]\n* [[Language school]]\n* [[Learning by teaching]]\n* [[Multilingualism]]\n* [[Official language]]\n* [[Second language]]\n* [[Teaching English as a foreign language]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bailey, David. \"The Secret to Learning a Foreign Language as an Adult. \" Time.

The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and TEFL (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows the attention different researchers have paid to the concepts of foreign language and second language.\n\nRichards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide the following information about second language:\n\n\"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's [[native language]] [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfills many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home).\"\n\nThey also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).\n\nCrystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).\n\nStern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after [[World War II]] in international organisations, such as [[UNESCO]], in order to meet [[nationalist]] susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.\n\nFasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.\n\nSo, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).\n\nA 'second language' usually has [[official language|official status]] or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, [[Persian language|Persian]] is a second language for [[Kurdish people]], but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]]. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian person]] goes to [[United States]], then English becomes a second language for him. Thus, British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language, and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. Meanwhile, people in Kurdistan can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.\n\nThe purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.\n\nThere are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. He or she can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.\n\nSecond language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.\n\n[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.\n\nThe major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:\n\n# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.\n# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.\n# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.\n# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.\n# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.\n\nThere are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.\n\n===Acquisition versus learning===\nThere is often a distinction between [[language acquisition|acquisition]] and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught, and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.\n\nThe distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.\n\nNevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the US]] can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[First language]]\n* [[Foreign language influences in English]]\n* [[Fremdsprachen und Hochschule]]\n* [[International auxiliary language]]\n* [[Language education]]\n* [[Language exchange]]\n* [[Language Resource Center]]\n* [[Language school]]\n* [[Learning by teaching]]\n* [[Multilingualism]]\n* [[Official language]]\n* [[Second language]]\n* [[Teaching English as a foreign language]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Bailey, David. \"The Secret to Learning a Foreign Language as an Adult. \" Time.
