It has more than 17,000 members from more than 95 countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nAs food technology grew from the individual family farm to the factory level, including the [[slaughterhouse]] for meat and poultry processing, the [[cannery]] for canned foods, and bakeries for bread, the need to have personnel trained for the food industry did also. Literature such as [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) later that year. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] was also interested in food technology, and research was already being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>Goldblith, S.A.

Trumball, Connecticut: Food & Nutrition Press, Inc. pp. 99\u2013100.</ref> By 1935, two MIT professors, [[Samuel C. Prescott]] and [[Bernard E. Proctor]] decided that it was time to hold an international conference regarding this.<ref name=\"Goldblith p101\">Goldblith. p. 101.</ref> A detailed proposal was presented to MIT President [[Karl Taylor Compton]] in 1936 was presented with $1500 of financial aid from MIT for a meeting to be held from June 30 to July 2, 1937 with Compton asking how many people would be in attendance at this meeting. Prescott replied with \"fifty or sixty people.\" 500 people actually attended the event.<ref name=\"Goldblith p101\"/>\n\nThis meeting proved so successful that in early 1938 that a second conference would be held in 1939. Initially led by [[George J. Hucker]] of the [[New York State Agricultural Experiment Station]] (part of [[Cornell University]]) in [[Geneva, New York]], a small group meeting was held on August 5, 1938 on forming an organization with an expanded group meeting in New York City on January 16, 1939 to further discuss this.<ref name=\"Goldblith p102\">Goldblith. p. 102.</ref> The second conference was held at MIT June 29 to July 1, 1939 with Proctor as conference chair. 600 people attended this event. At the final session, the chairman of the session [[Fred C. Blanck]] of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the '''Institute of Food Technologists.''' This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as President, [[Roy C. Newton]] of [[Swift & Company]] in Chicago, Illinois as Vice President, and Hucker as Secretary-Treasurer.<ref name=\"Goldblith p102\"/> By 1949, IFT had 3,000 members.\n\n===Growth===\nRegional sections were established in IFT as early as 1940 in northern California (San Francisco, [[Bakersfield]], [[Sacramento]]).<ref>[http://www.ift.org/sections/ncift/oldguard.htm Northern California IFT Section Chairs]</ref> The first IFT Award, the [[Nicholas Appert Award]] was established in 1942 by IFT's Chicago section with additional awards being established since then. For the first ten years, IFT officers were President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer. In 1949, IFT moved into offices in Chicago and created a permanent position of Executive Secretary to run daily organizational operations. Retired [[U.S. Army]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Charles S. Lawrence]] was named the first Executive Secretary, a position he would hold until 1961 when he was replaced by [[Calvert L. Willey]]. During Willey's term as Executive Director (Executive Secretary 1961\u20131966), IFT would grow from 6,000 members in 1961 to 23,000 members in 1987.<ref>\"In Memoriam: Calvert L.

Today, IFT sits on the advisory council for the [[International Food Protection Training Institute]].\n\n===IFT Annual Meeting & Food Expo===\nIFT largest in-person gathering is IFT\u2019s Annual Meeting & Food Expo.<ref>http://www.am-fe.ift.org/</ref> This event, which offers more than 100 scientific and applied education sessions and an expo featuring 1,000+ exhibiting companies, regularly attracts 23,000 food professionals from more than 90 countries.\n\n===Certification===\nIFT offers the Certified Food Scientist (CFS) designation. The CFS is the only globally-recognized certification for food scientists, and has more than 1600 certificants in 55 countries. The CFS program is officially endorsed by the Australian Institute of Food Science Technology (AIFST) as well as the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology (CIFST). Earning the CFS consists of meeting certain academic and work experience requirements and passing an exam in the following content areas:\n* Product Development \n* Quality Assurance and Quality Control \n* Food Chemistry and Food Analysis \n* Regulatory \n* Food Microbiology \n* Food Safety \n* Food Engineering \n* Sensory Evaluation and Consumer Testing\n\nIt was designed to meet the International Standards Organization (ISO) 17024 standards for certification programs.\n\n===Global Food Traceability Center===\nIFT\u2019s Global Food Traceability Center (GFTC) is the global resource and authoritative voice on food traceability. Supported by its Founding Sponsors and guided by its Advisory Council, GFTC is designed to accelerate adoption and implementation of practical traceability solutions across the global [[food system]].\n\nThe Center works to deliver events, research, and support services that will help to increase understanding of food traceability across four business platforms:\n* Research\n* Protocols & Standards\n* Education & Training\n* Technology Transfer\n\n==Awards==\nAll awards except the Loncin prize have this reference<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://members.ift.org/NR/rdonlyres/A4E0668B-2F2C-4AFC-8F67-101350093BBE/0/AchievementAwardsNomination.doc |title=Achievement Awards Nomination (Word file) |access-date=October 5, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302063935/http://members.ift.org/NR/rdonlyres/A4E0668B-2F2C-4AFC-8F67-101350093BBE/0/AchievementAwardsNomination.doc |archive-date=March 2, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> listed below.\n\n* [[Nicholas Appert Award]] (1942) \u2013 IFT's highest honor.

Food traceability, food fraud, obesity, and how science and technology will help feed the world\u2019s projected 9 billion-plus people in 2050 have all become main issues for IFT.\n\n{{Food science}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Institute Of Food Technologists}}\n[[Category:Agricultural organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Food technology organizations]]\n[[Category:Organizations based in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Organizations established in 1939]]\n[[Category:Food safety organizations]]\n[[Category:1939 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{Infobox company \n|name       = Institute of Food Technologists\n|logo       = IFT logo as of 5.24.2010.PNG\n|logo_size  = 150px\n|type       = Non-profit\n|foundation = 1939\n|location   = Chicago, Illinois\n|homepage   = {{Official URL}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Institute of Food Technologists''' (IFT) is an international, non-profit scientific society of professionals engaged in food science, food technology, and related areas in academia, government and industry. It has more than 17,000 members from more than 95 countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nAs food technology grew from the individual family farm to the factory level, including the [[slaughterhouse]] for meat and poultry processing, the [[cannery]] for canned foods, and bakeries for bread, the need to have personnel trained for the food industry did also. Literature such as [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'' in 1906 about slaughterhouse operations would be a factor in the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) later that year. The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] was also interested in food technology, and research was already being done at agricultural colleges in the United States, including the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], and the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>Goldblith, S.A.

Trumball, Connecticut: Food & Nutrition Press, Inc. pp. 99\u2013100.</ref> By 1935, two MIT professors, [[Samuel C. Prescott]] and [[Bernard E. Proctor]] decided that it was time to hold an international conference regarding this.<ref name=\"Goldblith p101\">Goldblith. p. 101.</ref> A detailed proposal was presented to MIT President [[Karl Taylor Compton]] in 1936 was presented with $1500 of financial aid from MIT for a meeting to be held from June 30 to July 2, 1937 with Compton asking how many people would be in attendance at this meeting. Prescott replied with \"fifty or sixty people.\" 500 people actually attended the event.<ref name=\"Goldblith p101\"/>\n\nThis meeting proved so successful that in early 1938 that a second conference would be held in 1939. Initially led by [[George J. Hucker]] of the [[New York State Agricultural Experiment Station]] (part of [[Cornell University]]) in [[Geneva, New York]], a small group meeting was held on August 5, 1938 on forming an organization with an expanded group meeting in New York City on January 16, 1939 to further discuss this.<ref name=\"Goldblith p102\">Goldblith. p. 102.</ref> The second conference was held at MIT June 29 to July 1, 1939 with Proctor as conference chair. 600 people attended this event. At the final session, the chairman of the session [[Fred C. Blanck]] of the United States Department of Agriculture, proposed that an organization be established as the '''Institute of Food Technologists.''' This was approved unanimously. Its first officers were Prescott as President, [[Roy C. Newton]] of [[Swift & Company]] in Chicago, Illinois as Vice President, and Hucker as Secretary-Treasurer.<ref name=\"Goldblith p102\"/> By 1949, IFT had 3,000 members.\n\n===Growth===\nRegional sections were established in IFT as early as 1940 in northern California (San Francisco, [[Bakersfield]], [[Sacramento]]).<ref>[http://www.ift.org/sections/ncift/oldguard.htm Northern California IFT Section Chairs]</ref> The first IFT Award, the [[Nicholas Appert Award]] was established in 1942 by IFT's Chicago section with additional awards being established since then. For the first ten years, IFT officers were President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer. In 1949, IFT moved into offices in Chicago and created a permanent position of Executive Secretary to run daily organizational operations. Retired [[U.S. Army]] [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Charles S. Lawrence]] was named the first Executive Secretary, a position he would hold until 1961 when he was replaced by [[Calvert L. Willey]]. During Willey's term as Executive Director (Executive Secretary 1961\u20131966), IFT would grow from 6,000 members in 1961 to 23,000 members in 1987.<ref>\"In Memoriam: Calvert L.
