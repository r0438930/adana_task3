The convicted traitor was fastened to a [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then [[hanged]] (almost to the point of death), [[emasculation|emasculated]], [[disembowelment|disembowelled]], [[decapitation|beheaded]], and [[Dismemberment|quartered]] (chopped into four pieces). His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as [[London Bridge]], to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]].\n\nThe severity of the sentence was [[Retributive justice|measured against the seriousness of the crime]]. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests executed during the [[Elizabethan era]], and several of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] involved in the 1649 [[execution of Charles I]].\n\nAlthough the [[Act of Parliament]] defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]]. The death penalty for treason was abolished [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998|in 1998]].\n\n==Treason in England==\n[[Image:Drawing of William de Marisco.jpg|thumb|300px|As illustrated in [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', [[William de Marisco]] is drawn to his execution behind a horse.]]\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]] those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the 13th century other more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering. The 13th-century English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] described how in 1238 \"a certain man at arms, a man of some education (''armiger literatus'')\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1949|pp=54\u201358}}</ref> attempted to kill [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]].

Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution. For killing English nobles he was hanged alive. For killing those nobles at Easter he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. For conspiring to kill the king in various parts of the realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the [[Tower of London]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2004|pp=23\u201326}}</ref> A similar fate was suffered by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] leader [[William Wallace|Sir William Wallace]].

Suspects were first questioned in private by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] before they were publicly tried. They were allowed no witnesses or defence [[counsel]], and were generally presumed guilty from the outset. This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians prompted the introduction of the [[Treason Act 1695]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomkovicz|2002|p=6}}</ref> This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Execution of the sentence==\n{{See also|List of people hanged, drawn and quartered}}\nOnce sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution.

According to [[Samuel Clarke]], the [[Puritan]] clergyman [[William Perkins (Puritan)|William Perkins]] (1558\u20131602) once managed to convince a young man at the gallows that he had been forgiven, enabling the youth to go to his death \"with tears of joy in his eyes&nbsp;... as if he actually saw himself delivered from the hell which he feared before, and heaven opened for receiving his soul.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Clarke|1654|p=853}}</ref>\n\nAfter the king's commission had been read aloud, the crowd was normally asked to move back from the scaffold before being addressed by the convict.<ref name=\"Bellamyp191\">{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=191}}</ref> While these speeches were mostly an admission of guilt (although few admitted treason),<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=195}}</ref> still they were carefully monitored by the sheriff and chaplain, who were occasionally forced to act; in 1588, Catholic priest [[William Dean (priest)|William Dean]]'s address to the crowd was considered so inappropriate that he was gagged almost to the point of suffocation.<ref name=\"Bellamyp191\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Pollen|1908|p=327}}</ref> Questions on matters of allegiance and politics were sometimes put to the prisoner,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=193}}</ref> as happened to [[Edmund Gennings]] in 1591.

A government spy, John Munday, was in 1582 present for the execution of [[Thomas Ford (martyr)|Thomas Ford]]. Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=194}}</ref> The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=199}}</ref>\n\nThe condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. The priest [[James Bell (priest)|James Bell]] was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, [[John Finch (martyr)|John Finch]], was \"a-quarter-inge.\" [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]] and Francis Edwardes were made to witness [[Ralph Crockett]]'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=201}}</ref> Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart. On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air. The aim was usually to cause [[strangulation]] and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest [[John Payne (martyr)|John Payne]]'s death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs. Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular [[William Hacket]] (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally [[emasculated]]\u2014the latter, according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], to \"show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood.\"{{refn|group=\"nb\"|For an explanation of \"corruption of blood\", see [[Attainder]].}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Though many say that the disembowelling involved the criminal being slit open from the breastbone down, Geoffrey Robertson <ref>(2005) ''The Tyrannicide Brief'', London  Chatto & Windus</ref> shows photographs of the screw irons used, he states, to 'draw' the entrails through the anus, the opening having been first cut open it more than natural.

He speculates that the reasoning behind such bloody displays may have been to assuage the crowd's anger, to remove any human characteristics from the corpse, to rob the criminal's family of any opportunity to hold a meaningful funeral, or even to release any evil spirits contained within.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kastenbaum|2004|pp=193\u2013194}}</ref> The practice of disembowelling the body may have originated in the medieval belief that treasonable thoughts were housed there, requiring that the convict's entrails be \"purged by fire\".<ref name=\"Bellamyp204\"/> [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Andrew Harclay]]'s \"treasonous thoughts had originated in his 'heart, bowels, and entrails'\", and so were to be \"extracted and burnt to ashes, which would then be dispersed\", as had happened with William Wallace and [[Gilbert de Middleton]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Westerhof|2008|p=127}}</ref>}} At his execution in January 1606 for his involvement in the [[Gunpowder Plot]], [[Guy Fawkes]] managed to break his neck by jumping from the gallows.<ref>{{Harvnb|Northcote Parkinson|1976|pp=91\u201392}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|2005|p=283}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Execution of thomas armstrong 1683.jpg|right|thumb|250px|upright|Engraving of the execution of [[Thomas Armstrong (English politician)|Sir Thomas Armstrong]] in 1684]]\nNo records exist to demonstrate exactly how the corpse was quartered, although an engraving of the quartering of [[Sir Thomas Armstrong]] in 1684 shows the executioner making vertical cuts through the spine and removing the legs at the hip.{{sfn|Lewis|2008|pp=113\u2013124|ps=}} The distribution of [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]]'s remains was described by [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet|Herbert Maxwell]]: \"the right arm with a ring on the finger in York; the left arm in Bristol; the right leg and hip at Northampton; the left [leg] at Hereford.

Several drops of blood fell from the fingers of Macnamara and Wood, during the time they were suspended.

A surgeon then in attempting to sever the head from the body by a common dissecting knife, missed the particular joint aimed at, when he kept haggling it, till the executioner was obliged to take the head between his hands, and to twist it several times round, when it was with difficulty severed from the body.

(BnF Fr 2643-6)|Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse]]]]\n\nTo be '''hanged, drawn and quartered''' was, [[Treason Act 1351|from 1352]], a [[statutory]] penalty in England for men convicted of [[high treason]], although the ritual was first recorded during the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216\u20131272). The convicted traitor was fastened to a [[hurdle]], or wooden panel, and drawn by horse to the place of execution, where he was then [[hanged]] (almost to the point of death), [[emasculation|emasculated]], [[disembowelment|disembowelled]], [[decapitation|beheaded]], and [[Dismemberment|quartered]] (chopped into four pieces). His remains would then often be displayed in prominent places across the country, such as [[London Bridge]], to serve as a warning of the fate of traitors. For reasons of public decency, women convicted of high treason were instead [[Burning of women in England|burned at the stake]].\n\nThe severity of the sentence was [[Retributive justice|measured against the seriousness of the crime]]. As an attack on the monarch's authority, high treason was considered a deplorable act demanding the most extreme form of punishment. Although some convicts had their sentences modified and suffered a less ignominious end, over a period of several hundred years many men found guilty of high treason were subjected to the law's ultimate sanction. They included many English [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] priests executed during the [[Elizabethan era]], and several of the [[List of regicides of Charles I|regicides]] involved in the 1649 [[execution of Charles I]].\n\nAlthough the [[Act of Parliament]] defining high treason remains on the United Kingdom's statute books, during a long period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England [[Forfeiture Act 1870|in 1870]]. The death penalty for treason was abolished [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998|in 1998]].\n\n==Treason in England==\n[[Image:Drawing of William de Marisco.jpg|thumb|300px|As illustrated in [[Matthew Paris]]'s ''[[Chronica Majora]]'', [[William de Marisco]] is drawn to his execution behind a horse.]]\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]] those in England guilty of treason were punished in a variety of ways, including drawing and hanging. In the 13th century other more brutal penalties were introduced, such as disembowelling, burning, beheading and quartering. The 13th-century English chronicler [[Matthew Paris]] described how in 1238 \"a certain man at arms, a man of some education (''armiger literatus'')\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Powicke|1949|pp=54\u201358}}</ref> attempted to kill [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]]. His account records in gruesome detail how the would-be assassin was executed: \"dragged asunder, then beheaded, and his body divided into three parts; each part was then dragged through one of the principal cities of England, and was afterwards hung on a gibbet used for robbers.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Giles|1852|p=139}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|\"''<!-- Quo cognito -->Rex eum, quasi regiae majestatis (occisorem), membratim laniatum equis apud Coventre, exemplum terribile et spectaculum comentabile praebere (iussit) omnibus audentibus talia machinari.

De Marisco was captured in 1242 and on Henry's order dragged from Westminster to the [[Tower of London]] to be executed. There he was hanged from a [[gibbet]] until dead. His corpse was disembowelled, his entrails burned, his body quartered and the parts distributed to cities across the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|Paris|1987|p=234}}</ref> The punishment is more frequently recorded during [[Edward I of England|Edward I]]'s reign.<ref>{{Harvnb|Diehl|Donnelly|2009|p=58}}</ref>  \n\nThe [[Welsh people|Welsh]] Prince [[Dafydd ap Gruffydd]] became the first nobleman in England to be hanged, drawn, and quartered after he turned against the king and proclaimed himself [[Prince of Wales]] and Lord of Snowdon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beadle|Harrison|2008|p=11}}</ref> Dafydd's rebellion infuriated [[Edward I]] so much that he demanded a novel punishment. Therefore, following his capture and trial in 1283, for his betrayal he was drawn by horse to his place of execution. For killing English nobles he was hanged alive. For killing those nobles at Easter he was eviscerated and his entrails burned. For conspiring to kill the king in various parts of the realm, his body was quartered and the parts sent across the country; his head was placed on top of the [[Tower of London]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|2004|pp=23\u201326}}</ref> A similar fate was suffered by the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] leader [[William Wallace|Sir William Wallace]].

As this might undermine the state, retribution was considered an absolute necessity and the crime deserving of the ultimate punishment.<ref>{{Harvnb|Foucault|1995|pp=47\u201349}}</ref> The practical difference between the two offences therefore was in the consequence of being convicted; rather than being drawn and hanged, men were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered, while for reasons of public decency (their anatomy being considered inappropriate for the sentence), women were instead drawn and burned.<ref name=\"Briggsp84\">{{Harvnb|Briggs|1996|p=84}}</ref><ref name=\"Naishp9\">{{Harvnb|Naish|1991|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe Act declared that a person had committed high treason if they were:<ref name=\"Bellamyp9\"/>\n*compassing or imagining the death of the king, his wife or his eldest son and heir;\n*violating the king's wife, his eldest daughter if she were unmarried, or the wife of his eldest son and heir;\n*levying war against the king in his [[realm]];\n*adhering to the king's enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in his realm or elsewhere;\n*counterfeiting the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] or the [[Privy Seal]], or the king's coinage;\n*knowingly importing counterfeit money;\n*killing the [[Lord Chancellor|Chancellor]], [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] or one of the king's Justices while performing their offices.\n\nThe Act did not limit the king's authority in defining the scope of treason.

Suspects were first questioned in private by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] before they were publicly tried. They were allowed no witnesses or defence [[counsel]], and were generally presumed guilty from the outset. This meant that for centuries anyone accused of treason was severely legally disadvantaged, a situation which lasted until the late 17th century, when several years of politically motivated treason charges made against [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politicians prompted the introduction of the [[Treason Act 1695]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Tomkovicz|2002|p=6}}</ref> This allowed a defendant counsel, witnesses, a copy of the indictment, and a jury, and when not charged with an attempt on the monarch's life, to be prosecuted within three years of the alleged offence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Feilden|2009|pp=6\u20137}}</ref>\n\n==Execution of the sentence==\n{{See also|List of people hanged, drawn and quartered}}\nOnce sentenced, malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution.

Munday supported the sheriff, who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=194}}</ref> The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment. Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant; conversely, those of a higher station were often the most apologetic. Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect, and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious, but not treasonable act, had been committed. Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=199}}</ref>\n\nThe condemned were occasionally forced to watch as other traitors, sometimes their confederates, were executed before them. The priest [[James Bell (priest)|James Bell]] was in 1584 made to watch as his companion, [[John Finch (martyr)|John Finch]], was \"a-quarter-inge.\" [[Edward James (martyr)|Edward James]] and Francis Edwardes were made to witness [[Ralph Crockett]]'s execution in 1588, in an effort to elicit their co-operation and acceptance of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s religious supremacy before they were themselves executed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|p=201}}</ref> Normally stripped to the shirt with their arms bound in front of them, prisoners were then hanged for a short period, either from a ladder or cart. On the sheriff's orders the cart would be taken away (or if a ladder, turned), leaving the man suspended in mid-air. The aim was usually to cause [[strangulation]] and near-death, although some victims were killed prematurely, the priest [[John Payne (martyr)|John Payne]]'s death in 1582 being hastened by a group of men pulling on his legs. Conversely, some, such as the deeply unpopular [[William Hacket]] (d. 1591), were cut down instantly and taken to be disembowelled and normally [[emasculated]]\u2014the latter, according to Sir [[Edward Coke]], to \"show his issue was disinherited with corruption of blood.\"{{refn|group=\"nb\"|For an explanation of \"corruption of blood\", see [[Attainder]].}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Bellamy|1979|pp=202\u2013204}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Though many say that the disembowelling involved the criminal being slit open from the breastbone down, Geoffrey Robertson <ref>(2005) ''The Tyrannicide Brief'', London  Chatto & Windus</ref> shows photographs of the screw irons used, he states, to 'draw' the entrails through the anus, the opening having been first cut open it more than natural.
