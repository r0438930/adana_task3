Critique was mainly aimed towards lower build quality and missing user interface indicators, together with a new style of trackpad where the traditional ThinkPad trackpoint functionality had been radically changed, and the controversial [[Chiclet keyboard|Chiclet style keyboard]] introduced in 2012 on other products, which many enthusiasts claimed abandoned the core tactile principles established by IBM over previous decades.\n\nThe new W series however featured newer hardware such as the option for a 3K IPS display.\n<br>\nOther new features included:\n* Full size keyboard w/numeric keypad (though offset from center of screen, causing criticism from those who rarely use the keypad)\n* New trackpad/trackpoint integration (though TrackPoint \"thumb\" buttons were removed causing criticism due to lost tactile feedback)\n* Changed [[Lenovo UltraBay|UltraBay]] design (the easy eject locking buttons were replaced by a hidden locking screw rendering \"hot swap\" functionality moot and earlier UltraBay modules incompatible)\n* New rectangular connector for charger (rendering earlier accessories and docking stations obsolete)\n* Thinner profile\n* Lighter weight\n\n===W541===\n\nThe Lenovo W541 is a ThinkPad W540 featuring the new-style keyboard but with a re-introduction of the classic ThinkPad trackpad design.
