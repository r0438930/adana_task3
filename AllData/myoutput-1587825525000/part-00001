{"title_page": "Device driver", "text_new": "{{About|device drivers for hardware|other aasoftware \ndrivers|sex\n (software)}}\nIn [[computing]], a '''device driver''' is a [[computer program]] that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer.<ref name=\"dev1\">{{cite web|title=What is a device driver?|url=http://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/definition/device-driver|website=WhatIs.com|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> A driver provides a [[software interface]] to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used.\n\nA driver communicates with the [[Peripheral|device]] through the [[computer bus]] or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. When a calling program invokes a [[subroutine|routine]] in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. Drivers are hardware dependent and [[operating system|operating-system]]-specific. They usually provide the [[interrupt]] handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCCfRAj3aCgC&dq=device+driver+hardware+dependent&hl=fil&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Information Storage and Management: Storing, Managing, and Protecting Digital Information|year=2010|author=EMC Education Services|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nThe main purpose of device drivers is to provide abstraction by acting as a translator between a hardware device and the applications or [[operating system]]s that use it.<ref name=\"dev1\"/>  Programmers can write higher-level application code independently of whatever specific hardware the end-user is using.\nFor example, a high-level application for interacting with a [[serial port]] may simply have two functions for \"send data\" and \"receive data\". At a lower level, a device driver implementing these functions would communicate to the particular serial port controller installed on a user's computer. The commands needed to control a [[16550 UART]] are much different from the commands needed to control an [[FTDI]] serial port converter, but each hardware-specific device driver [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstracts]] these details into the same (or similar) software interface.\n\n==Development==\nWriting a device driver requires an in-depth understanding of how the hardware and the software works for a given [[Computing platform|platform]] function. Because drivers require low-level access to hardware functions in order to operate, drivers typically operate in a highly [[privilege (computing)|privilege]]d environment and can cause system operational issues if something goes wrong. In contrast, most user-level software on modern [[operating system]]s can be stopped without greatly affecting the rest of the system. Even drivers executing in [[user mode]] can crash a system if the device is [[Erroneous program|erroneously programmed]]. These factors make it more difficult and dangerous to diagnose problems.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aFQAAAAMAAJ&q=writing+a+device+driver&dq=writing+a+device+driver&hl=fil&sa=X&ei=yA2jUJyXEKmfiAes44CIAQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ|title=Writing device drivers: tutorial and reference|year=1995|author=Burke, Timothy|publisher=Digital Press}}</ref>\n\nThe task of writing drivers thus usually falls to [[software engineer]]s or [[computer engineer]]s who work for hardware-development companies. This is because they have better information than most outsiders about the design of their hardware. Moreover, it was traditionally considered in the hardware [[manufacturer]]'s interest to guarantee that their clients can use their hardware in an optimum way. Typically, the [[Logical Device Driver]] (LDD) is written by the operating system vendor, while the [[Physical Device Driver]] (PDD) is implemented by the device vendor. But in recent years, non-vendors have written numerous [[proprietary device driver]]s, mainly for use with [[free and open source software|free and open source]] [[operating system]]s. In such cases, it is important that the hardware manufacturer provides information on how the device communicates. Although this information can instead be learned by [[reverse engineering]], this is much more difficult with hardware than it is with software.\n\n[[Microsoft]] has attempted to reduce system instability due to poorly written device drivers by creating a new framework for driver development, called [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF).  This includes [[User-Mode Driver Framework]] (UMDF) that encourages development of certain types of drivers\u2014primarily those that implement a [[message-based protocol]] for communicating with their devices\u2014as user-mode drivers. If such drivers malfunction, they do not cause system instability. The [[Kernel-Mode Driver Framework]] (KMDF) model continues to allow development of kernel-mode device drivers, but attempts to provide standard implementations of functions that are known to cause problems, including cancellation of I/O operations, power management, and plug and play device support.\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has an open-source framework for developing drivers on [[macOS]], called [[I/O Kit]].\n\nIn [[Linux kernel|Linux]] environments, programmers can build device drivers as parts of the [[Linux kernel|kernel]], separately as loadable [[loadable kernel module|module]]s, or as user-mode drivers (for certain types of devices where kernel interfaces exist, such as for USB devices). [[Makedev]] includes a list of the devices in Linux: ttyS (terminal), lp ([[parallel port]]), hd (disk), loop, sound  (these include [[Sound card mixer|mixer]], [[Music sequencer|sequencer]], [[Digital signal processor|dsp]], and audio)...<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl8_MAKEDEV.htm\n | title = MAKEDEV&nbsp;\u2014 Linux Command&nbsp;\u2014 Unix Command\n | publisher = Linux.about.com\n | date = 2009-09-11\n | accessdate = 2009-09-17\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Microsoft Windows]] [[.sys]] files and [[Linux]] .ko modules contain loadable device drivers.

They are used to emulate a hardware device, particularly in [[virtual machine|virtualization]] environments, for example when a [[DOS]] program is run on a [[Microsoft Windows]] computer or when a guest [[operating system]] is run on, for example, a [[Xen]] host. Instead of enabling the guest operating system to dialog with hardware, virtual device drivers take the opposite role and emulates a piece of hardware, so that the guest operating system and its drivers running inside a [[virtual machine]] can have the illusion of accessing real hardware. Attempts by the guest operating system to access the hardware are routed to the virtual device driver in the host operating system as e.g.,&nbsp;[[function call]]s. The virtual device driver can also send simulated processor-level events like [[interrupt]]s into the virtual machine.\n\nVirtual devices may also operate in a non-virtualized environment. For example, a virtual [[Network interface controller|network adapter]] is used with a [[virtual private network]], while a virtual [[Hard disk drive|disk]] device is used with [[iSCSI]]. A good example for virtual device drivers can be [[Daemon Tools]].\n\nThere are several variants of virtual device drivers, such as [[VxD]]s, [[VLM (NetWare)|VLM]]s, and VDDs.\n\n==Open source drivers==\n* [[Free and open-source graphics device driver|Graphics device driver]]\n* Printers: [[CUPS]]\n* RAIDs: CCISS<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://sourceforge.net/projects/cciss/\n| title       = CCISS\n| year        = 2010\n| work        = [[SourceForge]]\n| accessdate  = 2010-08-11\n| quote       = Drivers for the HP (previously Compaq) Smart Array controllers which provide hardware RAID capability.\n}}\n</ref> (Compaq Command Interface for SCSI-3 Support<ref>{{cite web\n |url             = http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246852.pd\n |title           = Abbreviations and acronyms\n |first           = Steve\n |last            = Russell\n |date            = 2003-10-21\n |work            = Server Consolidation with the IBM eserver xSeries 440 and VMware ESX Serve\n |publisher       = IBM International Technical Support Organization\n |page            = 207\n |isbn            = 0-7384-2684-9\n |accessdate      = 2011-08-14\n |display-authors = etal\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>)\n* Scanners: [[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]]\n* Video: [[Vidix]], [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]\n\n[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] descriptions of commonly used device drivers:\n* fas: Fast/wide SCSI controller\n* hme: Fast (10/100 Mbit/s) Ethernet\n* isp: Differential SCSI controllers and the SunSwift card\n* glm: (Gigabaud Link Module<ref>{{cite web\n | title = US Patent 5969841 - Gigabaud link module with received power detect signal\n | url = http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | publisher = PatentStorm LLC\n | accessdate = 2009-09-08\n | quote = An improved Gigabaud Link Module (GLM) is provided for performing bi-directional data transfers between a host device and a serial transfer medium.\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110612215844/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | archive-date = 2011-06-12\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>) UltraSCSI controllers\n* scsi: Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) devices\n* sf: soc+ or social Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FCAL)\n* soc: SPARC Storage Array (SSA) controllers and the control device\n* social: Serial optical controllers for FCAL (soc+)\n\n==APIs==\n* [[Windows Display Driver Model]] (WDDM) \u2013 the graphic display driver architecture for [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], and [[Windows 10]].\n* Unified Audio Model (UAM)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms894071.aspx|title=Unified Audio Model (Windows CE 5.0)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n* [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF)\n* [[Windows Driver Model]] (WDM)\n* [[Network Driver Interface Specification]] (NDIS) \u2013 a standard [[network card]] driver API\n* [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture]] (ALSA) \u2013 {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} the standard Linux sound-driver interface\n* [[Scanner Access Now Easy]] (SANE) \u2013 a public-domain interface to raster-image scanner-hardware\n* [[I/O Kit]] \u2013 an open-source framework from [[Apple Computer|Apple]] for developing [[macOS]] device drivers\n* [[Installable File System]] (IFS) \u2013 a [[filesystem API]] for IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows NT\n* [[Open Data-Link Interface]] (ODI) \u2013 a network card API similar to NDIS\n* [[Uniform Driver Interface]] (UDI) \u2013 a cross-platform driver interface project\n* Dynax Driver Framework (dxd) \u2013 C++ open source cross-platform driver framework for KMDF and IOKit<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dxd.dynax.at/|title=dxd - dynax driver framework: Main Page|website=dxd.dynax.at|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Identifiers==\nA device on the [[Conventional PCI|PCI bus]] or USB is identified by two IDs which consist of 4 [[hexadecimal]] numbers each.

Instead of enabling the guest operating system to dialog with hardware, virtual device drivers take the opposite role and emulates a piece of hardware, so that the guest operating system and its drivers running inside a [[virtual machine]] can have the illusion of accessing real hardware. Attempts by the guest operating system to access the hardware are routed to the virtual device driver in the host operating system as e.g.,&nbsp;[[function call]]s. The virtual device driver can also send simulated processor-level events like [[interrupt]]s into the virtual machine.\n\nVirtual devices may also operate in a non-virtualized environment. For example, a virtual [[Network interface controller|network adapter]] is used with a [[virtual private network]], while a virtual [[Hard disk drive|disk]] device is used with [[iSCSI]]. A good example for virtual device drivers can be [[Daemon Tools]].\n\nThere are several variants of virtual device drivers, such as [[VxD]]s, [[VLM (NetWare)|VLM]]s, and VDDs.\n\n==Open source drivers==\n* [[Free and open-source graphics device driver|Graphics device driver]]\n* Printers: [[CUPS]]\n* RAIDs: CCISS<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://sourceforge.net/projects/cciss/\n| title       = CCISS\n| year        = 2010\n| work        = [[SourceForge]]\n| accessdate  = 2010-08-11\n| quote       = Drivers for the HP (previously Compaq) Smart Array controllers which provide hardware RAID capability.\n}}\n</ref> (Compaq Command Interface for SCSI-3 Support<ref>{{cite web\n |url             = http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246852.pd\n |title           = Abbreviations and acronyms\n |first           = Steve\n |last            = Russell\n |date            = 2003-10-21\n |work            = Server Consolidation with the IBM eserver xSeries 440 and VMware ESX Serve\n |publisher       = IBM International Technical Support Organization\n |page            = 207\n |isbn            = 0-7384-2684-9\n |accessdate      = 2011-08-14\n |display-authors = etal\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>)\n* Scanners: [[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]]\n* Video: [[Vidix]], [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]\n\n[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] descriptions of commonly used device drivers:\n* fas: Fast/wide SCSI controller\n* hme: Fast (10/100 Mbit/s) Ethernet\n* isp: Differential SCSI controllers and the SunSwift card\n* glm: (Gigabaud Link Module<ref>{{cite web\n | title = US Patent 5969841 - Gigabaud link module with received power detect signal\n | url = http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | publisher = PatentStorm LLC\n | accessdate = 2009-09-08\n | quote = An improved Gigabaud Link Module (GLM) is provided for performing bi-directional data transfers between a host device and a serial transfer medium.\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110612215844/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | archive-date = 2011-06-12\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>) UltraSCSI controllers\n* scsi: Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) devices\n* sf: soc+ or social Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FCAL)\n* soc: SPARC Storage Array (SSA) controllers and the control device\n* social: Serial optical controllers for FCAL (soc+)\n\n==APIs==\n* [[Windows Display Driver Model]] (WDDM) \u2013 the graphic display driver architecture for [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], and [[Windows 10]].\n* Unified Audio Model (UAM)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms894071.aspx|title=Unified Audio Model (Windows CE 5.0)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n* [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF)\n* [[Windows Driver Model]] (WDM)\n* [[Network Driver Interface Specification]] (NDIS) \u2013 a standard [[network card]] driver API\n* [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture]] (ALSA) \u2013 {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} the standard Linux sound-driver interface\n* [[Scanner Access Now Easy]] (SANE) \u2013 a public-domain interface to raster-image scanner-hardware\n* [[I/O Kit]] \u2013 an open-source framework from [[Apple Computer|Apple]] for developing [[macOS]] device drivers\n* [[Installable File System]] (IFS) \u2013 a [[filesystem API]] for IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows NT\n* [[Open Data-Link Interface]] (ODI) \u2013 a network card API similar to NDIS\n* [[Uniform Driver Interface]] (UDI) \u2013 a cross-platform driver interface project\n* Dynax Driver Framework (dxd) \u2013 C++ open source cross-platform driver framework for KMDF and IOKit<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dxd.dynax.at/|title=dxd - dynax driver framework: Main Page|website=dxd.dynax.at|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Identifiers==\nA device on the [[Conventional PCI|PCI bus]] or USB is identified by two IDs which consist of 4 [[hexadecimal]] numbers each.
