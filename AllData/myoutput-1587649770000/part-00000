The first MUD, known as [[MUD1]], was released in 1978. The acronym originally stood for Multi-User Dungeon, but later also came to mean Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain.  A MUD is a virtual world with many players interacting in real time.<ref>Mitchell, Don.

Users interact in role-playing or competitive games by typing commands and can read or view descriptions of the world and other players.  Such early worlds began the MUD heritage that eventually led to [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s, more commonly known as MMORPGs, a genre of role-playing games in which a large number of players interact  within a virtual world.\n\nSome prototype virtual worlds were ''[[WorldsAway]]'', a two-dimensional chat environment where users designed their own avatars; ''[[Dreamscape (chat)|Dreamscape]],'' an interactive community featuring a virtual world by [[CompuServe]]; [[Cityspace]], an educational networking and 3D computer graphics project for children; and ''[[The Palace (computer program)|The Palace]]'', a 2-dimensional community driven virtual world.

For example, ''EverQuest'' time passes faster than real-time despite using the same calendar and time units to present game time.\n\nAs ''virtual world'' is a general term, the virtual environment supports varying degrees of play and gaming. Some uses of the term include\n* [[Massively multiplayer online game]]s (MMOGs) games in which a large number of players interact within a virtual world. The concept of MMO has spread to other game types such as sports, real-time strategy and others. The persistence criterion is the only criterion that separates virtual worlds from video games,<ref name=\"Bell2008-virtualworld\"/> meaning that some MMO versions of RTS and FPS games resemble virtual worlds; ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' is a video game that is such a pseudo virtual world. Emerging concepts include basing the terrain of such games on real satellite photos, such as those available through the [[Google Maps]] API or through a simple virtual [[geocaching]] of \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" on [[WikiMapia]] or similar [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mash-ups]], where permitted; these concepts are virtual worlds making use of [[mixed reality]].\n* [[Collaborative virtual environment]]s (CVEs) designed for collaborative work in a virtual environment.\n* Massively multiplayer online real-life games (MMORLGs), also called virtual social worlds,<ref name=\"Kaplan, Andreas M. 2009\">Kaplan, Andreas M.; Haenlein, Michael (2009). \"The fairyland of Second Life: About virtual social worlds and how to use them\".

While the designers have a great deal of control over the economy by the encoded mechanics of trade, it is nonetheless the actions of players that define the economic conditions of a virtual world. The economy arises as a result of the choices that players make under the scarcity of real and virtual resources such as time or currency.<ref name=\"IJMR Article\"/><ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\">{{cite journal |author=Robinson, E.

The choices they make in their interaction with the virtual world, along with the mechanics of trade and wealth acquisition, dictate the relative values of items in the economy. The economy in virtual worlds is typically driven by in-game needs such as equipment, food, or trade goods. Virtual economies like that of [[Second Life]], however, are almost entirely player-produced with very little link to in-game needs. While the relevance of virtual world economics to physical world economics has been questioned, it has been shown the users of virtual worlds respond to economic stimuli (such as the law of supply and demand) in the same way that people do in the physical world.<ref>Castronova, Edward, et al. \"A Test of the Law of Demand in a Virtual World: Exploring the Petri Dish.\" Discoveries in Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations: New Interdisciplinary Applications (2011): 301.</ref> In fact, there are often very direct corollaries between physical world economic decisions and virtual world economic decisions, such as the decision by prisoners of war in World War II to adopt cigarettes as currency and the adoption of Stones of Jordan as currency in ''Diablo II''.<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\"/>\n\nThe value of objects in a virtual economy is usually linked to their usefulness and the difficulty of obtaining them.

Many users seek an escape or a comfort zone in entering these virtual worlds, as well as a sense of acceptance and freedom. Virtual worlds allow users to freely explore many facets of their personalities in ways that are not easily available to them in real life.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Indalecio, Tina. Psychology Today. How Much Of An Individual\u2019s Virtual Identity, Is Really - Real? Exploring Identity in the Virtual World - Is that REALLY you?\n1991\u20132012. Sussex Publishers, LLC. 30 April 2010</ref> However, users may not be able to apply this new information outside of the virtual world. Thus, virtual worlds allow for users to flourish within the world and possibly become addicted to their new virtual life which may create a challenge as far as dealing with others and in emotionally surviving within their real lives. One reason for this freedom of exploration can be attributed to the anonymity that virtual worlds provide. It gives the individual the ability to be free from social norms, family pressures or expectations they may face in their personal real world lives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The avatar persona experiences an experience similar to an escape from reality like drug or alcohol usage for numbing pain or hiding behind it.  The avatar no longer represents a simple tool or mechanism manipulated in cyberspace.  Instead, it has become the individual's bridge between the physical and virtual world, a  conduit through which to express oneself among other social actors.<ref>McCreery, Michael Patrick. UNLV University Libraries. University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Personality, Presence, And The Virtual Self: A Fivefactor Model Approach To Behavioral Analysis Within A Virtual Environment\". 201.</ref> The avatar becomes the person's alter ego; the vehicle to which one utilizes to exist among others who are all seeking the same satisfaction.\n\nWhile greatly facilitating ease of interaction across time and geographic boundaries, the virtual world presents an unreal environment with instant connection and gratification. Online encounters are employed as seemingly fulfilling alternatives to \u201clive person\u201d relationships (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0015485|title=Time out of mind: Dissociation in the virtual world|year=2009|last1=Toronto|first1=Ellen|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=117\u2013133|url=https://www.recoveryonpurpose.com/upload/Time%20out%20of%20Mind%20Dissociation%20in%20the%20Virtual%20World.pdf}}</ref> When one is ashamed, insecure, lost or just looking for something different and stimulating to engage in, virtual worlds are the perfect environment for its users. A person has unlimited access to an infinite array of opportunities to fulfill every fantasy, grant every wish, or satisfy every desire. He or she can face any fear or conquer any enemy, all at the click of a mouse (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\"/> Ultimately, virtual worlds are the place to go when real life becomes overbearing or boring. While in real life individuals hesitate to communicate their true opinions, it is easier to do so online because they don't ever have to meet the people they are talking with (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\"/> Thus, virtual worlds are basically a psychological escape.\n\nAnother area of research related to virtual worlds is the field of navigation. Specifically, this research investigates whether or not virtual environments are adequate learning tools in regards to real-world navigation. Psychologists at Saint Michael's College found that video game experience corresponded with ability to navigate virtual environments and complete objectives; however, that experience did not correlate with an increased ability to navigate real, physical environments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.003|title=Video game experience predicts virtual, but not real navigation performance|year=2011|last1=Richardson|first1=Anthony E.|last2=Powers|first2=Morgan E.|last3=Bousquet|first3=Lauren G.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=27|pages=552\u2013560}}</ref> An extensive study at the University of Washington conducted multiple experiments involving virtual navigation. One experiment had two groups of subjects, the first of which examined maps of a virtual environment, and the second of which navigated the virtual environment. The groups of subjects then completed an objective in the virtual environment. There was little difference between the two groups\u2019 performances, and what difference there was, it was in favor of the map-users. The test subjects, though, were generally unfamiliar with the virtual world interface, likely leading to some impaired navigation, and thus bias in the yielded analysis of the experiments. The study concluded that the interface objects made natural navigation movements impossible, and perhaps less intrusive controls for the virtual environment would reduce the effect of the impairment.<ref>Satalich, Glenna (1995). \"[http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/satalich/ch5.html Navigation and Wayfinding in Virtual Reality: Finding Proper Tools and Cues to Enhance Navigation Awareness] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105102730/http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/satalich/ch5.html |date=January 5, 2013 }}\".

Even those users who do make use of HIDs which provide such features as [[six degrees of freedom]] often have to switch between separate 3D and 2D devices in order to navigate their respectively designed interfaces.\n\nLike video gamers, some users of virtual world clients may also have a difficult experience with the necessity of proper graphics hardware (such as the more advanced [[graphics processing unit]]s distributed by [[Nvidia]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]) for the sake of reducing the frequency of less-than-fluid graphics instances in the navigation of virtual worlds.  However, in part for this reason, a growing number of virtual world engines, especially serving children, are entirely browser-based requiring no software down loads or specialized computer hardware.  The first virtual world of this kind was [[Whyville]].net, launched in 1999,<ref name=\"Routledge\"/> built by [[Numedeon]] inc. which obtained an early patent for its browser-based implementation.<ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=8402097B2|title=Determining a manner in which user interface commands are processed in an instant messaging environment|status=patent|gdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Application domains==\n[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|right|A film made in [[Second Life]] using [[machinima]].]]\n\n===Social===\n{{more citations needed section |date=April 2008}}\nAlthough the social interactions of participants in virtual worlds are often viewed in the context of 3D Games, other forms of interaction are common as well, including forums, blogs, wikis, chatrooms, instant messaging, and video-conferences.  Communities are born in places which have their own rules, topics, jokes, and even language. Members of such communities can find like-minded people to interact with, whether this be through a shared passion, the wish to share information, or a desire to meet new people and experience new things. Users may develop personalities within the community adapted to the particular world they are interacting with, which can impact the way they think and act. Internet friendships and participation online communities tend to complement existing friendships and civic participation rather than replacing or diminishing such interactions.<ref>Schroeder, Ralph (1999).

They may also be able to socialize, form friendships and relationships much more easily and avoid the stigma and other obstacles which would normally be attached to their disabilities. This can be much more constructive, emotionally satisfying and mentally fulfilling than passive pastimes such as television watching, playing computer games, reading or more conventional types of internet use.{{Citation needed|reason=This is just a very strong (and general) claim not supported by next paragraph's citation|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe [[Starlight Children's Foundation]] helps hospitalized children (suffering from painful diseases or [[autism]] for example) to create a comfortable and safe environment which can expand their situation, experience interactions (when the involvement of a multiple cultures and players from around the world is factored in) they may not have been able to experience without a virtual world, healthy or sick.

For example, in [[World of Warcraft]], /dance is the emote for a dance move which a player in the virtual world can \"emote\" quite simply.  And a familiarization with said or similar \"emotes\" or social skills (such as, encouragement, gratitude, problem-solving, and even kissing) in the virtual world via avatar can make the assimilation to similar forms of expression, socialization, interaction in real life smooth.  Interaction with humans through avatars in the virtual world has potential to seriously expand the mechanics of one's interaction with real-life interactions.{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''Commercial'''\n\nAs businesses compete in the real world, they also compete in virtual worlds. As there has been an increase in the buying and selling of products online (e-commerce) this twinned with the rise in the popularity of the internet, has forced businesses to adjust to accommodate the new market.\n\nMany companies and organizations now incorporate virtual worlds as a new form of advertising. There are many advantages to using these methods of commercialization. An example of this would be Apple creating an online store within Second Life. This allows the users to browse the latest and innovative products. Players cannot actually purchase a product but having these \u201cvirtual stores\u201d is a way of accessing a different clientele and customer demographic. The use of advertising within \"virtual worlds\" is a relatively new idea. This is because Virtual Worlds is a relatively new technology. Before companies would use an advertising company to promote their products. With the introduction of the prospect of commercial success within a Virtual World, companies can reduce cost and time constraints by keeping this \"in-house\". An obvious advantage is that it will reduce any costs and restrictions that could come into play in the real world.\n\nUsing virtual worlds gives companies the opportunity to gauge customer reaction and receive feedback.  Feedback can be crucial to the development of a project as it will inform the creators exactly what users want.<ref name=\"Wasko 2011\">{{cite journal\n |last        = Wasko\n |first       = Molly\n |last2       = Teigland\n |first2      = Robin\n |last3       = Leidner\n |first3      = Dorothy\n |last4       = Jarvenpaa\n |first4      = Sirkka\n |year        = 2011\n |title       = Stepping into the Internet: New Ventures in Virtual Worlds\n |journal     = MIS Quarterly\n |volume      = 35\n |issue       = 3\n |pages = 645\n |url         = http://nordicworlds.net/PPublic/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/MISQ-SI-on-VWs_intro1.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132301/http://nordicworlds.net/PPublic/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/MISQ-SI-on-VWs_intro1.pdf\n |archivedate = 2012-04-25\n|doi = 10.2307/23042801\n |jstor = 23042801\n }}</ref>\n\nUsing virtual worlds as a tool allows companies to test user reaction and give them feedback on products. This can be crucial as it will give the companies an insight as to what the market and customers want from new products, which can give them a competitive edge. Competitive edge is crucial in the ruthless world that is today's business.\n\nAnother use of virtual worlds business is where players can create a gathering place. Many businesses can now be involved in business-to-business commercial activity and will create a specific area within a virtual world to carry out their business. Within this space all relevant information can be held. This can be useful for a variety of reasons. Players can conduct business with companies on the other side of the world, so there are no geographical limitations, it can increase company productivity. Knowing that there is an area where help is on hand can aid the employees. Sun Microsystems have created an island in Second Life dedicated for the sole use of their employees. This is a place where people can go and seek help, exchange new ideas or to advertise a new product.\n\nAccording to trade media company Virtual Worlds Management,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com |title=The leading virtual worlds trade media company. in New York |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> commercial investments in the \"virtual worlds\" sector were in excess of US$425 million in Q4 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2007/q4.html |title=Virtual Worlds Management |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> and totaled US$184 million in Q1 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2008/q1.html |title=Virtual Worlds Management |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>  However, the selection process for defining a \"virtual worlds\" company in this context has been challenged by one industry blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsinmotion.biz/2008/04/analysis_virtual_worlds_and_in.php |title=Worlds In Motion - Analysis: Virtual Worlds And Investment, Q1 2008 |publisher=Worldsinmotion.biz |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>\n\n====E-commerce (legal)====\nA number of virtual worlds have incorporated systems for sale of goods through virtual interfaces and using virtual currencies. Transfers of in-world credits typically are not bound by laws governing commerce. Such transactions may lack the oversight and protections associated with real-world commerce, and there is potential for fraudulent transactions. One example is that of [[Ginko Financial]], a bank system featured in [[Second Life]] where avatars could deposit their real life currency after converted to [[Economy of Second Life|Linden Dollars]] for a profit. In July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM's in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money. After a few days the ATM's along with the banks disappeared altogether. Around $700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life. An investigation was launched but nothing substantial ever came of finding and punishing the avatar known as Nicholas Portocarrero who was the head of [[Ginko Financial]].<ref>Talbot, David.

Virtual Worlds such as ''[[Eve Online]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]'' also have people and systems that govern them.<ref name=\"Haskins\">Haskins, Walaika (July 31, 2008), [http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/64002.html Who polices Virtual Worlds?] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\nProviders of online virtual spaces have more than one approach to the governing of their environments. ''[[Second Life]]'' for instance was designed with the expectation being on the residents to establish their own community rules for appropriate behaviour. On the other hand, some virtual worlds such as ''[[Habbo]]'' enforce clear rules for behaviour,<ref name=\"Haskins\"/> as seen in their terms and conditions.<ref>Habbo Hotel (blog), [http://blog.habbo.com/house-rules/ Habbo Hotel House Rules] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\nIn some instances virtual worlds don't need established rules of conduct because actions such as \u2018killing\u2019 another avatar is impossible. However, if needed to, rule breakers can be punished with fines being payable through their virtual bank account, alternatively a players suspension may be put into effect.<ref name=\"Haskins\"/>\n\nInstances of real world theft from a virtual world do exist, Eve Online had an incident where a bank controller stole around 200bn credits and exchanged them for real world cash amounting to \u00a33,115.<ref>BBC (July 3, 2009), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8132547.stm Billions stolen in online robbery] Access date: February 2013.</ref> The player in question has now been suspended as trading in-game cash for real money is against Eve Online's terms and conditions.<ref>Stockley, Mark (October 1, 2009), [http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2009/10/01/guest-blog-polices-crime-virtual-world/ Who polices crime in a virtual world?] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\n{{See also|MMOG}}\nThere are many [[MMORPG]] virtual worlds out on many platforms. Most notable are [[IMVU]] for Windows, [[PlayStation Home]] for [[PlayStation 3]], and Second Life for Windows.\nMany Virtual worlds have shut down since launch however. Notable shutdowns are The Sims Online, The Sims Bustin Out Online Weekend Mode,    PlayStation Home, and Club Penguin.\n\n====Single-player games====\n\nSome [[single-player video game]]s contain virtual worlds populated by [[non-player character]]s (NPC). Many of these allow players to save the current state of this world instance to allow stopping and restarting the virtual world at a later date. (This can be done with some multiplayer environments as well.)\n\nThe virtual worlds found in [[video game]]s are often split into discrete [[level (video gaming)|levels]].\n\nSingle-player games such as ''[[Minecraft]]'' allow players to optionally create their own world without other players, and then combine skills from the game to work together with other players and create bigger and more intricate environments. These environments can then be accessed by other players, if the [[server (computing)|server]] is available to other players then they may be able to modify parts of it, such as the structure of the environment.\n\nAt one level, a more or less realistic rendered 3D space like the game world of ''[[Halo 3]]'' or ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' is just as much a big database as Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia.\n\n==Use in education==\n{{See also |Virtual learning environment |Online communication between school and home}}\n\nVirtual worlds represent a powerful new medium for instruction and education that presents many opportunities but also some challenges.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n | last=Kluge | first=Stacy\n | last2=Riley| first2=Elizabeth\n | title=Teaching in Virtual Worlds: Opportunities and Challenges\n | year=2008\n | journal=Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology\n | volume=5\n | pages=127\u2013135\n | url=http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2008/IISITv5p127-135Kluge459.pdf\n | ref=harv\n | doi=10.28945/1000\n }}\n</ref> Persistence allows for continuing and growing social interactions, which themselves can serve as a basis for collaborative education. The use of virtual worlds can give teachers the opportunity to have a greater level of student participation. It allows users to be able to carry out tasks that could be difficult in the real world due to constraints and restrictions, such as cost, scheduling or location. Virtual worlds have the capability to adapt and grow to different user needs, for example, classroom teachers are able to use virtual worlds in their classroom leveraging their [[interactive whiteboard]] with the [[Open-source software|open-source]] project [[Edusim]]. They can be a good source of user feedback, the typical paper-based resources have limitations that Virtual Worlds can overcome.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Learning in a Virtual World for Real Life|doi = 10.13140/rg.2.1.5029.3602|last1 = Jon|first1 = Allan|last2 = MacCreadie|first2 = Alex|last3 = MacCreadie|first3 = Tracey|year = 2010|publisher = Unpublished}}</ref>\n\nMulti-user virtual worlds with easy-to-use affordances for building are useful in project-based learning. For example, Active Worlds is used to support classroom teachers in Virginia Beach City Public Schools, the out-of-school NASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge, and many after school and in school programs in EDUni-NY. Projects range from tightly scaffolded reflection spaces to open building based on student-centered designs. New York Museums AMNH and NYSci have used the medium to support STEM learning experiences for their program participants.\n\nVirtual worlds can also be used with [[virtual learning environment]]s, as in the case of what is done in the Sloodle project, which aims to merge [[Second Life]] with [[Moodle]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last=Livingstone | first=D.\n | last2=Kemp | first2=J.\n | year=\n | title=Integrating Web-Based and 3D Learning Environments: Second Life Meets Moodle\n | journal= UPGRADE (European Journal for the Informatics Professional)\n | volume=9 | issue=3\n | pages=8\u201314\n | url=http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/2008-III-sowe.pdf\n | ref=harv\n}} \n</ref>\n\nVirtual worlds allow users with specific needs and requirements to access and use the same learning materials from home as they would receive if they were physically present. Virtual worlds can help users stay up to date with relevant information and needs while also feeling as they are involved. Having the option to be able to attend a presentation via a virtual world from home or from their workplace, can help the user to be more at ease and comfortable.  Although virtual worlds are used as an alternative method of communicating and interacting with students and teachers, a sense of isolation can occur such as losing certain body language cues and other more personal aspects that one would achieve if they were face to face.\n\nSome virtual worlds also offer an environment where simulation-based activities and games allow users to experiment various phenomenon and learn the underlying physics and principles. An example is [[Whyville]] launched in 1999,<ref name=\"Richard Lee Colvin\"/> which targets kids and teenagers, offering  them many opportunities to experiment, understand and learn. Topics covered in [[Whyville]] vary from physics to nutrition to ecology. Whyville also has a strong entrepreneurial structure based on user created virtual content sold in the internal virtual economy.\n\nSome multi-user virtual worlds have become used for educational purposes and are thus called Multi-User Virtual Learning Environments (MUVLEs). Examples have included the use of [[Second Life]] for teaching English as a foreign languages (EFL)<ref>Par Janusz Arabski, Adam Wojtaszek (2011). The Acquisition of L2 Phonology.

The initial game could only be played on an [[Imlac PDS-1|Imlac]], as it was specifically designed for this type of computer.\n\nThe first virtual worlds presented on the [[Internet]] were communities and [[chat room]]s, some of which evolved into [[MUD]]s and [[MUSH]]es. The first MUD, known as [[MUD1]], was released in 1978. The acronym originally stood for Multi-User Dungeon, but later also came to mean Multi-User Dimension and Multi-User Domain.

Users interact in role-playing or competitive games by typing commands and can read or view descriptions of the world and other players.

For example, ''EverQuest'' time passes faster than real-time despite using the same calendar and time units to present game time.\n\nAs ''virtual world'' is a general term, the virtual environment supports varying degrees of play and gaming. Some uses of the term include\n* [[Massively multiplayer online game]]s (MMOGs) games in which a large number of players interact within a virtual world. The concept of MMO has spread to other game types such as sports, real-time strategy and others. The persistence criterion is the only criterion that separates virtual worlds from video games,<ref name=\"Bell2008-virtualworld\"/> meaning that some MMO versions of RTS and FPS games resemble virtual worlds; ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'' is a video game that is such a pseudo virtual world. Emerging concepts include basing the terrain of such games on real satellite photos, such as those available through the [[Google Maps]] API or through a simple virtual [[geocaching]] of \"[[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]\" on [[WikiMapia]] or similar [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mash-ups]], where permitted; these concepts are virtual worlds making use of [[mixed reality]].\n* [[Collaborative virtual environment]]s (CVEs) designed for collaborative work in a virtual environment.\n* Massively multiplayer online real-life games (MMORLGs), also called virtual social worlds,<ref name=\"Kaplan, Andreas M. 2009\">Kaplan, Andreas M.; Haenlein, Michael (2009). \"The fairyland of Second Life: About virtual social worlds and how to use them\".

While the designers have a great deal of control over the economy by the encoded mechanics of trade, it is nonetheless the actions of players that define the economic conditions of a virtual world. The economy arises as a result of the choices that players make under the scarcity of real and virtual resources such as time or currency.<ref name=\"IJMR Article\"/><ref name=autogenerated1 />{{Clarify|date=March 2008}}<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\">{{cite journal |author=Robinson, E.

The choices they make in their interaction with the virtual world, along with the mechanics of trade and wealth acquisition, dictate the relative values of items in the economy. The economy in virtual worlds is typically driven by in-game needs such as equipment, food, or trade goods. Virtual economies like that of [[Second Life]], however, are almost entirely player-produced with very little link to in-game needs. While the relevance of virtual world economics to physical world economics has been questioned, it has been shown the users of virtual worlds respond to economic stimuli (such as the law of supply and demand) in the same way that people do in the physical world.<ref>Castronova, Edward, et al. \"A Test of the Law of Demand in a Virtual World: Exploring the Petri Dish.\" Discoveries in Gaming and Computer-Mediated Simulations: New Interdisciplinary Applications (2011): 301.</ref> In fact, there are often very direct corollaries between physical world economic decisions and virtual world economic decisions, such as the decision by prisoners of war in World War II to adopt cigarettes as currency and the adoption of Stones of Jordan as currency in ''Diablo II''.<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\"/>\n\nThe value of objects in a virtual economy is usually linked to their usefulness and the difficulty of obtaining them.

Special websites such as [[GamerDNA]], [[Koinup]] and others which serve as social networks for virtual worlds users are facing some crucial issues as the DataPortability of [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]s across many virtual worlds and MMORPGs.<ref>Brady Forrest, [http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/12/post-2.html/ \"Wow and Cottage Industries\"]{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, O'Really Radar, December 4, 2006</ref>\n\nVirtual worlds offer advertisers the potential for virtual advertisements, such as the [[in-game advertising]] already found in a number of video games.\n\n===Geography===\nThe geography of virtual worlds can vary widely because the role of geography and space is an important design component over which the developers of virtual worlds have control and may choose to alter.<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\"/> Virtual worlds are, at least superficially, digital instantiations of three-dimensional space. As a result, considerations of geography in virtual worlds (such as World of Warcraft) often revolve around \u201cspatial narratives\u201d in which players act out a nomadic hero's journey along the lines of that present in ''The Odyssey''.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1555412006292618|title=Blood Scythes, Festivals, Quests, and Backstories|year=2006|last1=Krzywinska|first1=Tanya|journal=Games and Culture|volume=1|issue=4|pages=383\u2013396}}</ref> The creation of fantastic places is also a reoccurring theme in the geographic study of virtual worlds, although, perhaps counterintuitively, the heaviest users of virtual worlds often downgrade the sensory stimuli of the world's fantastic places in order to make themselves more efficient at core tasks in the world, such as killing monsters.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1353/anq.0.0110|title=Being in the World (of Warcraft): Raiding, Realism, and Knowledge Production in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game|year=2010|last1=Golub|first1=Alex|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=83|pages=17\u201345}}</ref> However, the geographic component of some worlds may only be a geographic veneer atop an otherwise nonspatial core structure.<ref name=\"journals.tdl.org\"/> For instance, while imposing geographic constraints upon users when they quest for items, these constraints may be removed when they sell items in a geographically unconstrained auction house.

The [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] for example have funded research into virtual worlds including, for example, how preteens explore and share information about reproductive health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spotlight.macfound.org/main/entry/thomas_kafai_tweens_reproductive_health_virtual_worlds/#When:14:03:00Z|title=Thomas & Kafai: Tweens and Reproductive Health in Virtual Worlds, 2008-08-09|accessdate=1 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623030550/http://spotlight.macfound.org/main/entry/thomas_kafai_tweens_reproductive_health_virtual_worlds#When:14:03:00Z|archive-date=23 June 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  A larger set of studies on children's social and political use of the virtual world [[Whyville]].net has also been published in the book \"Connected Play: Tweens in a Virtual World\"  Authored by Yasmin B. Kafai, Deborah A. Fields, and Mizuko Ito.<ref>{{cite book|title=Connected Play: Tweens in a Virtual World (The John D and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning). |publisher=MIT Press }}</ref>  Several other research publications now specifically address the use of virtual worlds for education.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nOther research focused more on adults explores the reasons for indulging and the emotions of virtual world users. Many users seek an escape or a comfort zone in entering these virtual worlds, as well as a sense of acceptance and freedom. Virtual worlds allow users to freely explore many facets of their personalities in ways that are not easily available to them in real life.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Indalecio, Tina. Psychology Today. How Much Of An Individual\u2019s Virtual Identity, Is Really - Real? Exploring Identity in the Virtual World - Is that REALLY you?\n1991\u20132012. Sussex Publishers, LLC. 30 April 2010</ref> However, users may not be able to apply this new information outside of the virtual world. Thus, virtual worlds allow for users to flourish within the world and possibly become addicted to their new virtual life which may create a challenge as far as dealing with others and in emotionally surviving within their real lives. One reason for this freedom of exploration can be attributed to the anonymity that virtual worlds provide. It gives the individual the ability to be free from social norms, family pressures or expectations they may face in their personal real world lives.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The avatar persona experiences an experience similar to an escape from reality like drug or alcohol usage for numbing pain or hiding behind it.  The avatar no longer represents a simple tool or mechanism manipulated in cyberspace.  Instead, it has become the individual's bridge between the physical and virtual world, a  conduit through which to express oneself among other social actors.<ref>McCreery, Michael Patrick. UNLV University Libraries. University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Personality, Presence, And The Virtual Self: A Fivefactor Model Approach To Behavioral Analysis Within A Virtual Environment\". 201.</ref> The avatar becomes the person's alter ego; the vehicle to which one utilizes to exist among others who are all seeking the same satisfaction.\n\nWhile greatly facilitating ease of interaction across time and geographic boundaries, the virtual world presents an unreal environment with instant connection and gratification. Online encounters are employed as seemingly fulfilling alternatives to \u201clive person\u201d relationships (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0015485|title=Time out of mind: Dissociation in the virtual world|year=2009|last1=Toronto|first1=Ellen|journal=Psychoanalytic Psychology|volume=26|issue=2|pages=117\u2013133|url=https://www.recoveryonpurpose.com/upload/Time%20out%20of%20Mind%20Dissociation%20in%20the%20Virtual%20World.pdf}}</ref> When one is ashamed, insecure, lost or just looking for something different and stimulating to engage in, virtual worlds are the perfect environment for its users. A person has unlimited access to an infinite array of opportunities to fulfill every fantasy, grant every wish, or satisfy every desire. He or she can face any fear or conquer any enemy, all at the click of a mouse (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\"/> Ultimately, virtual worlds are the place to go when real life becomes overbearing or boring. While in real life individuals hesitate to communicate their true opinions, it is easier to do so online because they don't ever have to meet the people they are talking with (Toronto, 2009).<ref name=\"Toronto, Ellen 2009\"/> Thus, virtual worlds are basically a psychological escape.\n\nAnother area of research related to virtual worlds is the field of navigation. Specifically, this research investigates whether or not virtual environments are adequate learning tools in regards to real-world navigation. Psychologists at Saint Michael's College found that video game experience corresponded with ability to navigate virtual environments and complete objectives; however, that experience did not correlate with an increased ability to navigate real, physical environments.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.003|title=Video game experience predicts virtual, but not real navigation performance|year=2011|last1=Richardson|first1=Anthony E.|last2=Powers|first2=Morgan E.|last3=Bousquet|first3=Lauren G.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=27|pages=552\u2013560}}</ref> An extensive study at the University of Washington conducted multiple experiments involving virtual navigation. One experiment had two groups of subjects, the first of which examined maps of a virtual environment, and the second of which navigated the virtual environment. The groups of subjects then completed an objective in the virtual environment. There was little difference between the two groups\u2019 performances, and what difference there was, it was in favor of the map-users. The test subjects, though, were generally unfamiliar with the virtual world interface, likely leading to some impaired navigation, and thus bias in the yielded analysis of the experiments. The study concluded that the interface objects made natural navigation movements impossible, and perhaps less intrusive controls for the virtual environment would reduce the effect of the impairment.<ref>Satalich, Glenna (1995). \"[http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/satalich/ch5.html Navigation and Wayfinding in Virtual Reality: Finding Proper Tools and Cues to Enhance Navigation Awareness] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105102730/http://www.hitl.washington.edu/publications/satalich/ch5.html |date=January 5, 2013 }}\".

University of Washington, USA.</ref>\n\n==Hardware==\nUnlike most video games, which are usually navigated using various free-ranging [[human interface device]]s (HIDs), virtual worlds are usually navigated (as of 2009) using HIDs which are designed and oriented around flat, 2-dimensional [[graphical user interface]]s; as most comparatively inexpensive computer [[mouse (computing)|mice]] are manufactured and distributed for 2-dimensional UI navigation, the lack of 3D-capable HID usage among most virtual world users is likely due to both the lack of penetration of 3D-capable devices into non-niche, non-gaming markets as well as the generally higher pricing of such devices compared to 2-dimensional HIDs. Even those users who do make use of HIDs which provide such features as [[six degrees of freedom]] often have to switch between separate 3D and 2D devices in order to navigate their respectively designed interfaces.\n\nLike video gamers, some users of virtual world clients may also have a difficult experience with the necessity of proper graphics hardware (such as the more advanced [[graphics processing unit]]s distributed by [[Nvidia]] and [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]) for the sake of reducing the frequency of less-than-fluid graphics instances in the navigation of virtual worlds.  However, in part for this reason, a growing number of virtual world engines, especially serving children, are entirely browser-based requiring no software down loads or specialized computer hardware.  The first virtual world of this kind was [[Whyville]].net, launched in 1999,<ref name=\"Routledge\"/> built by [[Numedeon]] inc. which obtained an early patent for its browser-based implementation.<ref>{{cite patent|country=US|number=8402097B2|title=Determining a manner in which user interface commands are processed in an instant messaging environment|status=patent|gdate=2013-03-19}}</ref>\n\n==Application domains==\n[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|right|A film made in [[Second Life]] using [[machinima]].]]\n\n===Social===\n{{more citations needed section |date=April 2008}}\nAlthough the social interactions of participants in virtual worlds are often viewed in the context of 3D Games, other forms of interaction are common as well, including forums, blogs, wikis, chatrooms, instant messaging, and video-conferences.  Communities are born in places which have their own rules, topics, jokes, and even language. Members of such communities can find like-minded people to interact with, whether this be through a shared passion, the wish to share information, or a desire to meet new people and experience new things. Users may develop personalities within the community adapted to the particular world they are interacting with, which can impact the way they think and act. Internet friendships and participation online communities tend to complement existing friendships and civic participation rather than replacing or diminishing such interactions.<ref>Schroeder, Ralph (1999).

They may also be able to socialize, form friendships and relationships much more easily and avoid the stigma and other obstacles which would normally be attached to their disabilities. This can be much more constructive, emotionally satisfying and mentally fulfilling than passive pastimes such as television watching, playing computer games, reading or more conventional types of internet use.{{Citation needed|reason=This is just a very strong (and general) claim not supported by next paragraph's citation|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe [[Starlight Children's Foundation]] helps hospitalized children (suffering from painful diseases or [[autism]] for example) to create a comfortable and safe environment which can expand their situation, experience interactions (when the involvement of a multiple cultures and players from around the world is factored in) they may not have been able to experience without a virtual world, healthy or sick.  Virtual worlds also enable them to experience and act beyond the restrictions of their illness and help to relieve stress.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last=UT Dallas\n | date=November 18, 2007\n | title=Avatars Help Asperger Syndrome Patients Learn to Play the Game of Life\n | url=http://www.utdallas.edu/news/2007/11/18-003.html\n | ref=harv\n }}\n</ref>\n\nVirtual worlds can help players become more familiar and comfortable with actions they may in real-life feel reluctant or embarrassed.  For example, in [[World of Warcraft]], /dance is the emote for a dance move which a player in the virtual world can \"emote\" quite simply.  And a familiarization with said or similar \"emotes\" or social skills (such as, encouragement, gratitude, problem-solving, and even kissing) in the virtual world via avatar can make the assimilation to similar forms of expression, socialization, interaction in real life smooth.  Interaction with humans through avatars in the virtual world has potential to seriously expand the mechanics of one's interaction with real-life interactions.{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''Commercial'''\n\nAs businesses compete in the real world, they also compete in virtual worlds. As there has been an increase in the buying and selling of products online (e-commerce) this twinned with the rise in the popularity of the internet, has forced businesses to adjust to accommodate the new market.\n\nMany companies and organizations now incorporate virtual worlds as a new form of advertising. There are many advantages to using these methods of commercialization. An example of this would be Apple creating an online store within Second Life. This allows the users to browse the latest and innovative products. Players cannot actually purchase a product but having these \u201cvirtual stores\u201d is a way of accessing a different clientele and customer demographic. The use of advertising within \"virtual worlds\" is a relatively new idea. This is because Virtual Worlds is a relatively new technology. Before companies would use an advertising company to promote their products. With the introduction of the prospect of commercial success within a Virtual World, companies can reduce cost and time constraints by keeping this \"in-house\". An obvious advantage is that it will reduce any costs and restrictions that could come into play in the real world.\n\nUsing virtual worlds gives companies the opportunity to gauge customer reaction and receive feedback.  Feedback can be crucial to the development of a project as it will inform the creators exactly what users want.<ref name=\"Wasko 2011\">{{cite journal\n |last        = Wasko\n |first       = Molly\n |last2       = Teigland\n |first2      = Robin\n |last3       = Leidner\n |first3      = Dorothy\n |last4       = Jarvenpaa\n |first4      = Sirkka\n |year        = 2011\n |title       = Stepping into the Internet: New Ventures in Virtual Worlds\n |journal     = MIS Quarterly\n |volume      = 35\n |issue       = 3\n |pages = 645\n |url         = http://nordicworlds.net/PPublic/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/MISQ-SI-on-VWs_intro1.pdf\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425132301/http://nordicworlds.net/PPublic/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/MISQ-SI-on-VWs_intro1.pdf\n |archivedate = 2012-04-25\n|doi = 10.2307/23042801\n |jstor = 23042801\n }}</ref>\n\nUsing virtual worlds as a tool allows companies to test user reaction and give them feedback on products. This can be crucial as it will give the companies an insight as to what the market and customers want from new products, which can give them a competitive edge. Competitive edge is crucial in the ruthless world that is today's business.\n\nAnother use of virtual worlds business is where players can create a gathering place. Many businesses can now be involved in business-to-business commercial activity and will create a specific area within a virtual world to carry out their business. Within this space all relevant information can be held. This can be useful for a variety of reasons. Players can conduct business with companies on the other side of the world, so there are no geographical limitations, it can increase company productivity. Knowing that there is an area where help is on hand can aid the employees. Sun Microsystems have created an island in Second Life dedicated for the sole use of their employees. This is a place where people can go and seek help, exchange new ideas or to advertise a new product.\n\nAccording to trade media company Virtual Worlds Management,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com |title=The leading virtual worlds trade media company. in New York |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> commercial investments in the \"virtual worlds\" sector were in excess of US$425 million in Q4 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2007/q4.html |title=Virtual Worlds Management |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref> and totaled US$184 million in Q1 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualworldsmanagement.com/2008/q1.html |title=Virtual Worlds Management |publisher=Virtual Worlds Management |date=2008-04-22 |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>  However, the selection process for defining a \"virtual worlds\" company in this context has been challenged by one industry blog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsinmotion.biz/2008/04/analysis_virtual_worlds_and_in.php |title=Worlds In Motion - Analysis: Virtual Worlds And Investment, Q1 2008 |publisher=Worldsinmotion.biz |date= |accessdate=2012-07-29}}</ref>\n\n====E-commerce (legal)====\nA number of virtual worlds have incorporated systems for sale of goods through virtual interfaces and using virtual currencies. Transfers of in-world credits typically are not bound by laws governing commerce. Such transactions may lack the oversight and protections associated with real-world commerce, and there is potential for fraudulent transactions. One example is that of [[Ginko Financial]], a bank system featured in [[Second Life]] where avatars could deposit their real life currency after converted to [[Economy of Second Life|Linden Dollars]] for a profit. In July 2007, residents of Second Life crowded around the ATM's in an unsuccessful attempt to withdraw their money. After a few days the ATM's along with the banks disappeared altogether. Around $700,000 in real world money was reported missing from residents in Second Life. An investigation was launched but nothing substantial ever came of finding and punishing the avatar known as Nicholas Portocarrero who was the head of [[Ginko Financial]].<ref>Talbot, David.

Virtual Worlds such as ''[[Eve Online]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]'' also have people and systems that govern them.<ref name=\"Haskins\">Haskins, Walaika (July 31, 2008), [http://www.linuxinsider.com/story/64002.html Who polices Virtual Worlds?] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\nProviders of online virtual spaces have more than one approach to the governing of their environments. ''[[Second Life]]'' for instance was designed with the expectation being on the residents to establish their own community rules for appropriate behaviour. On the other hand, some virtual worlds such as ''[[Habbo]]'' enforce clear rules for behaviour,<ref name=\"Haskins\"/> as seen in their terms and conditions.<ref>Habbo Hotel (blog), [http://blog.habbo.com/house-rules/ Habbo Hotel House Rules] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\nIn some instances virtual worlds don't need established rules of conduct because actions such as \u2018killing\u2019 another avatar is impossible. However, if needed to, rule breakers can be punished with fines being payable through their virtual bank account, alternatively a players suspension may be put into effect.<ref name=\"Haskins\"/>\n\nInstances of real world theft from a virtual world do exist, Eve Online had an incident where a bank controller stole around 200bn credits and exchanged them for real world cash amounting to \u00a33,115.<ref>BBC (July 3, 2009), [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8132547.stm Billions stolen in online robbery] Access date: February 2013.</ref> The player in question has now been suspended as trading in-game cash for real money is against Eve Online's terms and conditions.<ref>Stockley, Mark (October 1, 2009), [http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2009/10/01/guest-blog-polices-crime-virtual-world/ Who polices crime in a virtual world?] Access date: February 2013.</ref>\n\n===Entertainment===\n{{See also|MMOG}}\nThere are many [[MMORPG]] virtual worlds out on many platforms. Most notable are IMVU for Windows, [[PlayStation Home]] for [[PlayStation 3]], and Second Life for Windows.\nMany Virtual worlds have shut down since launch however. Notable shutdowns are The Sims Online, The Sims Bustin Out Online Weekend Mode,    PlayStation Home, and Club Penguin.\n\n====Single-player games====\n\nSome [[single-player video game]]s contain virtual worlds populated by [[non-player character]]s (NPC). Many of these allow players to save the current state of this world instance to allow stopping and restarting the virtual world at a later date. (This can be done with some multiplayer environments as well.)\n\nThe virtual worlds found in [[video game]]s are often split into discrete [[level (video gaming)|levels]].\n\nSingle-player games such as ''[[Minecraft]]'' allow players to optionally create their own world without other players, and then combine skills from the game to work together with other players and create bigger and more intricate environments. These environments can then be accessed by other players, if the [[server (computing)|server]] is available to other players then they may be able to modify parts of it, such as the structure of the environment.\n\nAt one level, a more or less realistic rendered 3D space like the game world of ''[[Halo 3]]'' or ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' is just as much a big database as Microsoft's Encarta encyclopedia.\n\n==Use in education==\n{{See also |Virtual learning environment |Online communication between school and home}}\n\nVirtual worlds represent a powerful new medium for instruction and education that presents many opportunities but also some challenges.<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n | last=Kluge | first=Stacy\n | last2=Riley| first2=Elizabeth\n | title=Teaching in Virtual Worlds: Opportunities and Challenges\n | year=2008\n | journal=Issues in Informing Science and Information Technology\n | volume=5\n | pages=127\u2013135\n | url=http://proceedings.informingscience.org/InSITE2008/IISITv5p127-135Kluge459.pdf\n | ref=harv\n | doi=10.28945/1000\n }}\n</ref> Persistence allows for continuing and growing social interactions, which themselves can serve as a basis for collaborative education. The use of virtual worlds can give teachers the opportunity to have a greater level of student participation. It allows users to be able to carry out tasks that could be difficult in the real world due to constraints and restrictions, such as cost, scheduling or location. Virtual worlds have the capability to adapt and grow to different user needs, for example, classroom teachers are able to use virtual worlds in their classroom leveraging their [[interactive whiteboard]] with the [[Open-source software|open-source]] project [[Edusim]]. They can be a good source of user feedback, the typical paper-based resources have limitations that Virtual Worlds can overcome.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title = Learning in a Virtual World for Real Life|doi = 10.13140/rg.2.1.5029.3602|last1 = Jon|first1 = Allan|last2 = MacCreadie|first2 = Alex|last3 = MacCreadie|first3 = Tracey|year = 2010|publisher = Unpublished}}</ref>\n\nMulti-user virtual worlds with easy-to-use affordances for building are useful in project-based learning. For example, Active Worlds is used to support classroom teachers in Virginia Beach City Public Schools, the out-of-school NASA RealWorld-InWorld Engineering Design Challenge, and many after school and in school programs in EDUni-NY. Projects range from tightly scaffolded reflection spaces to open building based on student-centered designs. New York Museums AMNH and NYSci have used the medium to support STEM learning experiences for their program participants.\n\nVirtual worlds can also be used with [[virtual learning environment]]s, as in the case of what is done in the Sloodle project, which aims to merge [[Second Life]] with [[Moodle]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>\n{{cite journal\n | last=Livingstone | first=D.\n | last2=Kemp | first2=J.\n | year=\n | title=Integrating Web-Based and 3D Learning Environments: Second Life Meets Moodle\n | journal= UPGRADE (European Journal for the Informatics Professional)\n | volume=9 | issue=3\n | pages=8\u201314\n | url=http://www.cepis.org/upgrade/files/2008-III-sowe.pdf\n | ref=harv\n}} \n</ref>\n\nVirtual worlds allow users with specific needs and requirements to access and use the same learning materials from home as they would receive if they were physically present. Virtual worlds can help users stay up to date with relevant information and needs while also feeling as they are involved. Having the option to be able to attend a presentation via a virtual world from home or from their workplace, can help the user to be more at ease and comfortable.  Although virtual worlds are used as an alternative method of communicating and interacting with students and teachers, a sense of isolation can occur such as losing certain body language cues and other more personal aspects that one would achieve if they were face to face.\n\nSome virtual worlds also offer an environment where simulation-based activities and games allow users to experiment various phenomenon and learn the underlying physics and principles. An example is [[Whyville]] launched in 1999,<ref name=\"Richard Lee Colvin\"/> which targets kids and teenagers, offering  them many opportunities to experiment, understand and learn. Topics covered in [[Whyville]] vary from physics to nutrition to ecology. Whyville also has a strong entrepreneurial structure based on user created virtual content sold in the internal virtual economy.\n\nSome multi-user virtual worlds have become used for educational purposes and are thus called Multi-User Virtual Learning Environments (MUVLEs). Examples have included the use of [[Second Life]] for teaching English as a foreign languages (EFL)<ref>Par Janusz Arabski, Adam Wojtaszek (2011). The Acquisition of L2 Phonology.

A prominent example is the work of [[William Gibson]]. The first was probably [[John M. Ford]]'s 1980 novel ''[[Web of Angels]]''.  Virtual worlds are integral to ''[[Tron (franchise)|Tron]]'', ''[[Neuromancer]]'', ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'', ''[[Snow Crash]]'', ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'', ''[[Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace|Lawnmower Man 2]]'', ''[[ReBoot]]'', ''[[Digimon]]'', ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'', ''[[MegaMan NT Warrior]]'', ''[[Epic (novel)|Epic]]'', ''[[Code Lyoko]]'', ''[[Real Drive]]'', and ''[[Ready Player One]]''.\n\nIn A.K. Dewdney's novel, ''[[the Planiverse]]'' (1984), college students create a virtual world called 2DWorld, leading to contact with Arde, a two-dimensional parallel universe.\n\nThe main focus of the [[cyberpunk]], psychological, 13-episode [[anime]] titled ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]'' is the Wired, a virtual reality world that governs the sum of all electronic communication and machines; outer receptors are used to mentally transport a person ''into'' the Wired itself as a uniquely different virtual [[avatar]].\n\n[[Yasutaka Tsutsui]]'s novel, ''Gaspard in the Morning'' (1992), is the story of an individual immersed in the virtual world of a [[massively multiplayer online game]].<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/tsutsui_yasutaka Tsutsui Yasutaka], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]''</ref> The plots of ''[[.hack]]'', ''[[Sword Art Online]]'', ''[[Accel World]]'' and ''[[Summer Wars]]'' also involve the virtual worlds of massively multiplayer online games.\n\nThe fourth series of the New Zealand TV series ''[[The Tribe (1999 TV series)|The Tribe]]'' features the birth of Reality Space and the Virtual World that was created by Ram, the computer genius-wizard leader of The Technos.\n\nIn 2009, [[BBC Radio 7]] commissioned ''[[Planet B]]'', set in a virtual world in which a man searches for his girlfriend, believed to be dead, but in fact still alive within the world called \"Planet B\". The series is the biggest-ever commission for an original drama series.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hemley|first=Matthew|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/21930/bbc-radio-launches-major-cross-station-sci-fi|title=BBC radio launches major cross-station sci-fi season|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=2008-09-30|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref>\n\nThe plot of \"[[San Junipero]]\", series 3, episode 4 of the anthology TV series ''[[Black Mirror]]'', revolves around a virtual world in which participants can choose time periods to visit.
