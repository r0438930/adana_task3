Dietary [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] were affected by the political changes from [[monarchy|kingdom]] to [[republic]] to [[empire]], and the empire's enormous expansion, which exposed Romans to many new provincial culinary habits and cooking methods.\n\nIn the beginning, dietary differences between Roman social classes were not  great, but disparities developed with the empire's growth.\n\n==Meals==\n{{Further|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nTraditionally, a [[breakfast]] called ''ientaculum''<ref name=\"ArtmanJohnAncient\">Artman, John:\"Ancient Rome- Independent Learning Unit\", page 26, Good Apple, 1991.</ref> was served at dawn. At mid-day to early afternoon, Romans ate ''[[cena]]'',<ref name=\"ArtmanJohnAncient\" /> the main meal of the day, and at nightfall a light supper called ''vesperna''.<ref name=\"Artman, John page 26\">Artman, John::\"Ancient Rome- Independent Learning Unit\", page 26, Good Apple,1991.</ref> With the increased importation of foreign foods, the ''cena'' grew larger in size and included a wider range of foods. Thus, it gradually shifted to the evening, while the ''vesperna''<ref name=\"Artman, John page 26\"/> was abandoned completely over the course of the years. The mid-day meal ''prandium'' became a light meal to hold one over until ''[[cena]]''.<ref name=\"ArtmanJohnAncient\" /> Among the lower classes of the Roman society, these changes were less pronounced as the traditional routines corresponded closely to the daily rhythms of manual labour.\n[[File: Roman Museum 099.jpg|thumb|Roman spoons with duck or swan handles]]\n\nHowever, among the upper classes, who normally did not engage in manual labour, it became customary to schedule all business obligations in the morning. After the ''prandium'', the last responsibilities would be discharged, and a visit would be made to the [[thermae|baths]]. Around 2&nbsp;p.m.,<ref>Guy, John:\"Roman Life\", page 8, Ticktock Publishing LTD,1998.</ref> the '' cena'' would begin. This meal could last until late in the night, especially if guests were invited, and would often be followed by ''comissatio'', a round of alcoholic beverages (usually [[wine]].)\n\nIn the period of the kings and the early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], but also in later periods (for the working classes), the ''cena'' essentially consisted of a kind of [[porridge]], the ''[[puls (food)|puls]]''.<ref name=\"Woolf2007a\">{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&q=fish+sauce|year=2007|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=388}}</ref> The simplest kind would be made from [[emmer]], water, salt and fat. A more sophisticated variation was made with [[olive oil]], and consumed with an accompaniment of assorted [[vegetable]]s when available. The wealthy commonly ate their ''puls'' with [[egg]]s, [[cheese]], and [[honey]] and it was also occasionally served with [[meat]] or [[Fish (food)|fish]].\n\nOver the course of the Republican period, the ''Cena'' developed into two courses: the main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. [[mollusc]]s, [[shrimp]]). By the end of the Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in three parts: an appetiser (''gustatio''), main course (''primae mensae''), and dessert (''secundae mensae'').\n\nThe Roman legions' staple ration of food was wheat. In the 4th century, most legionnaires ate as well as anyone in Rome. They were supplied with rations of bread and vegetables along with meats such as beef, mutton, or pork. Rations also depended on where the legions were stationed or were campaigning. Mutton was popular in Northern Gaul and Britannica, but pork was the main meat ration of the legions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A taste of Ancient Rome|last=Giacosa|first=Ilaria Gozzini|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1992|isbn=|location=chicago|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Foods and ingredients==\n[[File:Pompei pane retouched.jpg|thumb|A carbonised loaf of ancient Roman bread from [[Pompeii]].

In the [[Imperial Rome|Imperial]] period, around the beginning of the Common era, bread made of [[wheat]] was introduced; with time, more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer loaves. There were many kinds of bread of differing quality. Typically white bread was baked for the elite, with darker bread baked for the middle class, and the darkest bread for the poor peasants.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Feldman|first=Charles|date=2005-03-01|title=Roman Taste|journal=Food, Culture & Society|volume=8|issue=1|pages=7\u201330|doi=10.2752/155280105778055407|issn=1552-8014}}</ref> The bread was sometimes dipped in [[wine]] and eaten with olives, cheese, and grapes.

Dietary [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] were affected by the political changes from [[monarchy|kingdom]] to [[republic]] to [[empire]], and the empire's enormous expansion, which exposed Romans to many new provincial culinary habits and cooking methods.\n\nIn the beginning, dietary differences between Roman social classes were not  great, but disparities developed with the empire's growth.\n\n==Meals==\n{{Further|Food and dining in the Roman Empire}}\n\nTraditionally, a [[breakfast]] called ''ientaculum''<ref name=\"ArtmanJohnAncient\">Artman, John:\"Ancient Rome- Independent Learning Unit\", page 26, Good Apple, 1991.</ref> was served at dawn. At mid-day to early afternoon, Romans ate ''[[cena]]'',<ref name=\"ArtmanJohnAncient\" /> the main meal of the day, and at nightfall a light supper called ''vesperna''.<ref name=\"Artman, John page 26\">Artman, John::\"Ancient Rome- Independent Learning Unit\", page 26, Good Apple,1991.</ref> With the increased importation of foreign foods, the ''cena'' grew larger in size and included a wider range of foods. Thus, it gradually shifted to the evening, while the ''vesperna''<ref name=\"Artman, John page 26\"/> was abandoned completely over the course of the years. The mid-day meal ''prandium'' became a light meal to hold one over until ''[[cena]]''.<ref name=\"ArtmanJohnAncient\" /> Among the lower classes of the Roman society, these changes were less pronounced as the traditional routines corresponded closely to the daily rhythms of manual labour.\n[[File: Roman Museum 099.jpg|thumb|Roman spoons with duck or swan handles]]\n\nHowever, among the upper classes, who normally did not engage in manual labour, it became customary to schedule all business obligations in the morning. After the ''prandium'', the last responsibilities would be discharged, and a visit would be made to the [[thermae|baths]]. Around 2&nbsp;p.m.,<ref>Guy, John:\"Roman Life\", page 8, Ticktock Publishing LTD,1998.</ref> the '' cena'' would begin. This meal could last until late in the night, especially if guests were invited, and would often be followed by ''comissatio'', a round of alcoholic beverages (usually [[wine]].)\n\nIn the period of the kings and the early [[Roman Republic|Republic]], but also in later periods (for the working classes), the ''cena'' essentially consisted of a kind of [[porridge]], the ''[[puls (food)|puls]]''.<ref name=\"Woolf2007a\">{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&q=fish+sauce|year=2007|publisher=Barnes & Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=388}}</ref> The simplest kind would be made from [[emmer]], water, salt and fat. A more sophisticated variation was made with [[olive oil]], and consumed with an accompaniment of assorted [[vegetable]]s when available. The wealthy commonly ate their ''puls'' with [[egg]]s, [[cheese]], and [[honey]] and it was also occasionally served with [[meat]] or [[Fish (food)|fish]].\n\nOver the course of the Republican period, the ''Cena'' developed into two courses: the main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. [[mollusc]]s, [[shrimp]]). By the end of the Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in three parts: an appetiser (''gustatio''), main course (''primae mensae''), and dessert (''secundae mensae'').\n\nThe Roman legions' staple ration of food was wheat. In the 4th century, most legionnaires ate as well as anyone in Rome. They were supplied with rations of bread and vegetables along with meats such as beef, mutton, or pork. Rations also depended on where the legions were stationed or were campaigning. Mutton was popular in Northern Gaul and Britannica, but pork was the main meat ration of the legions.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A taste of Ancient Rome|last=Giacosa|first=Ilaria Gozzini|publisher=University of Chicago|year=1992|isbn=|location=chicago|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Foods and ingredients==\n[[File:Pompei pane retouched.jpg|thumb|A carbonised loaf of ancient Roman bread from [[Pompeii]].
