During the 1920s and 1930s, he employed Lloyd (his top money-maker until his departure in 1923), [[Will Rogers]], [[Max Davidson]], the [[Our Gang]] children, [[Charley Chase]], [[Harry Langdon]], [[Thelma Todd]], [[ZaSu Pitts]], [[Lupe V\u00e9lez]], [[Patsy Kelly]] and, most famously, [[Laurel and Hardy]]. During the 1920s, Roach's biggest rival was producer [[Mack Sennett]]. In 1925, Roach hired away Sennett's supervising director, [[F. Richard Jones]].\n\nRoach released his films through [[Path\u00e9 Exchange]] until 1927, when he went to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. He converted his silent movie studio to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts in early 1929. In the days before [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]], foreign language versions of the Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film in the Spanish, French, and sometimes Italian and German languages. Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang children (some of whom had barely begun school) were required to recite the foreign dialogue [[phonetically]], often working from blackboards hidden off camera.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nIn 1931, with the release of the Laurel & Hardy film ''[[Pardon Us]]'', Roach began producing occasional full-length features alongside the short product. Short subjects became less profitable and were phased out by 1936, save for the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series. An ''Our Gang'' feature film ''[[General Spanky]]'' did not do as well as expected; Roach continued making the shorts for MGM.\n\nIn 1937, Roach conceived a joint business venture partnering with [[Vittorio Mussolini]], son of fascist Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], to form a production company called \"R.A.M\" (Roach and Mussolini). Roach claimed the scheme involved Italian bankers (not the government) providing US$6 million that would enable Roach's studio to produce a series of 12 films. Eight would be for Italian screening only whilst the remaining four would receive world distribution.  The first film for Italy was to be a feature film of the opera ''[[Rigoletto]]''.<ref> Graham, Sheila ''Hollywood Today'' ''Hal Roach Defends Mussolini Deal'' p. 4  ''The Milwaukee Journal'' 5 October 1937</ref>\n\nThis proposed business alliance with Mussolini caused MGM to intervene and force Roach to pay his way out of the venture. This embarrassment, coupled with the underperformance of much of Roach's new feature product (save for Laurel & Hardy films and the odd non-L&H hit such as 1937's ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]''), led to the end of Roach's relationship with MGM.<ref name=\"MGMsale\">Ward, Richard Lewis (2005). ''A History of Hal Roach Studios''. Carbondale, IL: Southern Illinois University Press. Pg. 97\u2013102, 116, 225. {{ISBN|0-8093-2637-X}}.</ref> In May 1938, Roach ended his distribution contract with MGM, selling them the production rights to, and actors' contracts for ''Our Gang'' in the process, and signed with [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"MGMsale\" />\n\nFrom 1937 to 1940, Roach concentrated on producing glossy features, abandoning low comedy almost completely. Most of his new films were either sophisticated farces (like ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'', 1937, and ''[[The Housekeeper's Daughter]]'', 1939) or rugged action fare (like ''[[Captain Fury]]'', 1939, and ''[[One Million B.C.]]'', 1940). Roach's one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), in which actors [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] played the leading roles. The Laurel and Hardy comedies, once the Roach studio's biggest drawing cards, were now the studio's ''least'' important product and were phased out altogether in 1940.\n\nIn 1940, Roach experimented with medium-length [[featurette]]s, running 40 to 50 minutes each. He contended that these \"[[Hal Roach's Streamliners|streamliners]]\", as he called them, would be useful in [[double-feature]] situations where the main attraction was a longer-length epic. Exhibitors agreed with him and used Roach's mini-features to balance top-heavy double bills. United Artists continued to release Roach's streamliners through 1943. By this time, Roach no longer had a resident company of comedy stars and cast his films with familiar featured players ([[William Tracy]] and [[Joe Sawyer]], [[Johnny Downs]], [[Jean Porter (actress)|Jean Porter]], [[Frank Faylen]], [[William Bendix]], [[George E. Stone]], etc.).\n\n==World War II and television==\nHal Roach, Sr., commissioned in the US Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927<ref> p. 125  Ward, Richard Lewis ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'' SIU Press, 15 Aug 2006</ref> was called back to active military duty in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] in June 1942, at age 50.  The studio output he oversaw in uniform was converted from entertainment featurettes to military [[training film]]s. The studios were leased to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] made 400 training, morale and [[propaganda films]] at \"Fort Roach\". Members of the unit included [[Ronald W. Reagan]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. After the war the government returned the studio to Roach, with millions of dollars of improvements.<ref name=\"betancourt201203\">{{cite web | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html | title=World War II: The Movie | work=Air & Space | date=March 2012 | accessdate=September 27, 2013 | author=Betancourt, Mark}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star [[Bebe Daniels]] as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to go to an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in [[Cinecolor]], although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with [[Hal Roach Jr.]], producing series such as ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', ''[[Steve Donovan, Western Marshal]]'', ''[[Racket Squad]]'', ''[[The Public Defender (TV series)|The Public Defender]]'', ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'', ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]'' and ''[[My Little Margie]]'', and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[The Life of Riley]]'' and ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood's annual output of feature movies.<ref>\"Hollywood Is Humming\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 29, 1951.</ref>\n\nRecognizing the value of his film library, in 1943 Roach began licensing revivals of his sound-era productions for theatrical and home-movie distribution. Roach's films were also early arrivals on television. His [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies were successful in [[television syndication]], as were the ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies produced from 1927-1938, for which in 1949 Roach had bought back the rights from MGM and re-branded for television as \"The Little Rascals\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | title=Little Rascals History | accessdate=2017-02-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119052141/http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | archive-date=November 19, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He thus became one of the first significant film producers to venture into television.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, [[Hal Roach Jr.]], and retired from active production. The younger Roach lacked much of his father's business acumen and soon lost the studio to creditors. It was finally shut down in 1961.\n\nFor two more decades, Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96.\n\nIn 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an [[honorary Academy Award]]. Former ''Our Gang'' members [[Jackie Cooper]] and [[George McFarland|George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior. An additional [[Our Gang]] member, [[Ernie Morrison]], was amongst the crowd and started the standing ovation for Hal Roach. Cooper's gratitude towards Roach was especially notable. Years earlier Cooper had been the youngest Academy Award nominee ever for his performance in [[Skippy (1931 movie)|Skippy]] when he had been under contract with Roach. Although Paramount had paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper's services in that film, Roach paid Cooper only his standard salary of $50 per week''.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Please Don't Shoot My Dog|last=Cooper|first=Jackie|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1982|isbn=0-425-05306-7|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9 9, 32, 40\u201342, 44, 54\u201361]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 January 1992, Roach was a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', just days after his 100th birthday, where he recounted experiences with such stars as [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Jean Harlow]]; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance. In February 1992, Roach travelled to [[Berlin]] to receive the honorary award of the ''Berlinale Kamera'' for Lifetime Achievement at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the [[64th Academy Awards]] ceremony, hosted by [[Billy Crystal]]. When Roach rose from the audience for a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip \"I think that's appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.\"\n\n==Death==\nHal Roach died in his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]], from [[pneumonia]], on November 2, 1992, just two months before his 101st birthday. He had married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than 20 years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964), and Elizabeth (died in 1946). He also outlived many of the children who starred in his films.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\"/> Roach is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Elmira, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[Elmira, New York]], where he grew up.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=_-cZDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=hal+roach+woodlawn+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY-7Gw7YTfAhWRCHwKHVHBC8QQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=hal%20roach%20woodlawn%20cemetery&f=false ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'']</ref>\n\n==Hal Roach Studios==\nThe 14.5 acre (58,680 m\u00b2) studio once known as \"The Lot of Fun\", containing 55 buildings, was demolished in 1963 (despite tentative plans to reopen the facilities as \"Landmark Studios\"), after one last movie, ''[[Dime with a Halo]]'' (1963), with [[BarBara Luna|Barbara Luna]], was made there in 1963 by [[Boris Sagal]] (to Sagal, the forlorn facility looked like a run-down Mexican city).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531142915/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie |archivedate=May 31, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}{{failed verification|date=September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThey were replaced by light industrial buildings, businesses, and an automobile dealership. Today, Culver City's \"Landmark Street\" runs down what was the middle of the old studio lot, with the two original sound stages having been located on the north side of Landmark Street, and the [[backlot]]/city street sets had been located at the eastern end of Landmark Street.

Retrieved August 23, 2008</ref>\n\nMost of the film library was bought in 1971 by a Canadian company that adopted the \"Hal Roach Studios\" name. It primarily handled the business of keeping the library in the public eye and licensing products based upon the classic film series.\n\nIn 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the controversial business of [[film colorization]]. Buying a fifty percent interest in [[Wilson Markle]]'s Colorization Inc, it began creating digitally colored versions of several Laurel and Hardy features, the [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), and other popular films. In the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios produced ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Roach's old distributor in the 1930s. During the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios distributed its classic film library, as well as films in the [[public domain]], on home video. 1986 saw the merger of Hal Roach Studios with the production firm of [[Robert Halmi]] into ''Qintex Entertainment'', named after Australian investor [[Qintex]]. Under this name, Qintex collaborated with [[Universal Television]] to distribute ''[[The New Leave It To Beaver]]'' in syndication and the Canadian drama ''[[T. and T.]]'', starring [[Mr. T]], with Canadian animation house [[Nelvana]]. However, Qintex's Australian parent ended up collapsing under a crushing debtload, forcing Qintex Entertainment into bankruptcy.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Roach company changed hands several more times. Independent television producer Robert Halmi (who had merged his company with Roach) bought the company in the early 1990s after the bankruptcy of Qintex, and it became [[RHI Entertainment]]. A short time later, this successor company was acquired by [[Hallmark Entertainment]] in 1994, but Halmi, [[Robert Halmi Jr.]] and affiliates of [[Kelso & Company]] reacquired the company in 2006. Hallmark Entertainment was absorbed into RHI Entertainment (with [[Vivendi]] as the current home video output partner).\n\nIn that same decade, a new incarnation of Hal Roach Studios (operated by the Roach Trust) was established, and today this new version of the company has released classic films on DVD, many of which are from Roach's own archival prints of his films, while others are public domain titles mastered from the best available [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] elements.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Richard Lewis Ward.

An ''Our Gang'' feature film ''[[General Spanky]]'' did not do as well as expected; Roach continued making the shorts for MGM.\n\nIn 1937, Roach conceived a joint business venture partnering with [[Vittorio Mussolini]], son of fascist Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], to form a production company called \"R.A.M\" (Roach and Mussolini). Roach claimed the scheme involved Italian bankers (not the government) providing US$6 million that would enable Roach's studio to produce a series of 12 films. Eight would be for Italian screening only whilst the remaining four would receive world distribution.  The first film for Italy was to be a feature film of the opera ''[[Rigoletto]]''.<ref> Graham, Sheila ''Hollywood Today'' ''Hal Roach Defends Mussolini Deal'' p. 4  ''The Milwaukee Journal'' 5 October 1937</ref>\n\nThis proposed business alliance with Mussolini caused MGM to intervene and force Roach to pay his way out of the venture. This embarrassment, coupled with the underperformance of much of Roach's new feature product (save for Laurel & Hardy films and the odd non-L&H hit such as 1937's ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]''), led to the end of Roach's relationship with MGM.<ref name=\"MGMsale\">Ward, Richard Lewis (2005).

Pg. 97\u2013102, 116, 225. {{ISBN|0-8093-2637-X}}.</ref> In May 1938, Roach ended his distribution contract with MGM, selling them the production rights to, and actors' contracts for ''Our Gang'' in the process, and signed with [[United Artists]].<ref name=\"MGMsale\" />\n\nFrom 1937 to 1940, Roach concentrated on producing glossy features, abandoning low comedy almost completely. Most of his new films were either sophisticated farces (like ''[[Topper (film)|Topper]]'', 1937, and ''[[The Housekeeper's Daughter]]'', 1939) or rugged action fare (like ''[[Captain Fury]]'', 1939, and ''[[One Million B.C.]]'', 1940). Roach's one venture into heavy drama was the acclaimed ''[[Of Mice and Men (1939 film)|Of Mice and Men]]'' (1939), in which actors [[Burgess Meredith]] and [[Lon Chaney Jr.]] played the leading roles. The Laurel and Hardy comedies, once the Roach studio's biggest drawing cards, were now the studio's ''least'' important product and were phased out altogether in 1940.\n\nIn 1940, Roach experimented with medium-length [[featurette]]s, running 40 to 50 minutes each. He contended that these \"[[Hal Roach's Streamliners|streamliners]]\", as he called them, would be useful in [[double-feature]] situations where the main attraction was a longer-length epic. Exhibitors agreed with him and used Roach's mini-features to balance top-heavy double bills. United Artists continued to release Roach's streamliners through 1943. By this time, Roach no longer had a resident company of comedy stars and cast his films with familiar featured players ([[William Tracy]] and [[Joe Sawyer]], [[Johnny Downs]], [[Jean Porter (actress)|Jean Porter]], [[Frank Faylen]], [[William Bendix]], [[George E. Stone]], etc.).\n\n==World War II and television==\nHal Roach, Sr., commissioned in the US Army Signal Reserve Corps in 1927<ref> p. 125  Ward, Richard Lewis ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'' SIU Press, 15 Aug 2006</ref> was called back to active military duty in the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal Corps]] in June 1942, at age 50.  The studio output he oversaw in uniform was converted from entertainment featurettes to military [[training film]]s. The studios were leased to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]], and the [[First Motion Picture Unit]] made 400 training, morale and [[propaganda films]] at \"Fort Roach\". Members of the unit included [[Ronald W. Reagan]] and [[Alan Ladd]]. After the war the government returned the studio to Roach, with millions of dollars of improvements.<ref name=\"betancourt201203\">{{cite web | url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/World-War-II-The-Movie.html | title=World War II: The Movie | work=Air & Space | date=March 2012 | accessdate=September 27, 2013 | author=Betancourt, Mark}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, Hal Roach resumed motion picture production, with former Harold Lloyd co-star [[Bebe Daniels]] as an associate producer. Roach was the first Hollywood producer to go to an all-color production schedule, making four streamliners in [[Cinecolor]], although the increased production costs did not result in increased revenue. In 1948, with his studio deeply in debt, Roach re-established his studio for television production, with [[Hal Roach Jr.]], producing series such as ''[[The Stu Erwin Show]]'', ''[[Steve Donovan, Western Marshal]]'', ''[[Racket Squad]]'', ''[[The Public Defender (TV series)|The Public Defender]]'', ''[[The Gale Storm Show]]'', ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]'' and ''[[My Little Margie]]'', and independent producers leasing the facilities for such programs as ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', ''[[The Life of Riley]]'' and ''[[The Abbott and Costello Show]]''. By 1951, the studio was producing 1,500 hours of television programs a year, nearly three times Hollywood's annual output of feature movies.<ref>\"Hollywood Is Humming\", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', October 29, 1951.</ref>\n\nRecognizing the value of his film library, in 1943 Roach began licensing revivals of his sound-era productions for theatrical and home-movie distribution. Roach's films were also early arrivals on television. His [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies were successful in [[television syndication]], as were the ''[[Our Gang]]'' comedies produced from 1927-1938, for which in 1949 Roach had bought back the rights from MGM and re-branded for television as \"The Little Rascals\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | title=Little Rascals History | accessdate=2017-02-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119052141/http://www.ramseyltd.com/rascals/history.html | archive-date=November 19, 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> He thus became one of the first significant film producers to venture into television.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1955, Roach sold his interests in the production company to his son, [[Hal Roach Jr.]], and retired from active production. The younger Roach lacked much of his father's business acumen and soon lost the studio to creditors. It was finally shut down in 1961.\n\nFor two more decades, Roach Sr. occasionally worked as a consultant on projects related to his past work. Extremely vigorous into an advanced age, Roach contemplated a comedy comeback at 96.\n\nIn 1984, 92-year-old Roach was presented with an [[honorary Academy Award]]. Former ''Our Gang'' members [[Jackie Cooper]] and [[George McFarland|George \"Spanky\" McFarland]] made the presentation to a flattered Roach, with McFarland thanking the producer for hiring him 53 years prior. An additional [[Our Gang]] member, [[Ernie Morrison]], was amongst the crowd and started the standing ovation for Hal Roach. Cooper's gratitude towards Roach was especially notable. Years earlier Cooper had been the youngest Academy Award nominee ever for his performance in [[Skippy (1931 movie)|Skippy]] when he had been under contract with Roach. Although Paramount had paid Roach $25,000 for Cooper's services in that film, Roach paid Cooper only his standard salary of $50 per week''.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Please Don't Shoot My Dog|last=Cooper|first=Jackie|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1982|isbn=0-425-05306-7|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9 9, 32, 40\u201342, 44, 54\u201361]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/pleasedontshootm00coop/page/9}}</ref>\n\nOn 21 January 1992, Roach was a guest on ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', just days after his 100th birthday, where he recounted experiences with such stars as [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Jean Harlow]]; he even did a brief, energetic demonstration of a hula dance. In February 1992, Roach travelled to [[Berlin]] to receive the honorary award of the ''Berlinale Kamera'' for Lifetime Achievement at the [[42nd Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name=\"Berlinale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1992/03_preistr_ger_1992/03_Preistraeger_1992.html |title=Berlinale: 1992 Prize Winners |accessdate=March 27, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref>\n\nOn March 30, 1992, Roach appeared at the [[64th Academy Awards]] ceremony, hosted by [[Billy Crystal]]. When Roach rose from the audience for a standing ovation, he decided to give a speech without a microphone, causing Crystal to quip \"I think that's appropriate because Mr. Roach started in silent films.\"\n\n==Death==\nHal Roach died in his home in [[Bel Air, Los Angeles]], from [[pneumonia]], on November 2, 1992, just two months before his 101st birthday. He had married twice, and had six children, eight grandchildren, and a number of great-grandchildren. Roach outlived three of his children by more than 20 years: Hal Jr. (died in 1972), Margaret (died in 1964), and Elizabeth (died in 1946). He also outlived many of the children who starred in his films.<ref name=\"articles.sun-sentinel.com\"/> Roach is buried in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Elmira, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[Elmira, New York]], where he grew up.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=_-cZDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=hal+roach+woodlawn+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY-7Gw7YTfAhWRCHwKHVHBC8QQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=hal%20roach%20woodlawn%20cemetery&f=false ''A History of the Hal Roach Studios'']</ref>\n\n==Hal Roach Studios==\nThe 14.5 acre (58,680 m\u00b2) studio once known as \"The Lot of Fun\", containing 55 buildings, was demolished in 1963 (despite tentative plans to reopen the facilities as \"Landmark Studios\"), after one last movie, ''[[Dime with a Halo]]'' (1963), with [[BarBara Luna|Barbara Luna]], was made there in 1963 by [[Boris Sagal]] (to Sagal, the forlorn facility looked like a run-down Mexican city).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531142915/http://www.arte.tv/guide/fr/050153-000/hollywood-l-age-d-or-de-la-comedie |archivedate=May 31, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}{{failed verification|date=September 2016}}</ref>\n\nThey were replaced by light industrial buildings, businesses, and an automobile dealership. Today, Culver City's \"Landmark Street\" runs down what was the middle of the old studio lot, with the two original sound stages having been located on the north side of Landmark Street, and the [[backlot]]/city street sets had been located at the eastern end of Landmark Street. A plaque sits in a small park across from the studio's location, placed there by [[The Sons of the Desert]].<ref>[http://www.culvercity.org/en/Visitors/CulverCityHistory/HalRoachStudios Culver City History: Hal Roach Studios] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315022518/http://www.culvercity.org/en/Visitors/CulverCityHistory/HalRoachStudios |date=March 15, 2011 }}, culvercity.org. Retrieved August 23, 2008</ref>\n\nMost of the film library was bought in 1971 by a Canadian company that adopted the \"Hal Roach Studios\" name. It primarily handled the business of keeping the library in the public eye and licensing products based upon the classic film series.\n\nIn 1983, Hal Roach Studios became one of the first studios to venture into the controversial business of [[film colorization]]. Buying a fifty percent interest in [[Wilson Markle]]'s Colorization Inc, it began creating digitally colored versions of several Laurel and Hardy features, the [[Frank Capra]] film ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' (1946), ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), and other popular films. In the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios produced ''[[Kids Incorporated]]'' in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Roach's old distributor in the 1930s. During the 1980s, Hal Roach Studios distributed its classic film library, as well as films in the [[public domain]], on home video. 1986 saw the merger of Hal Roach Studios with the production firm of [[Robert Halmi]] into ''Qintex Entertainment'', named after Australian investor [[Qintex]]. Under this name, Qintex collaborated with [[Universal Television]] to distribute ''[[The New Leave It To Beaver]]'' in syndication and the Canadian drama ''[[T. and T.]]'', starring [[Mr. T]], with Canadian animation house [[Nelvana]]. However, Qintex's Australian parent ended up collapsing under a crushing debtload, forcing Qintex Entertainment into bankruptcy.\n\nIn the years that followed, the Roach company changed hands several more times. Independent television producer Robert Halmi (who had merged his company with Roach) bought the company in the early 1990s after the bankruptcy of Qintex, and it became [[RHI Entertainment]]. A short time later, this successor company was acquired by [[Hallmark Entertainment]] in 1994, but Halmi, [[Robert Halmi Jr.]] and affiliates of [[Kelso & Company]] reacquired the company in 2006. Hallmark Entertainment was absorbed into RHI Entertainment (with [[Vivendi]] as the current home video output partner).\n\nIn that same decade, a new incarnation of Hal Roach Studios (operated by the Roach Trust) was established, and today this new version of the company has released classic films on DVD, many of which are from Roach's own archival prints of his films, while others are public domain titles mastered from the best available [[35mm movie film|35 mm]] elements.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Richard Lewis Ward.
