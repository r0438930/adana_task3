The city lies on the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas River]] and is well known in the countries of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] for being full of tree-lined avenues, boulevards, gardens, and parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|title=\u0410\u0421\u0411\u041b >> General information|website=www.banjaluka.rs.ba|access-date=2 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815215526/http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|archive-date=15 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe name 'Banja Luka' was first mentioned in a document dated to 6 February 1494 by [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Ladislaus II of Hungary]]. The name is interpreted as the 'Ban's meadow', from the words ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' (a mediaeval noble title), and ''luka'' ('valley' or 'meadow'). The identity of the ban and the meadow in question remain uncertain, and [[popular etymology]] combines the modern words ''banja'' ('bath' or 'spa'), or ''bajna'' ('marvelous') and ''luka'' ('port'). A different interpretation is suggested by the Hungarian name ''Luk\u00e1csb\u00e1nya'', in English 'Luke's Mine',  which is also the meaning of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''ba\u0148a Luka''. In modern usage, the name is pronounced and usually [[declension|declined]] (''u Banjaluci'') as one word, and often written as such. The citizens reportedly prefer the form with inflected adjective (''u Banjoj Luci'').<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&reportid=151 Ivan Lovrenovi\u0107, \" \u2018Serb\u2019 towns in Bosnia\"], BH Dani, 20 July 2001</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Overview===\nBanja Luka covers some {{convert|96.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is situated on either bank of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] in the Banja Luka valley, which is characteristically flat within the otherwise hilly region. Banja Luka's centre lies {{convert|163|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\nThe source of the Vrbas River is about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to the south at the [[Vranica]] mountain. Its tributaries\u2014the Suturlija, the Crkvena, and the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja]]\u2014flow into the Vrbas at various points in the city. A number of springs can be found nearby.\n\nThe area around Banja Luka is mostly woodland, although there are mountains further from the city. The most notable of these mountains are Manja\u010da (1,214 m), \u010cemernica (1,338 m), and Tisovac. These are all part of the [[Dinaric Alps]] mountain range.\n\n=== Settlements ===\nThe city of Banja Luka (aside from city proper) includes the following settlements:\n{{flatlist|\n* [[Agino Selo]]\n* [[Barlovci]]\n* [[Bastasi, Banja Luka|Bastasi]]\n* [[Bistrica, Banja Luka|Bistrica]]\n* [[Bo\u010dac]]\n* [[Borkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Bronzani Majdan]]\n* [[Cerici]]\n* [[\u010cokori]]\n* [[Debeljaci]]\n* [[Dobrnja, Banja Luka|Dobrnja]]\n* [[Drago\u010daj]]\n* [[Drakuli\u0107, Banja Luka|Drakuli\u0107]]\n* [[Dujakovci]]\n* [[Gole\u0161i]]\n* [[Jagare]]\n* [[Kme\u0107ani]]\n* [[Kola, Banja Luka|Kola]]\n* [[Kola Donja]]\n* [[Krmine]]\n* [[Krupa na Vrbasu]]\n* [[Kuljani]]\n* [[Lokvari]]\n* [[Lusi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ljuba\u010devo]]\n* [[Melina, Banja Luka|Melina]]\n* [[Motike, Banja Luka|Motike]]\n* [[Obrovac, Banja Luka|Obrovac]]\n* [[Pavi\u0107i]]\n* [[Pavlovac, Banja Luka|Pavlovac]]\n* [[Pervan Donji]]\n* [[Pervan Gornji]]\n* [[Piskavica, Banja Luka|Piskavica]]\n* [[Ponir]]\n* [[Potkozarje, Banja Luka|Potkozarje]]\n* [[Prijakovci]]\n* [[Prije\u010dani]]\n* [[Prnjavor Mali, Banja Luka|Prnjavor Mali]]\n* [[Radmani\u0107i]]\n* [[Radosavska]]\n* [[Rami\u0107i, Banja Luka|Rami\u0107i]]\n* [[Rekavice]]\n* [[Slavi\u0107ka]]\n* [[Stratinska]]\n* [[Stri\u010di\u0107i]]\n* [[Subotica, Banja Luka|Subotica]]\n* [[\u0160argovac]]\n* [[\u0160imi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0160ljivno, Banja Luka|\u0160ljivno]]\n* [[Veri\u0107i]]\n* [[Vilusi, Banja Luka|Vilusi]]\n* [[Zalu\u017eani]]\n* [[Zelenci, Banja Luka|Zelenci]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nBanja Luka has a moderate [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild winters, frequent frosts, and warm summers.

Banja Luka has an average of 104 rainy days a year. Due to the city's relatively high latitude and inland location, it snows in Banja Luka almost every year. Strong winds come from the north and northeast. Sometimes, southern winds which bring hot weather are also prevalent.\n\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Banja Luka\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 22.3\n|Feb record high C = 25.2\n|Mar record high C = 29.0\n|Apr record high C = 31.8\n|May record high C = 35.2\n|Jun record high C = 37.9\n|Jul record high C = 41.6\n|Aug record high C = 41.1\n|Sep record high C = 40.2\n|Oct record high C = 30.9\n|Nov record high C = 27.1\n|Dec record high C = 23.2\n|year record high C = 41.6\n|Jan high C = 6.7\n|Feb high C = 7.8\n|Mar high C = 13.7\n|Apr high C = 19.3\n|May high C = 23.2\n|Jun high C = 27.3\n|Jul high C = 29.9\n|Aug high C = 30.1\n|Sep high C = 24.3\n|Oct high C = 18.5\n|Nov high C = 13.0\n|Dec high C = 7.2\n|year high C = 18.4\n|Jan mean C = 1.7\n|Feb mean C = 2.5\n|Mar mean C = 7.3\n|Apr mean C = 12.5\n|May mean C = 16.8\n|Jun mean C = 20.8\n|Jul mean C = 22.8\n|Aug mean C = 22.3\n|Sep mean C = 17.1\n|Oct mean C = 11.8\n|Nov mean C = 7.3\n|Dec mean C = 2.8\n|year mean C = 12.1\n|Jan low C = -2.1\n|Feb low C = -1.4\n|Mar low C = 1.8\n|Apr low C = 6.4\n|May low C = 10.0\n|Jun low C = 14.4\n|Jul low C = 16.0\n|Aug low C = 15.6\n|Sep low C = 11.4\n|Oct low C = 7.0\n|Nov low C = 3.2\n|Dec low C = -0.7\n|year low C = 6.8\n|Jan record low C = -22.8\n|Feb record low C = -21.5\n|Mar record low C = -18.2\n|Apr record low C = -5.9\n|May record low C = 0.0\n|Jun record low C = 4.0\n|Jul record low C = 6.7\n|Aug record low C = 6.1\n|Sep record low C = 0.0\n|Oct record low C = -5.5\n|Nov record low C = -11.0\n|Dec record low C = -18.0\n|year record low C = -22.8\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 71.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 67.6\n|Mar precipitation mm = 77.8\n|Apr precipitation mm = 86.5\n|May precipitation mm = 98.3\n|Jun precipitation mm = 109.2\n|Jul precipitation mm = 73.9\n|Aug precipitation mm = 74.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 83.9\n|Oct precipitation mm = 103.9\n|Nov precipitation mm = 89.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 100.8\n|year precipitation mm = 1037.2\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 8.9\n|Feb precipitation days = 9.7\n|Mar precipitation days = 9.4\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.2\n|May precipitation days = 9.8\n|Jun precipitation days = 8.1\n|Jul precipitation days = 7.9\n|Aug precipitation days = 5.8\n|Sep precipitation days = 7.9\n|Oct precipitation days = 8.9\n|Nov precipitation days = 8.1\n|Dec precipitation days = 10.2\n|year precipitation days = 104.0\n|Jan humidity = 82\n|Feb humidity = 80\n|Mar humidity = 73\n|Apr humidity = 69\n|May humidity = 71\n|Jun humidity = 71\n|Jul humidity = 70\n|Aug humidity = 73\n|Sep humidity = 78\n|Oct humidity = 82\n|Nov humidity = 84\n|Dec humidity = 83\n|year humidity = 76\n|Jan sun = 54\n|Feb sun = 71\n|Mar sun = 125\n|Apr sun = 158\n|May sun = 206\n|Jun sun = 222\n|Jul sun = 272\n|Aug sun = 238\n|Sep sun = 186\n|Oct sun = 133\n|Nov sun = 70\n|Dec sun = 46\n|year sun = \n|source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (temperatures, 1992\u20132016, extremes 1973\u20132016, precipitation, 1926\u20132016, precipitation days, 1992\u20132016, humidity, 1973\u20131991 and sun, 1961\u20131990)<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_145420_kt.pdf|title=Klimatafel von Banja Luka/Bosnien und Herzegowina|work=Baseline climate means (1961-1990) from stations all over the world|publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst|language=German|accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref><ref name=DWDsun>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/multi_annual/sunshine_duration/1961_1990.txt|title=Station 14542 Banja Luka|work=Global station data 1961\u20131990\u2014Sunshine Duration|publisher=Deutscher Wetterdienst|accessdate=29 January 2016|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171017195327/ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/observations_global/CLIMAT/multi_annual/sunshine_duration/1961_1990.txt|archive-date=17 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{efn|[ftp://ftp-cdc.dwd.de/pub/CDC/help/stations_list_CLIMAT_data.txt Station ID for Banja Luka is 14542] Use this station ID to locate the sunshine duration}}|date=January 2011}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:\u0421\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0430_\u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430_\u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430_\u0441\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0459\u0430_004.jpg|thumb|423x423px|right|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Banja Luka]].]]\n[[File:NKD138 Ferhadija2.jpg|thumb|281x281px|The 1579's Ferhat Pasha Mosque was blown-up by explosives in 1993.

The area comprising Banja Luka was entirely in the kingdom of Illyria and then a part of the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], which split into provinces of [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia]] of which Castra became a part.

Later periodic intrusions by the Austrian army stimulated military developments in Banja Luka, which made it into a strategic military centre. Orthodox churches and monasteries near Banja Luka were built in the 19th century. Also, [[Sephardic Jew]]s and [[Trappists]] migrated to the city in the 19th century and contributed to the early industrialisation of the region by building mills, breweries, brick factories, textile factories and other important structures.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe [[Mariastern Abbey, Banja Luka|Trappist monastery]] built in the 19th century lent its name to the neighbourhood of ''Trapisti'' and has left a large legacy in the area through its famous [[Trappista cheese|Trappist cheese]] and its beer production.\n\nIn 1835 and 1836, during Ottoman administration, numerous people from Banja Luka emigrated to [[Le\u0161nica, Serbia|Le\u0161nica]], [[Lipnica (Loznica)|Lipnica]] and [[Loznica]], the villages around Loznica, and to [[\u0160abac]].<ref>Jovan Cviji\u0107, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju\u017enoslovenske zemlje /Balkan Peninsula and South Slav Countries/ (Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud\u017ebenika, 1966), pp. 151-152.</ref>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\nDespite its leading position in the region, Banja Luka as a city was not modernised until [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]] in the late 19th century. Railroads, schools, factories, and infrastructure appeared, and were developed, which turned Banja Luka into a modern city.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nAfter World War I, the town became the capital of the [[Vrbas Banovina]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\nThe provincial capital owed its rapid progress to the first Ban Svetislav Milosavljevi\u0107. During that time, the Banski dvor and its twin sister, the Administration building, the Serbian Orthodox Church of the Holy Trinity, a theatre and a museum were built, the Grammar School was renovated, the Teachers College enlarged, a city bridge was built and the park renovated.\n125 elementary schools were functioning in Banja Luka in 1930. The revolutionary ideas of the time were incubated by the \"Pelagi\u0107\" association and the Students' Club. Banja Luka naturally became the organisational centre of anti-fascist work in the region.\n\n====World War II====\nDuring World War II, Banja Luka was part of the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. Most of Banja Luka's Serbs and Jews were deported to concentration camps such as [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] and [[Stara Gradi\u0161ka concentration camp|Stara Gradi\u0161ka]]. On 7 February 1942, [[Usta\u0161e]] paramilitaries, led by a Franciscan friar, [[Miroslav Filipovi\u0107]] (aka Tomislav Filipovi\u0107-Majstorovi\u0107), killed more than 2,300 Serbs (among them 500 children)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtrs.tv/vijesti/vijest.php?id=45305|title=Radio-Televizija Republike Srpske|publisher=Rtrs.tv|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> in Drakuli\u0107, Motike and \u0160argovac (a part of the Banja Luka municipality).\n\nThe city's Orthodox church of the Holy Trinity was totally demolished by the [[Usta\u0161e]], as was the Church of St. George in [[Petri\u0107evac]]. The Bishop of Banja Luka, [[Platon Jovanovi\u0107]], was arrested by the Usta\u0161e on 5 May 1941, and was tortured and killed.

Banja Luka is the centre of the government for the Municipality of Banja Luka. A number of entity and state institutions are seated in the city. The Republika Srpska Government and the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]] are based in Banja Luka.\n\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina State Agencies based in the city include the Indirect Taxation (VAT) Authority, the Deposit Insurance Agency as well as a branch of the [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (formerly the National Bank of Republika Srpska). [[Austria]], Croatia, France, Germany, [[Serbia]], the United Kingdom and the United States maintain diplomatic representation through [[Consul (representative)|consulates-general]] in Banja Luka.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. In this period Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established [[Banja Luka Stock Exchange]]. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as [[Telekom Srpske]], Rafinerija ulja Modri\u010da, [[Banjalu\u010dka Pivara]] and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Serbia]], now include a number of investment funds from the EU, and from [[Norway]], the United States, Japan and China.\n\nA number of financial services regulators, such as the [[Republika Srpska Securities Commission]] and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n;Economic preview\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The [[Museum of Modern Art of Republika Srpska]], also called MSURS, the Museum of Contemporary Art, displays exhibitions of both domestic and worldwide artists.\n\nBanja Luka is home to the National Theatre and National Library, both dating from the first half of the 20th century, and of numerous other theatres. The headquarters of the [[Archives of Republika Srpska]] is situated in the building known as ''Carska ku\u0107a'' or Imperial House, built around 1880. It has been in continuous public use longer than any other structure in Banja Luka.\n\nOne of the most famous cultural sites in Banja Luka is the cultural centre of \"[[Banski Dvor]]\" (Halls of the [[Ban (title)|Ban]]), built in the 1930s as the residence for the Bans of the [[Vrbas Banovina]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn the city there are many Cultural Artistic Associations. The oldest is CAA \"Pelagi\u0107\" (founded 1927), one of the oldest institutions of this kind in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rkud-pelagic.org|title=RKUD \"Pelagi\u0107\", Banja Luka|publisher=Rkud-pelagic.org|date=13 August 2012|accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Rafting-Start slalom staza.jpg|thumb|In 2009 Banja Luka was host of World Cup in rafting.]]\nBanja Luka has one major [[association football|football]] stadium and several indoor sports halls. The local [[handball]], basketball and football teams bear the traditional name [[Borac Banja Luka|Borac]] (''fighter''). The three football teams from Banja Luka are [[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]] (2010/2011 season champions of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), [[FK BSK Banja Luka|BSK Banja Luka]], and [[FK Omladinac Banja Luka|Omladinac Banja Luka]] (both in the [[First League of the Republika Srpska]]), FK Naprijed Banja Luka and FK Vrbas Banja Luka\n\n[[FK Borac Banja Luka]] is the most popular football club in the Republika Srpska. The club has won several major trophies in its history such as trophies as a champion of [[Mitropa Cup]], [[Yugoslav Cup]], [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup]], [[2007\u201308 First League of the Republika Srpska|First League of the Republika Srpska]], [[Republika Srpska Cup|Republic Srpska Cup]]. They have participated in [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]].\n\nThe city has a long tradition of handball. [[RK Borac Banja Luka]] was the European Champion in 1976, the European Vice-Champion in 1975 and the winner of the IHF Cup in 1991.\n\nRecently, tennis has taken on a bigger role in the city. The local tennis tournament, [[Banja Luka Challenger|\"Memorijal Trive Vuji\u0107a\"]], has become professional and has been awarded [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] status in 2001, with the rank of a [[ATP Challenger Series|Challenger]]. The Banja Luka Challenger takes place in September each year. In 2005, the European Championships in [[Rafting]] were held on the Vrbas river.  In 2006, the [[Davis Cup]] matches of the Europe/Africa Zone Group III took place in the city. Since 2015, the city hosts the Banjaluka Half-marathon.\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:TranzitBL.jpg|thumb|right|Banja Luka west transit road]]\n[[File:Isto\u010dni tranzit, Banja Luka.jpg|thumb|Banja Luka east transit road]]\n[[File:BH Airlines - Banja Luka airport - Aug-10 v1.jpg|thumb|right|B&H Airlines [[ATR 72]] at Banja Luka airport preparing for the flight to Z\u00fcrich, August 2010]]\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki most Banja Luka.jpg|thumb|right|Banja Luka railway bridge over the river Vrbas, April 2020]]\n\nPublic transportation within Banja Luka is exclusively operated by the bus services. Over thirty bus lines connect downtown with the rest of the city and its suburbs. The oldest bus link in the city is line No 1. Taxis are also readily available. The expressway E-661 (locally known as M-16) leads north to [[Croatia]] from Banja Luka by way of [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi\u0161ka]], near the Bosnian/Croatian border. A wide range of bus services are available to most neighbouring and larger towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to regional and European destinations such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, France, Italy, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia.\n\nBanja Luka is a minor hub of the railway services of [[Republika Srpska Railways|\u017deljeznice Republike Srpske]], which comprises one half of the railway network of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Services operate to most northern Bosnian towns, and two modern air-conditioned 'Talgo' trains run to [[Sarajevo]] every day. However, services are relatively slow and infrequent compared with neighbouring countries.\n\n[[Banja Luka International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: BNX, [[ICAO]]: LQBK) is located {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Banja Luka. The airport is served by [[Air Serbia]], which operates flights to [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport|Belgrade]] and summer charters to [[Antalya Airport|Antalya]] and [[Athens International Airport|Athens]], while [[Ryanair]] operates flights to [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport|Brussels]], [[Memmingen Airport|Memmingen]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Berlin]] and [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Stockholm]].

The city lies on the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas River]] and is well known in the countries of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] for being full of tree-lined avenues, boulevards, gardens, and parks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|title=\u0410\u0421\u0411\u041b >> General information|website=www.banjaluka.rs.ba|access-date=2 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815215526/http://www.banjaluka.rs.ba/front/category/139/|archive-date=15 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe name 'Banja Luka' was first mentioned in a document dated to 6 February 1494 by [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Ladislaus II of Hungary]]. The name is interpreted as the 'Ban's meadow', from the words ''[[ban (title)|ban]]'' (a mediaeval noble title), and ''luka'' ('valley' or 'meadow'). The identity of the ban and the meadow in question remain uncertain, and [[popular etymology]] combines the modern words ''banja'' ('bath' or 'spa'), or ''bajna'' ('marvelous') and ''luka'' ('port'). A different interpretation is suggested by the Hungarian name ''Luk\u00e1csb\u00e1nya'', in English 'Luke's Mine',  which is also the meaning of the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''ba\u0148a Luka''. In modern usage, the name is pronounced and usually [[declension|declined]] (''u Banjaluci'') as one word, and often written as such. The citizens reportedly prefer the form with inflected adjective (''u Banjoj Luci'').<ref>[http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=786&reportid=151 Ivan Lovrenovi\u0107, \" \u2018Serb\u2019 towns in Bosnia\"], BH Dani, 20 July 2001</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Overview===\nBanja Luka covers some {{convert|96.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and is situated on either bank of the [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] in the Banja Luka valley, which is characteristically flat within the otherwise hilly region. Banja Luka's centre lies {{convert|163|m|2|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].\n\nThe source of the Vrbas River is about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} to the south at the [[Vranica]] mountain. Its tributaries\u2014the Suturlija, the Crkvena, and the [[Vrbanja (river)|Vrbanja]]\u2014flow into the Vrbas at various points in the city. A number of springs can be found nearby.\n\nThe area around Banja Luka is mostly woodland, although there are mountains further from the city. The most notable of these mountains are Manja\u010da (1,214 m), \u010cemernica (1,338 m), and Tisovac. These are all part of the [[Dinaric Alps]] mountain range.\n\n=== Settlements ===\nThe city of Banja Luka (aside from city proper) includes the following settlements:\n{{flatlist|\n* [[Agino Selo]]\n* [[Barlovci]]\n* [[Bastasi, Banja Luka|Bastasi]]\n* [[Bistrica, Banja Luka|Bistrica]]\n* [[Bo\u010dac]]\n* [[Borkovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Bronzani Majdan]]\n* [[Cerici]]\n* [[\u010cokori]]\n* [[Debeljaci]]\n* [[Dobrnja, Banja Luka|Dobrnja]]\n* [[Drago\u010daj]]\n* [[Drakuli\u0107, Banja Luka|Drakuli\u0107]]\n* [[Dujakovci]]\n* [[Gole\u0161i]]\n* [[Jagare]]\n* [[Kme\u0107ani]]\n* [[Kola, Banja Luka|Kola]]\n* [[Kola Donja]]\n* [[Krmine]]\n* [[Krupa na Vrbasu]]\n* [[Kuljani]]\n* [[Lokvari]]\n* [[Lusi\u0107i]]\n* [[Ljuba\u010devo]]\n* [[Melina, Banja Luka|Melina]]\n* [[Motike, Banja Luka|Motike]]\n* [[Obrovac, Banja Luka|Obrovac]]\n* [[Pavi\u0107i]]\n* [[Pavlovac, Banja Luka|Pavlovac]]\n* [[Pervan Donji]]\n* [[Pervan Gornji]]\n* [[Piskavica, Banja Luka|Piskavica]]\n* [[Ponir]]\n* [[Potkozarje, Banja Luka|Potkozarje]]\n* [[Prijakovci]]\n* [[Prije\u010dani]]\n* [[Prnjavor Mali, Banja Luka|Prnjavor Mali]]\n* [[Radmani\u0107i]]\n* [[Radosavska]]\n* [[Rami\u0107i, Banja Luka|Rami\u0107i]]\n* [[Rekavice]]\n* [[Slavi\u0107ka]]\n* [[Stratinska]]\n* [[Stri\u010di\u0107i]]\n* [[Subotica, Banja Luka|Subotica]]\n* [[\u0160argovac]]\n* [[\u0160imi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0160ljivno, Banja Luka|\u0160ljivno]]\n* [[Veri\u0107i]]\n* [[Vilusi, Banja Luka|Vilusi]]\n* [[Zalu\u017eani]]\n* [[Zelenci, Banja Luka|Zelenci]]\n}}\n\n===Climate===\nBanja Luka has a moderate [[humid subtropical climate]] with mild winters, frequent frosts, and warm summers.

Banja Luka has an average of 104 rainy days a year. Due to the city's relatively high latitude and inland location, it snows in Banja Luka almost every year.

The area comprising Banja Luka was entirely in the kingdom of Illyria and then a part of the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], which split into provinces of [[Pannonia]] and [[Dalmatia]] of which Castra became a part.

It was also the central sanjak in the Bosnia Eyalet. In 1688, the city was burned down by the [[Austria]]n army, but it quickly recovered. Later periodic intrusions by the Austrian army stimulated military developments in Banja Luka, which made it into a strategic military centre. Orthodox churches and monasteries near Banja Luka were built in the 19th century. Also, [[Sephardic Jew]]s and [[Trappists]] migrated to the city in the 19th century and contributed to the early industrialisation of the region by building mills, breweries, brick factories, textile factories and other important structures.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe [[Mariastern Abbey, Banja Luka|Trappist monastery]] built in the 19th century lent its name to the neighbourhood of ''Trapisti'' and has left a large legacy in the area through its famous [[Trappista cheese|Trappist cheese]] and its beer production.\n\nIn 1835 and 1836, during Ottoman administration, numerous people from Banja Luka emigrated to [[Le\u0161nica, Serbia|Le\u0161nica]], [[Lipnica (Loznica)|Lipnica]] and [[Loznica]], the villages around Loznica, and to [[\u0160abac]].<ref>Jovan Cviji\u0107, Balkansko poluostrvo i ju\u017enoslovenske zemlje /Balkan Peninsula and South Slav Countries/ (Belgrade: Zavod za izdavanje ud\u017ebenika, 1966), pp. 151-152.</ref>\n\n===Austro-Hungarian rule===\nDespite its leading position in the region, Banja Luka as a city was not modernised until [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]] in the late 19th century. Railroads, schools, factories, and infrastructure appeared, and were developed, which turned Banja Luka into a modern city.\n\n===Yugoslavia===\nAfter World War I, the town became the capital of the [[Vrbas Banovina]], a province of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\nThe provincial capital owed its rapid progress to the first Ban Svetislav Milosavljevi\u0107.

Banja Luka is the centre of the government for the Municipality of Banja Luka. A number of entity and state institutions are seated in the city. The Republika Srpska Government and the [[National Assembly (Republika Srpska)|National Assembly]] are based in Banja Luka.\n\nThe Bosnia and Herzegovina State Agencies based in the city include the Indirect Taxation (VAT) Authority, the Deposit Insurance Agency as well as a branch of the [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (formerly the National Bank of Republika Srpska). [[Austria]], Croatia, France, Germany, [[Serbia]], the United Kingdom and the United States maintain diplomatic representation through [[Consul (representative)|consulates-general]] in Banja Luka.\n\n==Economy==\nIn 1981 Banja Luka's GDP per capita was 97% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book|title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju|year=1984|edition=3rd|publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber|location=Zagreb|language=Croatian|editor1-first=Radovan|editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107|editor2-first=Ivan|editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the city itself was not directly affected by the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, its economy was. In this period Banja Luka fell behind the world in key areas such as technology, resulting in a rather stagnant economy. However, in recent years, the financial services sector has gained in importance in the city. In 2002, the trading began on the newly established [[Banja Luka Stock Exchange]]. The number of companies listed, the trading volume and the number of investors have increased significantly. A number of big companies such as [[Telekom Srpske]], Rafinerija ulja Modri\u010da, [[Banjalu\u010dka Pivara]] and Vitaminka are all listed on the exchange and are traded regularly. Investors, apart from those from [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Serbia]], now include a number of investment funds from the EU, and from [[Norway]], the United States, Japan and China.\n\nA number of financial services regulators, such as the [[Republika Srpska Securities Commission]] and the RS Banking Agency are headquartered in Banja Luka. This, along with the fact that some of the major banks in Bosnia, the Deposit Insurance Agency and the [[value-added tax]] (VAT) authority are all based in the city, has helped Banja Luka establish itself as a major financial centre of the country.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n;Economic preview\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):<ref name=\"stats2018\">{{cite web |title=Cities and Municipalities of Republika Srpska |url=http://www2.rzs.rs.ba/static/uploads/bilteni/gradovi_i_opstine_republike_srpske/2019/Gradovi_I_Opstine_Republike_Srpske_2019_WEB.pdf |website=rzs.rs.ba |publisher=Republika Srspka Institute of Statistics |accessdate=31 December 2019 |format=PDF |date=25 December 2019}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!

The three football teams from Banja Luka are [[FK Borac Banja Luka|Borac Banja Luka]] (2010/2011 season champions of [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]), [[FK BSK Banja Luka|BSK Banja Luka]], and [[FK Omladinac Banja Luka|Omladinac Banja Luka]] (both in the [[First League of the Republika Srpska]]), FK Naprijed Banja Luka and FK Vrbas Banja Luka\n\n[[FK Borac Banja Luka]] is the most popular football club in the Republika Srpska. The club has won several major trophies in its history such as trophies as a champion of [[Mitropa Cup]], [[Yugoslav Cup]], [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup]], [[2007\u201308 First League of the Republika Srpska|First League of the Republika Srpska]], [[Republika Srpska Cup|Republic Srpska Cup]]. They have participated in [[UEFA Champions League]] and [[UEFA Europa League]].\n\nThe city has a long tradition of handball. [[RK Borac Banja Luka]] was the European Champion in 1976, the European Vice-Champion in 1975 and the winner of the IHF Cup in 1991.\n\nRecently, tennis has taken on a bigger role in the city. The local tennis tournament, [[Banja Luka Challenger|\"Memorijal Trive Vuji\u0107a\"]], has become professional and has been awarded [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] status in 2001, with the rank of a [[ATP Challenger Series|Challenger]]. The Banja Luka Challenger takes place in September each year. In 2005, the European Championships in [[Rafting]] were held on the Vrbas river.  In 2006, the [[Davis Cup]] matches of the Europe/Africa Zone Group III took place in the city. Since 2015, the city hosts the Banjaluka Half-marathon.\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:TranzitBL.jpg|thumb|right|Banja Luka west transit road]]\n[[File:Isto\u010dni tranzit, Banja Luka.jpg|thumb|Banja Luka east transit road]]\n[[File:BH Airlines - Banja Luka airport - Aug-10 v1.jpg|thumb|right|B&H Airlines [[ATR 72]] at Banja Luka airport preparing for the flight to Z\u00fcrich, August 2010]]\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki most Banja Luka.jpg|thumb|right|Banja Luka railway bridge over the river Vrbas, April 2020]]\n\nPublic transportation within Banja Luka is exclusively operated by the bus services. Over thirty bus lines connect downtown with the rest of the city and its suburbs. The oldest bus link in the city is line No 1. Taxis are also readily available. The expressway E-661 (locally known as M-16) leads north to [[Croatia]] from Banja Luka by way of [[Gradi\u0161ka, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gradi\u0161ka]], near the Bosnian/Croatian border. A wide range of bus services are available to most neighbouring and larger towns in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as to regional and European destinations such as Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, France, Italy, Montenegro, The Netherlands, Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland and Slovakia.\n\nBanja Luka is a minor hub of the railway services of [[Republika Srpska Railways|\u017deljeznice Republike Srpske]], which comprises one half of the railway network of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Services operate to most northern Bosnian towns, and two modern air-conditioned 'Talgo' trains run to [[Sarajevo]] every day. However, services are relatively slow and infrequent compared with neighbouring countries.\n\n[[Banja Luka International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: BNX, [[ICAO]]: LQBK) is located {{convert|23|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Banja Luka. The airport is served by [[Air Serbia]], which operates flights to [[Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport|Belgrade]] and summer charters to [[Antalya Airport|Antalya]] and [[Athens International Airport|Athens]], while [[Ryanair]] operates flights to [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport|Brussels]], [[Memmingen Airport|Memmingen]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Berlin]] and [[Stockholm Skavsta Airport|Stockholm]].
