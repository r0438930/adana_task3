At the time, [[Gaelic Ireland]] was made up of several kingdoms, with a [[High King of Ireland|High King]] claiming lordship over the lesser kings. The Norman invasion was a watershed in the history of Ireland, marking the beginning of more than 800 years of direct English and, later, British involvement in Ireland.\n\nIn May 1169, Anglo-Norman mercenaries landed in Ireland at the request of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] (Dermot MacMurragh), the [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] [[List of kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]], who had sought their help in regaining his kingdom. Diarmait and the Normans seized Leinster within weeks and launched raids into neighbouring kingdoms. This military intervention had the backing of King [[Henry II of England]] and was sanctioned by [[Pope Adrian IV]]. \n\nIn the summer of 1170 there were two further Norman landings, led by the Anglo-Norman [[Earl of Pembroke#The first creation: de Clare (1138)|Earl of Pembroke]], [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard \"Strongbow\" de Clare]]. By May 1171, Strongbow had assumed control of Leinster and seized the [[Norse-Irish]] city kingdoms of Dublin, Waterford, and Wexford. That summer, High King [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] (Rory O'Connor) led an Irish counteroffensive against the Normans, who nevertheless managed to hold most of their conquered territory. In October 1171, King Henry landed with a large army in Ireland to establish control over both the Anglo-Normans and the Irish. The Norman lords handed their conquered territory to Henry. He let Strongbow hold Leinster in [[fief]] and declared the cities to be [[crown land]]. Many Irish kings also submitted to him, likely in the hope that he would curb Norman expansion. Henry, however, granted the unconquered kingdom of [[Kingdom of Meath|Meath]] to [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]]. After Henry's departure in 1172, Norman expansion and Irish counteroffensives continued.\n\nThe 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] acknowledged Henry as overlord of the conquered territory and Ruaidr\u00ed as overlord of the rest of Ireland, with Ruaidr\u00ed also swearing [[fealty]] to Henry. However, the Treaty soon fell apart; the Anglo-Norman lords continued to invade Irish kingdoms and they attacked the Normans in turn. In 1177, Henry adopted a new policy. He declared his son [[John, King of England|John]] to be \"Lord of Ireland\" (i.e. of the whole country) and authorised the Norman lords to conquer more land. The territory they held became the [[Lordship of Ireland]] and formed part of the [[Angevin Empire]]. The largely successful nature of the invasion has been attributed to a number of factors. These include the Normans' military superiority and castle-building; the lack of a unified opposition from the Irish; and the support of the [[Catholic Church]] for Henry's intervention.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Kenneth L. |title=Ireland's History: Prehistory to the Present |publisher=A & C Black |year=2013 |pages=59}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn the 12th century, [[Gaelic Ireland]] was made up of several over-kingdoms, which each comprised several lesser kingdoms. At the top was the High King, who received tribute from the other kings but did not rule Ireland as a [[unitary state]]. The five port towns of [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]], [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], and [[Limerick]] were inhabited by the [[Norse\u2013Gaels|Norse-Irish]] and had their own rulers.\n \nThe Normans [[Norman conquest of England|conquered England]] between 1066 and 1075, with all earldoms thereafter held by Normans, as were all [[Bishopric|bishoprics]] after 1096.  In parallel, the [[Treaty of Abernethy]] created a limited settlement between the Norman conquerors and Scotland, with lands in Cumbria exchanged for peace. Over the following decades, Norman lords [[Norman invasion of Wales|conquered much of south Wales]] and established their own semi-independent lordships there. According to historian [[John Gillingham]], after the Norman conquest, an imperialist attitude emerged among England's new elite, and they came to view their Celtic neighbours as inferior and barbarous.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gillingham |first=John |title=The English in the Twelfth Century  |publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd |year=2000 |pages=42\u201343, 145}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1155, King Henry II of England held a council at Winchester. According to [[Robert of Torigni]], Henry discussed plans to invade Ireland and grant it to his brother [[William FitzEmpress]]. However, the plans were put on hold, allegedly due to opposition from his mother, the [[Empress Matilda]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Duffy|first=Se\u00e1n|editor=Christopher Harper-Bill|title=Henry II: New Interpretations|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2007|chapter=Henry II and England's Insular Neighbours|pages=132\u2013133}}</ref>\n\n{{wikisource|Laudabiliter}}\nSome of the initiative for invasion may have come from Anglo-Norman church leaders \u2013 especially [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] \u2013 who wanted to control the Irish church.<ref>Martin (2008), p.57</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Crooks |first=Peter |year=2005 |chapter=Anglo-Irish Relations |editor=Se\u00e1n Duffy |title=Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=27}}</ref><ref name=carpenter>{{cite book |last=Carpenter|first=David|title=The Struggle for Mastery: Britain 1066\u20131284|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|pages=218\u2013219}}</ref> That same year, [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only English pope) issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', which authorised Henry to conquer Ireland as a means of promoting the [[Gregorian Reform]]s in the Irish church.<ref>Austin Lane Poole.

However, implementing the reforms was slow and difficult. It \"would demand the abandonment of features of Gaelic society going back to pre-Christian times and of practises which had been accepted for centuries by the church in Ireland.\" These included attitudes towards marriage, clerical celibacy, the sacramental system, and control of church lands.<ref>Martin (2008), p.58</ref>\n\n[[John of Salisbury]], Secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, spoke in Rome about the \"barbaric and impious\" people of Ireland. In 1149, influential French abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] had written a book about [[Saint Malachy]], in which he described Ireland as barbaric and semi-pagan. According to historian [[F. X. Martin]], Ireland was \"barbaric\" in Bernard's eyes simply because it \"had retained its own culture and had remained outside the Latin secular world\". John and Bernard's depiction of Ireland, rather than the truth about its reforms, became established throughout Europe.<ref>Martin (2008), p.59</ref>\n\n==Landings of 1169==\n[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 175 - Henry Authorizes Dermod to Levy Forces.jpg|thumb|250px|\"Henry authorizes Dermod to levy forces\", from ''A Chronicle of England'' (1864) by [[James William Edmund Doyle|James Doyle]]]]\nIn 1166, Diarmait Mac Murchada (Dermot MacMurragh) was ousted as king of Leinster by a coalition led by the High King, Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair (Rory O'Connor), and the King of [[Kingdom of Breifne|Breffny]], [[Tigern\u00e1n Ua Ruairc]] (Tiernan O'Rourke). However, he was allowed to remain chief of his home territory, [[U\u00ed Ceinnselaig]] (Hy-Kinsellagh).\n\nDiarmait fled Ireland and sought help from Henry II in regaining the kingship of Leinster. Henry gave Diarmait permission to recruit mercenaries and authorised his subjects to help Diarmait. In return, Diarmait was required to swear loyalty to Henry.<ref>Martin (2008), pp.64\u201365</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Marcher Lord]]s agreed to help: [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard de Clare]] (also known as Strongbow), [[Robert FitzStephen]], [[Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan|Maurice FitzGerald]], and [[Maurice de Prendergast]]. Diarmait promised Strongbow his daughter [[Aoife MacMurrough|Ao\u00edfe]] in marriage and the kingship of Leinster upon Diarmait's death. He promised Robert and Maurice the town of Wexford and two neighbouring [[cantred]]s. Under Irish law, Diarmait had no right to do this. Having secured their help, he returned to U\u00ed Ceinnselaig in 1167 and awaited the arrival of the mercenaries.<ref>Martin (2008), pp.65\u201366</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1169, Robert FitzStephen and Maurice de Prendergast landed at [[Bannow]] Bay, on the south coast of County Wexford, with a force of at least 40 knights, 60 men-at-arms and 360 archers.<ref>Martin (2008), pp.68\u201369</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor1=Moody, T.

They set about conquering Leinster and the territories Diarmait had claimed sovereignty over.

They then raided and plundered the territories of north Leinster, which had refused to submit to Diarmait.<ref name=martin70>Martin (2008), p.70</ref> They also raided the neighbouring kingdom of [[Kingdom of Ossory|Ossory]], defeating the forces of king Donnchad Mac Gilla Patraic (Donagh MacGillapatrick) in the battle of [[Freshford, County Kilkenny|Achad \u00dar]]. However, Donnchad withdrew his forces to safety and remained defiant.<ref name=martin70/>\n\nIn response, High King Ruaidr\u00ed led an army into Leinster to confront Diarmait and the Normans.

These captives were then executed: the Normans broke their limbs before beheading them and throwing their bodies off the cliff.<ref name=martin74/>\n\nOn 23 August, Strongbow landed at [[Passage East|Passage]] with at least 200 knights and 1,000 soldiers.<ref name=martin75>Martin (2008), p.75</ref> They met with Raymond's force and assaulted Waterford. The walls were eventually breached and there followed fierce fighting in the streets, in which 700 defenders were killed.<ref name=martin75/> Diarmait and the other Norman commanders arrived in Waterford and there Strongbow married Diarmait's daughter, Ao\u00edfe.<ref>Martin (2008), p.76</ref>\n\nThe Normans and Diarmait held a council of war at Waterford and agreed to take Dublin. High King Ruaidr\u00ed deployed a large army near Dublin to intercept them. As well as soldiers from Connacht, it included troops from Breffny (led by King Tigern\u00e1n), Meath (led by King M\u00e1el Sechlainn), and [[Airg\u00edalla|Oriel]] (led by King Murchad Ua Cerbaill). The Normans and Diarmait bypassed them by travelling over the [[Wicklow Mountains]], forcing Ruaidr\u00ed's army to abandon their plans.<ref>Martin (2008), p.77</ref>\n\nWhen they reached Dublin, Diarmait began negotiations with its king, [[Ascall mac Ragnaill]] (Ascall MacRannall). On 21 September, while talks were ongoing, a force of Normans\u2014led by [[Miles de Cogan]] and Raymond FitzGerald\u2014stormed the town and took it. Ascall and his followers fled in their ships but vowed to re-take the town.<ref>Martin (2008), p.78</ref> Strongbow and Diarmait then launched \"a devastating campaign\" through Meath and into Breffny, burning [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]], [[Abbey of Kells|Kells]], and several other monastic towns. In response to these violations of the Ferns agreement, Ruaidr\u00ed executed three hostages, including Diarmait's son.<ref name=\"martin79\"/>\n\n===Irish counteroffensive of 1171===\nDiarmait returned to Ferns and died there suddenly in May 1171.<ref name=martin79>Martin (2008), p.79</ref> Strongbow thus declared himself king of Leinster. However, he had no right to do this under Gaelic law and he was opposed by Diarmait's brother Murchad.<ref name=martin79/>\n\nShortly after Diarmait's death, the Anglo-Normans faced a general rising, both from within Leinster and from outside.<ref name=martin79/> The Irish of [[Kingdom of Desmond|Desmond]] launched a devastating attack on Norman-held Waterford.<ref name=martin79/> At about the same time, a Norse-Gaelic army, in a fleet of at least 60 ships, landed outside Dublin. Led by Ascall, they tried to re-take the town, but were repulsed by de Cogan's forces. Ascall was captured and publicly executed.<ref>Martin (2008), p.82</ref>\n\nA great army, led by Ruaidr\u00ed, surrounded Dublin. It comprised troops from most of the Irish kingdoms: contingents from Connacht, Breffny (led by King Tigern\u00e1n), Meath (led by King M\u00e1el Sechlainn), [[Thomond]] (led by King [[Domnall M\u00f3r Ua Briain|Domnall Ua Briain]]), Oriel (led by King Murchad Ua Cerbaill), [[Ulaid|Ulster]] (led by King Magnus Mac Duinnsl\u00e9ibe), and Leinster (led by Murchad Mac Murchada).<ref name=martin83>Martin (2008), p.83</ref> A Norse-Gaelic fleet of 30 ships, sent by [[Godred Olafsson]], blockaded Dublin bay.<ref name=martin83/> Robert FitzStephen sent his best troops out of Wexford to help the Anglo-Norman garrison in Dublin. The remaining garrison in Wexford was then attacked and forced out of the town. The Normans fled to a military encampment at nearby Carrick, where they were besieged.<ref name=martin83/> The siege of Dublin went on for two months. There were several skirmishes, but the Irish were apparently content to starve out the Normans.<ref name=martin84>Martin (2008), p.84</ref>\n\nWith Dublin and Carrick under siege, Strongbow and his council agreed to negotiate. Strongbow proposed that if the Anglo-Normans be allowed to keep what they had conquered, they would acknowledge Ruaidr\u00ed as their overlord. Ruaidr\u00ed responded that he would only allow the Normans to keep Dublin, Wexford, and Waterford.<ref name=martin84/> This was unacceptable to Strongbow. A Norman sortie slipped out of Dublin and made a surprise attack on Ruaidr\u00ed's camp at [[Castleknock]]. The Normans killed hundreds of soldiers, many of whom were resting or bathing, and seized supplies.<ref name=martin85>Martin (2008), p.85</ref> Following this defeat, the Irish army withdrew. In the meantime, FitzStephen had surrendered to the Norse-Irish at Carrick.

He wanted to establish his control over both the Norman warlords and the Irish. Henry apparently feared that Strongbow would set up an independent kingdom in Ireland, but Strongbow's actions were merely a catalyst for Henry's invasion.<ref name=carpenter/> Historian Peter Crooks writes that, \"No less than his predecessors, Henry II was happy to add Ireland to his empire.\"<ref>Crooks (2005), p.27</ref> Henry, as [[William of Newburgh]] put it, wanted to have \"the glory of such a famous conquest\" and its proceeds for himself.<ref name=carpenter/>\n\nOn [[17 October]] 1171, King Henry landed at Waterford with a large army of at least 500 mounted knights and 4,000 men-at-arms and archers.

At the time, [[Gaelic Ireland]] was made up of several kingdoms, with a [[High King of Ireland|High King]] claiming lordship over the lesser kings. The Norman invasion was a watershed in the history of Ireland, marking the beginning of more than 800 years of direct English and, later, British involvement in Ireland.\n\nIn May 1169, Anglo-Norman mercenaries landed in Ireland at the request of [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]] (Dermot MacMurragh), the [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] [[List of kings of Leinster|King of Leinster]], who had sought their help in regaining his kingdom. Diarmait and the Normans seized Leinster within weeks and launched raids into neighbouring kingdoms. This military intervention had the backing of King [[Henry II of England]] and was sanctioned by [[Pope Adrian IV]]. \n\nIn the summer of 1170 there were two further Norman landings, led by the Anglo-Norman [[Earl of Pembroke#The first creation: de Clare (1138)|Earl of Pembroke]], [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard \"Strongbow\" de Clare]]. By May 1171, Strongbow had assumed control of Leinster and seized the [[Norse-Irish]] city kingdoms of Dublin, Waterford, and Wexford. That summer, High King [[Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair]] (Rory O'Connor) led an Irish counteroffensive against the Normans, who nevertheless managed to hold most of their conquered territory. In October 1171, King Henry landed with a large army in Ireland to establish control over both the Anglo-Normans and the Irish. The Norman lords handed their conquered territory to Henry. He let Strongbow hold Leinster in [[fief]] and declared the cities to be [[crown land]]. Many Irish kings also submitted to him, likely in the hope that he would curb Norman expansion. Henry, however, granted the unconquered kingdom of [[Kingdom of Meath|Meath]] to [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Hugh de Lacy]]. After Henry's departure in 1172, Norman expansion and Irish counteroffensives continued.\n\nThe 1175 [[Treaty of Windsor (1175)|Treaty of Windsor]] acknowledged Henry as overlord of the conquered territory and Ruaidr\u00ed as overlord of the rest of Ireland, with Ruaidr\u00ed also swearing [[fealty]] to Henry. However, the Treaty soon fell apart; the Anglo-Norman lords continued to invade Irish kingdoms and they attacked the Normans in turn. In 1177, Henry adopted a new policy. He declared his son [[John, King of England|John]] to be \"Lord of Ireland\" (i.e. of the whole country) and authorised the Norman lords to conquer more land. The territory they held became the [[Lordship of Ireland]] and formed part of the [[Angevin Empire]]. The largely successful nature of the invasion has been attributed to a number of factors. These include the Normans' military superiority and castle-building; the lack of a unified opposition from the Irish; and the support of the [[Catholic Church]] for Henry's intervention.<ref>{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Kenneth L. |title=Ireland's History: Prehistory to the Present |publisher=A & C Black |year=2013 |pages=59}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn the 12th century, [[Gaelic Ireland]] was made up of several over-kingdoms, which each comprised several lesser kingdoms. At the top was the High King, who received tribute from the other kings but did not rule Ireland as a [[unitary state]]. The five port towns of [[Kingdom of Dublin|Dublin]], [[Wexford]], [[Waterford]], [[Cork (city)|Cork]], and [[Limerick]] were inhabited by the [[Norse\u2013Gaels|Norse-Irish]] and had their own rulers.\n \nThe Normans [[Norman conquest of England|conquered England]] between 1066 and 1075, with all earldoms thereafter held by Normans, as were all [[Bishopric|bishoprics]] after 1096.  In parallel, the [[Treaty of Abernethy]] created a limited settlement between the Norman conquerors and Scotland, with lands in Cumbria exchanged for peace. Over the following decades, Norman lords [[Norman invasion of Wales|conquered much of south Wales]] and established their own semi-independent lordships there. According to historian [[John Gillingham]], after the Norman conquest, an imperialist attitude emerged among England's new elite, and they came to view their Celtic neighbours as inferior and barbarous.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gillingham |first=John |title=The English in the Twelfth Century  |publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd |year=2000 |pages=42\u201343, 145}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1155, King Henry II of England held a council at Winchester. According to [[Robert of Torigni]], Henry discussed plans to invade Ireland and grant it to his brother [[William FitzEmpress]]. However, the plans were put on hold, allegedly due to opposition from his mother, the [[Empress Matilda]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Duffy|first=Se\u00e1n|editor=Christopher Harper-Bill|title=Henry II: New Interpretations|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2007|chapter=Henry II and England's Insular Neighbours|pages=132\u2013133}}</ref>\n\n{{wikisource|Laudabiliter}}\nSome of the initiative for invasion may have come from Anglo-Norman church leaders \u2013 especially [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] \u2013 who wanted to control the Irish church.<ref>Martin (2008), p.57</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Crooks |first=Peter |year=2005 |chapter=Anglo-Irish Relations |editor=Se\u00e1n Duffy |title=Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |pages=27}}</ref><ref name=carpenter>{{cite book |last=Carpenter|first=David|title=The Struggle for Mastery: Britain 1066\u20131284|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|pages=218\u2013219}}</ref> That same year, [[Pope Adrian IV]] (the only English pope) issued the [[papal bull]] ''[[Laudabiliter]]'', which authorised Henry to conquer Ireland as a means of promoting the [[Gregorian Reform]]s in the Irish church.<ref>Austin Lane Poole.

However, implementing the reforms was slow and difficult. It \"would demand the abandonment of features of Gaelic society going back to pre-Christian times and of practises which had been accepted for centuries by the church in Ireland.\" These included attitudes towards marriage, clerical celibacy, the sacramental system, and control of church lands.<ref>Martin (2008), p.58</ref>\n\n[[John of Salisbury]], Secretary to the Archbishop of Canterbury, spoke in Rome about the \"barbaric and impious\" people of Ireland.

Martin]], Ireland was \"barbaric\" in Bernard's eyes simply because it \"had retained its own culture and had remained outside the Latin secular world\".

This was the advance guard for Strongbow's army and was to be the springboard for an assault on Waterford.<ref name=martin73>Martin (2008), p.73</ref> Raymond's force occupied an old [[promontory fort]] at Baginbun and plundered the surrounding countryside.<ref name=martin73/> They were then besieged by a much larger force of Irish and Norse. The outnumbered Anglo-Normans drove a large herd of cattle into the opposing army.<ref name=martin74>Martin (2008), p.74</ref> In the ensuing havoc, the Normans routed the besiegers, killing up to 500 and capturing 70. These captives were then executed: the Normans broke their limbs before beheading them and throwing their bodies off the cliff.<ref name=martin74/>\n\nOn 23 August, Strongbow landed at [[Passage East|Passage]] with at least 200 knights and 1,000 soldiers.<ref name=martin75>Martin (2008), p.75</ref> They met with Raymond's force and assaulted Waterford. The walls were eventually breached and there followed fierce fighting in the streets, in which 700 defenders were killed.<ref name=martin75/> Diarmait and the other Norman commanders arrived in Waterford and there Strongbow married Diarmait's daughter, Ao\u00edfe.<ref>Martin (2008), p.76</ref>\n\nThe Normans and Diarmait held a council of war at Waterford and agreed to take Dublin. High King Ruaidr\u00ed deployed a large army near Dublin to intercept them. As well as soldiers from Connacht, it included troops from Breffny (led by King Tigern\u00e1n), Meath (led by King M\u00e1el Sechlainn), and [[Airg\u00edalla|Oriel]] (led by King Murchad Ua Cerbaill). The Normans and Diarmait bypassed them by travelling over the [[Wicklow Mountains]], forcing Ruaidr\u00ed's army to abandon their plans.<ref>Martin (2008), p.77</ref>\n\nWhen they reached Dublin, Diarmait began negotiations with its king, [[Ascall mac Ragnaill]] (Ascall MacRannall). On 21 September, while talks were ongoing, a force of Normans\u2014led by [[Miles de Cogan]] and Raymond FitzGerald\u2014stormed the town and took it. Ascall and his followers fled in their ships but vowed to re-take the town.<ref>Martin (2008), p.78</ref> Strongbow and Diarmait then launched \"a devastating campaign\" through Meath and into Breffny, burning [[Clonard Abbey|Clonard]], [[Abbey of Kells|Kells]], and several other monastic towns. In response to these violations of the Ferns agreement, Ruaidr\u00ed executed three hostages, including Diarmait's son.<ref name=\"martin79\"/>\n\n===Irish counteroffensive of 1171===\nDiarmait returned to Ferns and died there suddenly in May 1171.<ref name=martin79>Martin (2008), p.79</ref> Strongbow thus declared himself king of Leinster. However, he had no right to do this under Gaelic law and he was opposed by Diarmait's brother Murchad.<ref name=martin79/>\n\nShortly after Diarmait's death, the Anglo-Normans faced a general rising, both from within Leinster and from outside.<ref name=martin79/> The Irish of [[Kingdom of Desmond|Desmond]] launched a devastating attack on Norman-held Waterford.<ref name=martin79/> At about the same time, a Norse-Gaelic army, in a fleet of at least 60 ships, landed outside Dublin. Led by Ascall, they tried to re-take the town, but were repulsed by de Cogan's forces. Ascall was captured and publicly executed.<ref>Martin (2008), p.82</ref>\n\nA great army, led by Ruaidr\u00ed, surrounded Dublin. It comprised troops from most of the Irish kingdoms: contingents from Connacht, Breffny (led by King Tigern\u00e1n), Meath (led by King M\u00e1el Sechlainn), [[Thomond]] (led by King [[Domnall M\u00f3r Ua Briain|Domnall Ua Briain]]), Oriel (led by King Murchad Ua Cerbaill), [[Ulaid|Ulster]] (led by King Magnus Mac Duinnsl\u00e9ibe), and Leinster (led by Murchad Mac Murchada).<ref name=martin83>Martin (2008), p.83</ref> A Norse-Gaelic fleet of 30 ships, sent by [[Godred Olafsson]], blockaded Dublin bay.<ref name=martin83/> Robert FitzStephen sent his best troops out of Wexford to help the Anglo-Norman garrison in Dublin. The remaining garrison in Wexford was then attacked and forced out of the town. The Normans fled to a military encampment at nearby Carrick, where they were besieged.<ref name=martin83/> The siege of Dublin went on for two months. There were several skirmishes, but the Irish were apparently content to starve out the Normans.<ref name=martin84>Martin (2008), p.84</ref>\n\nWith Dublin and Carrick under siege, Strongbow and his council agreed to negotiate. Strongbow proposed that if the Anglo-Normans be allowed to keep what they had conquered, they would acknowledge Ruaidr\u00ed as their overlord. Ruaidr\u00ed responded that he would only allow the Normans to keep Dublin, Wexford, and Waterford.<ref name=martin84/> This was unacceptable to Strongbow. A Norman sortie slipped out of Dublin and made a surprise attack on Ruaidr\u00ed's camp at [[Castleknock]]. The Normans killed hundreds of soldiers, many of whom were resting or bathing, and seized supplies.<ref name=martin85>Martin (2008), p.85</ref> Following this defeat, the Irish army withdrew. In the meantime, FitzStephen had surrendered to the Norse-Irish at Carrick. When they learned that Strongbow was on his way, they burnt Wexford and withdrew to a nearby island with FitzStephen as a hostage.<ref name=martin85/>\n\n==Henry's invasion of 1171==\n[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 180 - Henry at Waterford.jpg|thumb|250px|\"Henry at Waterford\", from ''A Chronicle of England'' (1864) by James Doyle]]\nBy September 1171, King Henry had decided to lead a military expedition to Ireland. He wanted to establish his control over both the Norman warlords and the Irish. Henry apparently feared that Strongbow would set up an independent kingdom in Ireland, but Strongbow's actions were merely a catalyst for Henry's invasion.<ref name=carpenter/> Historian Peter Crooks writes that, \"No less than his predecessors, Henry II was happy to add Ireland to his empire.\"<ref>Crooks (2005), p.27</ref> Henry, as [[William of Newburgh]] put it, wanted to have \"the glory of such a famous conquest\" and its proceeds for himself.<ref name=carpenter/>\n\nOn [[17 October]] 1171, King Henry landed at Waterford with a large army of at least 500 mounted knights and 4,000 men-at-arms and archers. Several [[siege tower]]s were also shipped over.<ref>Martin (2008), p.87</ref> This was the first time that a reigning King of England had set foot on Irish soil, and marked the beginning of [[Angevin kings of England|Angevin]], [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]], [[House of Tudor|Tudor]], [[House of Stuart|Stuart]], [[House of Orange-Nassau|Orange-Nassau]], [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]], and later British rule in Ireland.\n\nThe Norman warlords affirmed their loyalty to Henry and handed over the territory they had conquered to him. He let Strongbow hold Leinster [[Fief|in fief]] and declared Dublin, Wexford and Waterford to be [[crown land]].<ref>Martin (2008), p.88</ref> Fifteen Irish kings and chiefs submitted to Henry, likely in the hope that he would curb unprovoked Norman expansion into their territories.<ref name=duffy138>{{cite book |last=Duffy|first=Se\u00e1n|editor=Christopher Harper-Bill|title=Henry II: New Interpretations|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2007|chapter=Henry II and England's Insular Neighbours|pages=138}}</ref> Those who did not submit included Ruaidr\u00ed<ref name=duffy138/> (the High King and king of Connacht) and the kings of Meath and the [[Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]].<ref name=carpenter/> Against this, the [[Annals of Tigernach]] stated that the kings' submissions to Henry II were in two stages; firstly in Waterford by the [[List of monarchs of Desmond|king of]] [[Kingdom of Desmond|Desmond]], and then in Dublin by the kings of [[List of kings of Leinster|Leinster]], [[Kingdom of Meath|Meath]], [[Kingdom of Breifne|Breifne]], [[Kings of Airg\u00edalla|Airg\u00edalla]] and [[List of kings of Ulster|Ulster]].<ref>At \u00a7T1171.12: \"''Henry arrived in Ireland at Waterford a week before Samhain, and Diarmaid Mac Carthaigh, king of Desmond, submitted to him.
