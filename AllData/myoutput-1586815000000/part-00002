Its construction began in the early 19th century and replaced an earlier church structure that fell into ruin. The church was listed as a historic structure by [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] (IPHAN) in 1960.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"i\"/><ref name=\"iphan\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe [[Jesuits]] traveled up the Paraguacu River from Salvador in approximately 1561 and founded a small settlement. It is now known as the Iguape district of Cachoeira. The church complex built by the Jesuits fell into ruin; the present structure dates to the first half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"i\"/>\n\n==Location==\n\nThe Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape is located on the Iguape inlet, sometimes called a lake, of the Paragua\u00e7u River. The facade of the church and its entrance faces the river. The rear of the church faces the community of Iguape and lacks an entrance.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape was constructed of mixed masonry of stone and brick. Its frontispiece is \"extremely elegant\"<ref name=\"hpip\"/> and is in the rococo Dona Maria I style. It is divided by sandstone pilasters, five portals superimposed by five windows at the choir level. The portals and windows are framed in ''lioz'' stone imported from Portugal; they have elaborate garland decoration borders. The facade is surmounted by an ornate baroque-style pediment. The church has two bell towers with gables at each side of the pediment. The bell gables have bulbous towers covered in glazed china fragments and azulejos, a feature found in numerous churches in Salvador and Rec\u00f4ncavo region.<ref name=\"iphan\"/>\n\nThe east, west, and rear facades of the church were never completed and lack any ornamentation.\n\n===Interior===\n\nThe interior of the church has a rectangular plan with a single [[nave]]. It has two side aisles superposed by [[Tribune (architecture)|tribunes]] and a transversal [[sacristy]]; these are features common to churches of the period.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"iphan\"/>\n\nThe interior has few decorative features and is considered unfinished. The chancel arch, balconies of the tribunes, and presbytery have simple [[ashlar]] facings; a lavabo is located in the sacristy. The chancel has semi-industrial tiles imported from Portugal in blue and white.<ref name=\"iphan\"/>\n\n==Protected status==\n\nThe Parish Church of Santiago do Iguape was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1960.
