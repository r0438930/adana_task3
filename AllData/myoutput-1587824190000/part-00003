The original series, '''''The $10,000 Pyramid''''', debuted on March 26, 1973,<ref name=EW>{{cite news|title=A Dick Clark appreciation: The deceptively laid-back, conservative revolutionary|author=Ken Tucker|date=April 18, 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2012/04/18/dick-clark-american-bandstand-pyramid-rockin-eve/|accessdate=June 28, 2016}}</ref> and spawned seven subsequent ''Pyramid'' series. Most later series featured a full title format matching the original series, with the title reflecting an increasing top prize. The game features two contestants, each paired with a celebrity. Contestants attempt to guess a series of words or phrases based on descriptions given to them by their teammates. The title refers to the show's pyramid-shaped gameboard, featuring six categories arranged in a triangular fashion. The various ''Pyramid'' series have won a total of nine [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]]s for Outstanding Game Show, second only to ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', which has won 13.\n\n[[Dick Clark]] is the host most commonly associated with the show, having hosted the network daytime version from 1973 to 1980 (which moved from CBS to ABC in 1974, and increased its namesake top prize from $10,000 to $20,000 in 1976) and its revival from 1982 to 1988 on CBS ('''''The (New) $25,000 Pyramid'''''). \nClark also hosted two weeknight syndicated versions, '''''The $50,000 Pyramid''''' in 1981 and '''''The $100,000 Pyramid''''' from 1985 to 1988 (concurrent with the daytime show).\n\n[[Bill Cullen]] hosted the first weekly nighttime version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' from 1974 to 1979. [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] hosted a revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' in 1991, and [[Donny Osmond]] hosted a version simply titled '''''Pyramid''''' from 2002 to 2004; both were five-nights-a-week affairs. [[Game Show Network|GSN]]'s '''''The Pyramid''''', hosted by [[Mike Richards (television personality)|Mike Richards]], who now is an executive at format owner, [[Sony Pictures Television]], aired a single forty-episode season in 2012.\n\nThe current revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' debuted June 26, 2016, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] with [[Michael Strahan]] as host, and has aired on Sunday nights during the summer months since, completing its fourth season in September 2019.\n\nOn November 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a fifth season.  Originally set for June 2020, Season 5 has been indefinitely delayed as a byproduct of the [[COVID-19]] outbreak as production was to have started in April 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC Renews \"Summer Fun & Games\" for 2020|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/11/20/abc-renews-summer-fun-and-games-for-2020-867314/20191120abc01/|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|date=November 20, 2019}}</ref>\n<REF>[https://tvline.com/2020/04/14/press-your-luck-season-2-premiere-date-abc-match-game/]</REF> <REF>[http://buzzerblog.com/2020/03/17/upcoming-game-show-schedules-impacted-by-coronavirus/] </REF>\n\n==History==\n===Broadcast history===\n[[File:Dick Clark $10000 Pyramid.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Dick Clark as host of ''The $10,000 Pyramid''.]]\n''The $10,000 Pyramid'', with host [[Dick Clark]], made its network debut on March 26, 1973<ref name=EW/> and was a ratings hit, sustaining its ratings even when episodes were delayed or preempted by the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] hearings. A year later, the ratings temporarily declined (against the original version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' on [[NBC]]) and CBS canceled it. The show was quickly picked up by ABC and began airing on that network on May 6, 1974. As per CBS custom at the time with celebrity game shows, three weeks of episodes for CBS were taped in [[Hollywood]] at [[CBS Television City]], Studio 31.<ref name=\"Shows\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows |title=Shows |publisher=CBS Television City |date=1954-09-07 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> The remainder of the CBS episodes originated in New York City at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], moving to ABC's Elysee Theatre after ''Pyramid'' switched networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2931|title=Elysee Theatre|website=Cinematreasures.org}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on January 19, 1976, the series doubled its top prize and was retitled ''The $20,000 Pyramid''. From October 1 to November 9, 1979, the series briefly became ''Junior Partner Pyramid'', which scrapped the usual celebrity-contestant pairings in favor of children playing the game with a parent or other adult relative. Its last episode aired June 27, 1980, with ''[[Family Feud]]'' subsequently moving up a half-hour to take over the 12:00 noon (EST) slot formerly occupied by ''The $20,000 Pyramid''.\n[[Image:$25,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title card of the 1980s ''(New) $25,000 Pyramid''.]]\nOn September 20, 1982, the series returned to the CBS daytime lineup as ''The (New) $25,000 Pyramid'', again with Clark as host, but now taped in Los Angeles full-time at [[CBS Television City]]'s Studio 33 (currently used for ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price is Right]]'', now known as the \"[[Bob Barker]] Studio\") and remained there for the entire run up until December 31, 1987. ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' began airing in the series' 10:00&nbsp;a.m. timeslot the following Monday, but that show was canceled after 13 weeks of episodes. On April 4, 1988, ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' returned to the CBS daytime schedule, but only for 13 more weeks. The show's final episode aired on July 1. The following Monday, the show was replaced by a revival of ''Family Feud'' hosted by [[Ray Combs]].\n\nConcurrent with the network show's run, several nighttime versions of the show were sold to local stations through [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]: the original ''$25,000 Pyramid'' and ''The $50,000 Pyramid'' were taped in the Elysee Theatre in New York, and the original version of ''The $100,000 Pyramid''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/81903/10-fun-facts-about-100000-pyramid|title=10 Fun Facts About '$100,000 Pyramid'|website=Mentalfloss.com|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref> taped at Studio 33 in Hollywood. A revival of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', hosted by [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]], ran from January until December 1991 and taped in Studio 31.<ref name=\"Shows\"/> ''Pyramid'', hosted by [[Donny Osmond]], ran from September 16, 2002 to September 10, 2004 and was taped at [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California]]. ''The Pyramid'' was taped at the [[CBS Studio Center]].  Strahan's ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' is taped at the ABC Television Center in New York.\n\n===Later developments===\nIn late 1996, [[Sony Pictures Television]] (then-[[Columbia TriStar Television]]) produced a pilot for a new version of ''Pyramid'', with [[Mark Walberg]] as host, which featured a format radically different from the earlier versions, including an increase of the number of celebrities to six, each of which would be assigned to a different main game subject. It did not sell, but Sony tried again the following year, this time with [[Chuck Woolery]] at the helm and a format closer to the original, although the six-celebrity motif from the previous pilot remained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgameshows.net/x.php?show=Pyramid1997&sort=0|title=The Game Show Pilot Light: Pyramid (1997)}}</ref> This version also failed to sell, but two years later, after the success of its series ''[[Rock and Roll Jeopardy!]]'' on [[VH1]], Sony attempted to give ''Pyramid'' similar treatment with a 1999 pilot called ''Pyramid Rocks''. Hosted by [[Bil Dwyer]], the format likewise attempted to incorporate music into the game, but proved no more successful than the previous two attempts at reviving the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/2016/01/09/watch-celebrate-pyramids-return-with-the-unsold-vh1-pilot-pyramid-rocks/|title=Watch: Celebrate Pyramid's Return With the Unsold VH1 Pilot \"Pyramid Rocks\"}}</ref>\n\nFollowing CBS's cancellation of ''[[Guiding Light]]'' in April 2009, ''Pyramid'' was one of three potential series considered as a replacement for the veteran soap opera. (''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' and ''[[The Dating Game]] as The New Dating Game or The Newlywed Game or The New Newlywed Game'' were the other two, with a pilot shot for the former series.) During the tapings that took place in June of that year at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in New York, the top prize was raised to a potential $1,000,000 with a tournament format similar to the $100,000 format.  [[Dean Cain]] and [[Tim Vincent]] were tapped as hosts of the pilots, with ''$50,000'' announcer Alan Kalter returning, and Sony Pictures game show legend [[Ken Jennings]] served as a panelist in the pilots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/set-report-from-the-1000000-pyramid|title=Set Report from \"The $1,000,000 Pyramid\" |date=June 25, 2009|website=Buzzerblog.com|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCBS passed on ''Pyramid'' and opted to pick up ''Let's Make a Deal'', hosted by [[Wayne Brady]], as ''Guiding Light's'' replacement. Several months later, in December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of another long-running soap opera, ''[[As the World Turns]]''. ''Pyramid'' was once again among the series being considered as a potential replacement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gameshows.about.com/b/2009/12/08/will-we-get-pyramid-back-after-all-atwt-is-toast.htm |title=About.com\u2014New York Times\u2014Will We Get Pyramid Back After All? |publisher=Gameshows.about.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> CBS ordered a third pilot on April 9, 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3ib5454b923e9fb7435165d866afd06e1c |title=CBS orders 'Pyramid' pilot| accessdate=20 September 2013}}</ref> [[Andy Richter]] was identified as a potential host.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2010/05/andy-richter-wrapping-deal-to-host-new-version-of-pyramid-for-cbs.html | title=Andy Richter wrapping deal to host new version of 'Pyramid' for CBS| work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref><ref>[http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/andy-richter-is-the-host-of-cbss-pyramid/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930135239/http://buzzerblog.flashgameshows.com/andy-richter-is-the-host-of-cbss-pyramid/|date=September 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn May 18, 2011, [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] announced development of a possible new version of ''Pyramid'', again to be hosted by [[Andy Richter]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2011/05/18/tnt-and-tbs-announce-extensive-slate-of-new-projects-from-top-talents-561104/20110518turner01/|title=TNT and TBS Announce Extensive Slate of New Projects from Top Talents |date=18 May 2011 |publisher=The Futon Critic |accessdate=25 May 2011}}</ref> It was later announced{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} that the show was not picked up.\n\nAnother pilot, titled ''The Pyramid'', was taped on June 16, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.twitter.com/buzzerblog/status/201396898345652224|title=buzzerblog (buzzerblog) on Twitter |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref> On July 12, 2012, GSN announced ''The Pyramid'' had been picked up and would premiere on the network on September 3, with [[Mike Richards (television personality)|Mike Richards]] hosting the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-announces-premiere-pyramid-monday-september-3 |title=GSN Announces Premiere of ''The Pyramid'' on Monday, September 3 |publisher=GSN Corporate |date=July 12, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014125159/http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-announces-premiere-pyramid-monday-september-3 |archivedate=October 14, 2013 }}</ref> The series ran for 40 episodes before being cancelled later in the year.\n\nOn January 9, 2016, ABC announced a revival of the series, specifically the ''$100,000'' format, had been greenlit and set to air during the summer of 2016.

The first season comprised ten hour-long episodes, with [[Michael Strahan]] serving as host.  Each episode consists of two full games.  Two introductions and two closings are taped with ability to air either;  as with ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and ''[[Match Game]]'', each game is its own 30-minute episode, and the introduction and closing aired depends if one game is the first or the second game to air in a single 60-minute block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/01/abc-is-reviving-game-show-classic-pyramid.html|title=ABC is Reviving Game-Show Classic $100,000 Pyramid|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture.com]]|publisher=New York Media, LLC|date=January 8, 2016|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pyramid|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=\u2018Pyramid\u2019 builds pacts|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=January 9, 2016 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe series premiered on June 26 of that year, airing as part of ABC's \"Sunday Fun & Games\" lineup at 9:00pm ET/8:00pm CT (along with the [[Steve Harvey]]-hosted ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and the [[Alec Baldwin]]-hosted ''[[Match Game]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2016/04/19/abc-announces-its-2016-summer-primetime-schedule-468314/20160419abc03/|title=Breaking News \u2013 ABC Announces Its 2016 Summer Primetime Schedule {{!}}|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|publisher=Futon Media|access-date=April 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/abc-orders-100000-pyramid-revival-853545|title=ABC Orders '$100,000 Pyramid' Revival Hosted by Michael Strahan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2016|first=Kate|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=June 26, 2016|last=Stanhope}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pyramid-game-show-abc-michael-strahan-1201675892/|title=ABC Bringing Back \u2018Pyramid\u2019 Game Show with Host Michael Strahan|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Elizabeth|date=January 9, 2016|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|last=Wagmeister|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/08/100000-pyramid-reboot-michael-strahan-host-abc|title=ABC orders $100,000 Pyramid reboot with Michael Strahan as host|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Dan|date=January 8, 2016|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|last=Snierson|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref> On August 4, 2016, ABC renewed ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' for a second season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/abc-renews-game-shows-match-game-family-feud-100000-pyramid/|title=ABC Renews Game Shows \u2018Match Game,\u2019 \u2018Celebrity Family Feud,\u2019 \u2018$100,000 Pyramid\u2019'|work=[[TheWrap]]|first=Reid|last=Nakamura|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> On June 11, 2017, the show moved to 10/9 central in order to pair it up with the seed-funding reality competition show ''[[Steve Harvey's Funderdome]]'' along with the third season of ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]''.

The 2016 ABC primetime version is announced by Brad Abelle.\n\nMike Gargiulo directed through 1981, with Bruce Burmester replacing him until the end of the 1991 revival.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}}\n\nThe original theme tune was \"Tuning Up\" by Ken Aldin. In 1982, it was replaced by an original, similarly-styled composition by [[Bob Cobert]], which was also used on the 1991 revival.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}} Barry Coffing and John Blaylock composed the theme and incidental music for the 2002\u201304 version, while Alan Ett composed a cover of Bob Cobert's 1982\u201391 theme for ''The Pyramid''. Bleeding Fingers Music composed a separate cover of Cobert's theme for the 2016 version.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Pyramid's gameboards, both in the main game and in the Winners' Circle bonus round, feature six categories arranged in a triangle (referred to as a pyramid), with three categories on the bottom row, two on the middle row, and one on the top. In the main game, a category's position on the board is arbitrary. In the Winners' Circle, categories become progressively more difficult the higher they are on the board.\n\n===Main game===\nTwo teams compete in the main game, each composed of a celebrity and a regular contestant.\n\n[[Image:Charles Siebert gives on The $25,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Charles Siebert]] uses pantomime to describe \"lasso\" on ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' in 1982.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the teams are shown six categories, whose titles gave vague clues to their possible meaning (for instance, \"I'm All Wet\" might pertain to things found in water). Once the category was chosen, its exact meaning is given (except in certain bonus situations where the meaning was not given and a cash/prize bonus won for completing all the clues). For up to 30 seconds, one contestant conveys to the other clues to a series of items belonging to a category. At this stage, the clue-giver could use whatever language they wanted, with the exclusion of saying any word that was part of the correct answer (for example, using \"high up\" for \"height\"); if the clue-giver gave such a clue, they were buzzed and that answer would be forfeited. The clue-giver could also include visual gestures and other non-verbal elements, and could also lead the player towards saying part of the answer to get them to say the correct answer.\n\nOne point is scored for each item correctly guessed. If a word is passed, the giver could not go back to that word, but if the receiver knows the word later on and guesses it, the team still earns a point (no sound effect was played, in order to avoid a distraction). Since the 2002 Osmond version, a team that passes on any words could return to them if time permitted, but if a word is guessed correctly after it had been passed, it did not count until the word was returned to and correctly guessed then.\n\nWhen ''The $10,000 Pyramid'' launched on CBS, there were eight possible items in a category. This was reduced to seven when the show moved to ABC, and this became the standard used for every subsequent series with two exceptions. When ''The $20,000 Pyramid'' briefly switched to its ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' format in November 1979, the time limit was increased to 35 seconds. The Donny Osmond-hosted ''Pyramid'' used categories with six items, with 20 seconds given to guess all six. Illegal clues, such as using part of the word in the description, or conveying its essence, results in the word being thrown out (denoted by a rapid \"cuckoo\" sound).\n\nOriginally, the celebrity gave the clues in both the first and third rounds, and the contestant in the second round. This soon changed to having the contestant decide whether to give or receive in the third round (except for the Osmond version, which used the original \"celebrity-contestant-celebrity\" giving pattern). The teams alternated in the first two rounds, and the team with the lower score played first in the third round. Whoever had the higher score after three rounds advanced to the Winners' Circle. In the 1970s, 1980s and 2016 versions, in the rare event that contestants were mathematically unable to at least tie their opponent before the opponent has had his/her last turn (or even rarer, before that point), the game ends and the remaining categories are left unplayed, unless one of them concealed a bonus.\n\nDuring the later years of the ABC run, if either team achieved a perfect score of 21, it was worth a $1,000 bonus ($500 during the ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era), later changed to a prize near the end of the run, while the 1977\u201378 season of the Cullen version likewise offered a $2,100 bonus for a perfect score.\n\nOriginally, if a tie occurred after the rounds were completed, the host gave the team who caused the tie a choice between two letters of the alphabet, and the team then played a round with seven words each beginning with that letter. The opposing team was then given seven words with the other letter. Tiebreaker rounds were played until the tie was broken, though the rules were later changed to award the victory to whichever team completed its own seven words faster, if both teams did so. In the 2016 Strahan version, if both teams achieve the same score, the team to do so in the shorter time is declared the winner, with a tiebreaker round being played if the teams match each other for both score and time.\n\nBeginning in January 1984, if both teams managed a \"perfect game\" by each scoring 21 points, the contestant whose team won the tiebreaker originally received a new car, but this was changed to a $5,000 cash bonus by September of that year. This bonus was also used on the 1980s incarnation of ''The $100,000 Pyramid''.\n\n====Bonus Cards====\nThroughout the 1970s, a random category during the main game doubled as the \"Big 7\", meaning that the contestant originally received a prize if all seven words were guessed correctly, but this was soon changed to a $500 cash bonus. On the Bill Cullen-hosted ''$25,000 Pyramid'', the Big 7 payoff was $1,000 when it was first introduced during the second season, but this was later replaced by a \"Big Money Card\" worth varying amounts of cash from $1,000 to $5,000 (though the maximum amount was later dropped to $4,000); for the final season, the Big 7 returned, and was always played for a [[Chevrolet Chevette]].\n\nDuring the short-lived ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era, there was no official bonus card; rather, each of the two teams selected one category from either of the day's two games to designate as their \"Bonus 7\", which otherwise worked the same as the Big 7, right down to the $500 bonus. However, unlike any other version, all bonuses won in this manner counted towards a team's score for the day.\n\nThe short-lived ''$50,000 Pyramid'' used no bonus cards, but added a feature called \"The Player of the Week\", in which the contestant who successfully conveyed or identified all seven answers in the fastest time during a main game round that week received a trip for two to [[Europe]], and later returned to compete in the show's $50,000 tournament. If two players were tied during a particular show or week, the tied players would return at the beginning or end of an episode and play a standard tiebreaker round to determine a winner.\n\nSimilar to the earlier Big 7, a new bonus called the \"7\u201311\" was introduced in April 1983 for the CBS version, hidden behind one category in the first round; if all seven words were guessed, the contestant won an $1,100 bonus. Initially, the contestant could choose to play for either this bonus or $50 per correct guess, but this option was dropped from January 1985 onward in favor of the all-or-nothing approach.\n\nBeginning in 1982, a random category in the second round was designated as the \"Mystery 7\", in which the host did not reveal the topic of the category until after the fact, and correctly guessing all seven words awarded a prize. The Mystery 7 was initially shown to the teams as one of the six categories, but from April 1984 onward, it was hidden behind a category name. This is the only bonus used in the 2016 edition, during the second round of each half.\n\nFor a brief time in early 1983, the Mystery 7 was replaced by a format similar to the earlier \"Player of the Week\" feature from ''The $50,000 Pyramid'', in which the player who had the fastest main game round during the week would win a Greek cruise. However, this bonus was dropped after only three weeks, and the Mystery 7 reinstated.\n\nThe John Davidson-hosted version had its own similar bonuses: \"Gamble for a Grand\"/\"Gamble for a Trip\" offered the choice to reduce the round's time limit from 30 to 25 seconds to win $1,000 cash or a trip, respectively, and \"Double Trouble\" offered the team 45 seconds to guess seven two-word responses for a $500 bonus. \n\nThe Donny Osmond-hosted version had only one bonus: \"Super Six\", which was featured in both games each day, and awarded the contestant a prize if the team managed to get all six words within the 20 seconds.\n\nOn the GSN version, there were no bonus cards, but sweeping a category awarded a $500 bonus and added $5,000 to the Winner's Circle bank (see below).\n\n===Winners' Circle===\n[[Image:Kathy Najimy on The $100,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A contestant, restrained in her seat, gives clues to [[Kathy Najimy]] in the Winners' Circle on ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' in 2016.]]\nThe winning team from the main game plays \"The Winners' Circle,\" in which the goal is to communicate six categories of increasing difficulty within 60 seconds, using only lists of words and phrases that fit them. During the show's original run on CBS from 1973 to 1974, hand gestures of any kind were permitted in this round. However, when the show moved to ABC in 1974, hand gestures became strictly forbidden, and all subsequent editions of the show included wrist straps attached to the chair to help contestants abide by this rule.  One team member gives clues to the category currently in play, while the other tries to guess it. An illegal clue (descriptions, saying a form of the answer, or a direct synonym) or hand gesture results in the category being thrown out, thus disqualifying the contestant from winning the grand prize; however, the contestant is still allowed to play the remainder of the Winners' Circle, either until time runs out or until the remaining categories have been correctly guessed. If all six categories are guessed before time runs out, the contestant wins the top prize; if not, he/she wins money for the guessed categories.{{sfn|Graham|1988|pages=181\u2013182}}{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013222}}{{sfn|Fabe|1979|pages=255\u2013259}} The clue-giver can pass on a category and then return to it after playing through all six, if time allows.\n\nThe values for individual categories during standard gameplay are shown in the table below. Category numbering proceeds across the bottom row of the pyramid (left/center/right), then the middle (left/right), and finally the single one at the peak.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=\"8\" style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\" | '''Version\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''1st'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" |''' 2nd'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''3rd'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''4th'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''5th'''\n! style=\"text-align: center;width:50px\" | '''6th'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $10,000/$20,000/$50,000/Junior Pyramid''\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $50\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' (1970s)\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''All-Star Junior Pyramid'' Special\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' (1979)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $125\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $150\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $175\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The (New) $25,000/$100,000 Pyramid'' (1982\u20131991)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $50\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $150\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $250\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | ''Pyramid'' (2002\u201304)\n| Regular gameplay\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n|-\n| Six-player tournament/four-player semifinals\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,500\n|-\n| Finals match of a four-player tournament\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $5,000\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The Pyramid'' (2012)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $100\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $200\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $300\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $400\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $750\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' (2016)\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $1,500\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $2,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $3,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $4,000\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | $5,000\n|-\n|}\n\n===Returning champions and winnings limits===\nOn the 1970s daytime version, contestants were allowed to remain on the show until they were defeated or won the Winners' Circle. Under the $10,000 format, a contestant who won the Winners' Circle was allowed to keep all earlier winnings. Under the $20,000 format, the contestant's total was merely augmented to the amount won in the Winners' Circle. The syndicated versions featured no returning champions prior to 1985.\n\nAfter the top prize on the 1970s daytime show was increased to $20,000, the Winners' Circle structure likewise changed, with a champion playing for $10,000 on their first attempt, $15,000 on their second attempt, and $20,000 for their third and all subsequent efforts. During the brief ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era, a team's first visit to the Winners' Circle was worth $2,500, while the second was worth $5,000.\n\nDuring the 1970s syndicated version, if a contestant won a bonus prize, then went on to win the $25,000 top prize, the value of the bonus (either the additional bonus cash, or the value of the car offered during the final season) was deducted from the champion's total, leaving them with exactly $25,000. This version did not feature returning champions.\n\nOn the short-lived 1981 version, the first Winners' Circle was worth $5,000; if the same player made it to the second Winners' Circle, it was played for a total of $10,000. This version also did not feature returning champions.\n\nOn all versions from 1982 onward, all main game bonus winnings remained intact in the event of a $25,000 win. On the $25,000 and $100,000 versions of the show, the same two contestants competed for both halves of the episode. A contestant who won the first of the two games on the episode played the Winners' Circle for $10,000. A contestant who won both games played the second Winners' Circle for a total of $25,000 (e.g., if a contestant won $10,000 in the first Winners' Circle, the second was worth an additional $15,000 to the contestant). On all versions from 1982 to 1991, a contestant who won both games of an episode became the champion and returned on the next show. If each contestant won one game, the contestant who won the higher amount in the Winners' Circle became champion (winnings from the various main game bonuses were not considered as part of the \"score\" winnings). If both contestants won equal amounts of money in the Winners' Circle (including $10,000 wins), both returned on the next show.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1991, contestants were allowed to remain on the show until defeated or a maximum of five episodes. Champions on the CBS version also retired after exceeding the network's winnings limit. This was originally $25,000, but was increased to $50,000 on October 22, 1984 (episode #0542) and to $75,000 on September 29, 1986 (episode #1041). Contestants were allowed to keep a maximum of $25,000 in excess of the limit.\n\nOn ''Pyramid'', the goal was once again to try to win $25,000. However, this required a contestant to get to and win the Winners' Circle twice. If the contestant made a second trip without having won the first, he/she was given another chance at $10,000. If the contestant managed to win both, he/she won the $25,000 and automatically qualified for the $100,000 tournament.\n\nOn ''The Pyramid'', each Winners' Circle was played for a base of $10,000. For each category that the contestant and celebrity swept in the front game, a $500 bonus was awarded to the contestant and an additional $5,000 was added to the potential prize, with the maximum prize for a trip to the Winners' Circle being $25,000 for each contestant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/2012/07/exclusive-info-gsn-pyramid/ |title=BUZZERBLOG Exclusive Info on 2012 GSN Revival |website=Buzzerblog.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Both ''Pyramid'' and ''The Pyramid'' did not have returning champions.\n\nThe 2016 ABC format consists of hour-long episodes, each containing two complete pairs of games. The contestant who wins the first game of a pair plays the Winners' Circle for a prize of $50,000. If the same contestant wins both games, he/she plays the second Winners' Circle for an additional $100,000, leading to a potential maximum total of $150,000.<ref>{{Cite episode|series=The $100,000 Pyramid|date=10 July 2016|network=ABC|number=3|time=42:29}}</ref> Two new contestants compete in each half of an episode; there are no returning champions.\n\n===Tournaments===\nOn ''The $50,000 Pyramid'', tournaments started with eight past \"Players of the Week\" competing over the course of a week. The quarterfinals were played on Monday and Tuesday, with two different contestants in each half, and the winner of each game would advance to the semi-finals after playing the Pyramid for $5,000. On Wednesday and Thursday, each match would have two semi-finalists playing two games against each other, with players winning one game playing for $5,000, and players winning both games in the same show playing for a total of $10,000 (as it was during regular play). The two players who won the most money would compete in the finals, while the losing contestants from the semi-finals competed in a \"wild card\" match on Friday to determine who would join them. Starting the following Monday, two finalists played one game, and the winner played the Winners' Circle for $50,000. If the grand prize was not won, that player played the next game against the finalist who sat out the previous game, continuing in this manner throughout the week until someone won in the Winners' Circle. When playing for $50,000, an illegal clue immediately ended the round, and no money was awarded for each individual category.\n\nOn the 1985\u201391 version of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', the three contestants who completed the Winners' Circle in the shortest lengths of time qualified for a $100,000 tournament, which was held every few weeks. During the tournament, all front game bonuses were removed except the $5,000 bonus for breaking a 21\u201321 tie. The first contestant to complete the Winners' Circle won the $100,000 grand prize, ending the tournament. If neither contestant did so on a particular episode, the one who accumulated more money in the Winners' Circle returned on the next show to compete against the contestant who had not played on that episode (in the event of a tie, a [[coin toss]] determined who returned). If one of the three contestants won the $100,000 in the first Winners' Circle of an episode, the other two played against each other in the second half and that winner played for $10,000 in the Winners' Circle.\n\nOn the Osmond version, tournaments lasted for exactly three episodes, and rules varied depending on whether four or six champions had qualified. During a six-player tournament, each contestant's first attempt at the Winners' Circle was worth $25,000. If $25,000 was won in the first half and the same player returned to the Winners' Circle, that contestant played for an additional $75,000 and the tournament title. If the tournament ended with no players having won both Winners' Circles in one show, either the contestant who won $25,000 in the fastest time or the player who won the most money would have his or her tournament winnings augmented to $100,000. In a four-player tournament, the first two semi-finalists competed on day one and the other two semi-finalists on day two, with each Winners' Circle attempt worth $25,000. The top two winners then returned to compete in the finals, where each Winners' Circle victory was worth an additional $50,000, for a maximum payoff of $150,000 if any of the contestants managed a clean sweep.\n\nUnlike the Clark and Davidson versions, the \"Super Six\" bonus remained in play during the Osmond era tournaments and was played for larger prizes than usual.\n\n==International versions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:left; line-height:16px; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

However, due to concerns about players easily memorizing possible Winners' Circle subjects, the format of the board game's Winners' Circle endgame was changed to mirror that of the TV version's main game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/2015/06/08/why-did-the-board-game-version-of-the-25000-pyramid-not-actually-have-a-pyramid-in-it/|title=Why Did the Board Game Version of the $25,000 Pyramid Not Actually Have a Pyramid In It?|date=8 June 2015|website=Legendsrevealed.com|accessdate=28 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nCardinal Games released a new home version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' in 1986,<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-Board-Game-1986-Clark/dp/B001TKV6WG] {{dead link|date=January 2019}}</ref> this time using the actual Winners' Circle rules and format, which was also given to all contestants who appeared on both the daytime and nighttime versions for most of 1987.

Most later series featured a full title format matching the original series, with the title reflecting an increasing top prize. The game features two contestants, each paired with a celebrity. Contestants attempt to guess a series of words or phrases based on descriptions given to them by their teammates. The title refers to the show's pyramid-shaped gameboard, featuring six categories arranged in a triangular fashion. The various ''Pyramid'' series have won a total of nine [[Daytime Emmy Award|Daytime Emmy]]s for Outstanding Game Show, second only to ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', which has won 13.\n\n[[Dick Clark]] is the host most commonly associated with the show, having hosted the network daytime version from 1973 to 1980 (which moved from CBS to ABC in 1974, and increased its namesake top prize from $10,000 to $20,000 in 1976) and its revival from 1982 to 1988 on CBS ('''''The (New) $25,000 Pyramid'''''). \nClark also hosted two weeknight syndicated versions, '''''The $50,000 Pyramid''''' in 1981 and '''''The $100,000 Pyramid''''' from 1985 to 1988 (concurrent with the daytime show).\n\n[[Bill Cullen]] hosted the first weekly nighttime version of ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' from 1974 to 1979.

A year later, the ratings temporarily declined (against the original version of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' on [[NBC]]) and CBS canceled it. The show was quickly picked up by ABC and began airing on that network on May 6, 1974. As per CBS custom at the time with celebrity game shows, three weeks of episodes for CBS were taped in [[Hollywood]] at [[CBS Television City]], Studio 31.<ref name=\"Shows\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows |title=Shows |publisher=CBS Television City |date=1954-09-07 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> The remainder of the CBS episodes originated in New York City at the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], moving to ABC's Elysee Theatre after ''Pyramid'' switched networks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2931|title=Elysee Theatre|website=Cinematreasures.org}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on January 19, 1976, the series doubled its top prize and was retitled ''The $20,000 Pyramid''. From October 1 to November 9, 1979, the series briefly became ''Junior Partner Pyramid'', which scrapped the usual celebrity-contestant pairings in favor of children playing the game with a parent or other adult relative. Its last episode aired June 27, 1980, with ''[[Family Feud]]'' subsequently moving up a half-hour to take over the 12:00 noon (EST) slot formerly occupied by ''The $20,000 Pyramid''.\n[[Image:$25,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title card of the 1980s ''(New) $25,000 Pyramid''.]]\nOn September 20, 1982, the series returned to the CBS daytime lineup as ''The (New) $25,000 Pyramid'', again with Clark as host, but now taped in Los Angeles full-time at [[CBS Television City]]'s Studio 33 (currently used for ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price is Right]]'', now known as the \"[[Bob Barker]] Studio\") and remained there for the entire run up until December 31, 1987. ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' began airing in the series' 10:00&nbsp;a.m. timeslot the following Monday, but that show was canceled after 13 weeks of episodes. On April 4, 1988, ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' returned to the CBS daytime schedule, but only for 13 more weeks. The show's final episode aired on July 1. The following Monday, the show was replaced by a revival of ''Family Feud'' hosted by [[Ray Combs]].\n\nConcurrent with the network show's run, several nighttime versions of the show were sold to local stations through [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]]: the original ''$25,000 Pyramid'' and ''The $50,000 Pyramid'' were taped in the Elysee Theatre in New York, and the original version of ''The $100,000 Pyramid''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/81903/10-fun-facts-about-100000-pyramid|title=10 Fun Facts About '$100,000 Pyramid'|website=Mentalfloss.com|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref> taped at Studio 33 in Hollywood.

Strahan's ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' is taped at the ABC Television Center in New York.\n\n===Later developments===\nIn late 1996, [[Sony Pictures Television]] (then-[[Columbia TriStar Television]]) produced a pilot for a new version of ''Pyramid'', with [[Mark Walberg]] as host, which featured a format radically different from the earlier versions, including an increase of the number of celebrities to six, each of which would be assigned to a different main game subject. It did not sell, but Sony tried again the following year, this time with [[Chuck Woolery]] at the helm and a format closer to the original, although the six-celebrity motif from the previous pilot remained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usgameshows.net/x.php?show=Pyramid1997&sort=0|title=The Game Show Pilot Light: Pyramid (1997)}}</ref> This version also failed to sell, but two years later, after the success of its series ''[[Rock and Roll Jeopardy!]]'' on [[VH1]], Sony attempted to give ''Pyramid'' similar treatment with a 1999 pilot called ''Pyramid Rocks''. Hosted by [[Bil Dwyer]], the format likewise attempted to incorporate music into the game, but proved no more successful than the previous two attempts at reviving the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/2016/01/09/watch-celebrate-pyramids-return-with-the-unsold-vh1-pilot-pyramid-rocks/|title=Watch: Celebrate Pyramid's Return With the Unsold VH1 Pilot \"Pyramid Rocks\"}}</ref>\n\nFollowing CBS's cancellation of ''[[Guiding Light]]'' in April 2009, ''Pyramid'' was one of three potential series considered as a replacement for the veteran soap opera. (''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' and ''[[The Dating Game]] as The New Dating Game or The Newlywed Game or The New Newlywed Game'' were the other two, with a pilot shot for the former series.) During the tapings that took place in June of that year at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in New York, the top prize was raised to a potential $1,000,000 with a tournament format similar to the $100,000 format.  [[Dean Cain]] and [[Tim Vincent]] were tapped as hosts of the pilots, with ''$50,000'' announcer Alan Kalter returning, and Sony Pictures game show legend [[Ken Jennings]] served as a panelist in the pilots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/set-report-from-the-1000000-pyramid|title=Set Report from \"The $1,000,000 Pyramid\" |date=June 25, 2009|website=Buzzerblog.com|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCBS passed on ''Pyramid'' and opted to pick up ''Let's Make a Deal'', hosted by [[Wayne Brady]], as ''Guiding Light's'' replacement. Several months later, in December 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of another long-running soap opera, ''[[As the World Turns]]''.

This version also marked the return of the show to New York City, where it had originally been produced in the 1970s. The first season comprised ten hour-long episodes, with [[Michael Strahan]] serving as host.  Each episode consists of two full games.  Two introductions and two closings are taped with ability to air either;  as with ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and ''[[Match Game]]'', each game is its own 30-minute episode, and the introduction and closing aired depends if one game is the first or the second game to air in a single 60-minute block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/01/abc-is-reviving-game-show-classic-pyramid.html|title=ABC is Reviving Game-Show Classic $100,000 Pyramid|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture.com]]|publisher=New York Media, LLC|date=January 8, 2016|accessdate=January 8, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pyramid|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=\u2018Pyramid\u2019 builds pacts|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=January 9, 2016 |accessdate=January 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe series premiered on June 26 of that year, airing as part of ABC's \"Sunday Fun & Games\" lineup at 9:00pm ET/8:00pm CT (along with the [[Steve Harvey]]-hosted ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'' and the [[Alec Baldwin]]-hosted ''[[Match Game]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2016/04/19/abc-announces-its-2016-summer-primetime-schedule-468314/20160419abc03/|title=Breaking News \u2013 ABC Announces Its 2016 Summer Primetime Schedule {{!}}|work=[[The Futon Critic]]|publisher=Futon Media|access-date=April 28, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/abc-orders-100000-pyramid-revival-853545|title=ABC Orders '$100,000 Pyramid' Revival Hosted by Michael Strahan|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 8, 2016|first=Kate|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=June 26, 2016|last=Stanhope}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/pyramid-game-show-abc-michael-strahan-1201675892/|title=ABC Bringing Back \u2018Pyramid\u2019 Game Show with Host Michael Strahan|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Elizabeth|date=January 9, 2016|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|last=Wagmeister|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/08/100000-pyramid-reboot-michael-strahan-host-abc|title=ABC orders $100,000 Pyramid reboot with Michael Strahan as host|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Dan|date=January 8, 2016|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|last=Snierson|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref> On August 4, 2016, ABC renewed ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' for a second season.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thewrap.com/abc-renews-game-shows-match-game-family-feud-100000-pyramid/|title=ABC Renews Game Shows \u2018Match Game,\u2019 \u2018Celebrity Family Feud,\u2019 \u2018$100,000 Pyramid\u2019'|work=[[TheWrap]]|first=Reid|last=Nakamura|date=August 4, 2016|accessdate=4 August 2016}}</ref> On June 11, 2017, the show moved to 10/9 central in order to pair it up with the seed-funding reality competition show ''[[Steve Harvey's Funderdome]]'' along with the third season of ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]''.

In this format, the host opens each show introducing the celebrity guests, each of whom then introduces his or her partner/contestant by first name only.\n\n===Other personnel===\n[[Bob Clayton]] was the series' original announcer and performed these duties until his death in 1979. [[Alan Kalter]] and Steve O'Brien shared the primary announcer role until ''The $50,000 Pyramid'' ended production in 1981. Substitutes included [[Fred Foy]], John Causier, Dick Heatherton, [[Scott Vincent]], and Ed Jordan.\n\nWhen the series was revived and production moved to California in 1982, [[Jack Clark (television personality)|Jack Clark]] became the announcer and held the position until 1985. [[Johnny Gilbert]] became the primary announcer for ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' while [[Charlie O'Donnell]] took the job for ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' when it launched that fall. Both Gilbert and O'Donnell substituted for each other on their respective series; other substitutes included Jerry Bishop, [[Rod Roddy]], [[Bob Hilton]], [[Charlie Tuna]], and [[Dean Goss]]. For the 1991 revival, Gilbert and Goss were both featured announcers and frequent panelist [[Henry Polic II]] also announced for several weeks.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}} [[John Cramer (announcer)|John Cramer]] announced the 2002\u201304 version, and [[JD Roberto]] announced ''The Pyramid'' (2012). The 2016 ABC primetime version is announced by Brad Abelle.\n\nMike Gargiulo directed through 1981, with Bruce Burmester replacing him until the end of the 1991 revival.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}}\n\nThe original theme tune was \"Tuning Up\" by Ken Aldin. In 1982, it was replaced by an original, similarly-styled composition by [[Bob Cobert]], which was also used on the 1991 revival.{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013221}} Barry Coffing and John Blaylock composed the theme and incidental music for the 2002\u201304 version, while Alan Ett composed a cover of Bob Cobert's 1982\u201391 theme for ''The Pyramid''. Bleeding Fingers Music composed a separate cover of Cobert's theme for the 2016 version.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe Pyramid's gameboards, both in the main game and in the Winners' Circle bonus round, feature six categories arranged in a triangle (referred to as a pyramid), with three categories on the bottom row, two on the middle row, and one on the top. In the main game, a category's position on the board is arbitrary. In the Winners' Circle, categories become progressively more difficult the higher they are on the board.\n\n===Main game===\nTwo teams compete in the main game, each composed of a celebrity and a regular contestant.\n\n[[Image:Charles Siebert gives on The $25,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Charles Siebert]] uses pantomime to describe \"lasso\" on ''The $25,000 Pyramid'' in 1982.]]\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the teams are shown six categories, whose titles gave vague clues to their possible meaning (for instance, \"I'm All Wet\" might pertain to things found in water). Once the category was chosen, its exact meaning is given (except in certain bonus situations where the meaning was not given and a cash/prize bonus won for completing all the clues). For up to 30 seconds, one contestant conveys to the other clues to a series of items belonging to a category. At this stage, the clue-giver could use whatever language they wanted, with the exclusion of saying any word that was part of the correct answer (for example, using \"high up\" for \"height\"); if the clue-giver gave such a clue, they were buzzed and that answer would be forfeited. The clue-giver could also include visual gestures and other non-verbal elements, and could also lead the player towards saying part of the answer to get them to say the correct answer.\n\nOne point is scored for each item correctly guessed. If a word is passed, the giver could not go back to that word, but if the receiver knows the word later on and guesses it, the team still earns a point (no sound effect was played, in order to avoid a distraction). Since the 2002 Osmond version, a team that passes on any words could return to them if time permitted, but if a word is guessed correctly after it had been passed, it did not count until the word was returned to and correctly guessed then.\n\nWhen ''The $10,000 Pyramid'' launched on CBS, there were eight possible items in a category. This was reduced to seven when the show moved to ABC, and this became the standard used for every subsequent series with two exceptions. When ''The $20,000 Pyramid'' briefly switched to its ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' format in November 1979, the time limit was increased to 35 seconds. The Donny Osmond-hosted ''Pyramid'' used categories with six items, with 20 seconds given to guess all six. Illegal clues, such as using part of the word in the description, or conveying its essence, results in the word being thrown out (denoted by a rapid \"cuckoo\" sound).\n\nOriginally, the celebrity gave the clues in both the first and third rounds, and the contestant in the second round. This soon changed to having the contestant decide whether to give or receive in the third round (except for the Osmond version, which used the original \"celebrity-contestant-celebrity\" giving pattern). The teams alternated in the first two rounds, and the team with the lower score played first in the third round. Whoever had the higher score after three rounds advanced to the Winners' Circle. In the 1970s, 1980s and 2016 versions, in the rare event that contestants were mathematically unable to at least tie their opponent before the opponent has had his/her last turn (or even rarer, before that point), the game ends and the remaining categories are left unplayed, unless one of them concealed a bonus.\n\nDuring the later years of the ABC run, if either team achieved a perfect score of 21, it was worth a $1,000 bonus ($500 during the ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era), later changed to a prize near the end of the run, while the 1977\u201378 season of the Cullen version likewise offered a $2,100 bonus for a perfect score.\n\nOriginally, if a tie occurred after the rounds were completed, the host gave the team who caused the tie a choice between two letters of the alphabet, and the team then played a round with seven words each beginning with that letter. The opposing team was then given seven words with the other letter. Tiebreaker rounds were played until the tie was broken, though the rules were later changed to award the victory to whichever team completed its own seven words faster, if both teams did so. In the 2016 Strahan version, if both teams achieve the same score, the team to do so in the shorter time is declared the winner, with a tiebreaker round being played if the teams match each other for both score and time.\n\nBeginning in January 1984, if both teams managed a \"perfect game\" by each scoring 21 points, the contestant whose team won the tiebreaker originally received a new car, but this was changed to a $5,000 cash bonus by September of that year. This bonus was also used on the 1980s incarnation of ''The $100,000 Pyramid''.\n\n====Bonus Cards====\nThroughout the 1970s, a random category during the main game doubled as the \"Big 7\", meaning that the contestant originally received a prize if all seven words were guessed correctly, but this was soon changed to a $500 cash bonus. On the Bill Cullen-hosted ''$25,000 Pyramid'', the Big 7 payoff was $1,000 when it was first introduced during the second season, but this was later replaced by a \"Big Money Card\" worth varying amounts of cash from $1,000 to $5,000 (though the maximum amount was later dropped to $4,000); for the final season, the Big 7 returned, and was always played for a [[Chevrolet Chevette]].\n\nDuring the short-lived ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era, there was no official bonus card; rather, each of the two teams selected one category from either of the day's two games to designate as their \"Bonus 7\", which otherwise worked the same as the Big 7, right down to the $500 bonus. However, unlike any other version, all bonuses won in this manner counted towards a team's score for the day.\n\nThe short-lived ''$50,000 Pyramid'' used no bonus cards, but added a feature called \"The Player of the Week\", in which the contestant who successfully conveyed or identified all seven answers in the fastest time during a main game round that week received a trip for two to [[Europe]], and later returned to compete in the show's $50,000 tournament. If two players were tied during a particular show or week, the tied players would return at the beginning or end of an episode and play a standard tiebreaker round to determine a winner.\n\nSimilar to the earlier Big 7, a new bonus called the \"7\u201311\" was introduced in April 1983 for the CBS version, hidden behind one category in the first round; if all seven words were guessed, the contestant won an $1,100 bonus. Initially, the contestant could choose to play for either this bonus or $50 per correct guess, but this option was dropped from January 1985 onward in favor of the all-or-nothing approach.\n\nBeginning in 1982, a random category in the second round was designated as the \"Mystery 7\", in which the host did not reveal the topic of the category until after the fact, and correctly guessing all seven words awarded a prize. The Mystery 7 was initially shown to the teams as one of the six categories, but from April 1984 onward, it was hidden behind a category name. This is the only bonus used in the 2016 edition, during the second round of each half.\n\nFor a brief time in early 1983, the Mystery 7 was replaced by a format similar to the earlier \"Player of the Week\" feature from ''The $50,000 Pyramid'', in which the player who had the fastest main game round during the week would win a Greek cruise. However, this bonus was dropped after only three weeks, and the Mystery 7 reinstated.\n\nThe John Davidson-hosted version had its own similar bonuses: \"Gamble for a Grand\"/\"Gamble for a Trip\" offered the choice to reduce the round's time limit from 30 to 25 seconds to win $1,000 cash or a trip, respectively, and \"Double Trouble\" offered the team 45 seconds to guess seven two-word responses for a $500 bonus. \n\nThe Donny Osmond-hosted version had only one bonus: \"Super Six\", which was featured in both games each day, and awarded the contestant a prize if the team managed to get all six words within the 20 seconds.\n\nOn the GSN version, there were no bonus cards, but sweeping a category awarded a $500 bonus and added $5,000 to the Winner's Circle bank (see below).\n\n===Winners' Circle===\n[[Image:Kathy Najimy on The $100,000 Pyramid.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A contestant, restrained in her seat, gives clues to [[Kathy Najimy]] in the Winners' Circle on ''The $100,000 Pyramid'' in 2016.]]\nThe winning team from the main game plays \"The Winners' Circle,\" in which the goal is to communicate six categories of increasing difficulty within 60 seconds, using only lists of words and phrases that fit them. During the show's original run on CBS from 1973 to 1974, hand gestures of any kind were permitted in this round. However, when the show moved to ABC in 1974, hand gestures became strictly forbidden, and all subsequent editions of the show included wrist straps attached to the chair to help contestants abide by this rule.  One team member gives clues to the category currently in play, while the other tries to guess it. An illegal clue (descriptions, saying a form of the answer, or a direct synonym) or hand gesture results in the category being thrown out, thus disqualifying the contestant from winning the grand prize; however, the contestant is still allowed to play the remainder of the Winners' Circle, either until time runs out or until the remaining categories have been correctly guessed. If all six categories are guessed before time runs out, the contestant wins the top prize; if not, he/she wins money for the guessed categories.{{sfn|Graham|1988|pages=181\u2013182}}{{sfn|Schwartz, Ryan, and Wostbrock|1999|pages=220\u2013222}}{{sfn|Fabe|1979|pages=255\u2013259}} The clue-giver can pass on a category and then return to it after playing through all six, if time allows.\n\nThe values for individual categories during standard gameplay are shown in the table below.

Under the $10,000 format, a contestant who won the Winners' Circle was allowed to keep all earlier winnings. Under the $20,000 format, the contestant's total was merely augmented to the amount won in the Winners' Circle. The syndicated versions featured no returning champions prior to 1985.\n\nAfter the top prize on the 1970s daytime show was increased to $20,000, the Winners' Circle structure likewise changed, with a champion playing for $10,000 on their first attempt, $15,000 on their second attempt, and $20,000 for their third and all subsequent efforts. During the brief ''Junior Partner Pyramid'' era, a team's first visit to the Winners' Circle was worth $2,500, while the second was worth $5,000.\n\nDuring the 1970s syndicated version, if a contestant won a bonus prize, then went on to win the $25,000 top prize, the value of the bonus (either the additional bonus cash, or the value of the car offered during the final season) was deducted from the champion's total, leaving them with exactly $25,000. This version did not feature returning champions.\n\nOn the short-lived 1981 version, the first Winners' Circle was worth $5,000; if the same player made it to the second Winners' Circle, it was played for a total of $10,000. This version also did not feature returning champions.\n\nOn all versions from 1982 onward, all main game bonus winnings remained intact in the event of a $25,000 win. On the $25,000 and $100,000 versions of the show, the same two contestants competed for both halves of the episode. A contestant who won the first of the two games on the episode played the Winners' Circle for $10,000. A contestant who won both games played the second Winners' Circle for a total of $25,000 (e.g., if a contestant won $10,000 in the first Winners' Circle, the second was worth an additional $15,000 to the contestant). On all versions from 1982 to 1991, a contestant who won both games of an episode became the champion and returned on the next show. If each contestant won one game, the contestant who won the higher amount in the Winners' Circle became champion (winnings from the various main game bonuses were not considered as part of the \"score\" winnings). If both contestants won equal amounts of money in the Winners' Circle (including $10,000 wins), both returned on the next show.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1991, contestants were allowed to remain on the show until defeated or a maximum of five episodes. Champions on the CBS version also retired after exceeding the network's winnings limit. This was originally $25,000, but was increased to $50,000 on October 22, 1984 (episode #0542) and to $75,000 on September 29, 1986 (episode #1041). Contestants were allowed to keep a maximum of $25,000 in excess of the limit.\n\nOn ''Pyramid'', the goal was once again to try to win $25,000. However, this required a contestant to get to and win the Winners' Circle twice. If the contestant made a second trip without having won the first, he/she was given another chance at $10,000. If the contestant managed to win both, he/she won the $25,000 and automatically qualified for the $100,000 tournament.\n\nOn ''The Pyramid'', each Winners' Circle was played for a base of $10,000. For each category that the contestant and celebrity swept in the front game, a $500 bonus was awarded to the contestant and an additional $5,000 was added to the potential prize, with the maximum prize for a trip to the Winners' Circle being $25,000 for each contestant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzerblog.com/2012/07/exclusive-info-gsn-pyramid/ |title=BUZZERBLOG Exclusive Info on 2012 GSN Revival |website=Buzzerblog.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> Both ''Pyramid'' and ''The Pyramid'' did not have returning champions.\n\nThe 2016 ABC format consists of hour-long episodes, each containing two complete pairs of games. The contestant who wins the first game of a pair plays the Winners' Circle for a prize of $50,000. If the same contestant wins both games, he/she plays the second Winners' Circle for an additional $100,000, leading to a potential maximum total of $150,000.<ref>{{Cite episode|series=The $100,000 Pyramid|date=10 July 2016|network=ABC|number=3|time=42:29}}</ref> Two new contestants compete in each half of an episode; there are no returning champions.\n\n===Tournaments===\nOn ''The $50,000 Pyramid'', tournaments started with eight past \"Players of the Week\" competing over the course of a week. The quarterfinals were played on Monday and Tuesday, with two different contestants in each half, and the winner of each game would advance to the semi-finals after playing the Pyramid for $5,000. On Wednesday and Thursday, each match would have two semi-finalists playing two games against each other, with players winning one game playing for $5,000, and players winning both games in the same show playing for a total of $10,000 (as it was during regular play). The two players who won the most money would compete in the finals, while the losing contestants from the semi-finals competed in a \"wild card\" match on Friday to determine who would join them. Starting the following Monday, two finalists played one game, and the winner played the Winners' Circle for $50,000. If the grand prize was not won, that player played the next game against the finalist who sat out the previous game, continuing in this manner throughout the week until someone won in the Winners' Circle. When playing for $50,000, an illegal clue immediately ended the round, and no money was awarded for each individual category.\n\nOn the 1985\u201391 version of ''The $100,000 Pyramid'', the three contestants who completed the Winners' Circle in the shortest lengths of time qualified for a $100,000 tournament, which was held every few weeks. During the tournament, all front game bonuses were removed except the $5,000 bonus for breaking a 21\u201321 tie. The first contestant to complete the Winners' Circle won the $100,000 grand prize, ending the tournament. If neither contestant did so on a particular episode, the one who accumulated more money in the Winners' Circle returned on the next show to compete against the contestant who had not played on that episode (in the event of a tie, a [[coin toss]] determined who returned). If one of the three contestants won the $100,000 in the first Winners' Circle of an episode, the other two played against each other in the second half and that winner played for $10,000 in the Winners' Circle.\n\nOn the Osmond version, tournaments lasted for exactly three episodes, and rules varied depending on whether four or six champions had qualified. During a six-player tournament, each contestant's first attempt at the Winners' Circle was worth $25,000. If $25,000 was won in the first half and the same player returned to the Winners' Circle, that contestant played for an additional $75,000 and the tournament title. If the tournament ended with no players having won both Winners' Circles in one show, either the contestant who won $25,000 in the fastest time or the player who won the most money would have his or her tournament winnings augmented to $100,000. In a four-player tournament, the first two semi-finalists competed on day one and the other two semi-finalists on day two, with each Winners' Circle attempt worth $25,000. The top two winners then returned to compete in the finals, where each Winners' Circle victory was worth an additional $50,000, for a maximum payoff of $150,000 if any of the contestants managed a clean sweep.\n\nUnlike the Clark and Davidson versions, the \"Super Six\" bonus remained in play during the Osmond era tournaments and was played for larger prizes than usual.\n\n==International versions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:left; line-height:16px; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Donny Osmond hosted a short-lived 2007 revival, which used a similar set and the same music package as the 2002 American revival hosted by Osmond.\n\nIn 2009, Sony created an Australian version of ''The Junior Partner Pyramid'' called simply ''[[Pyramid (Australian game show)|Pyramid]]''. This version was hosted by [[Shura Taft]] until 2012, with Graham Matters taking over the following year.\n\nA German version titled ''[[:de:Die Pyramide (Fernsehsendung)|Die Pyramide]]'' aired on [[ZDF]] from 1979 to 1994, and was hosted by [[Dieter Thomas Heck]].

Beginning with the fourth edition, like its TV counterpart, the title and top payoff changed to ''The $20,000 Pyramid'', while the final edition was titled ''The $50,000 Pyramid''.
