In late 1941 he was part of [[VF-42]] on carrier [[USS Yorktown (CV-5)|''Yorktown'']], which conducted patrols in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to protect the merchant ships heading for [[Britain]]. After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Yorktown'' with his squadron was transferred to the [[Pacific]]. In February 1942, he participated in [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids]] and was credited with shooting down a [[Kawanishi H6K]] flying boat (a shared victory with his wingman John P. Adams).<ref>Lundstrom, 2005, page 80</ref> He was later promoted to [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|Lieutenant (jg)]].\n\n==Coral Sea==\nOn 4 May, ''Yorktown'' that took part in operation against [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) [[Invasion of Tulagi (May 1942)|Invasion of Tulagi]] in the [[Solomon Islands]]. McCuskey flew an afternoon patrol over the [[Florida Islands]], where he and his division of four [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s (led by Lieutenant [[William N. Leonard|Bill Leonard]]) strafed a beached Japanese minesweeper near [[Tulagi]] and destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Y\u016bzuki|Y\u016bzuki]] heading towards [[Savo Island]]. This resulted in the death of the destroyer's captain and several of the ships' crew.<ref>Lundstrom, 2005, pages 173-174</ref> On the return flight, McCuskey and his wingman John P. Adams got separated from the rest of division and landed on a beach in the south-east part of the island. They were helped by the natives before the destroyer [[USS Hammann (DD-412)|''Hammann'']] picked them up. As result of getting lost and ditching at Guadalcanal, he was grounded for two days by the squadron commander. This prevented him to fly the evening mission with [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[James H. Flatley|James Flatley]] on 7 May that intercepted the IJN strike force.<ref>Lundstrom, 2005, page 179 and 211</ref>\n\nOn 8 May, McCuskey was restored to duty and flew an escort for the USN strike force against IJN carriers [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dkaku|''Sh\u014dkaku'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuikaku|''Zuikaku'']]. During the mission, his division was attacked by two [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters and where he managed to shot down one. A few more [[Combat Air Patrol]] (CAP) Zeros attacked [[Douglas TBD Devastator]]s. One of them, most likely [[Petty Officer]] [[Sadamu Komachi]]<ref>Lundstrom, 2005, page 233</ref>, chased McCuskey into a cloud. However, the escorting Wildcats successfully protected the USN bombers that made an attack on ''Sh\u014dkaku''. Near the enemy carries, McCuskey encountered two more Zeros and escaped by diving into a rain squall. He returned to the USN fleet and landed on the damaged [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|''Lexington'']] as he could not locate ''Yorktown''. ''Lexington'' later sank with his Wildcat fighter on board. After the battle he returned to ''Yorktown'' and VF-42 was merged into [[VF-3]], which was commanded by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[John Thach]].<ref>Lundstrom, 2005, pages 224-243</ref><ref>Millman, 2013, Chapter 3: The Coral Sea</ref>\n\n==Midway==\nDuring the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942, McCuskey was part of CAP that protected [[Task Force 17]]. His division intercepted the first strike wave of 18 dive bombers from the undamaged [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiry\u016b|''Hiry\u016b'']] led by [[lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] Michio Kobayashi. He shot down three [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers and engaged the rest of the group until he ran out of ammunition, causing the enemy to break formation. Nevertheless, the remaining D3A dive bombers hit ''Yorktown'' and he was forced to land on [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|''Enterprise'']]. He took off from ''Enterprise'' leading a division of four Wildcats for another CAP sortie over Task Force 17. He ambushed and shot down one Zero and damaged another one, but was attacked by the remaining escorting Zero, flown by [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|''Kaga'']] fighter pilot [[Akira Yamamoto]]. He was assisted by his wingman, who drove the enemy away.
