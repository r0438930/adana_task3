In Europe, it was released for Windows on June 20, 2003, and the GameCube and Xbox on March 4, 2005. A [[PlayStation 2]] version was also planned, but it was cancelled for unknown reasons. The game was released for Windows in the United States on September 22, 2003. A mobile port of the game was released worldwide for the iOS and Android on May 25, 2017.\n\n==Plot==\nWoody is an average man who has a happy life, until his neighbor Mr. Rottweiler makes his life miserable. Woody decides to take full revenge on Mr. Rottweiler and calls to TV crew, which produces title [[reality show]] that shows the neighbor's relations form worst site.\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn the game, the player plays as Woody, who creeps around the Rottweiler's house performing tricks upon the unsuspecting resident. Woody is the star of a new TV show with the same name, with cameras that track every move as the player sets traps such as sawing the chair, banana peels/soap on the floor, smeared paintings and messing with home equipment. The game's objectives are to create disarray, increase ratings, and win awards. Obstacles in the game include the watchful neighbour himself, also - his guard dog, and a parrot called ''Chilli'', both of whom will try to alert the neighbour of Woody's presence. If Woody is caught by the Rottweiler, he is shown being brutally beaten and it is implied that Woody will be beaten to death. Then the episode is failed and player must restart the level.\n\nEach level's goal is to play some crude tricks on your neighbor by using every item near the player's character. Each stage has 4 or 5 zones (not including the training stages). Woody must move from zone to zone, as well as hide under the bed and in wardrobe to avoid caught. The neighbor moves in the house by his own routine, which can be disrupted in different ways (such as call him to make him go downstairs) or he gets distracted automatically (for example, painting, washing clothes and so on). The game starts with only few rooms (the hall, bathroom, kitchen and the living room), but as the game progresses, more rooms are unlocked (in Season 2 is the balcony and bedroom, and in Season 3 is the basement and study), making the game more difficult.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = (PC) 69/100<ref name=MCPC>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/neighbors-from-hell|title=Neighbors from Hell for PC Reviews|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref><br />(Xbox) 49/100<ref name=MCXB>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/neighborsfromhell|title=Neighbours From Hell (xbx: 2005): Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=[[CNET]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913102810/http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbx/neighborsfromhell|archivedate=September 13, 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref><br />(GC) 41/100<ref name=MCGC>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/neighbors-from-hell|title=Neighbors From Hell for GameCube Reviews|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| CGM = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Review: Neighbors from Hell|magazine=[[Computer Games Magazine]]|publisher=[[theGlobe.com]]|issue=158|date=January 2004|page=76}}</ref>\n| CGW = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Del Sol|first=Arcadian|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/issues/cgw_234.pdf|title=Neighbors From Hell|magazine=[[Computer Gaming World]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|issue=234|date=January 2004|page=114|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040113101234/http://www.computergaming.com/article2/0,4364,1396253,00.asp|archivedate=January 13, 2004|url-status=live|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| EuroG = 6/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Martin|date=July 30, 2003|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_neighboursfromhell_pc|title=Neighbours From Hell (PC)|website=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=[[Gamer Network]]|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| GSpot = 6.7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Colayco|first=Bob|date=September 23, 2003|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/neighbors-from-hell-review/1900-6075608/|title=Neighbors From Hell Review (PC)|website=[[GameSpot]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| GSpy = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Harker|first=Carla|date=October 23, 2003|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/neighbors-from-hell/6298p1.html|title=GameSpy: Neighbors From Hell (PC)|website=[[GameSpy]]|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| IGN = 7/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Blevins|first=Tal|date=October 1, 2003|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/10/02/neighbors-from-hell-review|title=Neighbors from Hell Review (PC)|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=Ziff Davis|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| PCGUS = 70%<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Saltzman|first=Marc|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2005/07/neighbors_from.html|title=Neighbors From Hell|magazine=[[PC Gamer]]|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|volume=10|issue=11|date=November 2003|page=126|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060315142254/http://www.pcgamer.com/archives/2005/07/neighbors_from.html|archivedate=March 15, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| XPlay = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Hudak|first=Chris|date=October 23, 2003|url=http://www.techtv.com/xplay/reviews/story/0,24330,3549000,00.html|title='Neighbors From Hell' (PC) Review|website=[[X-Play]]|publisher=[[TechTV]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031023210119/http://www.techtv.com/xplay/reviews/story/0,24330,3549000,00.html|archivedate=October 23, 2003|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]''\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Saltzman|first=Marc|date=September 2, 2003|url=http://cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/090203_nfh.html|title=Neighbors from Hell (PC)|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060330175729/http://cincinnati.com/freetime/games/reviews/090203_nfh.html|archivedate=March 30, 2006|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe PC version received \"average\" reviews, while the GameCube and Xbox versions received \"generally unfavorable reviews\", according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggeregation]] website [[Metacritic]].<ref name=MCPC/><ref name=MCXB/><ref name=MCGC/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Sequel==\n{{main|Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation}}\nIn 2004 a sequel was released, called ''[[Neighbours from Hell 2: On Vacation]]''.
