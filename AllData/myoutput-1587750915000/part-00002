It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Raven Metzner]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Finn Jones]] stars as Rand, who protects New York following the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''. [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] also return from the [[Iron Fist (season 1)|first season]] to star, and are joined by [[Simone Missick]], reprising her role from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|Marvel Netflix series]], and [[Alice Eve]]. The season was ordered in July 2017, with Metzner replacing [[Scott Buck]] as showrunner. Filming for the season began in late 2017 in New York City, and continued until May 2018. Focus was placed on improving the fight sequences for the series after [[Iron Fist (season 1)#Fight scene criticisms|criticisms of the first season]], with Clayton Barber taking over as fight coordinator after doing so for the MCU film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''. Each episode in the season is named after a comics issue that Rand has appeared in.\n\nThe season was released on September 7, 2018, and consists of ten episodes. The season received mixed reviews from critics, but was considered a major improvement over the previous season.

Colleen finds a box bearing the [[Kamon (crest)|kamon]] of her family, who pushed her away years earlier. She begins investigating where the box may have come from, and comes to believe that furniture shop owner Frank Choi may know of its origin. He goes missing when he is unable to pay the Golden Tigers for protection. Danny and Ward Meachum\u2014who runs Danny's company\u2014meet with Ward's sister Joy, who asks for them to buy her out of the company; Danny agrees.

Despite Davos's protests, Joy agrees to avoid suspicion. Mary leaves a set of surveillance photos showing Danny and Colleen at the dojo, and when Danny confronts her about them Mary says that they are being watched by someone named Walker. Ward believes that someone at his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings is working for Joy, and becomes paranoid. He ultimately does not come to the dinner. Joy and Davos feign niceties until Colleen demands that they discuss their grievances with Danny. Davos finds the surveillance photos, which he and Joy had arranged to be taken, and the pair leave. Danny and Colleen come to a parlay between the Golden Tigers and the Hatchets, now represented by Mrs. Yang. Negotiations appear successful, but Danny believes that the Golden Tigers have set a trap and attacks them. Mrs. Yang escapes with Colleen.

Danny attempts to reignite peace talks between the triads, but the Golden Tigers have already seized the docks and the Hatchets are preparing to fight back. Danny visits Hai-Qing and realizes that Davos had caused the stroke. Hai-Qing is able to tell Danny what Davos was having brought in at the docks. Danny and Colleen are met by Detective [[Misty Knight]], a friend who Danny gave a robotic arm to after she lost hers fighting the Hand. Misty explains that the trap Danny had seen was actually police officers watching the parlay, and asks Danny to stay away from now on. He instead goes to the docks on his own, but Davos has already killed the Golden Tiger soldiers there and taken what he wanted: the tattooed skin from the corpse of an old Iron Fist. Danny is attacked, drugged, and taken by Walker to the site of a ritual in which the bowl, skin, and Danny's blood are used to transfer the power of the Iron Fist to Davos.\n |LineColor = 314548\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Iron Fist (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Heart of the Dragon\n |DirectedBy = [[Mairzee Almas]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Declan de Barra]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|9|7}}\n |ShortSummary = Bleeding out, Danny is found by a group of local kids who have started their own triad. They plan to give Danny to the Golden Tigers in exchange for a bounty. Colleen and Misty attempt to find Danny by tracking down Walker, and get Ward's help to quickly run a fingerprint search on the surveillance photos. Davos looks to become the Iron Fist that Danny never was, starting with ending the triad war himself. He goes to a nightclub owned by the Golden Tigers and kills their leadership. Joy begins to fear what Davos may do to her, and hires Walker for protection. One of the kids holding Danny, BB\u2014who Colleen had run into several times before\u2014is convinced by Danny to call Colleen. She and Misty find Danny, and Ward gets his NA sponsor Bethany to tend to Danny's injuries. While Ward stays with Danny, Colleen and Misty go to ensure that Joy is safe and find her with Walker.

Hoping that they can reverse the process, Colleen and Misty go to find them leaving Ward to watch over Danny, Joy, and Walker. Walker agrees to take Danny back to where the ritual took place to confront Davos, leaving Ward and Joy to discuss their relationship. Joy refuses to forgive Ward and leaves him. After explaining that they are accessories to a crime, Misty gets the Crane Sisters to agree to reversing the ritual. Walker reveals to Danny that she actually plans to kill Davos before running away to live in a secluded cabin in peace. This would allow her to avoid any of the triggers that bring Mary to the surface. Danny convinces her to take Davos hostage instead, and when he returns from his killing spree across the city Davos is subdued. He manages to break Danny's leg before falling unconscious.

Misty hopes to gain the help of the local police precinct to stop Davos, but Captain William Pike is unwilling to do so since Davos is putting an end to organised crime in the neighborhood. In addition to continuing his killing spree, Davos recruits the gang of local kids and plans to train them as soldiers to help fight his war against crime in New York City. Danny also wants to begin training again, hoping that Colleen will re-open her dojo for teaching. She does not want to take the responsibility for a student who could fight and die, but eventually relents and begins training Danny to fight with his injury. Misty learns the requirements of the ritual from Prada, and goes in search of more help. Ward turns to alcohol to drown his sorrows, despite the protests of Bethany. Ward later hears her reveal in an NA meeting that she is pregnant with his child. Joy visits Mary, who realizes that she is protected by Walker.

Joy attempts to undermine Davos by searching for the bowl, and asks Ward to take over a business venture that she is carrying out in the memory of their mother. He worries that she is in danger, and Walker agrees to help him kill Davos. BB helps Joy steal the bowl, while Davos unsuccessfully tries to convince the wider community of the nobility of his crusade. The remnants of the triads band together to stop him, and all Danny can do is try and stop him first. Colleen tries to teach Danny to overcome his emotional bond to Davos, allowing him to realize the negative impact on his life that the Iron Fist has had.

Misty returns with a police taskforce ready to capture Davos, as well as Frank Choi who had cut a deal to turn on the Golden Tigers. From Choi's information, Colleen deduces that her mother came to New York and could still be in the city. Davos discovers the missing bowl, and critically injures Joy by pushing her off a balcony. BB contacts the rest of his gang, hoping that they will see reason, but they tell Davos that he has gone to a community center where Colleen volunteers. Danny and Colleen go to the center to stop the combined triads from mobilizing to attack, but Davos and his gang arrive. BB faces his gang, and is killed.

Misty wakes up, escapes capture, and helps Danny stop Walker by triggering Mary. Colleen fights Davos, and is able to draw the rest of the Iron Fist power out of him. With Davos arrested, Danny is unsure of his purpose in life. Colleen prepares to protect the streets of Chinatown as the new Iron Fist, while Joy attempts to return to her normal life. Walker, considering the possibility of having another, more violent identity, decides to stay affiliated with Joy and her influence. Ward attempts to reconcile with Bethany, but she chooses to raise their child on her own. Danny decides to leave New York to find [[Orson Randall]], the man from whom Davos acquired the Iron Fist corpse.

Metzner pitched a story for the season that excited Marvel, and Loeb compared the change to a new writer taking over on a comic.<ref name=\"NewShowrunnerExplanation\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season begins after the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and sees Rand fulfill his promise to protect New York following the supposed death of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] at the end of that miniseries. For the season, Metzner also wanted to explore more of the mythology of [[K'un-Lun]] than was shown in the first season by spending more time there.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Each episode is named after the issue title of various comics Danny Rand has appeared in,<ref name=\"S2EpisodeTitlesEliteDaily\" /> after the first season named each episode after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"S1EpTitlesKungFu\" />\n\nWhen asked how the season would be influenced by the criticisms of the first, Metzner said that Marvel had allowed him to tell his own story rather than follow on from the first season and so he just approached the project as a fan of the comics and characters. He described the second season as an \"evolution\" of the first.<ref name=\"MetznerS1Criticisms\" /> Jones felt that Rand would be more relatable for the audience in the second season after moving in with his girlfriend and spending less time around Rand Enterprises. Metzner described this approach as \"[[holistic]]\", wanting the series to feel like being on the streets of New York.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[Finn Jones]], [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] reprise their roles as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand / Iron Fist]], [[Colleen Wing]], [[Ward Meachum]], [[Joy Meachum]], and [[Steel Serpent|Davos]], respectively. They are joined in the season by [[Alice Eve]] as [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]].<ref name=\"EveCast\" /><ref name=\"TyphoidMary\" /> Metzner had previously written a different version of Typhoid Mary for the film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005), and was always interested in that character and well-versed in her comic story. Eve described her introduction in the season as an origin story that explores the mystery of the character's multiple personalities, while Loeb said, \"We meet her at a certain point in her life and then cards get tipped over as you go.\"<ref name=\"EveCBRAug2018\" />\n\nWith the announcement of the season, it was revealed that [[Simone Missick]] would appear, reprising her role as [[Misty Knight]] from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|MCU Netflix series]].<ref name=\"S2Announce\" /> This allows for the exploration of the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] team that Wing and Knight form in the comics.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> [[James C. Chen|James Chen]] had also joined the cast as Sam Chung, a role loosely based on the comics supporting character of the [[Blindspot (Sam Chung)|same name]].<ref name=\"SamChung\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the season was expected to begin \"soon\" after it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"FilmingSoon\" /> with actor [[Sacha Dhawan]] saying then that \"they're hopefully starting\" by December 2017.<ref name=\"DhawanFilming\" /> By December 13, filming on the season had begun,<ref name=\"FilmingBegin\" /> in New York City where the production [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 10, 2018. Jones described this as the end of a \"long and physical 7 month winter shoot\".<ref name=\"FilmingWrapped\" /> Extensive filming took place in New York's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Niels Alpert served as cinematographer for the season.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\nClayton Barber took over as the fight coordinator for the season, having also served in the role on Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018),<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> after the fight choreography of the first season was widely criticized. Barber was inspired by \"old school kung fu\" such as the works of [[Jackie Chan]], and wanted to make the fights of the series feel like \"a punk rock song\".<ref name=\"BarberSDCC\" /><ref name=\"BarberSDCCVid\" /> Metzner noted that Jones had months of lead time before work on the season began to \"hone his skills\" with the fighting and stunts, and said that he and the rest of the cast along with Barber \"really pushed themselves\" with the fight sequences in the season. Jones added that all of the fight scenes have \"an emotional standpoint\" so that they drive the story forward rather than simply being \"awesome fight scenes\" for the sake of having fights.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesFightsSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Music===\nRobert Lydecker composed the music for the season.<ref name=\"Lydecker\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nThe fictional country of Sokovia that was introduced in the MCU film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) is referenced in the season as part of Walker's past as an operative in the country.<ref name=\"AoU\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nJones, Henwick, Missick, Eve, Loeb, Metzner, and Barber promoted the season at San Diego Comic-Con 2018.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Charles Pulliam-Moore of [[io9]] felt the footage shown at the panel left him optimistic for the season, since \"It finally feels like ''Iron Fist'' may have figured out what people wanted out of this show in the first place.\" He felt the clips showed \"how drastic an improvement\" there was to the fight choreography, thanks in part to new fight coordinator Barber joining the series. One clip that showed Rand facing Davos in K'un-Lun felt \"brutal and bloody\" while also being \"fluid and elegant in a way that feels fresh, new, and {{em|exactly}} like what you want from ''Iron Fist''.\"<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> At the panel, Loeb appeared in a karate costume, as part of a comedic bit with Henwick, who later appeared on stage telling Loeb to remove the outfit. Some criticized the outfit as insensitive and \"several layers of bad\".<ref name=\"TeenVogueLoebOutfit\" /><ref name=\"BuzzFeedLoebOutfit\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Iron Fist'', consisting of ten episodes,<ref name=\"IFS2Episodes\" /> was released on September 7, 2018, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 57% approval rating, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.69/10.

name]], follows Danny Rand / Iron Fist, a martial arts expert with the ability to call upon the power of the Iron Fist. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Raven Metzner]] serving as [[showrunner]].\n\n[[Finn Jones]] stars as Rand, who protects New York following the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''.

The season was ordered in July 2017, with Metzner replacing [[Scott Buck]] as showrunner. Filming for the season began in late 2017 in New York City, and continued until May 2018. Focus was placed on improving the fight sequences for the series after [[Iron Fist (season 1)#Fight scene criticisms|criticisms of the first season]], with Clayton Barber taking over as fight coordinator after doing so for the MCU film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]''.

The season received mixed reviews from critics, but was considered a major improvement over the previous season.

He goes missing when he is unable to pay the Golden Tigers for protection. Danny and Ward Meachum\u2014who runs Danny's company\u2014meet with Ward's sister Joy, who asks for them to buy her out of the company; Danny agrees.

She develops feelings for Danny in response to his kindness. Joy and Davos use blackmail to acquire an antique bowl from Mika Prada, an old acquaintance of Joy's.

Ward believes that someone at his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings is working for Joy, and becomes paranoid. He ultimately does not come to the dinner. Joy and Davos feign niceties until Colleen demands that they discuss their grievances with Danny. Davos finds the surveillance photos, which he and Joy had arranged to be taken, and the pair leave. Danny and Colleen come to a parlay between the Golden Tigers and the Hatchets, now represented by Mrs. Yang.

Danny visits Hai-Qing and realizes that Davos had caused the stroke. Hai-Qing is able to tell Danny what Davos was having brought in at the docks. Danny and Colleen are met by Detective [[Misty Knight]], a friend who Danny gave a robotic arm to after she lost hers fighting the Hand. Misty explains that the trap Danny had seen was actually police officers watching the parlay, and asks Danny to stay away from now on. He instead goes to the docks on his own, but Davos has already killed the Golden Tiger soldiers there and taken what he wanted: the tattooed skin from the corpse of an old Iron Fist.

Davos looks to become the Iron Fist that Danny never was, starting with ending the triad war himself. He goes to a nightclub owned by the Golden Tigers and kills their leadership. Joy begins to fear what Davos may do to her, and hires Walker for protection. One of the kids holding Danny, BB\u2014who Colleen had run into several times before\u2014is convinced by Danny to call Colleen. She and Misty find Danny, and Ward gets his NA sponsor Bethany to tend to Danny's injuries. While Ward stays with Danny, Colleen and Misty go to ensure that Joy is safe and find her with Walker.

After explaining that they are accessories to a crime, Misty gets the Crane Sisters to agree to reversing the ritual. Walker reveals to Danny that she actually plans to kill Davos before running away to live in a secluded cabin in peace. This would allow her to avoid any of the triggers that bring Mary to the surface. Danny convinces her to take Davos hostage instead, and when he returns from his killing spree across the city Davos is subdued. He manages to break Danny's leg before falling unconscious.

Misty hopes to gain the help of the local police precinct to stop Davos, but Captain William Pike is unwilling to do so since Davos is putting an end to organised crime in the neighborhood. In addition to continuing his killing spree, Davos recruits the gang of local kids and plans to train them as soldiers to help fight his war against crime in New York City. Danny also wants to begin training again, hoping that Colleen will re-open her dojo for teaching. She does not want to take the responsibility for a student who could fight and die, but eventually relents and begins training Danny to fight with his injury. Misty learns the requirements of the ritual from Prada, and goes in search of more help. Ward turns to alcohol to drown his sorrows, despite the protests of Bethany. Ward later hears her reveal in an NA meeting that she is pregnant with his child. Joy visits Mary, who realizes that she is protected by Walker.

Walker always believed that it was Mary who broke them out, and psychiatrist Paul Edmonds suggests that they may have another alternate personality; Walker dismisses this idea. Joy attempts to undermine Davos by searching for the bowl, and asks Ward to take over a business venture that she is carrying out in the memory of their mother. He worries that she is in danger, and Walker agrees to help him kill Davos. BB helps Joy steal the bowl, while Davos unsuccessfully tries to convince the wider community of the nobility of his crusade. The remnants of the triads band together to stop him, and all Danny can do is try and stop him first.

From Choi's information, Colleen deduces that her mother came to New York and could still be in the city. Davos discovers the missing bowl, and critically injures Joy by pushing her off a balcony. BB contacts the rest of his gang, hoping that they will see reason, but they tell Davos that he has gone to a community center where Colleen volunteers. Danny and Colleen go to the center to stop the combined triads from mobilizing to attack, but Davos and his gang arrive. BB faces his gang, and is killed. Colleen fights the rest off until Misty and the police can arrive. Danny overpowers Davos, and meets the Crane Sisters at the dojo to undertake the ritual again.

Misty wakes up, escapes capture, and helps Danny stop Walker by triggering Mary. Colleen fights Davos, and is able to draw the rest of the Iron Fist power out of him. With Davos arrested, Danny is unsure of his purpose in life. Colleen prepares to protect the streets of Chinatown as the new Iron Fist, while Joy attempts to return to her normal life.

Metzner pitched a story for the season that excited Marvel, and Loeb compared the change to a new writer taking over on a comic.<ref name=\"NewShowrunnerExplanation\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season begins after the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and sees Rand fulfill his promise to protect New York following the supposed death of [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] at the end of that miniseries. For the season, Metzner also wanted to explore more of the mythology of [[K'un-Lun]] than was shown in the first season by spending more time there.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Each episode is named after the issue title of various comics Danny Rand has appeared in,<ref name=\"S2EpisodeTitlesEliteDaily\" /> after the first season named each episode after [[Shaolin Kung Fu]] sequences.<ref name=\"S1EpTitlesKungFu\" />\n\nWhen asked how the season would be influenced by the criticisms of the first, Metzner said that Marvel had allowed him to tell his own story rather than follow on from the first season and so he just approached the project as a fan of the comics and characters. He described the second season as an \"evolution\" of the first.<ref name=\"MetznerS1Criticisms\" /> Jones felt that Rand would be more relatable for the audience in the second season after moving in with his girlfriend and spending less time around Rand Enterprises. Metzner described this approach as \"[[holistic]]\", wanting the series to feel like being on the streets of New York.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[Finn Jones]], [[Jessica Henwick]], [[Tom Pelphrey]], [[Jessica Stroup]], and [[Sacha Dhawan]] reprise their roles as [[Iron Fist (comics)|Danny Rand / Iron Fist]], [[Colleen Wing]], [[Ward Meachum]], [[Joy Meachum]], and [[Steel Serpent|Davos]], respectively. They are joined in the season by [[Alice Eve]] as [[Typhoid Mary (comics)|Typhoid Mary]].<ref name=\"EveCast\" /><ref name=\"TyphoidMary\" /> Metzner had previously written a different version of Typhoid Mary for the film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005), and was always interested in that character and well-versed in her comic story. Eve described her introduction in the season as an origin story that explores the mystery of the character's multiple personalities, while Loeb said, \"We meet her at a certain point in her life and then cards get tipped over as you go.\"<ref name=\"EveCBRAug2018\" />\n\nWith the announcement of the season, it was revealed that [[Simone Missick]] would appear, reprising her role as [[Misty Knight]] from previous [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Netflix series|MCU Netflix series]].<ref name=\"S2Announce\" /> This allows for the exploration of the [[Daughters of the Dragon]] team that Wing and Knight form in the comics.<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> [[James C. Chen|James Chen]] had also joined the cast as Sam Chung, a role loosely based on the comics supporting character of the [[Blindspot (Sam Chung)|same name]].<ref name=\"SamChung\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the season was expected to begin \"soon\" after it was announced at San Diego Comic-Con,<ref name=\"FilmingSoon\" /> with actor [[Sacha Dhawan]] saying then that \"they're hopefully starting\" by December 2017.<ref name=\"DhawanFilming\" /> By December 13, filming on the season had begun,<ref name=\"FilmingBegin\" /> in New York City where the production [[Wrap (filmmaking)|wrapped]] on May 10, 2018. Jones described this as the end of a \"long and physical 7 month winter shoot\".<ref name=\"FilmingWrapped\" /> Extensive filming took place in New York's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].<ref name=\"CBRSDCCPanel\" /> Niels Alpert served as cinematographer for the season.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesRelatableSDCCCBR\" />\n\nClayton Barber took over as the fight coordinator for the season, having also served in the role on Marvel's ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' (2018),<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> after the fight choreography of the first season was widely criticized. Barber was inspired by \"old school kung fu\" such as the works of [[Jackie Chan]], and wanted to make the fights of the series feel like \"a punk rock song\".<ref name=\"BarberSDCC\" /><ref name=\"BarberSDCCVid\" /> Metzner noted that Jones had months of lead time before work on the season began to \"hone his skills\" with the fighting and stunts, and said that he and the rest of the cast along with Barber \"really pushed themselves\" with the fight sequences in the season. Jones added that all of the fight scenes have \"an emotional standpoint\" so that they drive the story forward rather than simply being \"awesome fight scenes\" for the sake of having fights.<ref name=\"MetznerJonesFightsSDCCCBR\" />\n\n===Music===\nRobert Lydecker composed the music for the season.<ref name=\"Lydecker\" />\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nThe fictional country of Sokovia that was introduced in the MCU film ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015) is referenced in the season as part of Walker's past as an operative in the country.<ref name=\"AoU\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Iron Fist'', consisting of ten episodes,<ref name=\"IFS2Episodes\" /> was released on September 7, 2018, on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]] and [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nJones, Henwick, Missick, Eve, Loeb, Metzner, and Barber promoted the season at San Diego Comic-Con 2018.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Charles Pulliam-Moore of [[io9]] felt the footage shown at the panel left him optimistic for the season, since \"It finally feels like ''Iron Fist'' may have figured out what people wanted out of this show in the first place.\" He felt the clips showed \"how drastic an improvement\" there was to the fight choreography, thanks in part to new fight coordinator Barber joining the series. One clip that showed Rand facing Davos in K'un-Lun felt \"brutal and bloody\" while also being \"fluid and elegant in a way that feels fresh, new, and {{em|exactly}} like what you want from ''Iron Fist''.\"<ref name=\"io9ComicCon\" /> At the panel, Loeb appeared in a karate costume, as part of a comedic bit with Henwick, who later appeared on stage telling Loeb to remove the outfit. Some criticized the outfit as insensitive and \"several layers of bad\".<ref name=\"TeenVogueLoebOutfit\" /><ref name=\"BuzzFeedLoebOutfit\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 57% approval rating, based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 5.69/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Better action scenes and tighter pacing elevate ''Iron Fist''{{'}}s second season, but it remains a lesser light among MCU shows.\"<ref>{{cite web
