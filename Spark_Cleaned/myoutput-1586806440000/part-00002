Cora was then a baseball analyst for [[ESPN]] before becoming a coach and manager.\n\nIn November 2019, Cora was implicated in a [[Houston Astros sign stealing scandal|sign-stealing scandal]] during his time as a coach with the [[Houston Astros]].<ref name=carobeltran/> Amid an investigation to determine if he took part in another such scandal during his time managing the Red Sox,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2870185-mlbs-war-on-sign-stealing-shifts-to-alex-cora-and-the-boston-red-sox |title=MLB's War on Sign-Stealing Shifts to Alex Cora and the Boston Red Sox |first=Zachary D. |last=Rymer |website=[[Bleacher Report]] |date=January 8, 2020 |accessdate=January 14, 2020}}</ref> Cora and the Red Sox mutually agreed to part ways in January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/redsox/2020/01/14/alex-cora-out-red-sox-manager/SHuDNO9tab46sz6wVeqvxH/story.html|title=Alex Cora out as Red Sox manager - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com|language=en-US|date=2020-01-14|access-date=2020-01-15|url-access=limited}}</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\n===Early career===\nCora was drafted in the 12th round of the [[1993 Major League Baseball draft]] by the [[Minnesota Twins]], but did not sign a contract and decided instead to play collegiate baseball at the [[University of Miami]]. While there, Cora was named to the [[College World Series]] all-tournament team in both 1995 and 1996. He led the team to the title game in [[1996 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|1996]], a game they lost to [[Louisiana State University]].\n\nCora was rated by ''[[Baseball America]]'' as the best collegiate defensive player going into the [[1996 Major League Baseball draft|1996 draft]]. Cora was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the third round, and played 61 games of the 1996 season with the [[Minor League Baseball#Class A-Advanced|Class A-Advanced]] [[Vero Beach Dodgers]], batting .257 with no home runs and 26 RBIs. He played the 1997 season with the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[San Antonio Missions]]; in 127 games he batted .234 with 3 home runs and 48 RBIs. Cora spent parts of the 1998, 1999, and 2000 seasons with the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[Albuquerque Dukes]], hitting .264 in 81 games, .308 in 80 games, and .373 in 30 games, respectively.\n\n===Los Angeles Dodgers===\nCora made his major league debut on June 7, 1998, with the Dodgers against the [[Seattle Mariners]]; his brother [[Joey Cora]] was Seattle's starting second baseman in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1998/B06070SEA1998.htm |title=Los Angeles Dodgers 7, Seattle Mariners 4 |website=[[Retrosheet]] |date=June 7, 1998}}</ref> Alex Cora spent the next seven years in Los Angeles, appearing in a total of 684 games while batting .246 with 27 home runs and 173 RBIs. During his time with the Dodgers, he played at second base and shortstop. During the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Cora mostly played shortstop as the Dodgers moved the aging [[Mark Grudzielanek]] to second base.  With the emergence of [[C\u00e9sar Izturis]] in 2002, and the trade of Grudzielanek to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in December of the same year, Cora spent the rest of his stint with the Dodgers as their primary second baseman.\n\nCora played in one postseason series with the Dodgers, the [[2004 National League Division Series|2004 NLDS]], which the Dodgers lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Cora was the Dodgers' second baseman in all four games, batting 2-for-15 (.133) during the series.\n\n===Cleveland Indians===\nIn January 2005, Cora signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]], where he appeared in 49 games, with 22 starts at shortstop and 14 at second base; he batted .205 with a home run and 8 RBIs.

In the [[2005 American League Division Series|2005 ALDS]], which Boston lost to the [[Chicago White Sox]] in a three-game sweep, Cora played in one game as a defensive replacement, without a [[plate appearance]].\n\nCora was originally intended to back up shortstop [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]]. With the trade of Renter\u00eda to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in December 2005, Cora was being eyed to take the position of starting shortstop, until the Red Sox acquired [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (infielder, born 1977)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]] in February 2006. For the 2006 season, Cora appeared in 96 games, batting .238 with one home run and 18 RBIs.\n\nCora was a member of the Red Sox team that won the [[2007 World Series]]. During the regular season, he appeared in 83 games and batted .246 with 3 home runs and 18 RBIs. In the postseason, he appeared as a late-innings defensive replacement in two games of the [[2007 American League Championship Series|2007 ALCS]] and two games of the World Series.

While there, Cora was named to the [[College World Series]] all-tournament team in both 1995 and 1996. He led the team to the title game in [[1996 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament|1996]], a game they lost to [[Louisiana State University]].\n\nCora was rated by ''[[Baseball America]]'' as the best collegiate defensive player going into the [[1996 Major League Baseball draft|1996 draft]]. Cora was drafted by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in the third round, and played 61 games of the 1996 season with the [[Minor League Baseball#Class A-Advanced|Class A-Advanced]] [[Vero Beach Dodgers]], batting .257 with no home runs and 26 RBIs.

During his time with the Dodgers, he played at second base and shortstop. During the 2000 and 2001 seasons, Cora mostly played shortstop as the Dodgers moved the aging [[Mark Grudzielanek]] to second base.  With the emergence of [[C\u00e9sar Izturis]] in 2002, and the trade of Grudzielanek to the [[Chicago Cubs]] in December of the same year, Cora spent the rest of his stint with the Dodgers as their primary second baseman.\n\nCora played in one postseason series with the Dodgers, the [[2004 National League Division Series|2004 NLDS]], which the Dodgers lost to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. Cora was the Dodgers' second baseman in all four games, batting 2-for-15 (.133) during the series.\n\n===Cleveland Indians===\nIn January 2005, Cora signed as a [[free agent]] with the [[Cleveland Indians]], where he appeared in 49 games, with 22 starts at shortstop and 14 at second base; he batted .205 with a home run and 8 RBIs.

In the [[2005 American League Division Series|2005 ALDS]], which Boston lost to the [[Chicago White Sox]] in a three-game sweep, Cora played in one game as a defensive replacement, without a [[plate appearance]].\n\nCora was originally intended to back up shortstop [[\u00c9dgar Renter\u00eda]]. With the trade of Renter\u00eda to the [[Atlanta Braves]] in December 2005, Cora was being eyed to take the position of starting shortstop, until the Red Sox acquired [[\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez (infielder, born 1977)|\u00c1lex Gonz\u00e1lez]] in February 2006. For the 2006 season, Cora appeared in 96 games, batting .238 with one home run and 18 RBIs.\n\nCora was a member of the Red Sox team that won the [[2007 World Series]]. During the regular season, he appeared in 83 games and batted .246 with 3 home runs and 18 RBIs. In the postseason, he appeared as a late-innings defensive replacement in two games of the [[2007 American League Championship Series|2007 ALCS]] and two games of the World Series. He had one [[plate appearance]], a [[sacrifice bunt]] in [[2007 World Series#Game 3|World Series game 3]].\n\nFor the 2008 regular season, Cora played in 75 games, batting .270 with no home runs and 9 RBIs.
