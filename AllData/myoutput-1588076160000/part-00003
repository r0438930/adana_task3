Its King Ugrasena (Gummadi) loves his daughter Rupa a lot. According to astrologer's prediction, Rupa marries an ordinary citizen. Here Ugrasena becomes furious and wants to change the fate, so, he finds whereabouts of the boy Chandrasena through astrologers and orders to eliminate him. But the boy escapes and grows up at an ashram along with his mother Annapurna (Malathi). Years roll by, once in hunting, Rupa (Jayasri) gets acquaintance with Chandrasena (N. T. Rama Rao) and both of them fall in love. Meanwhile, Ugrasena announces a sports competition in the capital in which Chandrasena prevails and the king honors him. That night, Chandrasena secretly enters the fort, meets Rupa and captured by soldiers. At that moment, Annapurna pleads the king to leave her son, but in vain Ugrasena recognizes him as the same and commands to throw him into the cellar of demons. But Chandrasena kills the demon, reaches Rupa and while escaping they drop into a death house. Hence, the king announces whoever brings his daughter will be largess with a huge amount for which two guys, Takku (Relangi) and Tikku (Ramana Reddy) moves. In the death house, Rupa is caught by an enchanter (Shobhan Babu) and takes her to their Queen Gandharva Rani (Mohana) and entrusts a challenge of getting a musical tree to Chandrasena from ''Chambala Island'', ruled by wizard Kanakaksha (Mukkamala) in exchange of Rupa. After setting off on an adventurous journey, Chandrasena reaches the island where Kanakaksha's daughter Champa (Girija) falls for him, trapping her, he succeeds in achieving the musical tree and relieves Rupa. But unfortunately, Kanakaksha takes Chandrasena back by transforming into a garland. Helpless, Rupa seized by Takku-Tikku. Parallelly, on the island, Kanakaksha demands Chandrasena to marry his daughter, but he refuses, so, he keeps him in the prison and tortures. Fortunately, Rupa escapes from Takku-Tikku and gets back to the death house, reaches ''Chamba Island'' with the help of the musical tree and lets Chandrasena free.
