It was the longest and largest parade in the Soviet capital, lasting hours and utilizing 40,000 [[Red Army]] soldiers as well as 1,850 military vehicles. It took place over a month after the victory actually took place on 9 May, the day of Germany's surrender. Intensive preparations for the parade took place in late May and early June in Moscow. The preliminary rehearsal of the Victory Parade took place at [[Khodynka Aerodrome]], and the general rehearsal on Red Square on June 22. The day after the parade, a reception was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace in honor of the participants in the Victory Parade.<ref>https://www.prlib.ru/history/619337</ref> After the 1945 parade, Victory Day became obsolete in the [[Soviet Union]], with parades only being held on major jubilee, in part to make favor for the [[October Revolution Day]] parade which took place every year in the winter. In the decades that followed, 3 parades were held: in 1965, 1985<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/05/10/world/katyushas-and-missiles-in-red-square.html]</ref><ref>http://vvpobeda.shpl.ru/pob1985.html</ref>, and 1990.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dp.ru/a/2016/05/06/Parad_Pobedi|title=\u041a\u0430\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b \u0432 1945\u20132016 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0445|website=www.dp.ru|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tass.ru/obschestvo/1171423|title=\u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b: \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0432\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432|website=\u0422\u0410\u0421\u0421|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref><ref>\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u0438 / \u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u0412.\u00a0\u041c.\u00a0\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0438\u043f\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u0418.\u00a0\u041f.\u00a0\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0438\u043d\u0430. 3-\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434. \u041c., 1987.</ref><ref>https://m.sputnik-georgia.ru/russia/20200417/248265859/Istoriya-paradov-Pobedy-na-Krasnoy-ploschadi.html?mobile_return=no</ref>\n\nThe Victory Day Parade of 1995 was held to commemorate the [[golden jubilee]] of the Soviet victory in the war.<ref>http://tass.ru/obschestvo/1171423</ref> It was the first one held in the newly formed [[Russian Federation]], taking place 5 years after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]]. The parade was divided into two parts, a full military parade on [[Poklonnaya Hill]] and a veterans ceremony on [[Red Square]]. The [[2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade|2020 edition of the parade]], marking the [[diamond jubilee|75th anniversary]] of the victory over Nazi Germany, was postponed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://tass.ru/obschestvo/8263303</ref><ref>https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/16/putin-postpones-75th-victory-day-parade-over-coronavirus-a70022</ref>  It was the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resumption of military parades in 1995 that parade was to be cancelled on a holiday itself.\n\n==Description==\nOn the morning of the parade, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment.\n\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55&nbsp;am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\n\nAs the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10&nbsp;am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the [[Victory Banner]]. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''[[Slavsya]]'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, [[tachanka]]s and [[horse artillery]] in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\n\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''\n\nAs the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nThe ground column ends, as the massed bands play either Victory Day or \"Let's Go\", with the traditional marchpast of the [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]], which has been done since the golden jubilee [[October Revolution Day]] parade of 1967 as a commemoration of the school's importance as the first military officer cadet school to be established in modern-day Russia, the first time it had been seen last in the Victory Day parade ground column was in 1985 (the two battalions of the school's Corps of Cadets also march past the square in memory of the cadets who fought in the 1941 [[Battle of Moscow]]). With the ground segment competed the bands stop playing at the signal of the senior director and the senior drum majors and, to give way to the mobile column, march towards the facade of the GUM department store, with two sections of the MMMC Corps of Drums at either side of the bands, reflecting the formations of the massed bands alongside the Corps of Drums in the Red Square parades of the 1950s and the 1960s.\n\nThe mobile column starts with the drivepast of historical vehicles in jubilee years. In non-special anniversary years only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner leads the column of tens of military vehicles and equipment. As the Massed Bands play appropriate music the column drives past the stands in the Square, with the crew commanders and unit leaders executing a hand salute in the eyes right position (save for MRLs and mobile ICBMs). Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the ''Aviamarch'' and other air marches the flypast marks the formal termination of the parade with tens of aircraft from the Air Force flying past above the square in full view of everyone in attendance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} \n\n===Full order of the parade===\nThe parade march past order, since the parade of 2010, is arranged in the following manner as it passes before the dignitaries:\n\n* Corps of Drums, Moscow Military Music College\n* [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]]\n* Youth contingents\n** Survorov and Nakhimov Military Schools\n** Cadet Corps colleges of the Armed Forces and other uniformed organizations\n** [[Young Army Cadets National Movement]] Moscow Area (led by the Chairman, includes female students of the Moscow National Pensions School Cadet Corps)\n* [[Russian Ground Forces]]\n* [[Russian Aerospace Forces]]\n* Russian Navy\n* Regiment of female cadets of Armed Forces academies (starting 2016 as a battalion, expanded to full regiment in 2017)\n* Strategic Missile Troops\n* Russian Airborne Troops\n* Military Police (beginning 2018)\n* NBC Troops\n* Russian Railway Troops\n* Border Service of the Federal Security Service\n* Ministry of Emergency Situations\n* [[Police of Russia]] (beginning 2019)\n* [[National Guard of Russia]] [[Separate Operational Purpose Division]] ([[National Guard Forces Command]])\n* Military forces of the Western Military District\n* [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]] ''Supreme Soviet of Russia''\n\n===Preparations===\n[[File:EUCOM Image (2).jpg|thumb|The American contingent at the general rehearsal parade in [[Alabino]] in 2010.]]\nEarly preparations for the parade begin in the last two months of the previous year. In these early stages, organizers at the MoD discuss the size of the parade, units/military equipment attending, extra details and on jubilee years, the invitation pf foreign troops. During this time, regular participants practice their drill routines from their home units at various locations. Full parade rehearsals begin in March at a training center in the village of [[Alabino]], which is located in the [[Moscow Oblast]]. In their working uniforms, parade participants do a full run through of the entire ceremony to the closest extent possible. In the last week of April, the rehesals are moved to Red Square, as they are conducted in the evening time. The [[flypast]] segment of the parade begin during these practice runs with all aircraft practicing from the Kubinka airfield. In some cases, the flypast is rehearsed solely without any mobile and ground columns. Typically, the final dress rehearsal takes place 2-3 days before the actual parade and is usually livestreamed on outlets such as [[Ruptly]].\n\n===Presiding officers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! width=\"90\" |Year\n! width=\"90\" |Parade commander \n! width=\"90\" |Parade inspector  \n|-\n|1945\n|Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]\n|Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]]\n|-\n|1965\n|General of the Army [[Afanasy Beloborodov]]\n|Marshal [[Rodion Malinovsky]]\n|-\n|1985\n|General of the Army [[Pyotr Lushev]]\n|Marshal [[Sergey Sokolov (commander)|Sergey Sokolov]]\n|-\n|1990\n|Colonel General [[Nikolai Vasilyevich Kalinin]]\n|Marshal [[Dmitry Yazov]]\n|-\n|1995\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Govorov]]/Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Viktor Kulikov]]/General of the Army [[Pavel Grachev]]\n|-\n|1996\n|Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|General of the Army [[Pavel Grachev]]\n|-\n|1997\n|Lieutenant General Igor Puzanov\n|General of the Army [[Igor Rodionov]]\n|-\n|1998\n|Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|1999\n|Colonel General Igor Puzanov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|2000\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Govorov]]/Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|2001\n|Colonel General Nikolai Makarov\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2005\n|General of the Army Ivan Efremov\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2006\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2007\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2008\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2009\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2010\n|Colonel General [[Valery Gerasimov]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2014\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2015\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2016\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2017\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2018\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2019\n|General of the Army [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2020\n|General of the Army [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|}\n\n==Traditions and recent additions==\n[[File:20yearsvictory.jpg|thumb|A jubilee medal awarded for parade participants in 1965.]]\n2008 marked a return to tradition as well as the reorganization of the parade to fit the modern era.

It was abandoned due to reconstruction of the [[Iberian Gate and Chapel]], which was originally destroyed to fill the very purpose of making way for tanks during the mobile column of the parade. That same year an [[airshow]] was introduced and it also became the first major Russian military parade to be seen on worldwide television when [[RT (TV network)|RT]] carried a live broadcast of the parade for the first time.

It was the longest and largest parade in the Soviet capital, lasting hours and utilizing 40,000 [[Red Army]] soldiers as well as 1,850 military vehicles. It took place over a month after the victory actually took place on 9 May, the day of Germany's surrender. Intensive preparations for the parade took place in late May and early June in Moscow. The preliminary rehearsal of the Victory Parade took place at [[Khodynka Aerodrome]], and the general rehearsal on Red Square on June 22. The day after the parade, a reception was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace in honor of the participants in the Victory Parade.<ref>https://www.prlib.ru/history/619337</ref> After the 1945 parade, Victory Day became obsolete in the [[Soviet Union]], with parades only being held on major jubilee, in part to make favor for the [[October Revolution Day]] parade which took place every year in the winter.

The parade was divided into two parts, a full military parade on [[Poklonnaya Hill]] and a veterans ceremony on [[Red Square]]. The [[2020 Moscow Victory Day Parade|2020 edition of the parade]], marking the [[diamond jubilee|75th anniversary]] of the victory over Nazi Germany, was postponed due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://tass.ru/obschestvo/8263303</ref><ref>https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/04/16/putin-postpones-75th-victory-day-parade-over-coronavirus-a70022</ref>  It was the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resumption of military parades in 1995 that parade was to be cancelled on a holiday itself.\n\n==Description==\nOn the morning of the parade, an estimated 14,000 military personnel, including a regiment of female cadets and youth cadets, assemble by battalions on the square together with the more than 210 vehicles and 3,800 vehicle crews assembled on Tverskaya Street just north of the [[Manezhnaya Square, Moscow]], during the major parades a battalion or company of historical Red Army vehicles, estimated at around 36 vehicles and composed of just the [[T-34]], GAZ-67 and the SU-100 plus the optional BM-13N (or at around an estimated 480 when counting other vehicles of the war which would take part just like in the parades of 1985 and 1990) assemble on the street as well with modern military hardware of the Armed Forces and the National Guard (and optionally by the other uniformed organizations). At the air bases outside Moscow (in areas like [[Kubinka]]), more than 88 aircraft are assembled with their aircrews for the flypast segment.\n\nThe celebrations begin at 9:55&nbsp;am Moscow Standard Time with the arrival of the President and the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] to a special grandstand in front of [[Lenin's Mausoleum]], where six of the past parades were reviewed by national leaders. They greet the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, service commanders, deputy ministers in the Ministry of Defence and commanders of the support units within the Armed Forces, together with veterans, veterans' families and representatives of the Suvorov and Nakhimov Schools assembled. To the left and right of the grandstand are the stands wherein veterans, veterans' families and descendants and families of personnel killed in action are gathered. In between the grandstand to the south of the stands are two platoons of armed linemen and markers from the [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] in the Imperial-styled military uniforms and some unarmed half-companies of the Kremlin Regiment, both of which would be later taking post to mark the distance of the troops marching past and to line the square's western side facing the Kremlin together with extra drum majors from the Band Service, which are there to coordinate the march past to be timed in with the music of the bands since the parade of 1995. At the square, the parade commander (usually a Colonel General or rarely a General of the Army with the billet of Commander of the Ground Forces or as the Deputy Chief of General Staff) takes his place in a special an Aurus Senat armored limousine (formerly a Zil until 2018), having just received the report on the readiness of the parade from the commandant of the Combined Arms Academy who is a general officer.\n\nAs the [[Spasskaya Tower]] of the [[Kremlin]] sounds the chimes at 10&nbsp;am the parade commander orders the parade to present arms as the 154th PICR's 1st Honor Guard Company Colour Guard, to the melody of ''[[The Sacred War]]'' being played by the Massed Bands, marches into the square and past the dignitaries with guard carrying both the [[Flag of Russia]] and the [[Victory Banner]]. As the colour guards approach the grandstand, the colour officers execute eyes left and resume above face after passing by. This is followed by the parade being commanded to stand at ease after the colours take their place at the northwest end of the square fronting the [[State Historical Museum]], besides the colour of the Armed Forces. Then the Minister of Defence (usually a billet of a General of the Army) is driven on the limousine to the center of the square nearest the tribune, the parade presenting arms again at this point. The parade commander informs him of the readiness of the parade to be inspected. The report is received, and to the tune of the Massed Bands the Minister and the parade commander are driven to inspect the parading contingents each together with the bands. As the limousines stop the Minister sends Victory Day greetings to each of the parading contingents, in which they respond with a threefold loud ''[[Oorah (Marines)|Oorah]]'' that is heard all over the grounds. After the final greeting, the Massed Bands strike up to ''[[Slavsya]]'' from [[A Life for the Tsar]] as the PC returns to his place, the Minister driven to the grandstand amidst louds shouts of ''Oorah'' by the parade contingents where he dismounts the limousine and the [[corps of drums|Corps of Drums]] of the [[Moscow Military Music College]], an affiliate of the Suvorov Military Schools, take their place behind the parade commander's car led by the Commandant of the College and the college colour guard. The parade is ordered to stand at ease after the Minister informs the President that the parade is formed up for the march past in review and its inspection officially completed. In the 1965, 1985 and 1990 parades, the limousines would inspect the personnel of the mobile column at the Manezhnaya Square formed into battalions, in remembrance of the mounted inspection of the original 1945 parade, which included cavalry, [[tachanka]]s and [[horse artillery]] in addition to the huge mobile column. Following the report of the Minister of Defence, the keynote holiday address to the nation of the President follows, preceded by a fanfare by the Massed Bands, usually Govovin's ''Moscow Fanfare''. A moment of silence, since 2014, features as part of the keynote address.\n\nAs the president finishes the address and a threefold ''Oorah'' resounds all over the square by the entire parade assembled and the honor guard presents arms, the Massed Bands play the [[National Anthem of Russia]] and a ceremonial battery armed with the [[76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3)]] fire a [[21-gun salute]]. As the anthem ends, the bands sound Retreat as the honor guard executes order arms and the parade commander orders the parade to commence the march past in the following manner:\n\n::''Parade... attention! Ceremonial march past!''<br>''Form battalions! Distance by a single lineman! First battalion will remain in the right, remainder... left.. turn!''<br>''Slope.. arms!''\n\nAs the command is given to start the linemen take their places and the field markers also as well at the south end of the square. As the PC ends the commands with ''Eyes to the right, forward, quick march!'' the Corps of Drums of the Moscow Military Music College, as is their tradition since 1938, march first to the tune of the  \"General Miloradovich\" by one of its late alumni, Lieutenant General [[Valery Khalilov]], one of the longest serving Senior Directors of Music of the Military Band Service and conductor of the Moscow area massed bands from 2002 to 2016, being played by the drummers and fifers. As the massed bands start playing the Corps of Drums stop playing by the signal of the Corps Drum Major and swings its drumsticks while on the eyes right. The Corps is followed by the colour guard of the 154th PICR and its 1st Honor Guard Company, during jubilee parades, the colour guard is followed by a company of colour bearers carrying the front standards in the order of their marchpast in the 1945 Victory Parade and their escorts, colours from the regiments, brigades and divisions which took part in the original 1945 parade and a historical unit of servicemen in period uniforms, optionally joined by the Kuban Cossacks, in memory of their contingent which marched past on that very parade, and the Escort Cavalry Squadron of the [[Kremlin Regiment]] plus a number of international contingents. This is followed by the rest of the parade ground column, starting with the youth contingents and by the Combined Arms Academy, among other troops.\n\nThe ground column ends, as the massed bands play either Victory Day or \"Let's Go\", with the traditional marchpast of the [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]], which has been done since the golden jubilee [[October Revolution Day]] parade of 1967 as a commemoration of the school's importance as the first military officer cadet school to be established in modern-day Russia, the first time it had been seen last in the Victory Day parade ground column was in 1985 (the two battalions of the school's Corps of Cadets also march past the square in memory of the cadets who fought in the 1941 [[Battle of Moscow]]). With the ground segment competed the bands stop playing at the signal of the senior director and the senior drum majors and, to give way to the mobile column, march towards the facade of the GUM department store, with two sections of the MMMC Corps of Drums at either side of the bands, reflecting the formations of the massed bands alongside the Corps of Drums in the Red Square parades of the 1950s and the 1960s.\n\nThe mobile column starts with the drivepast of historical vehicles in jubilee years. In non-special anniversary years only a T-34/85 medium battle tank carrying the Victory Banner leads the column of tens of military vehicles and equipment. As the Massed Bands play appropriate music the column drives past the stands in the Square, with the crew commanders and unit leaders executing a hand salute in the eyes right position (save for MRLs and mobile ICBMs). Following the end of the mobile column with the service flags of the three branches of the Armed Forces the flypast then follows, usually as the Bands play the ''Aviamarch'' and other air marches the flypast marks the formal termination of the parade with tens of aircraft from the Air Force flying past above the square in full view of everyone in attendance.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} \n\n===Full order of the parade===\nThe parade march past order, since the parade of 2010, is arranged in the following manner as it passes before the dignitaries:\n\n* Corps of Drums, Moscow Military Music College\n* [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]]\n* Youth contingents\n** Survorov and Nakhimov Military Schools\n** Cadet Corps colleges of the Armed Forces and other uniformed organizations\n** [[Young Army Cadets National Movement]] Moscow Area (led by the Chairman, includes female students of the Moscow National Pensions School Cadet Corps)\n* [[Russian Ground Forces]]\n* [[Russian Aerospace Forces]]\n* Russian Navy\n* Regiment of female cadets of Armed Forces academies (starting 2016 as a battalion, expanded to full regiment in 2017)\n* Strategic Missile Troops\n* Russian Airborne Troops\n* Military Police (beginning 2018)\n* NBC Troops\n* Russian Railway Troops\n* Border Service of the Federal Security Service\n* Ministry of Emergency Situations\n* [[Police of Russia]] (beginning 2019)\n* [[National Guard of Russia]] [[Separate Operational Purpose Division]] ([[National Guard Forces Command]])\n* Military forces of the Western Military District\n* [[Moscow Higher Military Command School]] ''Supreme Soviet of Russia''\n\n===Preparations===\n[[File:EUCOM Image (2).jpg|thumb|The American contingent at the general rehearsal parade in [[Alabino]] in 2010.]]\nEarly preparations for the parade begin in the last two months of the previous year. In these early stages, organizers at the MoD discuss the size of the parade, units/military equipment attending, extra details and on jubilee years, the invitation pf foreign troops. During this time, regular participants practice their drill routines from their home units at various locations. Full parade rehearsals begin in March at a training center in the village of [[Alabino]], which is located in the [[Moscow Oblast]]. In their working uniforms, parade participants do a full run through of the entire ceremony to the closest extent possible. In the last week of April, the rehesals are moved to Red Square, as they are conducted in the evening time. The [[flypast]] segment of the parade begin during these practice runs with all aircraft practicing from the Kubinka airfield. In some cases, the flypast is rehearsed solely without any mobile and ground columns. Typically, the final dress rehearsal takes place 2-3 days before the actual parade and is usually livestreamed on outlets such as [[Ruptly]].\n\n===Presiding officers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! width=\"90\" |Year\n! width=\"90\" |Parade commander \n! width=\"90\" |Parade inspector  \n|-\n|1945\n|Marshal [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]]\n|Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]]\n|-\n|1965\n|General of the Army [[Afanasy Beloborodov]]\n|Marshal [[Rodion Malinovsky]]\n|-\n|1985\n|General of the Army [[Pyotr Lushev]]\n|Marshal [[Sergey Sokolov (commander)|Sergey Sokolov]]\n|-\n|1990\n|Colonel General [[Nikolai Vasilyevich Kalinin]]\n|Marshal [[Dmitry Yazov]]\n|-\n|1995\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Govorov]]/Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Viktor Kulikov]]/General of the Army [[Pavel Grachev]]\n|-\n|1996\n|Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|General of the Army [[Pavel Grachev]]\n|-\n|1997\n|Lieutenant General Igor Puzanov\n|General of the Army [[Igor Rodionov]]\n|-\n|1998\n|Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|1999\n|Colonel General Igor Puzanov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|2000\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Govorov]]/Colonel General Leonid Kuznetsov\n|Marshal [[Igor Sergeyev]]\n|-\n|2001\n|Colonel General Nikolai Makarov\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2005\n|General of the Army Ivan Efremov\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2006\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Sergei Ivanov]]\n|-\n|2007\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2008\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2009\n|General of the Army [[Vladimir Bakin]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2010\n|Colonel General [[Valery Gerasimov]]\n|[[Anatoliy Serdyukov]]\n|-\n|2014\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2015\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2016\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2017\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2018\n|Colonel General [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2019\n|General of the Army [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|-\n|2020\n|General of the Army [[Oleg Salyukov]]\n|General of the Army [[Sergey Shoygu]]\n|}\n\n==Traditions and recent additions==\n[[File:20yearsvictory.jpg|thumb|A jubilee medal awarded for parade participants in 1965.]]\n2008 marked a return to tradition as well as the reorganization of the parade to fit the modern era. For the first time, a mobile column appeared at a Victory Day Parade in the Russian Federation appeared, a return to a tradition that was last seen in 1991, and abandoned in 1995. It was abandoned due to reconstruction of the [[Iberian Gate and Chapel]], which was originally destroyed to fill the very purpose of making way for tanks during the mobile column of the parade. That same year an [[airshow]] was introduced and it also became the first major Russian military parade to be seen on worldwide television when [[RT (TV network)|RT]] carried a live broadcast of the parade for the first time. In 2018, an [[exhibition drill]] performance by the 1st Honor Guard Company, [[154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment]] took part in the  segment of the parade together with a [[drumline]] from the [[Moscow Military Music College]] the first time since 2007 in a return to a tradition that began in the 2001 parade.
