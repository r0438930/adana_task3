Since then, the Elephant has been a famous part of the Carlsberg family, especially after the strong Elephant Beer was created in 1955 under the name Export Lager Beer featuring the Elephant label. The Elephant is still brewed in Carlsberg Breweries in Copenhagen and exported around the world.

In May 1951 two crates were delivered to Churchill's London home. In a thank-you letter Churchill called the drink \"Commemoration Lager\". In Denmark the drink was called {{lang|da|P\u00e5skebryg}}&nbsp;(\"Easter Brew\"), but the Easter Brew has since been replaced by a weaker beer ({{lang|da|Carls P\u00e5ske}}). For the British market Carlsberg called the drink Special Brew, and production was started in [[Northampton]] in the 1950s.\n\nAt 7.5% alcohol (previously 9%, then 8% for a short time), Special Brew is part of a group of strong lagers that are termed \"super-strength\" in the UK and [[malt liquor]] in the USA. This beer is often associated with street alcoholics.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/oct/03/drugsandalcohol.homelessness | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Matthew | last=Weaver | title=Call for ban on super-strength 'tramp juice' | date=3 October 2005}}</ref>\n\nA single can (440mL) of Special Brew contains 3.5 [[Unit of alcohol|units of alcohol]] (previously 4.5 units) whilst the maximum recommended daily intake for a man is two units.

The change, a reduction either in the size of the can from 500mL to 440mL, or the alcoholic strength of the beer, was considered for implementation in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-30795336 |title=The secret history of Special Brew |publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 January 2015}}</ref> Both changes were made; the cans have since been reduced to 440 mL, and the ABV reduced from 9% to 8%, then another drop to 7.5%.\n\n=== Elephant beer ===\n[[Image:Elefantporten (Carlsberg).jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Elephant Gate and Tower, Carlsberg|Elephant Gate]] in Copenhagen, Denmark]] \n[[Image:Carlsberg Elephant Beer.jpg|thumb|upright|50px|Elephant beer]]\nIn 1901, at brewer Carl Jacobsen's initiative, the Architect Professor J.
