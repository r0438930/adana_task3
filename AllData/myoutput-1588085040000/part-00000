Thus ''Boro'' became the proper designation for these people.<ref>{{harvcol|Hodgson|1847|p=105,142}} Strangers call them Mech but they call themselves as Bodo, which is of course proper designation.

In the [[Kokborok|Kokborok language]], ''Borok'' means man ('K' being a suffix for every noun), so logically ''Boro'' would mean ''man'' even in the [[Boro language (India)|Boro language]].<ref>{{Harvcol|Bhatt|2005|p=20}}</ref> Brahma opines that ''Boro'' might have originated from the Tibetan word ''Hbrog'' or ''Hbrogok'', meaning ''Man''. Generally, the word ''Boro'' means a ''man'', in the wider sense ''Boro'' means a ''human being'' (but not specific to a female member of the family) in the languages used by [[Bodo-Kachari]] peoples.<ref>{{harvcol|Brahma|2008|p=1}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Bodo language}}\nThe [[Bodo language|Boro language]] is a member of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language family.

The shijou tree (in the genus ''[[Euphorbia]]'') is taken as the symbol of Bathou and worshiped. It is also claimed as the supreme god. In the Boro language, Ba means five and thou means deep. Since Boros believe in the five mighty elements of [[God]] \u2013 land, water, air, fire, and ether \u2013 the number five has become significant in the Bathou religion.\n\nThe Shijou tree is encircled by eighteen pairs of ornamental bamboo sticks and five pairs of rings of bamboo. In front of Shijou, within the bamboo ring, there is a \"dove heart\".{{clarify|date=September 2019}}<ref name=\"HOME\">{{Cite web|url=http://udalguri.gov.in/bodo.htm|title=HOME|website=udalguri.gov.in|access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bathouism, before the creation of the universe there was simply a great void, in which the supreme being 'Aham Guru', Anan Binan Gosai or Obonglaoree existed formlessly. Aham Guru became tired of living a formless existence and desired to live in flesh and blood. He descended on this great void with all human characteristics and created the universe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Boro Kachari Sonskritir Kinchit Abhas |last=Basumatary |first=Dhuparam |publisher= |year=|isbn= |location=|pages=2\u20133}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Bathouism, Boro people also follow [[Hinduism]], especially [[havan|Hoom Jaygya]]. For this worship through fire ceremony, a clean surface near a home or courtyard is prepared. Usually, worship offerings include a [[betel nut]] called a 'goi' and a betel leaf called a 'pathwi' or 'bathwi' and rice, milk, and sugar. Another important Hindu festival, the Kherai Puja, where an altar is placed in a rice field, is the most important festival of the Boros. However, caste and dowry practices are not practiced by the majority of Boro Hindus, who follow a set of rules called [[Bodo Brahma Dharma|Brahma Dharma]].<ref name=\"HOME\"/>\n\nSome Boro people practice [[Christianity]], predominantly [[Baptists|Baptism]]. The major associations are the [[Boro Baptist Convention]] and [[Boro Baptist Church Association]]. Other denominations include the [[Church of North India]], [[Lutheranism]], the [[Believers' Church]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Pentecostalism]].

Thus ''Boro'' became the proper designation for these people.<ref>{{harvcol|Hodgson|1847|p=105,142}} Strangers call them Mech but they call themselves as Bodo, which is of course proper designation.

Their own name for the race is Boro or Bodo.\n</ref> Dalton observes that ''Boro'' means \"great people\" based on the Boro saying, \"Boro hari, geder hari\", meaning ''Boro people, great people''. In the [[Kokborok|Kokborok language]], ''Borok'' means man ('K' being a suffix for every noun), so logically ''Boro'' would mean ''man'' even in the [[Boro language (India)|Boro language]].<ref>{{Harvcol|Bhatt|2005|p=20}}</ref> Brahma opines that ''Boro'' might have originated from the Tibetan word ''Hbrog'' or ''Hbrogok'', meaning ''Man''. Generally, the word ''Boro'' means a ''man'', in the wider sense ''Boro'' means a ''human being'' (but not specific to a female member of the family) in the languages used by [[Bodo-Kachari]] peoples.<ref>{{harvcol|Brahma|2008|p=1}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{main|Bodo language}}\nThe [[Bodo language|Boro language]] is a member of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language family.

The shijou tree (in the genus ''[[Euphorbia]]'') is taken as the symbol of Bathou and worshiped. It is also claimed as the supreme god. In the Boro language, Ba means five and thou means deep. Since Boros believe in the five mighty elements of [[God]] \u2013 land, water, air, fire, and ether \u2013 the number five has become significant in the Bathou religion.\n\nThe Shijou tree is encircled by eighteen pairs of ornamental bamboo sticks and five pairs of rings of bamboo. In front of Shijou, within the bamboo ring, there is a \"dove heart\".{{clarify|date=September 2019}}<ref name=\"HOME\">{{Cite web|url=http://udalguri.gov.in/bodo.htm|title=HOME|website=udalguri.gov.in|access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Bathouism, before the creation of the universe there was simply a great void, in which the supreme being 'Aham Guru', Anan Binan Gosai or Obonglaoree existed formlessly. Aham Guru became tired of living a formless existence and desired to live in flesh and blood. He descended on this great void with all human characteristics and created the universe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Boro Kachari Sonskritir Kinchit Abhas |last=Basumatary |first=Dhuparam |publisher= |year=|isbn= |location=|pages=2\u20133}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Bathouism, Boro people also follow [[Hinduism]], especially [[havan|Hoom Jaygya]]. For this worship through fire ceremony, a clean surface near a home or courtyard is prepared. Usually, worship offerings include a [[betel nut]] called a 'goi' and a betel leaf called a 'pathwi' or 'bathwi' and rice, milk, and sugar. Another important Hindu festival, the Kherai Puja, where an altar is placed in a rice field, is the most important festival of the Boros. However, caste and dowry practices are not practiced by the majority of Boro Hindus, who follow a set of rules called [[Bodo Brahma Dharma|Brahma Dharma]].<ref name=\"HOME\"/>\n\nSome Boro people practice [[Christianity]], predominantly [[Baptists|Baptism]]. The major associations are the [[Boro Baptist Convention]] and [[Boro Baptist Church Association]]. Other denominations include the [[Church of North India]], [[Lutheranism]], the [[Believers' Church]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Pentecostalism]]. Most Boro Christians' practices are a mixture of tribal and Christian traditions.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Occupation==\nBoros are mostly settled farmers.<ref>{{harvcol|Hodgson|1847|p=155}}</ref>\n\n== Folk tradition and mythology ==\nThe history of the Boro people can be explained from folk traditions.
