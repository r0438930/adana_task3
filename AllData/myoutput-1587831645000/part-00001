Lockheart argues that while academic literacies and writing practices are well-established in older, traditional academic disciplines, more recent disciplines such as art and design have been forced to adopt these existing academic practices or to justify their own distinctive practices, and this has been a contentious issue in the discipline of art and design (which includes diverse fields, each with their diferences and their own requirements, such as fine arts, graphic design and fashion design).<ref name=\"Writing Purposefully in Art and Design\"/>\n\nIt is in this spirit that Lockheart teaches Contextual Practice, and primarily for this reason that she co-founded an academic network, Writing-PAD, to provide a platform for these new ideas and practices (see below).<ref

\"to promote discussion about the necessary balance of consensus and dissensus that art and design fields require to remain vibrant.\"<ref name=\"Writing Purposefully in Art and

Lockheart argues that while academic literacies and writing practices are well-established in older, traditional academic disciplines, more recent disciplines such as art and design have been forced to adopt these existing academic practices or to justify their own distinctive practices, and this has been a contentious issue in the discipline of art and design (which includes diverse fields, each with their diferences and their own requirements, such as fine arts, graphic design and fashion design).<ref name=\"Writing Purposefully in Art and Design\"/>\n\nIt is in this spirit that Lockheart teaches Contextual Practice, and primarily for this reason that she co-founded an academic network, Writing-PAD, to provide a platform for these new ideas and practices (see below).<ref
