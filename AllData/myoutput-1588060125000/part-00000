Since 1948 it has been funded out of general taxation. It is made up of four separate systems that serve each part of the UK: The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in England, [[NHS Scotland]], [[NHS Wales]], and [[Health and Social Care (Northern Ireland)|Health and Social Care]] in Northern Ireland. They were established together in 1948 as one of the major social reforms following the [[World War II|Second World War]].  The founding principles were that services should be comprehensive, universal and free at the point of delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhscoreprinciples.aspx|title=The principles and values of the NHS in England |last= Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref> Each service provides a comprehensive range of [[health services]], free at the point of use for people ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, apart from dental treatment and optical care.<ref name=entitle>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-entitlements-migrant-health-guide |title=NHS entitlements: migrant health guide \u2013 Detailed guidance|website=UK Government|date=  |author= |accessdate= 6 June 2016}}</ref>  In England, NHS patients have to pay [[prescription charges]] with a range of exemptions from these charges.\n\nEach of the UK's health service systems operates independently, and is politically accountable to the relevant government: the [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]], [[Northern Ireland Executive]], and the [[UK Government]], responsible for England's NHS.

Some functions may be routinely performed by one health service on behalf of another. For example, Northern Ireland has no high-security [[psychiatric hospital]]s and depends on hospitals in Great Britain, routinely at [[State Hospital|Carstairs hospital]] in Scotland for male patients and [[Rampton Secure Hospital]] in England for female patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/guidance-transfer-mentally-disordered-patients-august-2011|title=Guidance on the Transfer of Mentally Disordered Patients August 2011|publisher=}}</ref> Similarly, patients in North Wales use specialist facilities in Manchester and Liverpool which are much closer than facilities in Cardiff, and more routine services at the [[Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Foundation Trust|Countess of Chester Hospital]].

newsreel.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyjbUK88CB4 White Paper \u2013 A National Health Service], YouTube</ref> \n\nWhen [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] he appointed [[Aneurin Bevan]] as [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Minister]]. Bevan then embarked upon what the official historian of the NHS, Charles Webster, called an \"audacious campaign\" to take charge of the form the NHS finally took.<ref>Charles Webster, The Health Services since the War, Volume 1: Problems of Health Care, The National Health Service Before 1957 (London: HMSO, 1988), p. 399.</ref> Bevan's National Health Service was proposed in Westminster legislation for [[National Health Service Act 1946|England and Wales]] from 1946 and [[National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947|Scotland]] from 1947, and the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland Parliament]]'s Public Health Services Act 1947.<ref>Ruth Barrington, ''Health, Medicine & Politics in Ireland 1900\u20131970'' (Institute of Public Administration: Dublin, 1987) pp. 188\u201389.</ref> [[NHS Wales]] was split from [[NHS (England)]] in 1969 when control was passed to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] before transferring to the [[Welsh Assembly Government|Welsh Executive]] and [[Welsh Assembly|Assembly]] under devolution in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/nhswalesaboutus/historycontext/1960s|title=NHS Wales {{!}} 1960's|last=Wales|first=NHS|website=www.wales.nhs.uk|access-date=2016-11-22|date=23 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS was born out of the ideal that good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth. Although being freely accessible regardless of wealth maintained Henry Willink's  principle of free healthcare for all, Conservative MPs were in favour of maintaining local administration of the NHS through existing arrangements with local authorities fearing that an NHS which owned hospitals on a national scale would lose the personal relationship between doctor and patient.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1946/apr/30/national-health-service-bill|publisher= Hansard|date= 30 April 1946 |title=NHS Bill Second Reading}}</ref>\n\nConservative MPs voted in favour of their amendment to Bevan's Bill to maintain local control and ownership of hospitals and against Bevan's plan for national ownership of all hospitals. The Labour government defeated Conservative amendments and went ahead with the NHS as it remains today;  a single large national organisation (with devolved equivalents) which forced the transfer of ownership of hospitals from local authorities and charities to the new NHS. Bevan's principle of ownership with no private sector involvement has since been diluted, with later Labour governments implementing large scale financing arrangements with private builders in [[private finance initiative]]s and joint ventures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/field_publication_file/perspectives-estates-nhs-property-nigel-edwards-jul13.pdf_|title=Kingsfund, July 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt its launch by Bevan on 5 July 1948 it had at its heart three core principles: That it meet the needs of everyone, that it be free at the point of delivery, and that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/aboutnhs/Pages/NHSCorePrinciples.aspx |title=The NHS in England \u2013 About the NHS \u2013 NHS core principles |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=23 March 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree years after the founding of the NHS, Bevan resigned from the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in opposition to the introduction of charges for the provision of dentures and glasses.<ref>Kenneth O.

The plan also includes a guarantee that investment in primary, community and mental health care will grow faster than the growing overall NHS budget so that different parts of the NHS come together to provide better, joined-up care in partnership with local government.

These systems do not communicate well with each other so there is a risk doctors treating a patient will not know everything they need to know to treat the patient effectively.  There were 11 million patient interactions out of 121 million where information from a previous visit could not be accessed.  Half the Trusts using Electronic Medical Records used one of three systems and at least those three should be able to share information.  A tenth of Trusts used multiple systems in the same hospital.  Dr Leigh Warren who participated in the research said, \"Hospitals and GPs often don't have the right information about the right patient in the right place at the right time.  This can lead to errors and accidents that can threaten patients' lives.\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50675361 NHS e-health systems 'risk patient safety'] 7 December 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Sale of data===\nInformation on millions of NHS patients was sold to international pharmaceutical companies, in the US and other nations for research, adding to concerns over USA ambitions to access remunerative parts of the NHS after Brexit.

Phil Booth of medConfidential[https://medconfidential.org/], campaigning for privacy of health data said, \u201cPatients should know how their data is used. There should be no surprises. While legitimate research for public health benefit is to be encouraged, it must always be consensual, safe and properly transparent.

Drugs to treat cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, mental health conditions, some eye conditions, antibiotics for tuberculosis and drugs to control epilepsy are among those in short supply.  Life saving drugs will have to be rationed and not all patients who need them will get them.  Some patients can be switched onto other drugs, though this may increase the workload of hard-pressed medical staff; other patients cannot be switched to alternative drugs.  Many problems can impact the supply chain, like IT failure, speculators stockpiling drugs, alterations in regulation and sudden disease outbreaks.  Dr Tony O\u2019Sullivan of [[Keep Our NHS Public]] said, \u201cThe Health Department\u2019s guidance includes an unprecedented list of drugs unavailable or in short supply. Patients and clinicians alike should be on high alert when the advice includes how to \u2018share stocks\u2019 to make them last, to \u2018prioritise\u2019 patients already on specific treatments including cancer rather than a new patient and effectively how to ration so many vital drugs. Drug companies\u2019 behaviour must be controlled. We must urgently protect the NHS from further risks of loss of control of drug prices and supplies from trade deals with the US and that requires returning it to a wholly public service.\u201d<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/18/revealed-nhs-running-short-of-dozens-of-lifesaving-medicines Revealed: NHS running short of dozens of lifesaving medicines] 18 November 2019 ''[[The Guardian]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50465563 Britain's 'unprecedented' drug shortage] 19 November 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Role in combating coronavirus pandemic===\n\nIn 2020, the NHS issued medical advice in combating COVID-19 and partnered with tech companies to create computer dashboards to help combat the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|nation's coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>[https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/ Advice for everyone-Coronavirus (COVID-19)] www.nhs.uk, accessed 12 April 2020</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52079287|title=Coronavirus: NHS turns to big tech to tackle Covid-19 hot spots|first=Leo|last=Kellon|publisher=BBC News|date=28 March 2020|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> During the pandemic, the NHS also established integrated COVID into its 1-1-1 service line as well.<ref>[https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/ Check if you have coronavirus symptoms] 111.nhs.uk, accessed 12 April 2020</ref> Following his [[St. Thomas' Hospital#Response to COVID-19|discharge]] from the [[St. Thomas' Hospital]] in London on 13 April 2020 after being diagnosed with [[COVID-19]], British Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] described NHS medical care as \"astonishing\" and that \"NHS saved my life.

Since 1948 it has been funded out of general taxation. It is made up of four separate systems that serve each part of the UK: The [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] in England, [[NHS Scotland]], [[NHS Wales]], and [[Health and Social Care (Northern Ireland)|Health and Social Care]] in Northern Ireland. They were established together in 1948 as one of the major social reforms following the [[World War II|Second World War]].  The founding principles were that services should be comprehensive, universal and free at the point of delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/thenhs/about/Pages/nhscoreprinciples.aspx|title=The principles and values of the NHS in England |last= Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|access-date=2016-11-23}}</ref> Each service provides a comprehensive range of [[health services]], free at the point of use for people ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, apart from dental treatment and optical care.<ref name=entitle>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/nhs-entitlements-migrant-health-guide |title=NHS entitlements: migrant health guide \u2013 Detailed guidance|website=UK Government|date=  |author= |accessdate= 6 June 2016}}</ref>  In England, NHS patients have to pay [[prescription charges]] with a range of exemptions from these charges.\n\nEach of the UK's health service systems operates independently, and is politically accountable to the relevant government: the [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]], [[Northern Ireland Executive]], and the [[UK Government]], responsible for England's NHS.

advanced this notion of a National Health Service in 1944 with his consultative White Paper \"A National Health Service\" which was circulated in full and short versions to colleagues, as well as in newsreel.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyjbUK88CB4 White Paper \u2013 A National Health Service], YouTube</ref> \n\nWhen [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] won the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 election]] he appointed [[Aneurin Bevan]] as [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Minister]]. Bevan then embarked upon what the official historian of the NHS, Charles Webster, called an \"audacious campaign\" to take charge of the form the NHS finally took.<ref>Charles Webster, The Health Services since the War, Volume 1: Problems of Health Care, The National Health Service Before 1957 (London: HMSO, 1988), p. 399.</ref> Bevan's National Health Service was proposed in Westminster legislation for [[National Health Service Act 1946|England and Wales]] from 1946 and [[National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1947|Scotland]] from 1947, and the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland Parliament]]'s Public Health Services Act 1947.<ref>Ruth Barrington, ''Health, Medicine & Politics in Ireland 1900\u20131970'' (Institute of Public Administration: Dublin, 1987) pp. 188\u201389.</ref> [[NHS Wales]] was split from [[NHS (England)]] in 1969 when control was passed to the [[Secretary of State for Wales]] before transferring to the [[Welsh Assembly Government|Welsh Executive]] and [[Welsh Assembly|Assembly]] under devolution in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wales.nhs.uk/nhswalesaboutus/historycontext/1960s|title=NHS Wales {{!}} 1960's|last=Wales|first=NHS|website=www.wales.nhs.uk|access-date=2016-11-22|date=23 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe NHS was born out of the ideal that good healthcare should be available to all, regardless of wealth. Although being freely accessible regardless of wealth maintained Henry Willink's  principle of free healthcare for all, Conservative MPs were in favour of maintaining local administration of the NHS through existing arrangements with local authorities fearing that an NHS which owned hospitals on a national scale would lose the personal relationship between doctor and patient.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1946/apr/30/national-health-service-bill|publisher= Hansard|date= 30 April 1946 |title=NHS Bill Second Reading}}</ref>\n\nConservative MPs voted in favour of their amendment to Bevan's Bill to maintain local control and ownership of hospitals and against Bevan's plan for national ownership of all hospitals. The Labour government defeated Conservative amendments and went ahead with the NHS as it remains today;  a single large national organisation (with devolved equivalents) which forced the transfer of ownership of hospitals from local authorities and charities to the new NHS. Bevan's principle of ownership with no private sector involvement has since been diluted, with later Labour governments implementing large scale financing arrangements with private builders in [[private finance initiative]]s and joint ventures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/field/field_publication_file/perspectives-estates-nhs-property-nigel-edwards-jul13.pdf_|title=Kingsfund, July 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt its launch by Bevan on 5 July 1948 it had at its heart three core principles: That it meet the needs of everyone, that it be free at the point of delivery, and that it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/aboutnhs/Pages/NHSCorePrinciples.aspx |title=The NHS in England \u2013 About the NHS \u2013 NHS core principles |publisher=Nhs.uk |date=23 March 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree years after the founding of the NHS, Bevan resigned from the [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] in opposition to the introduction of charges for the provision of dentures and glasses.<ref>Kenneth O.

The [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]] found some must wait up to thirteen months for the right care.  Wendy Burn of the  Royal College of Psychiatrists said, \u201cIt is a scandal that patients are waiting so long for treatment.  The failure to give people with mental illnesses the prompt help they need is ruining their lives.\u201d Even patients who are suicidal or who have attempted suicide are sometimes denied treatment; patients are told they are not ill enough or waiting lists are too long. During very long waits for treatment, one in three patients deteriorate, and they may become unemployed or get divorced. One in four patients throughout the UK wait over three months to see an NHS mental health professional, with 6% waiting at least a year.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/09/mental-health-patients-waiting-nhs-treatment-delays Delays in NHS mental health treatment 'ruining lives'] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\nThe [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] found mental health provisions for children and young people will not meet growing demand, despite promises of increased funding.

But the government doesn\u2019t understand how many children and young people are in need of treatment or how funding is being spent locally. The government urgently needs to set out how departments, and national and local bodies, are going to work together to achieve its long-term ambition.\u201d  [[Amyas Morse]] said, \u201cCurrent targets to improve care are modest and even if met would still mean two-thirds of those who need help are not seen.

These systems do not communicate well with each other so there is a risk doctors treating a patient will not know everything they need to know to treat the patient effectively.  There were 11 million patient interactions out of 121 million where information from a previous visit could not be accessed.  Half the Trusts using Electronic Medical Records used one of three systems and at least those three should be able to share information.  A tenth of Trusts used multiple systems in the same hospital.  Dr Leigh Warren who participated in the research said, \"Hospitals and GPs often don't have the right information about the right patient in the right place at the right time.  This can lead to errors and accidents that can threaten patients' lives.\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50675361 NHS e-health systems 'risk patient safety'] 7 December 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Sale of data===\nInformation on millions of NHS patients was sold to international pharmaceutical companies, in the US and other nations for research, adding to concerns over USA ambitions to access remunerative parts of the NHS after Brexit.  There is concern over lack of transparency and clarity over the data and how it is used.  Phil Booth of medConfidential[https://medconfidential.org/], campaigning for privacy of health data said, \u201cPatients should know how their data is used. There should be no surprises. While legitimate research for public health benefit is to be encouraged, it must always be consensual, safe and properly transparent.   Do patients know \u2013 have they even been told by the one in seven GP practices across England that pass on their clinical details \u2013 that their medical histories are being sold to multinational pharma companies in the US and around the world?\u201d<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/07/nhs-medical-data-sales-american-pharma-lack-transparency Patient data from GP surgeries sold to US companies] 7 December 2019 ''[[The Observer]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Medicines===\nIn November 2019 unprecedented shortages of medicines patients need developed.  Drugs to treat cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, mental health conditions, some eye conditions, antibiotics for tuberculosis and drugs to control epilepsy are among those in short supply.  Life saving drugs will have to be rationed and not all patients who need them will get them.  Some patients can be switched onto other drugs, though this may increase the workload of hard-pressed medical staff; other patients cannot be switched to alternative drugs.  Many problems can impact the supply chain, like IT failure, speculators stockpiling drugs, alterations in regulation and sudden disease outbreaks.  Dr Tony O\u2019Sullivan of [[Keep Our NHS Public]] said, \u201cThe Health Department\u2019s guidance includes an unprecedented list of drugs unavailable or in short supply. Patients and clinicians alike should be on high alert when the advice includes how to \u2018share stocks\u2019 to make them last, to \u2018prioritise\u2019 patients already on specific treatments including cancer rather than a new patient and effectively how to ration so many vital drugs. Drug companies\u2019 behaviour must be controlled. We must urgently protect the NHS from further risks of loss of control of drug prices and supplies from trade deals with the US and that requires returning it to a wholly public service.\u201d<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/18/revealed-nhs-running-short-of-dozens-of-lifesaving-medicines Revealed: NHS running short of dozens of lifesaving medicines] 18 November 2019 ''[[The Guardian]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50465563 Britain's 'unprecedented' drug shortage] 19 November 2019 ''[[BBC]]'', accessed 14 March 2020</ref>\n\n===Role in combating coronavirus pandemic===\n\nIn 2020, the NHS issued medical advice in combating COVID-19 and partnered with tech companies to create computer dashboards to help combat the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|nation's coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>[https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/ Advice for everyone-Coronavirus (COVID-19)] www.nhs.uk, accessed 12 April 2020</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52079287|title=Coronavirus: NHS turns to big tech to tackle Covid-19 hot spots|first=Leo|last=Kellon|publisher=BBC News|date=28 March 2020|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> During the pandemic, the NHS also established integrated COVID into its 1-1-1 service line as well.<ref>[https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19/ Check if you have coronavirus symptoms] 111.nhs.uk, accessed 12 April 2020</ref> Following his [[St. Thomas' Hospital#Response to COVID-19|discharge]] from the [[St. Thomas' Hospital]] in London on 13 April 2020 after being diagnosed with [[COVID-19]], British Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] described NHS medical care as \"astonishing\" and that \"NHS saved my life.
