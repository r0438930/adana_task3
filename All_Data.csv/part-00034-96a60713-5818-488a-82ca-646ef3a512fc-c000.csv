The winners were [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and the runners-up were [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]].

The competition began on 15 October 1991 and ended with the final on 16 May 1992 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

In the first round, there were two sections split into eight groups: North and South.

[[Category:1991–92 Football League Third Division|Tro]]","The '''1991–92 Associate Members' Cup''', known as the '''1991–92 Autoglass Trophy''', was the ninth staging of the [[Associate Members' Cup]], a knock-out competition for [[English football]] clubs in the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. The winners were [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] and the runners-up were [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]].

The competition began on 15 October 1991 and ended with the final on 16 May 1992 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

In the first round, there were two sections split into eight groups: North and South. In the following rounds each section gradually eliminates teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists faced each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

Restoring to previous version,safe,Sir Trenzalore,"[[Human swimming]] typically consists of repeating a specific body motion or '''swimming stroke '''to propel that body forward.  There are many kinds of strokes, each defining a different '''swimming style''' or '''crawl'''.

In high school, collegiate, and Olympic swimming, there are two [[undulating]] strokes (breaststroke, and butterfly stroke,) and two alternating strokes (front crawl and backstroke).

Most strokes involve rhythmic and coordinated movements of all major body parts — torso, arms, legs, hands, feet, and head.  Breathing typically must be synchronized with the strokes, too.  It is possible, however, to swim by moving only legs without arms or only arms without legs; such strokes may be used for special purposes, for training or exercise, or by [[amputation|amputees]] (paralympians) and [[paralysis|paralytics]].

==Swimming styles==

* [[Front crawl]]: the fastest style for swimming on the surface. Done while face down. The arms alternate while the legs perform a flutter kick.
** Dolphin crawl: Similar to front crawl, but with a [[dolphin kick]]. One kick per arm or two kicks per cycle. This style is often used in training.
** Catch up stroke: A variation of the front crawl where one arm always rests at the front while the other arm performs one cycle. This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.
** Head-high crawl (also known as the water polo stroke, lifeguard approach stroke, or Tarzan drill):  This stroke is used for [[water polo]], lifeguards to keep the victim in sight, or those who simply want to see where they're going and breathe with ease. It is similar to front crawl, but with head above the water.  This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.
* [[Trudgen]]: The trudgen is similar to the front crawl, except that it is paired with a [[Sidestroke|scissors kick]], similar to that used in the sidestroke.
** Trudgen crawl: Similar to the trudgen, but with the use of a flutter kick (up and down leg kick) between the scissor kicks.
** Double trudgen: Similar to the trudgen, but the sides of the scissors kick alternate.
** Double trudgen crawl: Similar to the double trudgen, but with a flutter kick between the scissors kick alternate.
* [[Butterfly stroke]]: performed face down in the water. The legs perform a dolphin kick and while the arms move in a forward circle at the same time.
** Slow butterfly (also known as \"moth stroke\"): Similar to butterfly, but with an extended gliding phase, Breathing during the pull/push phase, return head into the water during recovery. This style uses two kicks per cycle.
* [[Breaststroke]]: performed face down in the water without rotating the torso. The arms stay in the water and move synchronously, while the legs perform a whip kick. It is possible to keep the head elevated out of the water throughout the stroke, although the head usually dips in and out.
** Inverted breaststroke: Similar to elementary backstroke, but with a breaststroke kick and arm motions.
* [[Backstroke]]: Done while lying on the back.  One arm reaches behind the head with a fingertip entry while the other arm is by the side.  The legs perform a flutter kick.
** Elementary backstroke: Both arms move synchronized (They begin out like an airplane, then go beside the body like a soldier then they run up the sides and back out to an airplane position) with whip kick (breaststroke kick).
** Inverted butterfly: Similar to elementary backstroke, but with a dolphin kick. This is often used for training.
** Back double trudgen: Similar to the backstroke, but with a scissors kick to alternating sides.
**Old English Backstroke : Lying on back, breaststroke legs and butterfly arms
* [[Backstroke|Forward backstroke]]: Done  lying on back and floating. Arms parallel to the surface, moving in the opposite direction  to backstroke. 
* [[Sidestroke]]: On the side, pull the water as if with a rope with arms going out and stopping in the middle while ensuring that the strokes are most hydrodynamic when moving towards the desired location, and pushing the most water when moving away from the location. In addition, the legs are performing a scissors kick, which is like breaststroke kick, but sideways.
** Lifesaving stroke: Similar to the [[sidestroke|side stroke]], but only the bottom arm moves while the top arm tows a swimmer in distress.
** [[Combat sidestroke]]: This stroke was developed and used by the [[United States Navy SEALs]] and is designed to be more efficient and reduce profile in the water.
* [[Combat sidestroke|Composite stroke]] is drill stroke within one basic stroke, ''ins'' (for example, Front crawl flutter/scissor Dolphin/Dolphin flutter) or between two basic stroke, ''weens'' (Over arm 1 Arm Lead Sidestroke to 2 Arms Lead Dolphin). It is great strength and effort training technique.
* [[Dog paddle]]: face over water and paddling with alternate hands, often with the nose and mouth above the water. This stroke can be used in reverse to propel the body feet first.
** Human stroke: Similar to the dog paddle, but the arms reach out more and pull farther down.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* Survival travel stroke: Alternating underwater arm stroke, one cycle for propulsion, one for a lift to stay on the surface. This style is slow but sustainable.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* Breast feet first strokes: With legs extended, use the arms with a pushing, flapping, clapping or uplifting motion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* [[Snorkeling]]: Swimming on the breast using a snorkel, usually in combination with masks and fins. Any stroke on the breast can be used, and there is no need to lift or turn the head for breathing.
* [[Finswimming]] is the progression of a swimmer using fins either on the water surface or underwater. Finswimming is usually done on the breast.
* An arm and a leg: is the progression of a swimmer clasping one leg with the opposite arm, and using breaststroke movements with the remaining arm and leg.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
* Flutter back finning: Symmetrically underwater arm recovery with flutter kick.
* Flicker kick: Concerning human morphology oscillatory [[flutter kick]] is more suitable, hence all swimming techniques exert vertical oscillation with upward propelling. Flicker kick, as vibration of both, hands and legs, with slight deviation of arms within regular undulation will produce powerful horizontal dynamics. Swimmer by propelling is not just vibrating, this is proved to be insufficient, but rather producing undulating waves (horizontal instead of vertical). The initial move is made by shoulders gliding backward and curve. Meandering is transmitted to the hips and legs. Undulation is most pronounced between the shoulders and thighs. At the end of swimming cycle, legs produce flicker kick as collateral to undulatory movement. See also eel stroke. 
* Feet first swimming: A very slow stroke on the back where a breaststroke movement with the arms propels the body forward feet first. Also the arms can be lifted out of the water and pulled backwards together with a scooping movement. Alternatively, the arms can be raised behind the head, alternately or together pushing with the hands, propelling the body. Similarly, the hands can be brought together in a clapping action. These strokes are often used for training.
* Eel style: start position of swimmer is backward, hands to body and legs close floating. Swimmer then starts to undulate first with hand and shoulders then trespassing undulation on legs. The propulsion force is mainly generated by hands, which stay all the time close to body. Swimmer tries to relay on gliding flow of water moving easily and swiftly. Legs do not perform flutter stroke as it will create force opposite to undulation. Efficiency is achieved by undulating along the whole body, intermittently and at intervals.  Once the body is introduced in undulation, it will soon achieved optimal velocity. The purpose of transfer from preparation to propulsion phase is to generate gliding flow, which swimmer will use as an additional lift in moving forward and up. Swimmers in nature use body undulations to generate these propulsive and maneuvering forces. The anguilliform kinematics is driven by muscular actions all along the body<ref name=\"naturalmodes\">https://www.academia.edu/33629374/Natural_modes_of_swimming_new_swimming_styles_how_to_swim_with_efficient_buoyant_velocity</ref>{{dubious|date=November 2017}}
* Corkscrew swimming: Alternating between front crawl and backstroke every arm. This leads to a constant rotation of the swimmer. The stroke is used mainly for training purposes and is also sometimes known as Newfie Stroke, referring to [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. When rotating every third stroke, this is called ''waltz crawl''.
* Gliding: The swimmer is stretched with the arms to the front, the head between the arms and the feet to the back. This streamlined shape minimizes resistance and allows the swimmer to glide, for example after a [[Dive start|start]], a push off from a wall, or to rest between strokes.
* [[Cuttlefish|Sepia bone]]: Sepia bone could be effective as drifting technique, in steering and floating in the fast flow, using only hand to navigate the stream, complementary as passive to more proactive swimming techniques.<ref name=\"naturalmodes\"/>
* Turtle stroke: On the breast, extend right arm then pull, after pushing with the left leg (while opposite limbs are recovering), then opposite limbs repeat this process, i. e. left arm pulls after right leg pushes. Uses muscles of the waist. Head can easily be above or below water: this is a slow but very sustainable stroke, common in [[turtle]]s and [[newt]]s.
* Octopus stroke: The swimmer starts from floating posture backward spreading arms and feet in spread position, arms raised further up to the maximum momentum, keeping them parallel to the surface, in the propulsive phase returning the same way, hands to the body and legs merging. Legs opening to the 45 degree returning then returning and closing, arms smoothly from 90, 120 degrees of leg axis, then cling to the legs. More economical means of motion involves alternative movements of leg and arms, first arms then legs (Dalton, 1918). Effective swimming, however, implies their parallel movement.<ref>Dalton, F. E. (1918). Swimming scientifically taught, Funk and Wagnalls Company, New York and London</ref><ref name=\"naturalmodes\"/>

==Special purpose styles==
A number of strokes are only used for special purposes, e.g. to manipulate an object (a swimmer in distress, a ball), or just to stay afloat.

===Underwater swimming===
Swimming underwater is faster than swimming on the surface.  Underwater swimming is not its own category in the Olympics, but in the [[Swimming at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre backstroke|1988 Olympics]] several competitors swam much of the backstroke race underwater.  After that, the Olympics created a rule that swimmers are only allowed to stay underwater for the first 10 meters (later changed to 15 meters) after a start or a turn.<ref>https://swimswam.com/david-berkoff-daichi-suzukis-underwater-duel-88/</ref>

Any style with underwater recovery can be done underwater for certain distances depending on the need for air. Underwater swimming on the back has the additional problem of water entering the nose. To avoid this, the swimmer can breathe out through the nose or wear a nose clip. Some swimmers can close their nostrils with the upper lip or with the [[compressor naris]] muscles.
* [[Dolphin kick]]: this is the style that is usually used at the beginning of the race, to hold on to the speed the swimmer generate by pushing off the walls at the start and the turns.<ref>https://www.yourswimlog.com/develop-awesome-underwater-dolphin-kick/</ref>  The feet kick while the arms keep still while extended in front of the head, with the hands together.
* [[Fish kick]]: Similar to the dolphin kick, but performed while on the swimmer's side. This may be the fastest form of swimming.  Swimming creates vortices which propel the swimmer forward.  In the dolphin kick, the vortices go up and down, where they're disturbed when they hit the surface of the water or the bottom of the pool.  But with the fish kick, they go sideways, where there are no obstructions.<ref>http://nautil.us/issue/25/water/is-this-new-swim-stroke-the-fastest-yet</ref>
* Pull-down Breaststroke: most common swim stroke underwater as it requests very low energy. Main application is for [[dynamic apnea]] (DNF)
* Sea lion stroke: this swimming stroke is primarily performed with [[sculling]], arms at the side along the bodyline and strongly supported with [[flutter kick]]s in a contralateral sequencing. It can be identified to the [[sea lion]] swimming style.<ref>{{Google books |id=2rkHQpToi9sC |page=1142 |title=Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals }}</ref> It's very effective to swim through narrow underwater places.

=== Undulatory swimming ===
Swimming hydrodynamics have significantly applied BCF (body-caudal fin swimming)  to techniques. In addition research on undulatory motion, undulatory [[Body-caudal fin locomotion|Body-caudal fin]] [[anguilliform]], and undulatory [[Fish locomotion|Median-paired fin]] give interesting conclusions. These natural modes are seen as an alternative to BCF techniques introducing some missing elements as [[buoyancy]], [[gliding]] and floating to complement the scale of man’s hydrodynamics.<ref>31.	Lindsey, C. C. (1978) Form, function and locomotory habits in fish, in Fish Physiology VII Locomotion, W. S. Hoar and D. J. Randall, Eds. New York: Academic, 1–100</ref>

The study draws a conclusion from hydrodynamic properties of cephalopods as implied to human kinetics, discerning significant patterns, like floating, puddle, undulation or efficiency. In biomechanical aspect medusoid and anguilliform shows positive results: low [[Reynolds number]], low [[viscous forces]], stability, great laminar flow, [[linear momentum]] and efficient velocity.

===Lifesaving strokes===
* Lifesaving stroke: Similar to the [[sidestroke|side stroke]], but only the bottom arm moves while the top arm tows a swimmer in distress.
* Lifesaving approach stroke (also known as ''head-up front crawl'' or ''[[Tarzan]] stroke''): Similar to the [[front crawl]], but with the eyes to the front above the water level, such as to observe the surroundings as for example a swimmer in distress or a ball.
* Pushing rescue stroke: This stroke helps to assist a tired swimmer: The tired swimmer lies on the back and the rescuer swims a breaststroke kick and pushes against the soles of the tired swimmer  (not taught or recognized by the RLSS body governing UK lifeguarding).
* Pulling rescue stroke: This stroke helps to assist a swimmer in distress. Both swimmers lie on the back, and the rescuer grabs the armpits of the swimmer in distress and performs a breaststroke kick (on the back) for forwarding motion. The kick has to be not too shallow as otherwise the victim will be hit.
* Extended Arm Tow (unconscious victim):  swimming sidestroke or breaststroke on their back, the rescuer holds the head with a straight arm, the hand cupping underneath the chin, and ensures that the mouth and nose are out of the water.
* Arm Tow: the rescuer swims sidestroke, behind the casualty holds the upper right arm of a casualty with their left hand or vice versa, lifting the casualty out of the water.
* Vice Grip Turn and Trawl: used on a victim with a suspected spinal injury. The lifeguard approaches slowly to the victim (who is usually face down in water), places one hand on the victim's chin, with arm pressed firmly against the victim's chest. The other hand is placed on the back of the victim's head with the arm down the victim's back. Both arms press together (like a vice), and the lifeguard uses his feet to begin moving forward and then rolls under the victim to come up alongside her or him, but with the victim now on his or her back. (This is one of the hardest lifesaving maneuvers, as the grip must be perfect on the first attempt; otherwise, the victim may be given further spinal damage, such as paralysis.)
* Clothes swimming: The swimmer is wearing clothes that restrict movement when wet, i.e. almost all clothes. This is done to practice situations where the swimmer fell in the water dressed or the rescuer did not have time to undress. Due to the restricted movement and the weight of wet clothes out of the water, an overarm recovery is not possible. Most swimmers swim breaststroke, but any stroke with underwater recovery is feasible.
* Rescue tube swimming: The lifeguard pulls a flotation device, which is pushed forward when approaching the victim.

===Without forward motion===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Water polo]] -->
* Survival floating (also known as ''dead man float'' and [[drownproofing]]): Lying on the prone (face down in water) with minimal leg movement, and staying afloat with the natural buoyancy. Lift the head to breathe only then back to floating. This style is only to stay afloat and to rest.
* Back floating: Similar to the survival floating, except on the back.
* [[Treading water]]: The swimmer is in the water head up and feet down. Different kicks, such as the [[eggbeater kick]], and hand movements are used to stay afloat. This is useful to keep the head out of the water for a better view or to catch an object as for example in water polo.
* Sculling: This is a figure 8 movement of the hands for forward motion or upward lift. Used in [[surf lifesaving]], [[water polo]], [[synchronised swimming|synchronized swimming]] and treading water.
* Turtle float: The knees are raised to the chest and encircled by the arms.<ref name=\"scouts\">https://web.archive.org/web/20110613082530/http://www.usscouts.org/macscouter/CubScouts/PowWow99/Web99.pdf</ref>
* Jellyfish float: Holding the ankles with the hands.<ref name=\"scouts\" />
* Head first surface dive

{{Swimming styles}}

[[Category:Swimming styles| ]]","[[Human swimming]] typically consists of repeating a specific body motion or '''swimming stroke '''to propel that body forward.  There are many kinds of strokes, each defining a different '''swimming style''' or '''crawl'''.

In high school, collegiate, and Olympic swimming, there are two [[undulating]] strokes (breaststroke, and butterfly stroke,) and two alternating strokes (front crawl and backstroke).

Most strokes involve rhythmic and coordinated movements of all major body parts — torso, arms, legs, hands, feet, and head.  Breathing typically must be synchronized with the strokes, too.  It is possible, however, to swim by moving only legs without arms or only arms without legs; such strokes may be used for special purposes, for training or exercise, or by [[amputation|amputees]] (paralympians) and [[paralysis|paralytics]].

==Swimming styles==
n
* [[Front crawl]]: the fastest style for swimming on the surface. Done while face down. The arms alternate while the legs perform an up and down motion
** Dolphin crawl: Similar to front crawl, but with a [[dolphin kick]]. One kick per arm or two kicks per cycle. This style is often used in training.
** Catch up stroke: A variation of the front crawl where one arm always rests at the front while the other arm performs one cycle. This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.
** Head-high crawl (also known as the water polo stroke, lifeguard approach stroke, or Tarzan drill):  This stroke is used for [[water polo]], lifeguards to keep the victim in sight, or those who simply want to see where they're going and breathe with ease. It is similar to front crawl, but with head above the water.  This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.
* [[Trudgen]]: The trudgen is similar to the front crawl, except that it is paired with a [[Sidestroke|scissors kick]], similar to that used in the sidestroke.
** Trudgen crawl: Similar to the trudgen, but with the use of a flutter kick (up and down leg kick) between the scissor kicks.
** Double trudgen: Similar to the trudgen, but the sides of the scissors kick alternate.
** Double trudgen crawl: Similar to the double trudgen, but with a flutter kick between the scissors kick alternate.
* [[Butterfly stroke]]: performed face down in the water. The legs perform a dolphin kick and while the arms move in a forward circle at the same time.

The script was written by [[Rian James]] and James Seymour, with Whitney Bolton, who was not credited, from the 1932 novel of the same name by [[Bradford Ropes]].

This [[backstage musical]] was very successful at the box office and is now considered a classic by many. The film was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. In 1998, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".  In 2006, it ranked 13th on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years of Musicals|list of best musicals]].

==Plot==
[[File:42nd-Street-Merkel-Keeler-Rogers.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Una Merkel]], [[Ruby Keeler]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''42nd Street'']]
It is 1932, the depth of [[the Depression]], and noted Broadway producers Jones ([[Robert McWade]]) and Barry ([[Ned Sparks]]) are putting on ''Pretty Lady'', a musical starring Dorothy Brock ([[Bebe Daniels]]). She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon ([[Guy Kibbee]]), the show's \"angel\" (financial backer), but while she is busy keeping him both hooked and at arm's length, she is secretly seeing her old [[vaudeville]] partner, out-of-work Pat Denning ([[George Brent]]).

Julian Marsh ([[Warner Baxter]]) is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes, he is broke, a result of the 1929 [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash]], so he must make his last show a hit, in order to have enough money to retire.

Cast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few \"[[casting couch]]\" innuendos flying around. Naïve newcomer Peggy Sawyer ([[Ruby Keeler]]), who arrives in New York from her home in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming ([[Una Merkel]]) and Ann \"Anytime Annie\" Lowell ([[Ginger Rogers]]),<ref name=Anytime/> take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee ([[George E. Stone]]); she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler ([[Dick Powell]]), takes an immediate liking to Peggy, as does Pat.
[[File:JulPeg42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Naive newcomer Peggy makes her first ''faux pas'', antagonizing tough director Julian Marsh]]

When Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy ([[Tom Kennedy (American actor)|Tom Kennedy]]) to rough him up. That, plus her realization that their situation is unhealthy, makes Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. He gets a stock job in Philadelphia.

Rehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning Abner has quarreled with her and wants Julian to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. She, however, tells him that she can't carry the show, but the inexperienced Peggy can. With 200 jobs and his future riding on the outcome, a desperate Julian rehearses Peggy mercilessly (vowing \"I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl\") until an hour before the premiere.

Billy finally gets up the nerve to tell Peggy he loves her; she enthusiastically kisses him. Then Dorothy shows up and wishes her luck, telling her that she and Pat are getting married. The show goes on, and the last twenty minutes of the film are devoted to three [[Busby Berkeley]] production numbers: \"[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]\", \"(I'm) Young and Healthy\", and \"[[42nd Street (song)|42nd Street]]\".

The show is a hit. As the theater audience comes out, Julian stands in the shadows, hearing the comments that Peggy is a star and he (Marsh) does not deserve the credit for it.<ref>Green, Stanley (1999) Hollywood Musicals Year by Year (2nd ed.), pub.

'''Plot note'''<br>
In the original Bradford Ropes' novel, Julian and Billy are lovers. Since same-sex relationships were unacceptable in films by the moral standards of the era, the film substituted a romance between Billy and Peggy.

==Production==
[[File:JulDorot42ndSt1933Trailer.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dorothy strings the \"angel\" along, but her heart belongs to her old partner, Pat.]]
The film was Ruby Keeler's first, and the first time that Berkeley, Warren and Dubin had worked for Warner Bros.  Director Lloyd Bacon was not the first choice to direct – he replaced [[Mervyn LeRoy]] when LeRoy became ill. LeRoy was dating Ginger Rogers at the time, and had suggested to her that she take the role of \"Anytime Annie\".<ref name=Anytime/><ref name=tcmnotes /><ref name=imdbtrivia />

Actors who were considered for lead roles when the film was being cast include [[Warren William]] and [[Richard Barthelmess]] for the role of Julian Marsh, eventually played by Warner Baxter; [[Kay Francis]] and [[Ruth Chatterton]] instead of Bebe Daniels for the role of Dorothy Brock; [[Loretta Young]] as Peggy Sawyer instead of Ruby Keeler; [[Joan Blondell]] instead of Ginger Rogers for Anytime Annie; [[Glenda Farrell]] for the role of Lorraine, played by [[Una Merkel]], and [[Frank McHugh]] instead of the diminutive George E. Stone as Andy, the dance director.<ref name=imdbtrivia>IMDb [http://imdb.com/title/tt0024034/trivia \"42nd Street\" (1933) Trivia]</ref>

The film began production on October 5, 1932. The shooting schedule ran for 28 days at the Warner Bros. studio in [[Burbank, California]].

All songs have music by Harry Warren and lyrics by Al Dubin.<ref>IMDb [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0024034/soundtrack Soundtracks]</ref>
* \"[[You're Getting to Be a Habit with Me]]\" – sung by Bebe Daniels ({{YouTube|bIA0lUZKBKI}})
* \"It Must Be June\" – sung by Bebe Daniels, Dick Powell and the chorus
* \"[[Shuffle Off to Buffalo]]\" [http://www.trainweb.org/wnyrhs/Shuffle.wav Song Clip] – sung and danced by Ruby Keeler and Clarence Nordstrom, with Ginger Rogers, Una Merkel and the chorus, ({{YouTube|aMdEqB-TB8g}})
* \"Young and Healthy\" – sung by Dick Powell to [[Toby Wing]] and the chorus, ({{YouTube|mSvQtAnh_CI}})
* \"[[42nd Street (song)|42nd Street]]\" – sung and danced by Ruby Keeler, and sung by Dick Powell ({{YouTube|klu_rjDMEkk}})

The \"Love Theme\", written by Harry Warren, is played under scenes between Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, and Bebe Daniels and George Brent. It has no title or lyrics, and is unpublished.

The music playing during dance rehearsals and the opening of the show is an instrumental piano piece that Harry Warren wrote, titled \"Pretty Lady.\"

A special patter with different music was written for the song \"Forty-Second Street\" and the production number of same, with music by Warren and lyrics by Dubin. It was cut for unknown reasons from the finished film, but an unpublished manuscript of this still exists.

Though the songs of 42nd Street all allude to sex, there is a single moment at the end of \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", when one word of the scripted lyrics, \"belly\", was changed to \"tummy\" presumedly to comply with the then weakly enforced [[Motion Picture Production Code of 1930]]. But in making the change, the filmmakers purposely drew attention to the censored word.  During the last two verses, Una Merkel & Ginger Rogers sing about a traveling salesman who impregnates the farmer's daughter, and then is forced into a shotgun wedding. The lyric as [http://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/craftg/histhrs%20169/shuffle%20off%20to%20buffalo.pdf scripted] is: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his belly...\" But as Ginger sings it, Una gestures to her and she changes the last word: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his bel - - tummy\".

==Reception and legacy==
The film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933 at the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and went into general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable ones of the year, bringing in an estimated gross of $2,300,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|2300000|1933|fmt=c}} today. It received [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for Best Picture and Best Sound Recording, and was named one of the 10 Best Films of 1933 by ''[[Film Daily]]''.<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=616&category=Notes \"42nd Street\" (1933) Notes]</ref><ref>IMDb [http://imdb.com/title/tt0024034/awards Awards for \"42nd Street\" (1933)]</ref><ref>AllMovieGuide [https://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:258~T4 42nd Street Awards]</ref>

[[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"invariably entertaining\" and, \"The liveliest and one of the most tuneful screen musical comedies that has come out of Hollywood\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |authorlink=Mordaunt Hall |date=March 10, 1933 |title=Movie Review: 42nd Street |journal=[[The New York Times]]  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E0D91738E333A25753C1A9659C946294D6CF |accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref>

The ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' described it as \"A sprightly entertainment, combining, as it did, a plausible enough story of back-stage life, some excellent musical numbers and dance routines and a cast of players that are considerably above the average found in screen musicals.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=March 15, 1933 |title=New York Reviews |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=Wilkerson Daily Corp. |location=Los Angeles |page=2}}</ref>

\"Every element is professional and convincing\", wrote ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. \"It'll socko the screen musical fans with the same degree that [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro's]] pioneering screen musicals did.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=March 14, 1933 |title=42d Street |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=Variety, Inc. |location=New York |page=14}}</ref>

[[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it \"a bright movie\" with \"as pretty a little fantasy of Broadway as you may hope to see\", and praised Baxter's performance as \"one of the best he has given us\", though he described the plot as \"the most conventional one to be found in such doings.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Mosher |first=John |authorlink=John Mosher (writer) |date=March 18, 1933 |title=The Current Cinema |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=62}}</ref>

Warner already had a follow-up of sorts – ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' – in production before the film's release, and the success of both films permitted a higher budget and more elaborate production numbers in Warner's next follow-up, ''[[Footlight Parade]]''.

By the time of [[Busby Berkeley]]'s death in 1976, the film had become revered as the archetypal [[backstage musical]], the one that \"gave life to the clichés that have kept parodists happy\", as critic [[Pauline Kael]] wrote.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bianco |first=Anthony |date=2004 |title=Ghosts of 42nd Street: A History of America's Most Infamous Block |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-688-17089-9 |page=217}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[File:42nd-Street-Merkel-Keeler-Rogers.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Una Merkel]], [[Ruby Keeler]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''42nd Street'']]
It is 1932, the depth of [[the Depression]], and noted Broadway producers Jones ([[Robert McWade]]) and Barry ([[Ned Sparks]]) are putting on ''Pretty Lady'', a musical starring Dorothy Brock ([[Bebe Daniels]]). She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon ([[Guy Kibbee]]), the show's \"angel\" (financial backer), but while she is busy keeping him both hooked and at arm's length, she is secretly seeing her old [[vaudeville]] partner, out-of-work Pat Denning ([[George Brent]]).

Julian Marsh ([[Warner Baxter]]) is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes, he is broke, a result of the 1929 [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Stock Market Crash]], so he must make his last show a hit, in order to have enough money to retire.

Cast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few \"[[casting couch]]\" innuendos flying around. Naïve newcomer Peggy Sawyer ([[Ruby Keeler]]), who arrives in New York from her home in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming ([[Una Merkel]]) and Ann \"Anytime Annie\" Lowell ([[Ginger Rogers]]),<ref name=Anytime/> take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee ([[George E. Stone]]); she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler ([[Dick Powell]]), takes an immediate liking to Peggy, as does Pat.

The \"Love Theme\", written by Harry Warren, is played under scenes between Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, and Bebe Daniels and George Brent. It has no title or lyrics, and is unpublished.

The music playing during dance rehearsals and the opening of the show is an instrumental piano piece that Harry Warren wrote, titled \"Pretty Lady.\"

A special patter with different music was written for the song \"Forty-Second Street\" and the production number of same, with music by Warren and lyrics by Dubin. It was cut for unknown reasons from the finished film, but an unpublished manuscript of this still exists.

Though the songs of 42nd Street all allude to sex, there is a single moment at the end of \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", when one word of the scripted lyrics, \"belly\", was changed to \"tummy\" presumedly to comply with the then weakly enforced [[Motion Picture Production Code of 1930]]. But in making the change, the filmmakers purposely drew attention to the censored word.  During the last two verses, Una Merkel & Ginger Rogers sing about a traveling salesman who impregnates the farmer's daughter, and then is forced into a shotgun wedding. The lyric as [http://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/craftg/histhrs%20169/shuffle%20off%20to%20buffalo.pdf scripted] is: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his belly...\" But as Ginger sings it, Una gestures to her and she changes the last word: \"He did right by little Nellie, with a shotgun in his bel - - tummy\".

==Reception and legacy==
The film premiered in New York on March 9, 1933 at the [[Mark Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and went into general release two days later, becoming one of the most profitable ones of the year, bringing in an estimated gross of $2,300,000, equal to ${{Inflation|US|2300000|1933|fmt=c}} today. It received [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations for Best Picture and Best Sound Recording, and was named one of the 10 Best Films of 1933 by ''[[Film Daily]]''.<ref name=tcmnotes>TCM [http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=616&category=Notes \"42nd Street\" (1933) Notes]</ref><ref>IMDb [http://imdb.com/title/tt0024034/awards Awards for \"42nd Street\" (1933)]</ref><ref>AllMovieGuide [https://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:258~T4 42nd Street Awards]</ref>

[[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"invariably entertaining\" and, \"The liveliest and one of the most tuneful screen musical comedies that has come out of Hollywood\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Hall |first=Mordaunt |authorlink=Mordaunt Hall |date=March 10, 1933 |title=Movie Review: 42nd Street |journal=[[The New York Times]]  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B04E0D91738E333A25753C1A9659C946294D6CF |accessdate=December 8, 2014}}</ref>

The ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' described it as \"A sprightly entertainment, combining, as it did, a plausible enough story of back-stage life, some excellent musical numbers and dance routines and a cast of players that are considerably above the average found in screen musicals.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=March 15, 1933 |title=New York Reviews |journal=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=Wilkerson Daily Corp. |location=Los Angeles |page=2}}</ref>

\"Every element is professional and convincing\", wrote ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. \"It'll socko the screen musical fans with the same degree that [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro's]] pioneering screen musicals did.\"<ref>{{cite news |date=March 14, 1933 |title=42d Street |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=Variety, Inc. |location=New York |page=14}}</ref>

[[John Mosher (writer)|John Mosher]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' called it \"a bright movie\" with \"as pretty a little fantasy of Broadway as you may hope to see\", and praised Baxter's performance as \"one of the best he has given us\", though he described the plot as \"the most conventional one to be found in such doings.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Mosher |first=John |authorlink=John Mosher (writer) |date=March 18, 1933 |title=The Current Cinema |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |page=62}}</ref>

Warner already had a follow-up of sorts – ''[[Gold Diggers of 1933]]'' – in production before the film's release, and the success of both films permitted a higher budget and more elaborate production numbers in Warner's next follow-up, ''[[Footlight Parade]]''.

By the time of [[Busby Berkeley]]'s death in 1976, the film had become revered as the archetypal [[backstage musical]], the one that \"gave life to the clichés that have kept parodists happy\", as critic [[Pauline Kael]] wrote.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bianco |first=Anthony |date=2004 |title=Ghosts of 42nd Street: A History of America's Most Infamous Block |publisher=Harper Collins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-688-17089-9 |page=217}}</ref>

According to Warner Bros. records, the film earned $1,438,000 domestically and $843,000 abroad.<ref name=\"warners\"/>

==Society and history==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht op Banjoewangi Oost-Java TMnr 60020438.jpg|thumb|View of Banyuwangi during [[Dutch East Indies|colonial period]] ]]

One Banyuwangi native group is the [[Osing people|Osing community]] which has a [[Hindu culture]] although they can be considered as a Javanese sub-ethnic group. They live mainly in the central part of Banyuwangi and they sometimes consider themselves as [[Majapahit]] descendants. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Other groups are [[Java (island)|Javanese]] (living mostly in the south and west), [[Madurese people|Madurese]] (mainly in the north and coastal area) and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] (scattered but more concentrated in the east). Other smaller groups include [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], [[Bugis|Buginese]], and [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]]s.

Once known as '''Blambangan''' (or its variation: Balambangan and Balumbungan), it was a [[vassal]] of the Majapahit Kingdom and a regional trade centre. After the Majapahit Kingdom ceased to exist, it became an independent kingdom and, as such, the last Hindu kingdom of Java. In order to defend itself from the troops of the [[Sultanate of Demak]], which tried to occupy it, Blambangan asked for help from Balinese kings, which caused it to lose its independence to Balinese kingdoms. During this time Blambangan was deeply influenced by [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]]. After around 150 years of Balinese occupation, the [[Sultanate of Mataram]] gained control of the territory and renamed it Banyuwangi. Later, it was part of the Mataram territory controlled by the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] (1770). During the expansion of plantations in the 19th century, many parts of Banyuwangi were planted with [[coffee]] and [[sugar cane]], which feature its landscape even now. The Chinese and Arabs came mostly during this period.

Banyuwangi people are known for their combination of Islamic and pre-Islamic tradition.

During the [[Fall of Suharto]], [[1998 East Java ninja scare|a witchhunt]] in [[Banyuwangi]] against alleged sorcerers spiraled into widespread riots and violence. In addition to alleged sorcerers, Islamic clerics were also targeted and killed,  [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] members were murdered by rioters.<ref>http://www.insideindonesia.org/weekly-articles/the-banyuwangi-murders</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053925,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=October 19, 1998}}</ref>

It is performed during night until dawn particularly in parties.

===Janger or Damarwulan===
[[Damarwulan]] is a legendary hero who features in traditional theatre art which has been developed since the 19th century in Banyuwangi. It is a combination of Balinese, Javanese and local cultures.

==Environment==
The forest and river in Banyuwangi is well-preserved, says the Indonesia Dragonfly Society because they found 3 dragonfly species which only can live in good environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2014/01/30/206549674/Rare-Dragonfly-Species-Found-in-Banyuwangi |title=Rare Dragonfly Species Found in Banyuwangi |author=Ika Ningtyas |date=January 30, 2014}}</ref>

Nevertheless, there are local controversies in the Regency over the impact of gold mining activities in the locality of Tumpang Pitu village.  In 2006, the Banywangi regency administration granted a mining licence to one company, PT Indo Multi Niaga, which later transferred the licence to another company.  However, the local community had expressed concern about gold mining activities as early as 1997.  The issues partly related to the protection of the area around a local Hindu temple, partly relate to environmental matters, and partly related to local community views about the economic and social impact of the mining.<ref>Indra Harsaputra, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/01/30/banyuwangi-mining-site-risks-triggering-social-conflict-experts.html Banywangi mining site risks triggering social conflight: Experts'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 January 2016.</ref>

==Society and history==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht op Banjoewangi Oost-Java TMnr 60020438.jpg|thumb|View of Banyuwangi during [[Dutch East Indies|colonial period]] ]]

One Banyuwangi native group is the [[Osing people|Osing community]] which has a [[Hindu culture]] although they can be considered as a Javanese sub-ethnic group. They live mainly in the central part of Banyuwangi and they sometimes consider themselves as [[Majapahit]] descendants. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Other groups are [[Java (island)|Javanese]] (living mostly in the south and west), [[Madurese people|Madurese]] (mainly in the north and coastal area) and [[Balinese people|Balinese]] (scattered but more concentrated in the east). Other smaller groups include [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], [[Bugis|Buginese]], and [[Arab Indonesian|Arab]]s.

Once known as '''Blambangan''' (or its variation: Balambangan and Balumbungan), it was a [[vassal]] of the Majapahit Kingdom and a regional trade centre. After the Majapahit Kingdom ceased to exist, it became an independent kingdom and, as such, the last Hindu kingdom of Java. In order to defend itself from the troops of the [[Sultanate of Demak]], which tried to occupy it, Blambangan asked for help from Balinese kings, which caused it to lose its independence to Balinese kingdoms. During this time Blambangan was deeply influenced by [[Balinese people#Culture|Balinese culture]]. After around 150 years of Balinese occupation, the [[Sultanate of Mataram]] gained control of the territory and renamed it Banyuwangi. Later, it was part of the Mataram territory controlled by the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] (1770). During the expansion of plantations in the 19th century, many parts of Banyuwangi were planted with [[coffee]] and [[sugar cane]], which feature its landscape even now. The Chinese and Arabs came mostly during this period.

Banyuwangi people are known for their combination of Islamic and pre-Islamic tradition.

During the [[Fall of Suharto]], [[1998 East Java ninja scare|a witchhunt]] in [[Banyuwangi]] against alleged sorcerers spiraled into widespread riots and violence. In addition to alleged sorcerers, Islamic clerics were also targeted and killed,  [[Nahdlatul Ulama]] members were murdered by rioters.<ref>http://www.insideindonesia.org/weekly-articles/the-banyuwangi-murders</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053925,00.html | work=Time | title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews - TIME.com | date=October 19, 1998}}</ref>

It is performed during night until dawn particularly in parties.

===Janger or Damarwulan===

Visitors may be interested to find several waterfalls in one locality.  Opened formally in 2014, there are a number of waterfalls in Kampung Anyar (New Village), near Kalibendo Plantation, around 15 kilometers from Banyuwangi on the way to [[Ijen|Mount Ijen]]. There are 3 waterfalls near to each other known as the \"Triple Waterfall\" to be found 10 minutes walk down the stairs from a parking area. Or about 300 meters along the river, walking uphill, Kethagen Waterfall can be found. The cliff besides the river can reflect sunlight, glittering like diamonds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greatindonesia.com/article/detail/324/Segarnya-Air-Terjun-Kembar-Kampung-Anyar |title=Segarnya Air Terjun Kembar Kampung Anyar |author=Agoes Santoso |accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>

==Environment==
The forest and river in Banyuwangi is well-preserved, says the Indonesia Dragonfly Society because they found 3 dragonfly species which only can live in good environment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2014/01/30/206549674/Rare-Dragonfly-Species-Found-in-Banyuwangi |title=Rare Dragonfly Species Found in Banyuwangi |author=Ika Ningtyas |date=January 30, 2014}}</ref>

Nevertheless, there are local controversies in the Regency over the impact of gold mining activities in the locality of Tumpang Pitu village.  In 2006, the Banywangi regency administration granted a mining licence to one company, PT Indo Multi Niaga, which later transferred the licence to another company.  However, the local community had expressed concern about gold mining activities as early as 1997.  The issues partly related to the protection of the area around a local Hindu temple, partly relate to environmental matters, and partly related to local community views about the economic and social impact of the mining.<ref>Indra Harsaputra, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/01/30/banyuwangi-mining-site-risks-triggering-social-conflict-experts.html Banywangi mining site risks triggering social conflight: Experts'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 30 January 2016.</ref>

\"'''Under the Lake'''\" is the third episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]] of the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It was first broadcast on BBC One on 3 October 2015.<ref name=\"DoctorWhoMagazine\">{{cite web |title=Every Saturday evening from 19 September!|url=https://twitter.com/DWMtweets/status/633656485206196225|work=Twitter |author=Doctor Who Magazine |accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> It is the first part of a two-part story, the second of which is \"[[Before the Flood (Doctor Who)|Before the Flood]]\" on 10 October; both are written by [[Toby Whithouse]] and directed by Daniel O'Hara.

The episode is set in a Scottish underwater mining facility in 2119, where alien time traveller [[Twelfth Doctor|the Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) and his companion [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) arrive three days after the crew have unearthed an empty black spaceship. The crew members then start dying, and the survivors find themselves faced with an army of hollow-eyed homicidal ghosts.

In the form of Prentis, played by Paul Kaye, this episode sees a return for the [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q–Z)#Tivolian|Tivolians]], a race last seen in the 2011 episode \"[[The God Complex]]\", also written by Toby Whithouse.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Arnopp |first= Jason |date= November 2015|title= Episode Previews: Under the Lake & Before the Flood |journal= [[Doctor Who Magazine]] |publisher= Panini UK Ltd. }}</ref>

==Plot==
The crew of an underwater mining facility in [[Caithness]], Scotland in 2119 discover an alien craft in the ruins of a submerged town. They bring it aboard only to find it is missing one of its two power cells, and four glyphs carved into the interior walls. Suddenly the craft's engines ignite, and Commander Moran is killed in the act of pushing another out of the way. Later, the crew finds two ghostly figures, Moran and an unidentified alien, roaming during the night cycle, soundlessly chanting before turning to attack the crew. The crew take shelter in the base's [[Faraday cage]] which the ghosts cannot enter.

The [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] arrive later via the [[TARDIS]] and are briefed by acting commander Cass, who is deaf and assisted by her interpreter Lunn. Suddenly the base's systems switch to the night cycle, and before they can restore the day cycle, the ghosts have killed another crew member, and soon the ghost of that crew joins the other two. The Doctor recognises the alien ghost as Tivolian, a cowardly, peaceful race. Cass calls for an evacuation shuttle only to learn one has already been dispatched. The Doctor orders it to turn around, believing the ghosts have a nefarious purpose.

The Doctor is able to lure the ghosts into the Faraday cage, and with Cass's help, can read what they are chanting: \"the dark, the sword, the forsaken, the temple\". The Doctor determines these are galactic coordinates pointing to this location, and believes that the ghosts are killing the crew and trying to draw more victims to boost the strength of the broadcast of this signal; however, only those that have seen the glyphs in the ship are susceptible to the ghosts' influence. Using the base's remote drones, they find and collect a stasis chamber among the ruins, which the Doctor suspects is what the coordinates point to, but they cannot open it. The Doctor determines he must go back in time before the town was flooded to find the origin of the signal. The ghosts manipulate hatchways that separate Clara, Cass, and Lunn from the Doctor and crew members O'Donnell and Bennett. The Doctor promises Clara he will be back, and takes O'Donnell and Bennett with him to the TARDIS. Shortly after the TARDIS' departure, Clara, Cass, and Lunn witness a new ghost outside of the base – that of the Doctor.

===Continuity===
The Doctor says that the ghost in the top hat is from the planet Tivoli, first mentioned in the [[Eleventh Doctor]] story \"The God Complex\", which featured a member of its native species named Gibbis.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4YFWPhGQjwsBjLbzjQwzgtw/under-the-lake-the-fact-file|title=BBC One – Doctor Who, Series 9, Under the Lake – Under the Lake: The Fact File|work=BBC}}</ref>

When pondering what the ghosts actually are, the Doctor eliminates the possibility that they are Flesh avatars (\"[[The Rebel Flesh]]\" / \"[[The Almost People]]\"), [[Auton]]s (''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' et al.), or digital copies in the Nethersphere (\"[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]\" / \"[[Death in Heaven]]\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-hints-teasers-set-1-76528.htm|title=Under the Lake: Hints & Teasers (Set #1)|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-review-76631.htm|title=Under the Lake Review|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref>

One of the Doctor's \"cards\" has him offering reassurance that no-one, among other disasters, is going to be \"exterminated/upgraded\". This is a scripted response to potential [[Daleks|Dalek]] and/or [[Cybermen]] encounters.<ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-hints-teasers-set-2-76554.htm|title=Under the Lake: Hints & Teasers (Set #2)|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref> Another is an apology for dropping someone off in [[Aberdeen]], a reference to the stories ''[[The Hand of Fear]]'' (1976) and \"[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]\" (2006) when the Doctor mistakenly dropped off companion [[Sarah Jane Smith]] in Aberdeen, rather than [[Croydon]].<ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk1\"/><ref name=\"anglophenia\">{{cite web |url= http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/10/doctor-who-10-things-you-may-not-know-about-under-the-lake/ |title='Doctor Who': 10 Things You May Not Know About 'Under The Lake' |first=Fraser |last=McAlpine |work=BBC America |date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref>

==Broadcast and reception==
Overnight viewings for this episode were 3.74 million, a small improvement from the episode broadcast a week beforehand, [[The Witch's Familiar]]. However the final consolidated ratings were 5.63 million, the second lowest of any episode of Doctor Who since the show was revived in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/doctor-who-series-9-2015-uk-ratings-accumulator-76154.htm|title=Doctor Who Series 9 (2015) UK Ratings Accumulator|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref> Much like the previous episode, the lower ratings are possibly due to the [[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool A#England vs Australia|England v Australia match]] in the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] airing simultaneously. The episode received an [[Appreciation Index]] score of 84.<ref>{{cite web |title=Under the Lake – AI:84 |url= http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2015/10/under-lake-ai84.html |website=Doctor Who News |date=5 October 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>

\"Under the Lake\" received positive reviews from TV critics, with many praising the episode's creepy atmosphere and old fashioned style.<ref name=\"digitalspy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/review/a671652/doctor-who-review-under-the-lake-is-atmospheric-but-flawed.html |first=Morgan |last=Jeffery |date=3 October 2015 |title=Doctor Who review: 'Under the Lake' is atmospheric but flawed |work=Digital Spy}}</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/11907017/Doctor-Who-Series-9-Episode-3-Under-the-Lake-review.html |title=Doctor Who, Under the Lake, review: 'enjoyably old-fashioned'|first=Michael |last=Hogan |date=3 October 2015 |newspaper=the Daily Telegraph}}</ref> The episode received a score of 83% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average score of 7.6. The site's consensus reads \"Part one of two, \"Under the Lake\" scares up a good, old-fashioned ghost story, which may remind viewers of the original series – for better or worse\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/doctor-who/s09/e03/|title=Under the Lake|date=5 October 2015|work=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>

Morgan Jeffery of [[Digital Spy]] praised the episode, labelling it \"atmospheric\". He further went on to say \"It's this sense of claustrophobia that is among the episode's biggest selling points – watching a crew's camaraderie crumble as the pressure gets to them never grows old. Gloomy visuals and a haunting score from Murray Gold also do much to generate atmosphere and tension\" and closed his review stating \"Chills, action, adventure – this is old-school Doctor Who given a modern sheen and, most of all, it's enormous fun\".<ref name=\"digitalspy\"/> Michael Hogan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' acclaimed the episode, awarding it a perfect five stars. He said \"This rollicking, hair-raising romp demonstrated that the sci-fi franchise still has the power to thrill and chill in equal measure\". He closed his review by claiming \"Forty minutes flew by and the credits rolled too soon, leaving on a creepy cliffhanger that left me baying for more. If next week’s conclusion of the story – and the 12-part series as a whole – can keep up the standard set by the opening three episodes, we’re in for a treat. Doctor Who will have regenerated once more\".<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>

Alasdair Wilkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also enjoyed the episode, awarding it a B+ grade. Calling the episode \"impeccably structured\", he further stated that it \"has a tightness of narrative focus that often eludes the first episodes of Doctor Who two-parters\". He closed his review by saying the episode \"works beautifully as a propulsive monsters story\" and stating \"A simple, focused first episode figures to set up a twisted, sprawling second half. But even without seeing the payoff, it’s hard to imagine more efficient narrative construction for whatever that conclusion might be\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Alisdair|title=Doctor Who tells a real ghost story, then gets crazy|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-tells-real-ghost-story-then-gets-crazy-226272 |work=The A.V. Club |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref> Jon Cooper of ''[[The Independent]]'' lavished praised onto the episode, calling it \"spooky with a sci-fi slant\" and saying that \"while the show has tackled this sort of narrative countless times before, it has rarely been done with such palpable tension and slow-burning dread\". He further stated \"As secrets were uncovered and deductions made, the plot rattled along with a pace that ended up as satisfying as it was intriguing\", and closed his review by saying \"in terms of wonderfully solid and spooky TV there’s nothing to moan about here\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Jon |title=Doctor Who, Under the Lake, TV review: Extraterrestrial ghost story is scarier than the Daleks |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/doctor-who-under-the-lake-tv-review-extraterrestrial-ghost-story-is-more-terrifying-than-the-daleks-a6677251.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref> Scott Collura of [[IGN]] was also highly impressed with the episode, awarding it a score of 8.5/10, deemed by the site as \"great\". He particularly praised the episode's cliffhanger ending, stating \"But oh, the ending of this episode! So great\", and summarised his review with \"I always welcome the creature-feature Doctor Who episodes, and \"Under the Lake\" does that tradition proud. The shimmering, ghastly specters are scary enough, but the apparent fate of the Doctor in this cliffhanger is the real shocker\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Collura |first1=Scott |title=Doctor Who: \"Under the Lake\" Review |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/10/03/doctor-who-under-the-lake-review |work=IGN |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>

\"'''Under the Lake'''\" is the third episode of the [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]] of the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. It was first broadcast on BBC One on 3 October 2015.<ref name=\"DoctorWhoMagazine\">{{cite web |title=Every Saturday evening from 19 September!|url=https://twitter.com/DWMtweets/status/633656485206196225|work=Twitter |author=Doctor Who Magazine |accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref> It is the first part of a two-part story, the second of which is \"[[Before the Flood (Doctor Who)|Before the Flood]]\" on 10 October; both are written by [[Toby Whithouse]] and directed by Daniel O'Hara.

The episode is set in a Scottish underwater mining facility in 2119, where alien time traveller [[Twelfth Doctor|the Doctor]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) and his companion [[Clara Oswald]] ([[Jenna Coleman]]) arrive three days after the crew have unearthed an empty black spaceship. The crew members then start dying, and the survivors find themselves faced with an army of hollow-eyed homicidal ghosts.

In the form of Prentis, played by Paul Kaye, this episode sees a return for the [[List of Doctor Who universe creatures and aliens (Q–Z)#Tivolian|Tivolians]], a race last seen in the 2011 episode \"[[The God Complex]]\", also written by Toby Whithouse.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Arnopp |first= Jason |date= November 2015|title= Episode Previews: Under the Lake & Before the Flood |journal= [[Doctor Who Magazine]] |publisher= Panini UK Ltd. }}</ref>

==Plot==
The crew of an underwater mining facility in [[Caithness]], Scotland in 2119 discover an alien craft in the ruins of a submerged town. They bring it aboard only to find it is missing one of its two power cells, and four glyphs carved into the interior walls. Suddenly the craft's engines ignite, and Commander Moran is killed in the act of pushing another out of the way. Later, the crew finds two ghostly figures, Moran and an unidentified alien, roaming during the night cycle, soundlessly chanting before turning to attack the crew. The crew take shelter in the base's [[Faraday cage]] which the ghosts cannot enter.

The [[Twelfth Doctor]] and [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] arrive later via the [[TARDIS]] and are briefed by acting commander Cass, who is deaf and assisted by her interpreter Lunn. Suddenly the base's systems switch to the night cycle, and before they can restore the day cycle, the ghosts have killed another crew member, and soon the ghost of that crew joins the other two. The Doctor recognises the alien ghost as Tivolian, a cowardly, peaceful race. Cass calls for an evacuation shuttle only to learn one has already been dispatched. The Doctor orders it to turn around, believing the ghosts have a nefarious purpose.

The Doctor is able to lure the ghosts into the Faraday cage, and with Cass's help, can read what they are chanting: \"the dark, the sword, the forsaken, the temple\". The Doctor determines these are galactic coordinates pointing to this location, and believes that the ghosts are killing the crew and trying to draw more victims to boost the strength of the broadcast of this signal; however, only those that have seen the glyphs in the ship are susceptible to the ghosts' influence. Using the base's remote drones, they find and collect a stasis chamber among the ruins, which the Doctor suspects is what the coordinates point to, but they cannot open it. The Doctor determines he must go back in time before the town was flooded to find the origin of the signal. The ghosts manipulate hatchways that separate Clara, Cass, and Lunn from the Doctor and crew members O'Donnell and Bennett. The Doctor promises Clara he will be back, and takes O'Donnell and Bennett with him to the TARDIS. Shortly after the TARDIS' departure, Clara, Cass, and Lunn witness a new ghost outside of the base – that of the Doctor.

===Continuity===
The Doctor says that the ghost in the top hat is from the planet Tivoli, first mentioned in the [[Eleventh Doctor]] story \"The God Complex\", which featured a member of its native species named Gibbis.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4YFWPhGQjwsBjLbzjQwzgtw/under-the-lake-the-fact-file|title=BBC One – Doctor Who, Series 9, Under the Lake – Under the Lake: The Fact File|work=BBC}}</ref>

When pondering what the ghosts actually are, the Doctor eliminates the possibility that they are Flesh avatars (\"[[The Rebel Flesh]]\" / \"[[The Almost People]]\"), [[Auton]]s (''[[Spearhead from Space]]'' et al.), or digital copies in the Nethersphere (\"[[Dark Water (Doctor Who)|Dark Water]]\" / \"[[Death in Heaven]]\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-hints-teasers-set-1-76528.htm|title=Under the Lake: Hints & Teasers (Set #1)|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref><ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-review-76631.htm|title=Under the Lake Review|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref>

One of the Doctor's \"cards\" has him offering reassurance that no-one, among other disasters, is going to be \"exterminated/upgraded\". This is a scripted response to potential [[Daleks|Dalek]] and/or [[Cybermen]] encounters.<ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/under-the-lake-hints-teasers-set-2-76554.htm|title=Under the Lake: Hints & Teasers (Set #2)|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref> Another is an apology for dropping someone off in [[Aberdeen]], a reference to the stories ''[[The Hand of Fear]]'' (1976) and \"[[School Reunion (Doctor Who)|School Reunion]]\" (2006) when the Doctor mistakenly dropped off companion [[Sarah Jane Smith]] in Aberdeen, rather than [[Croydon]].<ref name=\"doctorwhotv.co.uk1\"/><ref name=\"anglophenia\">{{cite web |url= http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2015/10/doctor-who-10-things-you-may-not-know-about-under-the-lake/ |title='Doctor Who': 10 Things You May Not Know About 'Under The Lake' |first=Fraser |last=McAlpine |work=BBC America |date=4 October 2015 |accessdate=25 October 2015}}</ref>

Colin McFarlane, who plays Moran in this episode, had previously featured in the 2007 Christmas episode, \"[[Voyage of the Damned (Doctor Who)|Voyage of the Damned]]\", in which he voiced the Heavenly Host, and additionally appeared in spin-off series ''[[Torchwood]]'', in four episodes of ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'', as General Pierce.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://guide.doctorwhonews.net/person.php?code=919 |title=Doctor Who Guide: Colin McFarlane |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= 12 May 2015 |work=Doctor Who Guide|accessdate= 11 October 2015}}</ref>

==Broadcast and reception==
Overnight viewings for this episode were 3.74 million, a small improvement from the episode broadcast a week beforehand, [[The Witch's Familiar]]. However the final consolidated ratings were 5.63 million, the second lowest of any episode of Doctor Who since the show was revived in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/doctor-who-series-9-2015-uk-ratings-accumulator-76154.htm|title=Doctor Who Series 9 (2015) UK Ratings Accumulator|work=doctorwhotv.co.uk}}</ref> Much like the previous episode, the lower ratings are possibly due to the [[2015 Rugby World Cup Pool A#England vs Australia|England v Australia match]] in the [[2015 Rugby World Cup]] airing simultaneously. The episode received an [[Appreciation Index]] score of 84.<ref>{{cite web |title=Under the Lake – AI:84 |url= http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2015/10/under-lake-ai84.html |website=Doctor Who News |date=5 October 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>

\"Under the Lake\" received positive reviews from TV critics, with many praising the episode's creepy atmosphere and old fashioned style.<ref name=\"digitalspy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s7/doctor-who/review/a671652/doctor-who-review-under-the-lake-is-atmospheric-but-flawed.html |first=Morgan |last=Jeffery |date=3 October 2015 |title=Doctor Who review: 'Under the Lake' is atmospheric but flawed |work=Digital Spy}}</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/doctor-who/11907017/Doctor-Who-Series-9-Episode-3-Under-the-Lake-review.html |title=Doctor Who, Under the Lake, review: 'enjoyably old-fashioned'|first=Michael |last=Hogan |date=3 October 2015 |newspaper=the Daily Telegraph}}</ref> The episode received a score of 83% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], with an average score of 7.6. The site's consensus reads \"Part one of two, \"Under the Lake\" scares up a good, old-fashioned ghost story, which may remind viewers of the original series – for better or worse\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/doctor-who/s09/e03/|title=Under the Lake|date=5 October 2015|work=rottentomatoes.com}}</ref>

Morgan Jeffery of [[Digital Spy]] praised the episode, labelling it \"atmospheric\". He further went on to say \"It's this sense of claustrophobia that is among the episode's biggest selling points – watching a crew's camaraderie crumble as the pressure gets to them never grows old. Gloomy visuals and a haunting score from Murray Gold also do much to generate atmosphere and tension\" and closed his review stating \"Chills, action, adventure – this is old-school Doctor Who given a modern sheen and, most of all, it's enormous fun\".<ref name=\"digitalspy\"/> Michael Hogan of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' acclaimed the episode, awarding it a perfect five stars. He said \"This rollicking, hair-raising romp demonstrated that the sci-fi franchise still has the power to thrill and chill in equal measure\". He closed his review by claiming \"Forty minutes flew by and the credits rolled too soon, leaving on a creepy cliffhanger that left me baying for more. If next week’s conclusion of the story – and the 12-part series as a whole – can keep up the standard set by the opening three episodes, we’re in for a treat. Doctor Who will have regenerated once more\".<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>

Alasdair Wilkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also enjoyed the episode, awarding it a B+ grade. Calling the episode \"impeccably structured\", he further stated that it \"has a tightness of narrative focus that often eludes the first episodes of Doctor Who two-parters\". He closed his review by saying the episode \"works beautifully as a propulsive monsters story\" and stating \"A simple, focused first episode figures to set up a twisted, sprawling second half. But even without seeing the payoff, it’s hard to imagine more efficient narrative construction for whatever that conclusion might be\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilkins|first=Alisdair|title=Doctor Who tells a real ghost story, then gets crazy|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/doctor-who-tells-real-ghost-story-then-gets-crazy-226272 |work=The A.V. Club |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref> Jon Cooper of ''[[The Independent]]'' lavished praised onto the episode, calling it \"spooky with a sci-fi slant\" and saying that \"while the show has tackled this sort of narrative countless times before, it has rarely been done with such palpable tension and slow-burning dread\". He further stated \"As secrets were uncovered and deductions made, the plot rattled along with a pace that ended up as satisfying as it was intriguing\", and closed his review by saying \"in terms of wonderfully solid and spooky TV there’s nothing to moan about here\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Cooper|first=Jon |title=Doctor Who, Under the Lake, TV review: Extraterrestrial ghost story is scarier than the Daleks |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/doctor-who-under-the-lake-tv-review-extraterrestrial-ghost-story-is-more-terrifying-than-the-daleks-a6677251.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref> Scott Collura of [[IGN]] was also highly impressed with the episode, awarding it a score of 8.5/10, deemed by the site as \"great\". He particularly praised the episode's cliffhanger ending, stating \"But oh, the ending of this episode! So great\", and summarised his review with \"I always welcome the creature-feature Doctor Who episodes, and \"Under the Lake\" does that tradition proud. The shimmering, ghastly specters are scary enough, but the apparent fate of the Doctor in this cliffhanger is the real shocker\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Collura |first1=Scott |title=Doctor Who: \"Under the Lake\" Review |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/10/03/doctor-who-under-the-lake-review |work=IGN |accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>

'''Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children''' occurs when children do not receive accessible language exposure during the [[critical period]] of language development. Language development may be severely delayed from the lack of language exposure during this period. This was observed in well-known clinical case studies such as [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]],<ref>{{Cite book|last=Curtiss, Susan Ruth.|title=Genie : a psycholinguistic study of a modern-day 'wild child'|date=1977|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0-12-196350-0|oclc=780448709}}</ref> [[Kaspar Hauser]], [[Anna (feral child)|Anna]],<ref>{{Cite journal|date=January 1940|title=Extreme Social Isolation of a Child|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=45|issue=4|pages=554–565|doi=10.1086/218374|issn=0002-9602}}</ref> and Isabelle,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=D.

== American Deaf Educational Philosophy ==

=== Auditory-Oral ===

=== Mainstream ===
[[Mainstreaming (education)|Mainstream]] education is the philosophy of integrating students requiring special education services into a general education classroom based on their skills. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) mandates the specificities of this integration. IDEA protects students who are typically a part of the special education classroom by granting the right to enroll in the general education classroom. This applies to situations that may be in the best interest of these special education students. In terms of deaf students, deafness is considered a low-incidence disability. This translates to the possibility of one deaf child belonging to a classroom with other “hearing” children<ref>Stinson, M., & Antia, S. (1999). \"Considerations in Educating Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in Inclusive Settings\". Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education. 4 (3): 163–174. doi:10.1093/deafed/4.3.163. <nowiki>PMID 15579885</nowiki></ref> and results in unique barriers. For example, students within the mainstream setting may not know sign language will serve as significant communication barriers for deaf students. These deaf students may use accommodations in their general classroom setting such as a [[ASL interpreting|sign language interpreters]], communication access real-time translation (CART), or a [[Hearing aid|FM system]].

=== Bilingual-Bicultural ===
Deaf children without early access to signed language remain at risk for starting school unprepared for the rigors of academic learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=David|date=2006|title=The young deaf or hard of hearing child: a family-centered approach to early education.

This is where an educational philosophy known as the [[Bilingual-bicultural education|Bilingual-bicultural]] (Bi-Bi) found in [[Deaf education|deaf schools]] can be beneficial for deaf students. Bi-Bi emphasizes that deaf children learn visually and education should be provided through a [[visual language]]. Bi-Bi supporters' argue because of the variability in [[cochlear implant]] and [[hearing aid]] outcomes, sign language access is crucial for preventing deaf and hard-of-hearing children from experiencing language deprivation.

This approach began to emerge in schools during the late 1980s in the United States, Denmark, and Sweden.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Shawn Neal|date=1991|title=The Transition toward Bilingual Education of Deaf Children in Sweden &amp; Denmark: Perspectives on Language|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=1071|issue=1|pages=169–195|doi=10.1353/sls.1991.0023|issn=1533-6263}}</ref> Congruently, in America, the ASL/English Bi- Bi is designed to facilitate academic success and provide education to deaf students by learning [[sign language]], as a first language, followed by a written or spoken language (such as English) as their second language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmeister|first=Robert J.|last2=Caldwell-Harris|first2=Catherine L.|date=August 2014|title=Acquiring English as a second language via print: The task for deaf children|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=132|issue=2|pages=229–242|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.014|pmid=24813574}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=Stephen|date=October 2002|title=Educating deaf students: from research to practice.

== American Deaf Educational Philosophy ==

=== Auditory-Oral ===

=== Mainstream ===
[[Mainstreaming (education)|Mainstream]] education is the philosophy of integrating students requiring special education services into a general education classroom based on their skills. The [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) mandates the specificities of this integration. IDEA protects students who are typically a part of the special education classroom by granting the right to enroll in the general education classroom. This applies to situations that may be in the best interest of these special education students. In terms of deaf students, deafness is considered a low-incidence disability. This translates to the possibility of one deaf child belonging to a classroom with other “hearing” children<ref>Stinson, M., & Antia, S. (1999). \"Considerations in Educating Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in Inclusive Settings\". Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education. 4 (3): 163–174. doi:10.1093/deafed/4.3.163. <nowiki>PMID 15579885</nowiki></ref> and results in unique barriers. For example, students within the mainstream setting may not know sign language will serve as significant communication barriers for deaf students. These deaf students may use accommodations in their general classroom setting such as a [[ASL interpreting|sign language interpreters]], communication access real-time translation (CART), or a [[Hearing aid|FM system]].

=== Bilingual-Bicultural ===
Deaf children without early access to signed language remain at risk for starting school unprepared for the rigors of academic learning.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jones|first=David|date=2006|title=The young deaf or hard of hearing child: a family-centered approach to early education. Edited by Barbara Bodner-Johnson and Marilyn Sass-Lehrer, Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co., Baltimore, 2003, 502pp, ISBN 1 55766 579 6|journal=Deafness & Education International|volume=8|issue=3|pages=170–171|doi=10.1002/dei.186|issn=1464-3154}}</ref> One challenge for deaf children is not having the ability to use their natural language, simultaneously associate it to formal written language,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Padden|first=Carol|last2=Ramsey|first2=Claire|date=August 1998|title=Reading Ability in Signing Deaf Children|journal=Topics in Language Disorders|language=en|volume=18|issue=4|pages=30–46|doi=10.1097/00011363-199808000-00005|issn=0271-8294}}</ref> and blending these two forms of communication when partaking in social interactions. This is where an educational philosophy known as the [[Bilingual-bicultural education|Bilingual-bicultural]] (Bi-Bi) found in [[Deaf education|deaf schools]] can be beneficial for deaf students. Bi-Bi emphasizes that deaf children learn visually and education should be provided through a [[visual language]]. Bi-Bi supporters' argue because of the variability in [[cochlear implant]] and [[hearing aid]] outcomes, sign language access is crucial for preventing deaf and hard-of-hearing children from experiencing language deprivation.

This approach began to emerge in schools during the late 1980s in the United States, Denmark, and Sweden.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Shawn Neal|date=1991|title=The Transition toward Bilingual Education of Deaf Children in Sweden &amp; Denmark: Perspectives on Language|journal=Sign Language Studies|volume=1071|issue=1|pages=169–195|doi=10.1353/sls.1991.0023|issn=1533-6263}}</ref> Congruently, in America, the ASL/English Bi- Bi is designed to facilitate academic success and provide education to deaf students by learning [[sign language]], as a first language, followed by a written or spoken language (such as English) as their second language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmeister|first=Robert J.|last2=Caldwell-Harris|first2=Catherine L.|date=August 2014|title=Acquiring English as a second language via print: The task for deaf children|journal=Cognition|language=en|volume=132|issue=2|pages=229–242|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2014.03.014|pmid=24813574}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Powers|first=Stephen|date=October 2002|title=Educating deaf students: from research to practice.

Therefore, through the Bi-Bi approach, deaf students may master two cultures, both [[Deaf culture]] and hearing culture.

== LEAD-K ==
LEAD-K stands for Language Equality & Acquisition for Deaf Kids. It is a controversial effort<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2017/07/19/fierce-debate-over-sign-language-use-by-some.html|title=Fierce Debate Over Sign-Language Use by Some Deaf Students|journal=Education Week|first=Christina|last=Samuels|date=2017-07-19}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2018}} in the United States intended to increase the number of deaf children who use American Sign Language. The LEAD-K initiative aims to \"end language deprivation\" by promoting American Sign Language, and by putting new laws in place to ensure that deaf and hard of hearing children begin learning both American Sign Language and English before kindergarten enrollment.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lead-k.org|title=Language Equality and Acquisition for Deaf Kids|website=Language Equality and Acquisition for Deaf Kids|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}</ref> The main goal of LEAD-K is to promote a foundation for American Sign Language within deaf and hard of hearing children.

==Fictional character biography==
===Season 1===
{{see also|Stranger Things (season 1)}}
Eleven is the daughter of Teresa \"Terry\" Ives, a participant in the [[Project MKUltra]] experiments conducted by the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Eleven appears to have been born [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]]. However, the use of her abilities temporarily weakens her and causes her [[nosebleeds|nose to bleed]]. At birth, Eleven was taken away from her mother by Dr. Martin Brenner and was raised in the National Laboratory in Hawkins, Indiana as a test subject to develop her [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] skills. When placed in a [[isolation tank|sensory deprivation tank]] she can use [[Remote Viewing|remote viewing]] and access other [[parallel universes in fiction|dimension]]s, primarily for the purposes of international espionage. Eleven encounters a creature living in the Upside Down dimension, and on the evening of November 6, 1983, she finally makes contact with it. In efforts to make contact, Eleven opens a gate between the Hawkins Laboratory and the Upside Down dimension and the creature gains the ability to travel between the human world and the Upside Down.

In the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins Laboratory and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. She and the owner bond, but the owner calls social services. The responding social worker, who turns out to be a Hawkins Laboratory agent, kills the owner. Eleven flees before being taken once again. She is then found by Mike Wheeler ([[Finn Wolfhard]]), Dustin Henderson ([[Gaten Matarazzo]]) and Lucas Sinclair ([[Caleb McLaughlin]]), who are looking for their missing friend, Will Byers ([[Noah Schnapp]]). The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. After learning this, Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short. Mike allows Eleven to live in his basement in a blanket fort. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults so the social workers will not find her.

Eleven helps to locate Will using her supernatural abilities, and determines that he is trapped in the Upside Down. The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes that they are being led towards the laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her (having mistrusted her from the beginning). She flees, steals boxes of frozen waffles from a store, and consumes them in a forest. Mike and Dustin are threatened by bullies where Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a river with Dustin being held hostage but Eleven returns, immediately intervenes before Mike hits the water and saves both Mike and Dustin.

Eleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends. They travel to the town junkyard with Dr. Brenner and his associates in close pursuit. During the chase, Eleven uses her powers to cause a laboratory van to flip through the air. The group is aided by Joyce Byers ([[Winona Ryder]]), Police Chief [[Jim Hopper (character)|Jim Hopper]] ([[David Harbour]]), [[Nancy Wheeler (character)|Nancy Wheeler]] ([[Natalia Dyer]]), and Jonathan Byers ([[Charlie Heaton]]), produce a makeshift isolation tank with a pool and bags of salt. Eleven accesses the Upside Down and confirms that Will is alive. As laboratory personnel close in on the school, Mike tells Eleven she can be a part of his family and asks her to the school dance. He then kisses her after struggling to explain his feelings towards her. Eleven helps the group escape by using her powers to kill most of the agents, although doing so leaves her drained. The monster from the Upside Down makes its way into their dimension, and Eleven seemingly sacrifices herself to destroy the creature and save her friends.

One month later, after a [[Christmas]] party, Hopper leaves the police station and drives to the woods. There, he leaves waffles in a concealed box. The whereabouts or condition of Eleven are left ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |date=July 18, 2016 |title='Stranger Things' Finale: Duffer Brothers Talk Cliffhangers, Death and Season 2 |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-duffer-brothers-interview-season-2-1201816664/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Emily |date=July 29, 2016 |title=On Stranger Things' season finale, promises are made to be broken |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/stranger-things-season-finale-promises-are-made-be-240275 |work=[[The A.V.

===Season 2===
{{see also|Stranger Things (season 2)}}
After defeating the Demogorgon, Eleven wakes up in the Upside Down dimension. She escapes through a portal, leading her back to the school. With the government still searching for her, she is forced to hide in the forest. Eleven eventually finds the [[Eggos]] Hopper left for her and seeks him out. The two move into a cabin in the woods where he forbids her to leave, fearing for her safety. Hopper hides Eleven indoors for almost a year, telling no one of her whereabouts, not even Mike. During this time, Eleven gains better control over her powers; she is less weakened by the use of her telekinesis, and she is now able to project her mind without the use of a sensory deprivation tank. She uses the latter ability to listen to Mike's attempts to contact her, though she is increasingly frustrated at her inability to reply. Eleven also significantly expands her vocabulary during this time, learning from both Hopper and television.

Eleven becomes restless and longs to reunite with Mike, and this causes tension between her and Hopper. She runs away from home one day and travels to Hawkins Middle School. When she finds Mike, he is with Max, a new student. Eleven mistakenly thinks Max is flirting with Mike and, out of spite, uses her powers to knock her off of her skateboard before leaving. Upon returning to the cabin, she gets into a heated argument with Hopper over her leaving the cabin, ending with her using her powers to damage the cabin out of anger. The next day, cleaning the mess she made of the cabin, she discovers by looking through records in the cabin's basement her birth mother is alive, a contradiction to what Hopper had told her. She then goes to meet her birth mother, Terry, and her aunt, Becky, and discovers what happened to Terry at Hawkins Laboratory. While there, she realizes Terry is trying to talk with her, but due to her catatonic state, is unable to. Eleven, using her powers, views a flashback from her mother. Terry, after her daughter was taken from her, attempted to force her way into Hawkins Lab to save her. As a response, Brenner and his assistants captured her and subjected her to electroshock therapy, resulting in her current condition. Eleven then uses her abilities to find out she has a \"sister\"{{spaced endash}}another gifted girl taken by Dr. Brenner for experimentations{{spaced endash}}and sets out to find her.

Using her abilities once again, Eleven locates her sister and discovers that she is an older girl named Kali (\"Eight\"), with the ability to cause people to have visual hallucinations. Eleven stays with Kali and her friends{{spaced endash}}runaways who are determined to take revenge on people who have hurt them. Kali tells Eleven that while using her powers, she needs to think about what makes her most angry. When they go to get revenge on Brenner's assistant who helped hurt Eleven's mother, Eleven begins to choke him to death but stops upon realizing that he has two daughters. She then stops Kali from shooting him. Back at the hideout, Eleven witnesses Hopper and Mike in danger through the void. While the gang are about to flee, Eleven realizes she needs to go back to her friends because they need her help.

Eleven goes back to Hawkins and finally reunites with Mike with a heartfelt embrace and her friends after saving them from a Demodog. The group realizes that she needs to close the gate to the Upside Down, and she and Hopper head to Hawkins Laboratory. There, Eleven uses Kali's advice and focuses her anger into her powers, closing the gate and draining her powers. Afterward, it is discovered that Dr. Owens has forged a birth certificate allowing for Hopper to become her legal adoptive father as a way to help keep Eleven in hiding. Eleven's new legal name is Jane Hopper. Hopper lets her attend the Snow Ball at Hawkins Middle School. She meets up with Mike, dances with him, and they share their first kiss as a couple.

===Season 3===
{{see also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}
At the start of season three, Eleven and Mike have been dating for seven months, much to the dismay of Hopper, who is annoyed that El and Mike are constantly together, spending all of their time alone kissing. When Hopper confesses to Joyce that he feels uncomfortable about the situation, she asserts that he should sit down and calmly talk to El and Mike about how he feels. This backfires, however, and Hopper resorts to verbally threatening Mike to stay away from Eleven, or he will end their relationship. When Mike is forced to lie to Eleven about why he can no longer visit her, she becomes suspicious and seeks advice from Max, who asserts that Mike is pushing her aside to spend time playing games with the boys, and suggests that they have some fun of their own by going shopping at the new Starcourt mall. The girls spend quality time together, shopping, where they encounter Lucas, Will and Mike, who are attempting to buy Eleven a makeup present. When Mike lies and says the present is for his sick grandmother, Eleven angrily breaks up with him and leaves on a bus with Max, where the girls spend the night sleeping over at Hopper's house and use Eleven's telepathic powers to spy on the boys. This leads to a game they create in which they spin a bottle and spy on whoever it lands on. Eleven spies on Billy and it appears he has kidnapped someone, so the girls go to look for him and discover a fellow lifeguard has also gone missing. They discover that Billy has been taken over by the Mind Flayer. They reunite with Mike, Lucas, and Will. Mike is annoyed that El would spy on him and has an argument with Max about his feelings for Eleven while she is spying on the Flayed. She holds off the Mind Flayer when the cabin is attacked, but the Flayer wounds her and leaves a piece of itself in the wound. El and Mike make up, but the Flayer and Billy track them due to the wound. Eleven loses her powers, but the group defeat the Mind Flayer by closing the portal to the Upside Down. Hopper is presumed dead in the explosion that closes the gate and Eleven is taken in by the Byers. While the Byers are packing to leave Hawkins, El reveals to Mike that she loves him too and they share a kiss. Joyce gives her a letter written by Hopper that he intended to use when talking to her and Mike about how he felt about them dating. Eleven and the Byers then leave Hawkins.

== Development ==

=== Conception and writing ===
[[The Duffer Brothers]] originally based the character of Eleven on survivors of the [[Project MKUltra]] experiments, with influences from ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' and the idea of being an outsider. They also drew inspiration from the [[anime]]s ''[[Elfen Lied]]'' and ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'',<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/07/16/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-2/|title='Stranger Things': The Duffer Brothers explain how they found Eleven|work=EW.com|access-date=November 4, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> saying they \"wanted there to be a mystery in her past, and also have her seem a little scary.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/stranger-things-creators-explain-it-all-about-season-1/|title=’Stranger Things’ creators explain it all about season 1|date=July 27, 2016 |work=UPROXX |access-date=November 4, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref> Originally, ''Stranger Things'' was pitched as a [[miniseries|limited series]], and it was planned that Eleven would sacrifice herself in the last episode of the series. However, [[Netflix]] were keen for the show to be continued in a second season, and so the brothers decided to keep the character alive.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/stranger-things-almost-killed-off-eleven-in-season-one-1820226957|title=Stranger Things almost killed off Eleven in season 1, but not for a stupid reason|last=McLevy|first=Alex |date=November 8, 2017 |work=The A.V. Club|access-date=November 4, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Casting ===
Of all the roles on the show, the brothers felt it was most difficult to cast Eleven. As the character had few lines, they wanted a child actor that was able to convey lots of emotion. The Duffers were concerned that they would not be able to find anyone who could stay in character in scenes where they were not talking. However, the brothers were relieved after meeting [[Millie Bobby Brown]], who they described as \"something special, alright, with a downright spooky preternatural talent.\" Brown had to shave her head for the role. Initially she and her parents were worried about this, although after she was shown a photo of [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Imperator Furiosa]] she agreed to getting her hair cut.<ref name=\":0\" />

==Reception==
The character and Brown's performance have received critical acclaim; Alice Vincent of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that \"[[Millie Bobby Brown]] continues to be the star of the show: she has inspired fan art and tattoos, a worldwide acknowledgment of [[Eggo]]s, the waffles her character devours and given a whole new life to the phrase 'mouth breather'\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Vincent |first=Alice |date=September 24, 2016 |title=Eleven out of 10: how Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown charmed the world |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/2016/09/24/eleven-out-of-10-how-stranger-things-star-millie-bobby-brown-cha/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> Ashley Hoffman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine recommended Eleven as a mascot for [[Waffle Day|National Waffle Day]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Ashley |date=August 24, 2016 |title=Why Eleven From Stranger Things Is the Perfect National Waffle Day Mascot |url=http://time.com/4464257/national-waffle-day-stranger-things-eggo/ |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> However, Lenika Cruz of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' stated that \"despite a rich backstory, Eleven is the show's most thinly sketched protagonist\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cruz |first=Lenika |date=July 26, 2016 |title=Where Stranger Things Loses Its Magic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/stranger-things-netflix/491681/ |work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref>

At the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards|69th]] and [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2017 and 2018, Brown received a nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].

She won [[Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series|Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series]] at the [[43rd Saturn Awards]]. She was twice nominated for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series]] in 2017 and 2018.

In the first season, Eleven escapes from Hawkins Laboratory and attempts to steal food from a local restaurant. She and the owner bond, but the owner calls social services. The responding social worker, who turns out to be a Hawkins Laboratory agent, kills the owner. Eleven flees before being taken once again. She is then found by Mike Wheeler ([[Finn Wolfhard]]), Dustin Henderson ([[Gaten Matarazzo]]) and Lucas Sinclair ([[Caleb McLaughlin]]), who are looking for their missing friend, Will Byers ([[Noah Schnapp]]). The boys learn that her name is Eleven based on a \"011\" tattoo found on her left forearm. After learning this, Mike decides to call her \"El\" for short. Mike allows Eleven to live in his basement in a blanket fort. Fearing recapture, Eleven convinces Mike not to tell any adults so the social workers will not find her.

Eleven helps to locate Will using her supernatural abilities, and determines that he is trapped in the Upside Down. The group sets out to find Will using their compasses, but Eleven interferes with their search when she realizes that they are being led towards the laboratory. Lucas, noticing her deception, becomes angry at her (having mistrusted her from the beginning). She flees, steals boxes of frozen waffles from a store, and consumes them in a forest. Mike and Dustin are threatened by bullies where Mike is forced to jump off a high cliff into a river with Dustin being held hostage but Eleven returns, immediately intervenes before Mike hits the water and saves both Mike and Dustin.

Eleven, Mike, and Dustin reunite with Lucas and make amends. They travel to the town junkyard with Dr. Brenner and his associates in close pursuit. During the chase, Eleven uses her powers to cause a laboratory van to flip through the air. The group is aided by Joyce Byers ([[Winona Ryder]]), Police Chief [[Jim Hopper (character)|Jim Hopper]] ([[David Harbour]]), [[Nancy Wheeler (character)|Nancy Wheeler]] ([[Natalia Dyer]]), and Jonathan Byers ([[Charlie Heaton]]), produce a makeshift isolation tank with a pool and bags of salt. Eleven accesses the Upside Down and confirms that Will is alive. As laboratory personnel close in on the school, Mike tells Eleven she can be a part of his family and asks her to the school dance. He then kisses her after struggling to explain his feelings towards her. Eleven helps the group escape by using her powers to kill most of the agents, although doing so leaves her drained. The monster from the Upside Down makes its way into their dimension, and Eleven seemingly sacrifices herself to destroy the creature and save her friends.

One month later, after a [[Christmas]] party, Hopper leaves the police station and drives to the woods. There, he leaves waffles in a concealed box. The whereabouts or condition of Eleven are left ambiguous.<ref>{{cite news |last=Berkshire |first=Geoff |date=July 18, 2016 |title='Stranger Things' Finale: Duffer Brothers Talk Cliffhangers, Death and Season 2 |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-duffer-brothers-interview-season-2-1201816664/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Stephens |first=Emily |date=July 29, 2016 |title=On Stranger Things' season finale, promises are made to be broken |url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/stranger-things-season-finale-promises-are-made-be-240275 |work=[[The A.V.

===Season 2===
{{see also|Stranger Things (season 2)}}
After defeating the Demogorgon, Eleven wakes up in the Upside Down dimension. She escapes through a portal, leading her back to the school. With the government still searching for her, she is forced to hide in the forest. Eleven eventually finds the [[Eggos]] Hopper left for her and seeks him out. The two move into a cabin in the woods where he forbids her to leave, fearing for her safety. Hopper hides Eleven indoors for almost a year, telling no one of her whereabouts, not even Mike. During this time, Eleven gains better control over her powers; she is less weakened by the use of her telekinesis, and she is now able to project her mind without the use of a sensory deprivation tank. She uses the latter ability to listen to Mike's attempts to contact her, though she is increasingly frustrated at her inability to reply. Eleven also significantly expands her vocabulary during this time, learning from both Hopper and television.

Eleven becomes restless and longs to reunite with Mike, and this causes tension between her and Hopper. She runs away from home one day and travels to Hawkins Middle School. When she finds Mike, he is with Max, a new student. Eleven mistakenly thinks Max is flirting with Mike and, out of spite, uses her powers to knock her off of her skateboard before leaving. Upon returning to the cabin, she gets into a heated argument with Hopper over her leaving the cabin, ending with her using her powers to damage the cabin out of anger. The next day, cleaning the mess she made of the cabin, she discovers by looking through records in the cabin's basement her birth mother is alive, a contradiction to what Hopper had told her. She then goes to meet her birth mother, Terry, and her aunt, Becky, and discovers what happened to Terry at Hawkins Laboratory. While there, she realizes Terry is trying to talk with her, but due to her catatonic state, is unable to. Eleven, using her powers, views a flashback from her mother. Terry, after her daughter was taken from her, attempted to force her way into Hawkins Lab to save her. As a response, Brenner and his assistants captured her and subjected her to electroshock therapy, resulting in her current condition. Eleven then uses her abilities to find out she has a \"sister\"{{spaced endash}}another gifted girl taken by Dr. Brenner for experimentations{{spaced endash}}and sets out to find her.

Using her abilities once again, Eleven locates her sister and discovers that she is an older girl named Kali (\"Eight\"), with the ability to cause people to have visual hallucinations. Eleven stays with Kali and her friends{{spaced endash}}runaways who are determined to take revenge on people who have hurt them. Kali tells Eleven that while using her powers, she needs to think about what makes her most angry. When they go to get revenge on Brenner's assistant who helped hurt Eleven's mother, Eleven begins to choke him to death but stops upon realizing that he has two daughters. She then stops Kali from shooting him. Back at the hideout, Eleven witnesses Hopper and Mike in danger through the void. While the gang are about to flee, Eleven realizes she needs to go back to her friends because they need her help.

Eleven goes back to Hawkins and finally reunites with Mike with a heartfelt embrace and her friends after saving them from a Demodog. The group realizes that she needs to close the gate to the Upside Down, and she and Hopper head to Hawkins Laboratory. There, Eleven uses Kali's advice and focuses her anger into her powers, closing the gate and draining her powers. Afterward, it is discovered that Dr. Owens has forged a birth certificate allowing for Hopper to become her legal adoptive father as a way to help keep Eleven in hiding. Eleven's new legal name is Jane Hopper. Hopper lets her attend the Snow Ball at Hawkins Middle School. She meets up with Mike, dances with him, and they share their first kiss as a couple.

===Season 3===
{{see also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}
At the start of season three, Eleven and Mike have been dating for seven months, much to the dismay of Hopper, who is annoyed that El and Mike are constantly together, spending all of their time alone kissing. When Hopper confesses to Joyce that he feels uncomfortable about the situation, she asserts that he should sit down and calmly talk to El and Mike about how he feels. This backfires, however, and Hopper resorts to verbally threatening Mike to stay away from Eleven, or he will end their relationship. When Mike is forced to lie to Eleven about why he can no longer visit her, she becomes suspicious and seeks advice from Max, who asserts that Mike is pushing her aside to spend time playing games with the boys, and suggests that they have some fun of their own by going shopping at the new Starcourt mall. The girls spend quality time together, shopping, where they encounter Lucas, Will and Mike, who are attempting to buy Eleven a makeup present. When Mike lies and says the present is for his sick grandmother, Eleven angrily breaks up with him and leaves on a bus with Max, where the girls spend the night sleeping over at Hopper's house and use Eleven's telepathic powers to spy on the boys. This leads to a game they create in which they spin a bottle and spy on whoever it lands on. Eleven spies on Billy and it appears he has kidnapped someone, so the girls go to look for him and discover a fellow lifeguard has also gone missing. They discover that Billy has been taken over by the Mind Flayer. They reunite with Mike, Lucas, and Will. Mike is annoyed that El would spy on him and has an argument with Max about his feelings for Eleven while she is spying on the Flayed. She holds off the Mind Flayer when the cabin is attacked, but the Flayer wounds her and leaves a piece of itself in the wound. El and Mike make up, but the Flayer and Billy track them due to the wound. Eleven loses her powers, but the group defeat the Mind Flayer by closing the portal to the Upside Down. Hopper is presumed dead in the explosion that closes the gate and Eleven is taken in by the Byers. While the Byers are packing to leave Hawkins, El reveals to Mike that she loves him too and they share a kiss. Joyce gives her a letter written by Hopper that he intended to use when talking to her and Mike about how he felt about them dating. Eleven and the Byers then leave Hawkins.

== Development ==

=== Conception and writing ===
[[The Duffer Brothers]] originally based the character of Eleven on survivors of the [[Project MKUltra]] experiments, with influences from ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial|E.T.]]'' and the idea of being an outsider. They also drew inspiration from the [[anime]]s ''[[Elfen Lied]]'' and ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'',<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2016/07/16/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-2/|title='Stranger Things': The Duffer Brothers explain how they found Eleven|work=EW.com|access-date=November 4, 2018 |language=en}}</ref> saying they \"wanted there to be a mystery in her past, and also have her seem a little scary.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/stranger-things-creators-explain-it-all-about-season-1/|title=’Stranger Things’ creators explain it all about season 1|date=July 27, 2016 |work=UPROXX |access-date=November 4, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref> Originally, ''Stranger Things'' was pitched as a [[miniseries|limited series]], and it was planned that Eleven would sacrifice herself in the last episode of the series. However, [[Netflix]] were keen for the show to be continued in a second season, and so the brothers decided to keep the character alive.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.avclub.com/stranger-things-almost-killed-off-eleven-in-season-one-1820226957|title=Stranger Things almost killed off Eleven in season 1, but not for a stupid reason|last=McLevy|first=Alex |date=November 8, 2017 |work=The A.V. Club|access-date=November 4, 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Casting ===
Of all the roles on the show, the brothers felt it was most difficult to cast Eleven. As the character had few lines, they wanted a child actor that was able to convey lots of emotion. The Duffers were concerned that they would not be able to find anyone who could stay in character in scenes where they were not talking. However, the brothers were relieved after meeting [[Millie Bobby Brown]], who they described as \"something special, alright, with a downright spooky preternatural talent.\" Brown had to shave her head for the role. Initially she and her parents were worried about this, although after she was shown a photo of [[Charlize Theron]] as [[Imperator Furiosa]] she agreed to getting her hair cut.<ref name=\":0\" />

==Reception==
The character and Brown's performance have received critical acclaim; Alice Vincent of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that \"[[Millie Bobby Brown]] continues to be the star of the show: she has inspired fan art and tattoos, a worldwide acknowledgment of [[Eggo]]s, the waffles her character devours and given a whole new life to the phrase 'mouth breather'\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Vincent |first=Alice |date=September 24, 2016 |title=Eleven out of 10: how Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown charmed the world |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/2016/09/24/eleven-out-of-10-how-stranger-things-star-millie-bobby-brown-cha/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> Ashley Hoffman of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine recommended Eleven as a mascot for [[Waffle Day|National Waffle Day]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Hoffman |first=Ashley |date=August 24, 2016 |title=Why Eleven From Stranger Things Is the Perfect National Waffle Day Mascot |url=http://time.com/4464257/national-waffle-day-stranger-things-eggo/ |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref> However, Lenika Cruz of ''[[The Atlantic]]'' stated that \"despite a rich backstory, Eleven is the show's most thinly sketched protagonist\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cruz |first=Lenika |date=July 26, 2016 |title=Where Stranger Things Loses Its Magic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/07/stranger-things-netflix/491681/ |work=[[The Atlantic]]|access-date=October 16, 2016}}</ref>

At the [[69th Primetime Emmy Awards|69th]] and [[70th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2017 and 2018, Brown received a nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series]].

She won [[Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series|Best Performance by a Younger Actor in a Television Series]] at the [[43rd Saturn Awards]]. She was twice nominated for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series]] in 2017 and 2018.

'''''The Man Who Could Cheat Death''''' is a 1959 British [[horror film|horror]] film, directed by [[Terence Fisher]] and starring [[Anton Diffring]], [[Hazel Court]] and [[Christopher Lee]]. [[Jimmy Sangster]] adapted the screenplay from the play ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' by [[Barré Lyndon]], which had been [[The Man in Half Moon Street|previously filmed in 1945]]. ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was produced by [[Michael Carreras]] and [[Anthony Nelson Keys]] for [[Hammer Film Productions]]. It was released in the US on 19 August 1959 and in the UK on 30 November 1959.

== Plot ==

Paris, 1890. Dr Georges Bonnet (Diffring), MD and sculptor, harbours an unusual secret. Although he appears to be in his mid-30s, he is actually 104-years-old, and has kept his youth and vitality through [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] gland transplants every 10 years. But things are going wrong. Prof Ludwig Weiss ([[Arnold Marlé]]) of Vienna, co-discoverer of the anti-ageing process, is three weeks late in arriving at Georges' home to perform the latest transplant. As such, Georges must drink a steaming green liquid to stay young. When Georges' latest model, Margo Philippe ([[Delphi Lawrence]]), comes across Georges swilling the fluid, he strikes her down. 

Georges has invited a number of people to a reception at which he will unveil his bust of Margo, including Janine Dubois (Court), his former lover, and Dr Pierre Girard (Lee), Janine's current companion. When the 89-year-old Ludwig later arrives, it is quite apparent he will be unable to operate on Georges because a stroke has incapacitated his right hand. Ludwig tells Georges they must find another surgeon.

Georges and Ludwig invite Janine and Pierre to dinner. In private, Ludwig convinces Pierre to perform the transplant. However, Janine is still in love with Georges, and when he mysteriously says he must soon leave Paris so he can 'lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond', Janine asks to accompany him. As the dinner party ends, [[National Police (France)|Surété]] Inspector LeGris ([[Francis de Wolff|Francis De Wolff]]) arrives. He is investigating Margo's disappearance. Georges denies knowing her whereabouts and, when LeGris asks to see the bust of Margo, he tells him that he accidentally destroyed it. LeGris leaves and Georges admits to his startled guests that he lied but says the police would probably damage the bust if he turned it over to them.

After Janine and Pierre have left, Ludwig tells Georges that Pierre will operate. But Ludwig has grown suspicious of Georges and says it is strange that Georges' models have gone missing right after Georges' transplants. Ludwig also tells him that after examining the newest parathyroid gland, he can tell Georges has harvested it from a living person, instead of it being 'revitalised' from a corpse. When Ludwig tells him that his actions are unjustified, Georges says sadly that he's done what he's done because he has been left 'utterly alone - again and again' and is tired of having to start a new life every decade. Georges horrifies Ludwig by saying he wants to end his loneliness by having Janine with him forever. The men argue violently, and Georges strangles Ludwig to death.

Pierre arrives the following morning to perform the operation, but Georges tells him that Ludwig was unexpectedly called back to Vienna. Pierre refuses to carry on and suggests that Georges find another surgeon. But Georges can find no one who is willing or able,

LeGris tells Pierre of the disappearances of three young women at 10 year intervals - in London, San Francisco and Bern, Switzerland - and that each modelled for a sculptor who was an MD and who went missing at the same time. With Margo also missing, LeGris believes Georges is responsible for all the disappearances.

Georges takes Janine to a storeroom which holds his sculptures. He proudly shows her the first figurine he made as a boy. The figurine is dated 1798.  Janine laughingly says the date must be incorrect because if it weren't, Georges would be 104. Georges abruptly leaves, locking Janine in the storeroom.

Georges tells Pierre that he and Ludwig discovered the secret of 'perpetual life' decades earlier. But he can't reveal the secret to the world because if everyone could live forever, paradoxically, everyone would die as there would be no supply of parathyroid glands to keep them alive. Pierre again refuses to perform the transplant, calling it 'an offence against nature [and] and offence against God'. But he relents when Georges threatens Janine's life.

Janine finds a now-mad Margo imprisoned in the storeroom. Meanwhile, Pierre fakes the operation - making the incision at Georges' waist but not transplanting the gland. Georges rushes to the storeroom, and as Pierre and LeGris follow, Georges tells Janine that the same operation will allow her to live forever, always young and beautiful and in love. She refuses.

Suddenly, Georges begins ageing rapidly and realises that Pierre didn't actually perform the operation. As he exclaims he's dying, Margo, laughing dementedly, throws an oil lamp on him, setting him and the storeroom afire. Pierre and LeGris rescue Janine. Georges and Margo die in the flames.

== Production ==
The lead role of Bonnet was originally offered to [[Peter Cushing]], who turned it down six days before shooting started. Cushing's reason was that he was completely exhausted 'following the shooting of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (1959), which had just wrapped up'. The loss of Cushing caused Hammer to threaten legal action against him.

== Reception ==

''The'' ''Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films'' calls the film an \"odd mish-mash of mad scientist sci-fi flick and gothic flannel\" that \"suffers from an excess of dialogue and a lack of action.\"{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=41}} 

This assessment is reflected in other contemporary reviews. Film scholar Chris Fellner quotes several: the 20 June 1959 issue of ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' says that the movie's 'chief drawback' is 'that it is given more to talk than to movement'; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<nowiki/>'s issue of 24 June 1959 calls it 'well acted and intelligently conceived. But invention and embellishment in this field appear to have been exhausted'; and the ''[[Motion Picture Exhibitor]]'' issue of 1 July 1959 describes ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' as suffering from 'relying mainly on talk'.<ref name=\":1\" />

The film is referred to by journalist Howard Maxford as a 'commercial and artistic disaster' and a 'bog standard surgical thriller' that is 'by no means a Hammer classic'. He calls Terence Fisher's direction 'curiously unambitious', characterised by 'many scenes filmed in lengthy, static takes, almost as if from the stalls of a theatre'. Maxford also dislikes the 'Bright, bland lighting' and 'garish Technicolor film stock' which together 'make for some visually tedious and unattractive images'.<ref name=\":0\" />

On the other hand, film scholar Phil Hardy writes that visually the film 'looks like one of Hammer's more lavish productions', although it is a 'minor item' in Fisher's work. He describes the movie as having a 'perfunctory script', which makes it a 'rather awkward variation on the [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]] motif'.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Hardy, ed.|first=Phil|title=The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies|publisher=Harper & Row, Publishers|year=1986|isbn=0060550503|location=NY|pages=115}}</ref>

In the 'Hazel Court' chapter of ''Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors'', author Calvin Thomas Beck praises the performances of the three main actors. He writes that Diffring shows 'unique and excellent villainy' and is a 'magnificent heavy who has been shamefully neglected by filmmakers'. Court, he writes, is a 'fine, striking actress at all times' who 'screams and cringes properly' during the movie. He calls ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' one of her 'finest British thrillers'. Beck also notes that Lee 'unexpectedly reversed his monster-villain image' in the film.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Calvin Thomas|title=Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co. Inc.|year=1978|isbn=0025081705|location=NY|pages=280-281}}</ref>

Author 'Bobb' Carter agrees with Beck's view of Court's performance. Carter calls it 'on the whole (...) a solid, impassioned performance that makes it a shame that this was her last role for Hammer', even though her character, Janine, has the 'distressing trait of not being able to smell something fishy even if there was a whale in the room'.<ref name=\":3\" />

Other critics disagree about the quality of the acting in the film. Maxford calls Diffring's performance 'cold-eyed' and suggests that 'audiences were more used to seeing [him] playing ruthless Nazis',<ref name=\":0\" /> while Hardy says that 'Lee simply walks through his part'.<ref name=\":4\" />

== Novelisation ==
The screenplay of ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was rewritten as an inexpensive paperback novel in 1959. It was published in the US by [[Avon Books]] and sold for 35¢, with the authors named as 'Barre' Lyndon and Jimmy Sangster. In the UK, where the book sold for 2/6, [[Ace Books]] listed the author as John Sansom, the pen name of Sangster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abebooks.com/first-edition/Man-Who-Could-Cheat-Death-Lyndon-Barre/10079019346/bd#&grid=1&pid=1|title=The Man Who Could Cheat Death|last=|first=|date=|website=Abe Books|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

'''''The Man Who Could Cheat Death''''' is a 1959 British [[horror film|horror]] film, directed by [[Terence Fisher]] and starring [[Anton Diffring]], [[Hazel Court]] and [[Christopher Lee]]. [[Jimmy Sangster]] adapted the screenplay from the play ''[[The Man in Half Moon Street (play)|The Man in Half Moon Street]]'' by [[Barré Lyndon]], which had been [[The Man in Half Moon Street|previously filmed in 1945]]. ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was produced by [[Michael Carreras]] and [[Anthony Nelson Keys]] for [[Hammer Film Productions]]. It was released in the US on 19 August 1959 and in the UK on 30 November 1959.

== Plot ==

Paris, 1890. Dr Georges Bonnet (Diffring), MD and sculptor, harbours an unusual secret. Although he appears to be in his mid-30s, he is actually 104-years-old, and has kept his youth and vitality through [[Parathyroid gland|parathyroid]] gland transplants every 10 years. But things are going wrong. Prof Ludwig Weiss ([[Arnold Marlé]]) of Vienna, co-discoverer of the anti-ageing process, is three weeks late in arriving at Georges' home to perform the latest transplant. As such, Georges must drink a steaming green liquid to stay young. When Georges' latest model, Margo Philippe ([[Delphi Lawrence]]), comes across Georges swilling the fluid, he strikes her down. 

Georges has invited a number of people to a reception at which he will unveil his bust of Margo, including Janine Dubois (Court), his former lover, and Dr Pierre Girard (Lee), Janine's current companion. When the 89-year-old Ludwig later arrives, it is quite apparent he will be unable to operate on Georges because a stroke has incapacitated his right hand. Ludwig tells Georges they must find another surgeon.

Georges and Ludwig invite Janine and Pierre to dinner. In private, Ludwig convinces Pierre to perform the transplant. However, Janine is still in love with Georges, and when he mysteriously says he must soon leave Paris so he can 'lift the curtain of life and see what lies beyond', Janine asks to accompany him. As the dinner party ends, [[National Police (France)|Surété]] Inspector LeGris ([[Francis de Wolff|Francis De Wolff]]) arrives. He is investigating Margo's disappearance. Georges denies knowing her whereabouts and, when LeGris asks to see the bust of Margo, he tells him that he accidentally destroyed it. LeGris leaves and Georges admits to his startled guests that he lied but says the police would probably damage the bust if he turned it over to them.

After Janine and Pierre have left, Ludwig tells Georges that Pierre will operate. But Ludwig has grown suspicious of Georges and says it is strange that Georges' models have gone missing right after Georges' transplants. Ludwig also tells him that after examining the newest parathyroid gland, he can tell Georges has harvested it from a living person, instead of it being 'revitalised' from a corpse. When Ludwig tells him that his actions are unjustified, Georges says sadly that he's done what he's done because he has been left 'utterly alone - again and again' and is tired of having to start a new life every decade. Georges horrifies Ludwig by saying he wants to end his loneliness by having Janine with him forever. The men argue violently, and Georges strangles Ludwig to death.

Pierre arrives the following morning to perform the operation, but Georges tells him that Ludwig was unexpectedly called back to Vienna. Pierre refuses to carry on and suggests that Georges find another surgeon. But Georges can find no one who is willing or able,

LeGris tells Pierre of the disappearances of three young women at 10 year intervals - in London, San Francisco and Bern, Switzerland - and that each modelled for a sculptor who was an MD and who went missing at the same time. With Margo also missing, LeGris believes Georges is responsible for all the disappearances.

Georges takes Janine to a storeroom which holds his sculptures. He proudly shows her the first figurine he made as a boy. The figurine is dated 1798.  Janine laughingly says the date must be incorrect because if it weren't, Georges would be 104. Georges abruptly leaves, locking Janine in the storeroom.

Georges tells Pierre that he and Ludwig discovered the secret of 'perpetual life' decades earlier. But he can't reveal the secret to the world because if everyone could live forever, paradoxically, everyone would die as there would be no supply of parathyroid glands to keep them alive. Pierre again refuses to perform the transplant, calling it 'an offence against nature [and] and offence against God'. But he relents when Georges threatens Janine's life.

Janine finds a now-mad Margo imprisoned in the storeroom. Meanwhile, Pierre fakes the operation - making the incision at Georges' waist but not transplanting the gland. Georges rushes to the storeroom, and as Pierre and LeGris follow, Georges tells Janine that the same operation will allow her to live forever, always young and beautiful and in love. She refuses.

Suddenly, Georges begins ageing rapidly and realises that Pierre didn't actually perform the operation. As he exclaims he's dying, Margo, laughing dementedly, throws an oil lamp on him, setting him and the storeroom afire. Pierre and LeGris rescue Janine. Georges and Margo die in the flames.

== Production ==
The lead role of Bonnet was originally offered to [[Peter Cushing]], who turned it down six days before shooting started. Cushing's reason was that he was completely exhausted 'following the shooting of ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959 film)|The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' (1959), which had just wrapped up'. The loss of Cushing caused Hammer to threaten legal action against him.

Filming of ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' took place between 17 November and 30 December 1958 at [[Bray Studios (UK)|Bray Studios]]. Its working title was ''The Man in the Rue Noire''.<ref name=\":1\" />

The European release of the film featured a scene in which Court appeared topless.{{sfn|Hallenbeck|2011|p=104}} She was paid 'an extra £2000 ($5,600 in 1959 dollars)' for the scene, in which she is posing for a sculpture made by Diffring's character.

''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was granted an X-certificate by the [[British Board of Film Classification|BBFC]] on 8 April 1959. The X-cert meant that the film could only be exhibited to people age 16 or older. The film was cut in order to get the certificate, which allowed it to be shown in the UK, but the details of what or how much was cut are unknown.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/man-who-could-cheat-death-1959|title=The Man Who Could Cheat Death (1959)|last=|first=|date=|website=British Board of Film Classification|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19 March 2020}}</ref>

== Distribution ==
''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' was distributed in the UK and the US by Paramount.<ref name=\":0\" /> The film was first screened at the London Trade Show on 5 June 1959.

== Reception ==

''The'' ''Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films'' calls the film an \"odd mish-mash of mad scientist sci-fi flick and gothic flannel\" that \"suffers from an excess of dialogue and a lack of action.\"{{sfn|Hearn|Barnes|2007|p=41}} 

This assessment is reflected in other contemporary reviews. Film scholar Chris Fellner quotes several: the 20 June 1959 issue of ''[[Harrison's Reports]]'' says that the movie's 'chief drawback' is 'that it is given more to talk than to movement'; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''<nowiki/>'s issue of 24 June 1959 calls it 'well acted and intelligently conceived. But invention and embellishment in this field appear to have been exhausted'; and the ''[[Motion Picture Exhibitor]]'' issue of 1 July 1959 describes ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' as suffering from 'relying mainly on talk'.<ref name=\":1\" />

The film is referred to by journalist Howard Maxford as a 'commercial and artistic disaster' and a 'bog standard surgical thriller' that is 'by no means a Hammer classic'. He calls Terence Fisher's direction 'curiously unambitious', characterised by 'many scenes filmed in lengthy, static takes, almost as if from the stalls of a theatre'. Maxford also dislikes the 'Bright, bland lighting' and 'garish Technicolor film stock' which together 'make for some visually tedious and unattractive images'.<ref name=\":0\" />

On the other hand, film scholar Phil Hardy writes that visually the film 'looks like one of Hammer's more lavish productions', although it is a 'minor item' in Fisher's work. He describes the movie as having a 'perfunctory script', which makes it a 'rather awkward variation on the [[Dorian Gray (character)|Dorian Gray]] motif'.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Hardy, ed.|first=Phil|title=The Encyclopedia of Horror Movies|publisher=Harper & Row, Publishers|year=1986|isbn=0060550503|location=NY|pages=115}}</ref>

In the 'Hazel Court' chapter of ''Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors'', author Calvin Thomas Beck praises the performances of the three main actors. He writes that Diffring shows 'unique and excellent villainy' and is a 'magnificent heavy who has been shamefully neglected by filmmakers'. Court, he writes, is a 'fine, striking actress at all times' who 'screams and cringes properly' during the movie. He calls ''The Man Who Could Cheat Death'' one of her 'finest British thrillers'. Beck also notes that Lee 'unexpectedly reversed his monster-villain image' in the film.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beck|first=Calvin Thomas|title=Scream Queens: Heroines of the Horrors|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Co.

=== Philippine Revolution ===
{{Main|Philippine Revolution}}
The [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spain began in August, 1896. Just 3 months after the birth of [[Gabriel Daza]], his first son, Daza left Borongan for [[Catbalogan]] and joined the [[Katipunan|Katipunan (Revolutionaries)]] as an infantry officer. 

In 1898, the [[Spanish–American War|Spanish-American War]] overwhelmed Spain, allowing the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] to push out Spain and reconquer all but Manila, which was occupied by the Americans. Having defeated Spain, [[Emilio Aguinaldo|Aguinaldo]] issued the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence]]. However, 6 months later in the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]], Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States. After 2 months, the [[Philippine–American War|Philippine-American War]] began.

=== Philippine-American War ===

In the Philippine-American War, Daza held the rank of infantry Captain. General Lukbán gave him command of his home region of Southeastern Samar.

The '''Battle of Burton Bridge''' was fought between Royalist and Parliamentarian forces at [[Burton upon Trent]] on 4 July 1643 during the [[First English Civil War]].  By the time of the battle the town, which had at various times been held by both sides, was garrisoned by a Parliamentarian unit under the command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the town's military governor, Colonel Richard Houghton.  The key river crossing at Burton was desired by Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who was proceeding southwards from Yorkshire with a convoy of supplies destined for King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at Oxford.  The Royalists, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], launched a cavalry charge across the bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their officers, including Sanders and Houghton.  The Queen's convoy proceeded on its way south to Oxford with Tyldesley receiving a knighthood and a promotion in recognition of his victory.  Burton changed hands several more times during the course of the war, before finally coming into Parliament's control in 1646.

== Background ==
The county of Staffordshire, several days travel from the main seat of power in London, had a long-standing disinclination to paying taxes and levies imposed by the King.  [[James I]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was forced to write to the county's [[Justices of the Peace]] for their failure to raise a single penny to support the King's [[Palatinate campaign|campaign to reclaim the Palatinate]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] for his son-in-law [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] in the 1620s.<ref name=\"p3\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=3}}.</ref>  The county was also slow to pay [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s [[ship money]] which began to be levied (in defiance of the Parliament) on the inland counties in 1634 and saw much resistance.<ref name=\"p3\"/>  Open dissent against the King's decrees occurred in 1640 in objection to the levying of 300 men from the county for the King's [[Bishops' Wars|campaign against the Scots]].<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=5}}.</ref>  Riots took place in [[Uttoxeter]] with an armed guard having to be formed to prevent the levy from deserting.<ref name=\"p5\"/>

Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 the town of Burton was largely sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause.<ref name=county>Tringham, General History.</ref>   This was probably, in part, due to the large [[Puritan]] following in the town and Staffordshire's general disapproval of the [[High Church]] practices of the then Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]] (who was later executed for his opposition of Puritanism).<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p4\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=4}}.</ref>

== Early-war Burton ==
Burton's river crossing, a 36-arched medieval structure known as \"Burton Bridge\", was desirable to both sides, being described as \"the only passage over the [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Dove, Central England|Dove]] to the North\", and was positioned between the Royalist towns of Lichfield, Tutbury, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Parliamentarian Stafford and Derby.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p19\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=19}}.</ref>  Despite this strategic location the town was unfortified and possessed few natural defences.<ref name=county/>  Burton would change hands at least a dozen times during the course of the war, first coming to the attention of the Royalists when the [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield|Earl of Chesterfield]] used it as a rendezvous for his forces in late 1642.<ref name=county/>  Chesterfield withdrew his forces to Lichfield for the winter, garrisoning the [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]] which would be the scene of much fighting during the war.<ref name=\"p15\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=15}}.</ref>  There were rumours prior to the war that the town held secret supplies of gunpowder for a catholic rebellion, these were investigated by [[William Paget, 5th Baron Paget|Lord Paget]] (who began the war as a parliamentarian, switched allegiance to the King in 1642 before returning to the side of Parliament in 1644) and found to be false, though the explosion of a store of gunpowder did occur in 1643 causing the roof of [[St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent|St Modwen's Church]] to be destroyed.<ref name=county/><ref>Tringham, Established Church.</ref>

[[File:John Gell.jpg|thumb|left|Sir John Gell]]
East Staffordshire's strategic importance was heightened by its position at the boundary of Royalist and Parliamentarian garrisons in the region.<ref name=\"p16\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=16}}.</ref>  Burton had come to [[roundhead]] attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]].<ref name=county/>  In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton, consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes Molanus, but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an [[Newark-on-Trent#The Civil War|attack on Newark]].<ref name=county/>

Parliament's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  Shortly thereafter, Gell whose forces amounted to around 1,000 infantry, a few horse and 300 partially armed [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlanders]] met with [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], Commander-in-Chief of Cheshire, to organise an attack upon Stafford.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  This became known to the Royalists and the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] was sent with two fast-moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton's plan.<ref name=\"p17\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=17}}.</ref>  Northampton met with troops led by [[Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough|Henry Hastings]] (later Lord Loughborough) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]], during which Northampton was killed.<ref name=\"p17\"/>

During this time [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed at [[Bridlington]], Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King, who was then in [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  In advance of this the King sent his nephew, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], from Oxford with 1,200 horse, 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Prince Rupert's troops evicted garrisons from [[Rushall, West Midlands|Rushall]] and [[Birmingham]] and successfully [[Lichfield Cathedral#Devastation of the English Civil War|recaptured Lichfield]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta's convoy.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell, acting in co-operation with [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey]], commander-in-chief of the East Midlands Association.<ref name=county/>  He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry, 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to [[Tutbury Castle]] which he unsuccessfully attacked.<ref name=\"county\"/><ref name=\"Lewisp19\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=19}}.</ref>

== Battle ==
[[File:Tyldesley.jpg|thumb|Sir Thomas Tyldesley]]
Gell's garrison at Burton was commanded by Captain Thomas Sanders, who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell's force.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him.<ref name=county/>  Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton, of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p20\"/>

In July 1643 the Queen's convoy and its guard advanced from Newark to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and then to Burton.<ref name=\"p20\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=20}}.</ref>  Gell summoned the Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to [[Muster (military)|muster]] for him.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  On 4 July 1643 the Roylist cavalry, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders' men.<ref name=county/> The engagement was described as \"bloody\" and \"desperate\" and, though damage was caused to the town's St Modwen's church, the battle seems to have been decided by the action at the bridge.<ref name=\"p20l\"/><ref name=lanc>Remember Sir Thomas.</ref>  The forces of parliament were decisively beaten and, according to Gell, the town was \"most miserably plundered and destroyed\".<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Henrietta Maria herself recorded that so much loot was taken that her men \"could not well march with their bundles\".<ref name=county/>

The Royalists claimed that they had twice requested the surrender of the town before they attacked and that the Queen forbade any violence against the townsfolk.<ref name=\"p20l\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=20}}.</ref>  Conversely the parliamentarians claimed that 30 of their men were forced into the church and offered to surrender but were refused and were killed by cavaliers in the night.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists were also alleged to have looted the town and raped women before drowning at least 20 civilians in the river.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists took most of the Roundhead officers prisoner including Captain Sanders and Colonel Houghton (and his wife).<ref name=\"p20\"/><ref name=\"p20l\"/>  Sanders was later exchanged and was promoted to Major by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and commissioned by Gell to act as Colonel and to raise a regiment of horse.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Tyldesley was knighted and promoted to brigadier-general for bravery shown in the action.<ref name=\"ODNB\">Blackwood.</ref>

== Aftermath ==
[[File:HenriettaMariaofFrance02.jpg|thumb|Queen Henrietta Maria]]
Having lost Burton, Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] to defend it.<ref name=\"p21\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=21}}.</ref> He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder, 300 muskets, 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses, allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time.<ref name=\"p21\"/>  However Derby was not attacked by the Queen's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall, proceeding according to the King's instructions to avoid delays.<ref name=\"p21\"/>

The new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644.<ref name=county/>  During this attack Gell took the commanding officer (a Major), six captains, eight other officers and 500 men prisoner.<ref name=\"p31\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=31}}.</ref>  Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there, with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack.<ref name=\"p31\"/>  Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby, allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his \"flying army\" at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire.<ref name=\"p31\"/>

A Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644, afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more, before Sanders' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it  narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p31\"/>  Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645.<ref name=county/>  King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646, becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield.<ref name=county/>  After the war and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 Burton remained a place of [[English Dissenters|dissent]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] with large [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] congregations, raising doubts within the [[Church of England]] over the town's loyalty.<ref name=county/>

== Legacy ==
The medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era.<ref name=county/>  A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the [[English Civil War Society]].{{efn|The plaque on the modern bridge commemorating the battle reads: \"near this spot on 2nd July 1643, during the English Civil War, Colonel Thomas Tyldesley led a desperate cavalry charge over the famous 36-arched Trent Bridge to storm the town of Burton, the event being personally witnessed by Queen Henrietta Maria. For this exploit of signal valour, Thomas Tyldesley was subsequently knighted by King Charles I.  This plaque was erected on 2nd July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the English Civil War Society and Burton upon Trent Civic Society.\"}}
Another monument erected at the site of Tyldesley's death at the [[Battle of Wigan Lane]] by one of his [[Cornet (military rank)|cornets]], Alexander Rigby, in 1679 notes his \"desperate storming of Burton-Upon-Trent over a bridge of 36 arches [for which Tyldesley] received the honour of Knighthood\".<ref name=lanc/>  In honour of the battle the [[Burton Bridge Brewery]] markets an ale known as \"Battle Brew\".<ref>Battle Brew.</ref>  A local legend states that Oliver Cromwell was present in the area during the battle and tied his horse to a nail at [[Tatenhill]]'s St Michael's and All Angels Church, just {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the bridge.<ref>Moody.</ref> The medieval Burton bridge was the site of [[Battle of Burton Bridge (1322)|an earlier battle]] in 1322 where [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] defeated the rebellious [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Earl of Lancaster]].<ref name=county/>

The '''Battle of Burton Bridge''' was fought between Royalist and Parliamentarian forces at [[Burton upon Trent]] on 4 July 1643 during the [[First English Civil War]].  By the time of the battle the town, which had at various times been held by both sides, was garrisoned by a Parliamentarian unit under the command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the town's military governor, Colonel Richard Houghton.  The key river crossing at Burton was desired by Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who was proceeding southwards from Yorkshire with a convoy of supplies destined for King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at Oxford.  The Royalists, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], launched a cavalry charge across the bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their officers, including Sanders and Houghton.  The Queen's convoy proceeded on its way south to Oxford with Tyldesley receiving a knighthood and a promotion in recognition of his victory.  Burton changed hands several more times during the course of the war, before finally coming into Parliament's control in 1646.

[[James I]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was forced to write to the county's [[Justices of the Peace]] for their failure to raise a single penny to support the King's [[Palatinate campaign|campaign to reclaim the Palatinate]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] for his son-in-law [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] in the 1620s.<ref name=\"p3\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=3}}.</ref>  The county was also slow to pay [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s [[ship money]] which began to be levied (in defiance of the Parliament) on the inland counties in 1634 and saw much resistance.<ref name=\"p3\"/>  Open dissent against the King's decrees occurred in 1640 in objection to the levying of 300 men from the county for the King's [[Bishops' Wars|campaign against the Scots]].<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=5}}.</ref>  Riots took place in [[Uttoxeter]] with an armed guard having to be formed to prevent the levy from deserting.<ref name=\"p5\"/>

Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 the town of Burton was largely sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause.<ref name=county>Tringham, General History.</ref>   This was probably, in part, due to the large [[Puritan]] following in the town and Staffordshire's general disapproval of the [[High Church]] practices of the then Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]] (who was later executed for his opposition of Puritanism).<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p4\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=4}}.</ref>

== Early-war Burton ==
Burton's river crossing, a 36-arched medieval structure known as \"Burton Bridge\", was desirable to both sides, being described as \"the only passage over the [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Dove, Central England|Dove]] to the North\", and was positioned between the Royalist towns of Lichfield, Tutbury, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Parliamentarian Stafford and Derby.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p19\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=19}}.</ref>  Despite this strategic location the town was unfortified and possessed few natural defences.<ref name=county/>  Burton would change hands at least a dozen times during the course of the war, first coming to the attention of the Royalists when the [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield|Earl of Chesterfield]] used it as a rendezvous for his forces in late 1642.<ref name=county/>  Chesterfield withdrew his forces to Lichfield for the winter, garrisoning the [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]] which would be the scene of much fighting during the war.<ref name=\"p15\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=15}}.</ref>  There were rumours prior to the war that the town held secret supplies of gunpowder for a catholic rebellion, these were investigated by [[William Paget, 5th Baron Paget|Lord Paget]] (who began the war as a parliamentarian, switched allegiance to the King in 1642 before returning to the side of Parliament in 1644) and found to be false, though the explosion of a store of gunpowder did occur in 1643 causing the roof of [[St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent|St Modwen's Church]] to be destroyed.<ref name=county/><ref>Tringham, Established Church.</ref>

[[File:John Gell.jpg|thumb|left|Sir John Gell]]
East Staffordshire's strategic importance was heightened by its position at the boundary of Royalist and Parliamentarian garrisons in the region.<ref name=\"p16\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=16}}.</ref>  Burton had come to [[roundhead]] attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]].<ref name=county/>  In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton, consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes Molanus, but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an [[Newark-on-Trent#The Civil War|attack on Newark]].<ref name=county/>

Parliament's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  Shortly thereafter, Gell whose forces amounted to around 1,000 infantry, a few horse and 300 partially armed [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlanders]] met with [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], Commander-in-Chief of Cheshire, to organise an attack upon Stafford.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  This became known to the Royalists and the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] was sent with two fast-moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton's plan.<ref name=\"p17\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=17}}.</ref>  Northampton met with troops led by [[Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough|Henry Hastings]] (later Lord Loughborough) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]], during which Northampton was killed.<ref name=\"p17\"/>

During this time [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed at [[Bridlington]], Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King, who was then in [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  In advance of this the King sent his nephew, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], from Oxford with 1,200 horse, 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Prince Rupert's troops evicted garrisons from [[Rushall, West Midlands|Rushall]] and [[Birmingham]] and successfully [[Lichfield Cathedral#Devastation of the English Civil War|recaptured Lichfield]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta's convoy.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell, acting in co-operation with [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey]], commander-in-chief of the East Midlands Association.<ref name=county/>  He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry, 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to [[Tutbury Castle]] which he unsuccessfully attacked.<ref name=\"county\"/><ref name=\"Lewisp19\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=19}}.</ref>

== Battle ==
[[File:Tyldesley.jpg|thumb|Sir Thomas Tyldesley]]
Gell's garrison at Burton was commanded by Captain Thomas Sanders, who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell's force.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him.<ref name=county/>  Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton, of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p20\"/>

In July 1643 the Queen's convoy and its guard advanced from Newark to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and then to Burton.<ref name=\"p20\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=20}}.</ref>  Gell summoned the Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to [[Muster (military)|muster]] for him.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  On 4 July 1643 the Roylist cavalry, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders' men.<ref name=county/> The engagement was described as \"bloody\" and \"desperate\" and, though damage was caused to the town's St Modwen's church, the battle seems to have been decided by the action at the bridge.<ref name=\"p20l\"/><ref name=lanc>Remember Sir Thomas.</ref>  The forces of parliament were decisively beaten and, according to Gell, the town was \"most miserably plundered and destroyed\".<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Henrietta Maria herself recorded that so much loot was taken that her men \"could not well march with their bundles\".<ref name=county/>

The Royalists claimed that they had twice requested the surrender of the town before they attacked and that the Queen forbade any violence against the townsfolk.<ref name=\"p20l\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=20}}.</ref>  Conversely the parliamentarians claimed that 30 of their men were forced into the church and offered to surrender but were refused and were killed by cavaliers in the night.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists were also alleged to have looted the town and raped women before drowning at least 20 civilians in the river.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists took most of the Roundhead officers prisoner including Captain Sanders and Colonel Houghton (and his wife).<ref name=\"p20\"/><ref name=\"p20l\"/>  Sanders was later exchanged and was promoted to Major by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and commissioned by Gell to act as Colonel and to raise a regiment of horse.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Tyldesley was knighted and promoted to brigadier-general for bravery shown in the action.<ref name=\"ODNB\">Blackwood.</ref>

== Aftermath ==
[[File:HenriettaMariaofFrance02.jpg|thumb|Queen Henrietta Maria]]
Having lost Burton, Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] to defend it.<ref name=\"p21\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=21}}.</ref> He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder, 300 muskets, 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses, allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time.<ref name=\"p21\"/>  However Derby was not attacked by the Queen's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall, proceeding according to the King's instructions to avoid delays.<ref name=\"p21\"/>

The new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644.<ref name=county/>  During this attack Gell took the commanding officer (a Major), six captains, eight other officers and 500 men prisoner.<ref name=\"p31\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=31}}.</ref>  Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there, with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack.<ref name=\"p31\"/>  Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby, allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his \"flying army\" at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire.<ref name=\"p31\"/>

A Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644, afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more, before Sanders' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it  narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p31\"/>  Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645.<ref name=county/>  King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646, becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield.<ref name=county/>  After the war and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 Burton remained a place of [[English Dissenters|dissent]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] with large [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] congregations, raising doubts within the [[Church of England]] over the town's loyalty.<ref name=county/>

== Legacy ==
The medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era.<ref name=county/>  A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the [[English Civil War Society]].{{efn|The plaque on the modern bridge commemorating the battle reads: \"near this spot on 2nd July 1643, during the English Civil War, Colonel Thomas Tyldesley led a desperate cavalry charge over the famous 36-arched Trent Bridge to storm the town of Burton, the event being personally witnessed by Queen Henrietta Maria. For this exploit of signal valour, Thomas Tyldesley was subsequently knighted by King Charles I.  This plaque was erected on 2nd July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the English Civil War Society and Burton upon Trent Civic Society.\"}}
Another monument erected at the site of Tyldesley's death at the [[Battle of Wigan Lane]] by one of his [[Cornet (military rank)|cornets]], Alexander Rigby, in 1679 notes his \"desperate storming of Burton-Upon-Trent over a bridge of 36 arches [for which Tyldesley] received the honour of Knighthood\".<ref name=lanc/>  In honour of the battle the [[Burton Bridge Brewery]] markets an ale known as \"Battle Brew\".<ref>Battle Brew.</ref>  A local legend states that Oliver Cromwell was present in the area during the battle and tied his horse to a nail at [[Tatenhill]]'s St Michael's and All Angels Church, just {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the bridge.<ref>Moody.</ref> The medieval Burton bridge was the site of [[Battle of Burton Bridge (1322)|an earlier battle]] in 1322 where [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] defeated the rebellious [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Earl of Lancaster]].<ref name=county/>

'''''Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)''''' is a book written by [[Lucien van der Walt]] and Michael Schmidt which deals with “the ideas, history and relevance of the broad anarchist tradition through a survey of 150 years of global history.”<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html |title=Exchange on ''Black Flame'' in ''&#91;&#91;Anarchist Studies&#93;&#93;'' between Spencer Sunshine and Lucien van der Walt |access-date=2010-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917060243/http://ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The book includes a preface by Scottish anarchist, and former political prisoner, [[Stuart Christie]].

It is the first of two volumes in the authors' ''Counter Power'' series. ''Black Flame'' is a thematic work, on the history and theory of global anarchism and syndicalism. The forthcoming sequel, ''Global Fire'', will provide a global narrative history of the movement. Lucien van der Walt has meanwhile also edited [[Anarchism and Syndicalism in the Colonial and Postcolonial World, 1870-1940]]. A German translation appeared in late 2013, entitled ''Schwarze Flamme: Revolutionäre Klassenpolitik im Anarchismus und Syndikalismus'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edition-nautilus.de/programm/politik/buch-978-3-89401-783-5.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216080721/http://www.edition-nautilus.de/programm/politik/buch-978-3-89401-783-5.html |archive-date=2014-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Greek and Spanish translations nearing publication.

== Global scope ==

In terms of scope, ''Black Flame'' takes a uniquely global approach which, while also analysing Western Europe and North America, takes the history of anarchism and syndicalism in Latin America, Africa, and Asia seriously.<ref>[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/c2frv6 Black flame : the revolutionary class politics of anarchism and syndicalism by Michael Schmidt and Lucien van der Walt (Review)]</ref>

These regions are knitted together into a single global account, which overviews core themes, developments and debates in the anarchist and syndicalist tradition. Van der Walt and Michael Schmidt criticise the \"standard\" works on the overall history and theory of anarchism and syndicalism for focusing on the North Atlantic region, and for insisting upon an indefensible \"Spanish exceptionalism,\" the notion that in Spain alone were anarchism and syndicalism mass movements.

A global view shows that Spain was by no means unique. According to Lucien van der Walt, \"once you look globally, you find mass movements of comparable, sometimes even greater, influence in countries ranging from Argentina, to China, to Cuba, to Mexico, to Peru, to the Ukraine and so on. What gets a bit lost in studies that focus on Western Europe is that most of anarchist and syndicalist history took place elsewhere. In other words, you can’t understand anarchism unless you understand that much of its history was in the east and the south, not only in the north and the west.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ |title=\"Fanning the Flames\" interview with Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt |access-date=2012-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828002207/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ |archive-date=2017-08-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Therefore, besides movements like the Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]], the book examines movements like the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina]], the [[Uruguayan Anarchist Federation]], the Shinmin autonomous region founded by Korean anarchists, and the Ukrainian [[Free Territory]] of [[Makhnovism]]. Attention is also paid to figures and movements partially influenced by anarchism, like [[Augusto César Sandino]], and the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union]], in southern Africa.

''Black Flame'' also examines anarchist and syndicalist ideas and debates globally: for example, the account of anarchist debates on whether the [[Soviet Union]] was \"[[state capitalist]]\" includes the views of Asian anarchists, while sections on anarchism, syndicalism and race include coverage of Chinese, Mexican, Peruvian, and South African materials and movements.

== ''Black Flame'' and a global anarchist/ syndicalist canon ==

''Black Flame'' argues that [[East Europeans]] like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]] are the two most important anarchist thinkers. However, the book insists that globally \"the movement had an amazing array of writers and thinkers, truly cosmopolitan.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/>

The anarchist and syndicalist canon must be understood as a \"global\" one, that must \"include figures from within but also without the West,\" ideally including figures like Li Pei Kan ([[Ba Jin]]) and [[Liu Shifu]](“Shifu”) of China, [[James Connolly]] of Ireland, Armando Borghi and [[Errico Malatesta]] of Italy, [[Nestor Makhno]] and [[Piotr Arshinov]], of the Ukraine, [[Juana Rouco Buela]] of Argentina, [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] and Jaime Balius of Spain, [[Ricardo Flores Magón]], [[Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza]], Antonio Gomes y Soto and [[Práxedis Guerrero]] of Mexico, [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]] of the Netherlands, [[Ōsugi Sakae]], [[Kōtoku Shūsui]] and [[Kanno Sugako]] of Japan, [[Lucy Parsons]] and [[Emma Goldman]] of the United States, Enrique Roig de San Martín of Cuba, [[Shin Chaeho]] and [[Kim Jwa-jin]] of Korea, [[Rudolph Rocker]] of Germany, Neno Vasco and [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] of Brazil, [[Abraham Guillén]] of Spain and Uruguay, and S.P. Bunting and T.W. Thibedi of South Africa.<ref name=\"interview\"/>

== Other \"core theses\" ==

''Black Flame's'' \"core theses\" include the propositions \"that the global anarchist movement emerged in the First International, that syndicalism is an integral part of the broad anarchist tradition, that this tradition centres on rationalism, socialism and anti-authoritarianism, that the writings of Mikhail Bakunin and Pyotr Kropotkin are representative of its core ideas, and that this 'narrow' definition is both empirically defensible and analytically useful.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html |title=Exchange on ''Black Flame'' with ''&#91;&#91;Anarchist Studies&#93;&#93;'' between Spencer Sunshine and Lucien van der Walt |access-date=2010-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917060243/http://ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

According to the book, the core ideas of anarchism (including its syndicalist variant) include revolutionary class struggle by the working class and peasantry, internationalism, opposition to all forms of social and economic inequality, anti-imperialism, and a commitment to creating a self-managed global system of libertarian socialism, based on participatory planning and the abolition of markets and states.

== Main themes, areas and topics ==

While ''Black Flame's''' approach to defining anarchism has attracted a great deal of attention, this is actually a minor part of the book.

Other areas covered include
* anarchist economic theory, compared to [[Marxian economics]] and [[economic liberalism]];
* the class composition of anarchist and syndicalist movements;
* peasant anarchism: causes, patterns and outcomes;
* the case against \"Spanish exceptionalism\";
* debates over dual organisationalism;
* anarchism, syndicalism and the promotion of revolutionary \"counterpower\" and \"counterculture\";
* debates over trade unions in anarchism;
* anarchists and syndicalists in anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles; and
* anarchism, syndicalism and women's freedom

The book engages with contemporary academic thinking on issues such as race and gender, but does so by a close examination of \"the rich veins of anarchist and syndicalist thought on the national question, on women’s struggles, on union strategy.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/>

The aim is not \"'update' anarchism by blending it with current academic approaches,\" but to examine \"what the actual historical anarchist and syndicalist movement actually thought\" and \"actually did.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/> It is only from the basis of a solid understanding the movement's history and theory, as \"a intellectual tradition that has a great deal of insight into issues of social and economic inequality, as well as a strategy around these issues,\" that it becomes possible and useful to engage with current academic work.<ref name=\"interview\"/>

== Publicity and reception ==

The book has been very well-received, and quickly sold out its first print run.

Launches have taken place in Brazil, Britain, Canada, Germany, Mexico, Sweden, and South Africa.

Reviewers have praised the book for its \"deeply impressive quality of research, analysis and writing,\" as an \"outstanding contribution,\" for \"examining anarchism from a worldwide perspective instead of looking at it only from a west European angle,\" for its \"useful and insightful treatment of one of the most fascinating alternatives to industrial capitalism and the modern nation state,\"  its \"grand work of synthesis,\" and its \"remarkable job in drawing together a vast international body of literature, showing convincingly that anarchism and syndicalism were far more significant political forces than historians have generally given ... credit,\" and \"a serious and coherent political philosophy.”<ref name=\"interview\"/>

== Defining anarchism ==

A striking feature of ''Black Flame'' is the argument that “‘[[class struggle]]’ anarchism, sometimes called revolutionary or [[Anarchist communism|communist anarchism]], is not a type of anarchism … it is the only anarchism,” and so it does not include ideas sometimes called [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], identified with figures such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Max Stirner]]. Regarding the so-called “[[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical]], individualist, [[Anarchism and religion|spiritual]] and ‘[[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestyle]]’ traditions,” the authors say “we do not regard these currents as part of the broad anarchist tradition.”<ref name=\"review\">[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Deric_Shannon__A_Flame_to_Extenguish_Capital__Review_of_Black_Flame.html A Flame to Extenguish Capital: Review of Black Flame by Deric Shannon]</ref>

''Black Flame'' insists that while anarchism owes an immense debt to the earlier current of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] and to [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], it cannot be reduced to, or conflated with, Mutualism. For example, its stresses class struggle and social revolution, unlike Mutualism, which envisaged gradual change through building cooperatives.

The book argues that there are no rational or historical grounds for including currents like Stirnerism and Mutualism in the anarchist tradition.

Some studies do this, by defining anarchism as basically an anti-statist movement (this sort of approach can be found, for example, on Wikipedia at [[Anarchist schools of thought]]). However, the authors argue, if this was true, then [[Marxism-Leninism]] and [[economic liberalism]] must also be considered \"anarchist,\" as one aims at the \"withering away of the state\" and the other, at a massive reduction in state control. These currents cannot be logically excluded from anarchism, if anarchism is defined as anti-statism, but it would also be nonsensical to include them within anarchism.

Rather, anarchism (including syndicalism) emerged as a movement in the [[International Workingmen's Association]], or \"First International,\" founded in 1864: the new anarchist current emerged simultaneously in Europe and Latin America. After the International split in 1872, the anarchist majority   (sometimes known as the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]]) attracted affiliates in central Asia and North Africa. This is ignored by flawed twentieth century scholarship, which reduced anarchism to anti-statism, so conflating the movement with earlier (as well as parallel) libertarian currents. Thus, anarchism is regarded here as a distinct, continuous and novel ideological and political tradition, not a gallery of superficially similar moments and thinkers.

Anarchism was, that is, born as a radical, anti-capitalist current in the radical working class and peasant milieu. Since this milieu was the product of modern capitalist and the modern state in the 1800s, the first anarchist formations emerged in the 1860s and 1870s in areas by then being reshaped by these forces: parts of East as well as West Europe, North Africa as well as North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. As capitalist modernity expanded into southern Africa from the 1880s and east Asia from the 1890s, anarchism spread into those regions as well.

Further, since syndicalism is a variant of anarchism, argues ''Black Flame'', syndicalists who rejected the anarchist label, like [[James Connolly]] and [[Bill Haywood]] are nonetheless still part of the anarchist tradition.

It is not, ''Black Flame'' stresses, self-identity (such as calling oneself an 'anarchist') that makes one an \"anarchist\": the term \"anarchist,\" after all, has been used by the radical right, by free market neo-liberals, and by rock stars. It is the ideological content that matters, and this content goes back to the Bakuninist wing of the  \"First International.\" Thus, figures like the syndicalist [[Bill Haywood]], who often used the term \"anarchism\" in a negative way, form part of the larger anarchist tradition - while figures with no real connection to that tradition, like Stirner, do not.

== Mass anarchism (including syndicalism) versus insurrectionist anarchism ==

Van der Walt and Schmidt argue, instead, that the main divide in the anarchist movement has been between two main ''strategic'' approaches,  \"mass and [[insurrectionist anarchism]].\" The book is closer to the mass anarchist perspective, although it provides considerable coverage of insurrectionism.<ref name=\"review\"/>

For the authors, mass anarchism \"stresses that only mass movements can create revolutionary change in society,\" and \"that such movements are typically built through struggles around immediate issues and reforms.”<ref name=\"review\"/>

A key example of \"mass anarchism\" is [[syndicalism]], which is a variant of anarchism, and a key \"mass anarchist\" approach. However, it argues, not all mass anarchists are syndicalists, nor are all anarchists, mass anarchists.

They go on that “[t]he insurrectionist approach, in contrast, claims that reforms are illusory, that movements like unions are willing or unwitting bulwarks of the existing order, and that formal organisations are authoritarian.\" Consequently, insurrectionist anarchism typically emphasises violent action – ‘propaganda by the deed’ – as the \"most important means of evoking a spontaneous revolutionary upsurge” by the popular classes<ref name=\"review\"/>

== Sequel: ''Global Fire'' ==

''Black Flame'' is the first of two volumes in the authors' ''Counter Power'' series. ''Black Flame'' is a thematic work, on the history and theory of global anarchism and syndicalism. The forthcoming sequel, ''Global Fire'', will provide a global narrative history of the movement.

== The authors ==

The authors are South Africans.

Michael Schmidt, a senior journalist with an activist background, is now a journalism trainer.

[[Lucien van der Walt]], an industrial sociologist who works on labour and left movements and capitalist restructuring, also has an activist background.

'''''Black Flame: The Revolutionary Class Politics of Anarchism and Syndicalism (Counter-Power vol. 1)''''' is a book written by [[Lucien van der Walt]] and Michael Schmidt which deals with “the ideas, history and relevance of the broad anarchist tradition through a survey of 150 years of global history.”<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html |title=Exchange on ''Black Flame'' in ''&#91;&#91;Anarchist Studies&#93;&#93;'' between Spencer Sunshine and Lucien van der Walt |access-date=2010-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917060243/http://ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The book includes a preface by Scottish anarchist, and former political prisoner, [[Stuart Christie]].

It is the first of two volumes in the authors' ''Counter Power'' series. ''Black Flame'' is a thematic work, on the history and theory of global anarchism and syndicalism. The forthcoming sequel, ''Global Fire'', will provide a global narrative history of the movement. Lucien van der Walt has meanwhile also edited [[Anarchism and Syndicalism in the Colonial and Postcolonial World, 1870-1940]]. A German translation appeared in late 2013, entitled ''Schwarze Flamme: Revolutionäre Klassenpolitik im Anarchismus und Syndikalismus'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edition-nautilus.de/programm/politik/buch-978-3-89401-783-5.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216080721/http://www.edition-nautilus.de/programm/politik/buch-978-3-89401-783-5.html |archive-date=2014-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Greek and Spanish translations nearing publication.

== Global scope ==

In terms of scope, ''Black Flame'' takes a uniquely global approach which, while also analysing Western Europe and North America, takes the history of anarchism and syndicalism in Latin America, Africa, and Asia seriously.<ref>[http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/c2frv6 Black flame : the revolutionary class politics of anarchism and syndicalism by Michael Schmidt and Lucien van der Walt (Review)]</ref>

These regions are knitted together into a single global account, which overviews core themes, developments and debates in the anarchist and syndicalist tradition. Van der Walt and Michael Schmidt criticise the \"standard\" works on the overall history and theory of anarchism and syndicalism for focusing on the North Atlantic region, and for insisting upon an indefensible \"Spanish exceptionalism,\" the notion that in Spain alone were anarchism and syndicalism mass movements.

A global view shows that Spain was by no means unique. According to Lucien van der Walt, \"once you look globally, you find mass movements of comparable, sometimes even greater, influence in countries ranging from Argentina, to China, to Cuba, to Mexico, to Peru, to the Ukraine and so on. What gets a bit lost in studies that focus on Western Europe is that most of anarchist and syndicalist history took place elsewhere. In other words, you can’t understand anarchism unless you understand that much of its history was in the east and the south, not only in the north and the west.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ |title=\"Fanning the Flames\" interview with Lucien van der Walt and Michael Schmidt |access-date=2012-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828002207/http://www.revolutionbythebook.akpress.org/still-fanning-the-flames-an-interview-with-michael-schmidt-and-lucien-van-der-walt/ |archive-date=2017-08-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Therefore, besides movements like the Spanish [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]], the book examines movements like the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], the [[Federacion Obrera Regional Argentina]], the [[Uruguayan Anarchist Federation]], the Shinmin autonomous region founded by Korean anarchists, and the Ukrainian [[Free Territory]] of [[Makhnovism]]. Attention is also paid to figures and movements partially influenced by anarchism, like [[Augusto César Sandino]], and the [[Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union]], in southern Africa.

''Black Flame'' also examines anarchist and syndicalist ideas and debates globally: for example, the account of anarchist debates on whether the [[Soviet Union]] was \"[[state capitalist]]\" includes the views of Asian anarchists, while sections on anarchism, syndicalism and race include coverage of Chinese, Mexican, Peruvian, and South African materials and movements.

== ''Black Flame'' and a global anarchist/ syndicalist canon ==

''Black Flame'' argues that East Europeans like [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and [[Peter Kropotkin]] are the two most important anarchist thinkers. However, the book insists that globally \"the movement had an amazing array of writers and thinkers, truly cosmopolitan.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/>

The anarchist and syndicalist canon must be understood as a \"global\" one, that must \"include figures from within but also without the West,\" ideally including figures like Li Pei Kan ([[Ba Jin]]) and [[Liu Shifu]](“Shifu”) of China, [[James Connolly]] of Ireland, Armando Borghi and [[Errico Malatesta]] of Italy, [[Nestor Makhno]] and [[Piotr Arshinov]], of the Ukraine, [[Juana Rouco Buela]] of Argentina, [[Lucía Sánchez Saornil]] and Jaime Balius of Spain, [[Ricardo Flores Magón]], [[Juana Belén Gutiérrez de Mendoza]], Antonio Gomes y Soto and [[Práxedis Guerrero]] of Mexico, [[Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis]] of the Netherlands, [[Ōsugi Sakae]], [[Kōtoku Shūsui]] and [[Kanno Sugako]] of Japan, [[Lucy Parsons]] and [[Emma Goldman]] of the United States, Enrique Roig de San Martín of Cuba, [[Shin Chaeho]] and [[Kim Jwa-jin]] of Korea, [[Rudolph Rocker]] of Germany, Neno Vasco and [[Maria Lacerda de Moura]] of Brazil, [[Abraham Guillén]] of Spain and Uruguay, and S.P. Bunting and T.W. Thibedi of South Africa.<ref name=\"interview\"/>

== Other \"core theses\" ==

''Black Flame's'' \"core theses\" include the propositions \"that the global anarchist movement emerged in the First International, that syndicalism is an integral part of the broad anarchist tradition, that this tradition centres on rationalism, socialism and anti-authoritarianism, that the writings of Mikhail Bakunin and Pyotr Kropotkin are representative of its core ideas, and that this 'narrow' definition is both empirically defensible and analytically useful.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html |title=Exchange on ''Black Flame'' with ''&#91;&#91;Anarchist Studies&#93;&#93;'' between Spencer Sunshine and Lucien van der Walt |access-date=2010-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917060243/http://ainfos.ca/en/ainfos24315.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

According to the book, the core ideas of anarchism (including its syndicalist variant) include revolutionary class struggle by the working class and peasantry, internationalism, opposition to all forms of social and economic inequality, anti-imperialism, and a commitment to creating a self-managed global system of libertarian socialism, based on participatory planning and the abolition of markets and states.

== Main themes, areas and topics ==

While ''Black Flame's''' approach to defining anarchism has attracted a great deal of attention, this is actually a minor part of the book.

Other areas covered include
* anarchist economic theory, compared to [[Marxian economics]] and [[economic liberalism]];
* the class composition of anarchist and syndicalist movements;
* peasant anarchism: causes, patterns and outcomes;
* the case against \"Spanish exceptionalism\";
* debates over dual organisationalism;
* anarchism, syndicalism and the promotion of revolutionary \"counterpower\" and \"counterculture\";
* debates over trade unions in anarchism;
* anarchists and syndicalists in anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles; and
* anarchism, syndicalism and women's freedom

The book engages with contemporary academic thinking on issues such as race and gender, but does so by a close examination of \"the rich veins of anarchist and syndicalist thought on the national question, on women’s struggles, on union strategy.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/>

The aim is not \"'update' anarchism by blending it with current academic approaches,\" but to examine \"what the actual historical anarchist and syndicalist movement actually thought\" and \"actually did.\"<ref name=\"interview\"/> It is only from the basis of a solid understanding the movement's history and theory, as \"a intellectual tradition that has a great deal of insight into issues of social and economic inequality, as well as a strategy around these issues,\" that it becomes possible and useful to engage with current academic work.<ref name=\"interview\"/>

== Publicity and reception ==

The book has been very well-received, and quickly sold out its first print run.

Launches have taken place in Brazil, Britain, Canada, Germany, Mexico, Sweden, and South Africa.

Reviewers have praised the book for its \"deeply impressive quality of research, analysis and writing,\" as an \"outstanding contribution,\" for \"examining anarchism from a worldwide perspective instead of looking at it only from a west European angle,\" for its \"useful and insightful treatment of one of the most fascinating alternatives to industrial capitalism and the modern nation state,\"  its \"grand work of synthesis,\" and its \"remarkable job in drawing together a vast international body of literature, showing convincingly that anarchism and syndicalism were far more significant political forces than historians have generally given ... credit,\" and \"a serious and coherent political philosophy.”<ref name=\"interview\"/>

== Defining anarchism ==

A striking feature of ''Black Flame'' is the argument that “‘[[class struggle]]’ anarchism, sometimes called revolutionary or [[Anarchist communism|communist anarchism]], is not a type of anarchism … it is the only anarchism,” and so it does not include ideas sometimes called [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]], identified with figures such as [[William Godwin]] and [[Max Stirner]]. Regarding the so-called “[[Philosophical anarchism|philosophical]], individualist, [[Anarchism and religion|spiritual]] and ‘[[Lifestyle anarchism|lifestyle]]’ traditions,” the authors say “we do not regard these currents as part of the broad anarchist tradition.”<ref name=\"review\">[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Deric_Shannon__A_Flame_to_Extenguish_Capital__Review_of_Black_Flame.html A Flame to Extenguish Capital: Review of Black Flame by Deric Shannon]</ref>

''Black Flame'' insists that while anarchism owes an immense debt to the earlier current of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]] and to [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], it cannot be reduced to, or conflated with, Mutualism. For example, its stresses class struggle and social revolution, unlike Mutualism, which envisaged gradual change through building cooperatives.

The book argues that there are no rational or historical grounds for including currents like Stirnerism and Mutualism in the anarchist tradition.

Some studies do this, by defining anarchism as basically an anti-statist movement (this sort of approach can be found, for example, on Wikipedia at [[Anarchist schools of thought]]). However, the authors argue, if this was true, then [[Marxism-Leninism]] and [[economic liberalism]] must also be considered \"anarchist,\" as one aims at the \"withering away of the state\" and the other, at a massive reduction in state control. These currents cannot be logically excluded from anarchism, if anarchism is defined as anti-statism, but it would also be nonsensical to include them within anarchism.

Rather, anarchism (including syndicalism) emerged as a movement in the [[International Workingmen's Association]], or \"First International,\" founded in 1864: the new anarchist current emerged simultaneously in Europe and Latin America. After the International split in 1872, the anarchist majority   (sometimes known as the [[Anarchist St. Imier International]]) attracted affiliates in central Asia and North Africa. This is ignored by flawed twentieth century scholarship, which reduced anarchism to anti-statism, so conflating the movement with earlier (as well as parallel) libertarian currents. Thus, anarchism is regarded here as a distinct, continuous and novel ideological and political tradition, not a gallery of superficially similar moments and thinkers.

Anarchism was, that is, born as a radical, anti-capitalist current in the radical working class and peasant milieu. Since this milieu was the product of modern capitalist and the modern state in the 1800s, the first anarchist formations emerged in the 1860s and 1870s in areas by then being reshaped by these forces: parts of East as well as West Europe, North Africa as well as North America, and Latin America and the Caribbean. As capitalist modernity expanded into southern Africa from the 1880s and east Asia from the 1890s, anarchism spread into those regions as well.

Further, since syndicalism is a variant of anarchism, argues ''Black Flame'', syndicalists who rejected the anarchist label, like [[James Connolly]] and [[Bill Haywood]] are nonetheless still part of the anarchist tradition.

It is not, ''Black Flame'' stresses, self-identity (such as calling oneself an 'anarchist') that makes one an \"anarchist\": the term \"anarchist,\" after all, has been used by the radical right, by free market neo-liberals, and by rock stars. It is the ideological content that matters, and this content goes back to the Bakuninist wing of the  \"First International.\" Thus, figures like the syndicalist [[Bill Haywood]], who often used the term \"anarchism\" in a negative way, form part of the larger anarchist tradition - while figures with no real connection to that tradition, like Stirner, do not.

== Mass anarchism (including syndicalism) versus insurrectionist anarchism ==

Van der Walt and Schmidt argue, instead, that the main divide in the anarchist movement has been between two main ''strategic'' approaches,  \"mass and [[insurrectionist anarchism]].\" The book is closer to the mass anarchist perspective, although it provides considerable coverage of insurrectionism.<ref name=\"review\"/>

For the authors, mass anarchism \"stresses that only mass movements can create revolutionary change in society,\" and \"that such movements are typically built through struggles around immediate issues and reforms.”<ref name=\"review\"/>

A key example of \"mass anarchism\" is [[syndicalism]], which is a variant of anarchism, and a key \"mass anarchist\" approach. However, it argues, not all mass anarchists are syndicalists, nor are all anarchists, mass anarchists.

They go on that “[t]he insurrectionist approach, in contrast, claims that reforms are illusory, that movements like unions are willing or unwitting bulwarks of the existing order, and that formal organisations are authoritarian.\" Consequently, insurrectionist anarchism typically emphasises violent action – ‘propaganda by the deed’ – as the \"most important means of evoking a spontaneous revolutionary upsurge” by the popular classes<ref name=\"review\"/>

== Sequel: ''Global Fire'' ==

''Black Flame'' is the first of two volumes in the authors' ''Counter Power'' series. ''Black Flame'' is a thematic work, on the history and theory of global anarchism and syndicalism. The forthcoming sequel, ''Global Fire'', will provide a global narrative history of the movement.

== The authors ==

The authors are South Africans.

Michael Schmidt, a senior journalist with an activist background, is now a journalism trainer.

[[Lucien van der Walt]], an industrial sociologist who works on labour and left movements and capitalist restructuring, also has an activist background.

The winners were [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and the runners-up were [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]]. This was the first trophy in Birmingham's \"[[Double (association football)#Doubles in lower divisions|lower-league Double]]\" of the [[1994–95 Football League|Football League Second Division]] and [[Football League Trophy]].

The competition began on 27 September 1994 and ended with the final on 23 April 1995 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

In the first round, there were two sections split into seven groups: North and South. In the following rounds each section gradually eliminates teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists face each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

[[Category:1994–95 Football League Third Division|Tro]]","The '''1994–95 Football League Trophy''', known as the '''1994–95 Auto Windscreens Shields Trophy''', was the ninth staging of the [[Football League Trophy]], a knock-out competition for [[English football]] clubs in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] and the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. The winners were [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and the runners-up were [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]]. This was the first trophy in Birmingham's \"[[Double (association football)#Doubles in lower divisions|lower-league Double]]\" of the [[1994-95 Football League|Football League Second Division]] and [[Football League Trophy]].

The competition began on 27 September 1994 and ended with the final on 23 April 1995 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

In the following rounds each section gradually eliminates teams in knock-out fashion until each has a winning finalist. At this point, the two winning finalists face each other in the combined final for the honour of the trophy.

'''London General''' is a bus company operating services in [[Greater London]]. It is a subsidiary of the [[Go-Ahead Group]] and operates most buses under contract to [[Transport for London]]. The company is named after the [[London General Omnibus Company]], the principal operator of [[buses in London]] between 1855 and 1933.

==History==
[[File:Victoria Bus Station. - geograph.org.uk - 26698.jpg|thumb|The original logo]]
The modern-day London General<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02328489 Companies House extract company no 2328489] London General Transport Services Limited</ref> commenced operating on 1 April 1989 when London Buses was divided into 11 separate [[Privatisation of London bus services#Break-up of London Buses|business units]]. Its original logo being an omnibus in reflection of the name's history. In 1994 the company was sold in a [[management buyout]], before being sold to the [[Go-Ahead Group]] in May 1996.<ref>[http://www.go-ahead.com/~/media/Files/G/Go-Ahead/ir/presentations/archive_pres/1996pres/ar1996.pdf Go-Ahead annual report 29 June 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123165203/http://go-ahead.com/~/media/Files/G/Go-Ahead/ir/presentations/archive_pres/1996pres/ar1996.pdf |date=23 November 2012 }} Go-Ahead Group plc</ref>

The company moved its offices to an address in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], adjacent to the Merton bus garage. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the [[Go-Ahead London]] trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.

In October 2009, Go-Ahead completed the purchase of [[East Thames Buses]] from [[Transport for London]] and incorporated it into London General. Although Transport for London's normal practice is to put routes out for tender, London General began a new five-year contract for all East Thames Buses routes without going through the tendering process.

In March 2012, [[First London]]'s [[Northumberland Park, London|Northumberland Park]] garage was purchased. On 1 April 2014, the London operations of [[Metrobus (South East England)|Metrobus]] depots in [[Croydon]] and [[Orpington]]  were integrated into London General. On 25 April 2014, the [[Vehicle and Operator Services Agency]] formally increased London General's licence to accommodate the Metrobus buses.<ref>[http://issuu.com/goaheadlondon/docs/bus_talk_-_issue_27_-_april_2014 Go-Ahead London welcomes Metrobus garages into fold] ''[[Bus Talk]]'' issue 27 April 2014</ref><ref>\"Metrobus within Go-Ahead London\" ''The London Bus'' ([[London Omnibus Traction Society]]) issue 598 June 2014 page 7</ref><ref>\"Go-Ahead London\" ''[[Buses Magazine]]'' issue 713 August 2014 page 71</ref> However, as at September 2014, the buses continued to carry Metrobus branding.

==Garages==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2019}}
London General operates 9 bus garages.

===Sutton (A)===
As at February 2020, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 80|80]], [[London Buses route 93|93]], [[London Buses route 151|151]], [[London Buses route 154|154]], [[London Buses route 164|164]] (partial Sunday allocation only), [[London Buses route 213|213]].<ref name=Busroutes>[https://www.goaheadlondon.com/routes] Go-Ahead London </ref>

====History====
Opened by the [[London General Omnibus Company]] in January 1924 at cost of £30,000, Sutton garage had a capacity for 100 buses. During its early years, less than half of the garage was put to use, holding only 40 buses by 1926. This would change somewhat by the extension of the [[London Underground|Underground]] to [[Morden]] and major house-building projects in the area. Between 1945 and 1953, it had an allocation of exactly 100 Utility [[Daimler Company|Daimlers]] (classed as Ds) numbered from D182 - D281. By 1952, the garage had 128 buses allocated, achieved mainly by parking buses in surrounding streets. However, this would soon fall again, to 100 in 1966, 82 in 1976 and 62 in 1987. The garage passed to the reborn London General bus company in the run-up to privatisation in 1985. Sutton Garage also partly took control of [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] at a yard in [[Colliers Wood]] (AA) in 1989, after Cityrama withdrew from their contract. Sutton was responsible for providing drivers for the service, whilst Merton garage were contracted to do the maintenance. By 1994, the garage allocation had grown to 85 buses and again to 92 in 2001, including 10 buses subcontracted to [[Surrey County Council]].

Sutton also helped when Carshalton garage closed in 1964.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

====History====
With its ancestry going back to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was converted to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a side road with a modest frontage, yet it has an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940 which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was underutilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of [[Putney Bridge]] garage (F) it started to receive both short and long wheelbase [[AEC Routemaster]]s for its central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005 when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.

====History====
The garage was modernised in 1960, and again in 1991 when a new roof was fitted and various stores and welfare areas were moved to provide a larger, unobstructed parking area, which had previously been long and narrow. [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] was also responsible for the maintenance of vehicles for [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] in 1988/9 after the withdrawal of the Cityrama sightseeing company, whilst the route was operated from Sutton garage.

The garage has become [[Go-Ahead London]]'s head office, following the sale of Raleigh House, [[Mitcham]] and the acquisition of the former pub ([[King's Head, Merton]]) next door.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

====History====
A former farm, Green Street Green depot was for many years the only garage for all of Metrobus' London tendered routes since the award of [[London Buses route 61|route 61]] in 1986. More recently routes have been operated from Godstone and in December 2005 a new depot was constructed in Croydon to cope with new tender awards.

===Waterloo (RA)===
[[Waterloo, London|Waterloo]] garage operates [[Red Arrow (bus)|Red Arrow]] routes [[London Buses route 507|507]] and [[London Buses route 521|521]].<ref name=\"Busroutes\" />

====History====
The garage opened in the early 1980s as a [[Red Arrow (bus)|Red Arrow]] garage and in the 1990s had an allocation of [[AEC Routemaster]]s for [[London Buses route 11|route 11]]. The garage only operates Monday to Friday due to its proximity to residential properties.

In June 2002. the Red Arrow [[Leyland National]]s were replaced by London's first fleet of [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] articulated buses. Because of the extra space required to stable these, the route 11 Routemasters were transferred to Stockwell garage. In September 2009 the articulated fleet was replaced by [[Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro]]s.

===Stockwell (SW)===
As of December 2019, [[Stockwell Garage]] operated routes [[London Buses route 11|11]], [[London Buses route 77|77]], [[London Buses route 87|87]], [[London Buses route 88|88]], [[London Buses route 93|93]], [[London Buses route 118|118]], [[London Buses route 155|155]], [[London Buses route 170|170]], [[London Buses route 315|315]], [[London Buses route 322|322]], [[London Buses route 432|432]], [[London Buses route 670|670]], [[London Buses route G1|G1]], [[London Buses route N11|N11]], [[London Buses route N44|N44]], [[London Buses route N87|N87]] and [[London Buses route N155|N155]] <ref name=\"Busroutes\" />

====History====
Opened in 1952 after nearly four years of planning and building with many materials short of supply and problems re-housing residents of the houses that stood on the site.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Stockwell garage is a listed building, and when built was a masterpiece of architectural design incorporating a new roof structure that did not need supports which enabled for a {{convert|73350|sqft|m2|adj=on}} unobstructed parking space.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The offices and workshops are on the edges of the garage but do not take up any of the parking space. In the first few days of operation the garage ran just 11 buses on route 178 which had moved from Rye Lane (Peckham), but then gained more work from the next stage of the tram replacement program for which it had been designed, but it was still well short of capacity. 

More work arrived in late 1953 and early 1954 when routes 77 and 77A (now 87) moved from Victoria garage due to recruitment problems, and the closure of Nunhead which increased the PVR to 110 buses. In the early 1970s the Round London Sightseeing Tours moved to Stockwell. In 1984 Stockwell was chosen to conduct comparative testing on route 170, consisting of [[MCW Metrobus]]es, [[Leyland Titan (B15)|Leyland Titans]], [[Leyland Olympian]]s, [[Dennis Dominator]]s, and [[Volvo Ailsa]]s.

====History====
Belvedere was purchased by [[Harris Bus]] in 1998 to house its operations that moved from [[Crayford]]. Harris Bus went into receivership in 2000, and its routes and garage were taken over by London Buses under the guise of East Thames Buses. East Thames Buses remained a subsidiary of London Buses, taking over routes from defunct operators such as [[Durham Travel Services|London Easylink's]] [[London Buses route 42|42]] and [[London Buses route 185|185]] when this company ceased operating in 2002. Following the move to Mandela Way the engineering is now done there, however limited engineering facilities exist at Belvedere.

In October 2009, East Thames Buses was sold to Go-Ahead London. As a result of the purchase by Go-Ahead some route and allocation movements have taken or are due to take place.

Even though Belvedere was a London General Garage it operated as a satellite of [[London Central]]'s Bexleyheath garage. All of Belvedere's engineering and fleet and staff management was done at or organised by Bexleyheath.

Belvedere Garage closed on 1 December 2017 when the lease expired. Routes 180 and N1 transferred to the recently opened [[London Central#Morden Wharf (MG)|Morden Wharf]] bus garage in Greenwich, while Routes 244 and 669 transferred to Bexleyheath.

'''London General''' is a bus company operating services in [[Greater London]]. It is a subsidiary of the [[Go-Ahead Group]] and operates most buses under contract to [[Transport for London]]. The company is named after the [[London General Omnibus Company]], the principal operator of [[buses in London]] between 1855 and 1933.

==History==
[[File:Victoria Bus Station. - geograph.org.uk - 26698.jpg|thumb|The original logo]]
The modern-day London General<ref>[http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/02328489 Companies House extract company no 2328489] London General Transport Services Limited</ref> commenced operating on 1 April 1989 when London Buses was divided into 11 separate [[Privatisation of London bus services#Break-up of London Buses|business units]]. Its original logo being an omnibus in reflection of the name's history. In 1994 the company was sold in a [[management buyout]], before being sold to the [[Go-Ahead Group]] in May 1996.<ref>[http://www.go-ahead.com/~/media/Files/G/Go-Ahead/ir/presentations/archive_pres/1996pres/ar1996.pdf Go-Ahead annual report 29 June 1996] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123165203/http://go-ahead.com/~/media/Files/G/Go-Ahead/ir/presentations/archive_pres/1996pres/ar1996.pdf |date=23 November 2012 }} Go-Ahead Group plc</ref>

The company moved its offices to an address in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]], adjacent to the Merton bus garage. In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the [[Go-Ahead London]] trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.

In October 2009, Go-Ahead completed the purchase of [[East Thames Buses]] from [[Transport for London]] and incorporated it into London General. Although Transport for London's normal practice is to put routes out for tender, London General began a new five-year contract for all East Thames Buses routes without going through the tendering process.

In March 2012, [[First London]]'s [[Northumberland Park, London|Northumberland Park]] garage was purchased. On 1 April 2014, the London operations of [[Metrobus (South East England)|Metrobus]] depots in [[Croydon]] and [[Orpington]]  were integrated into London General. On 25 April 2014, the [[Vehicle and Operator Services Agency]] formally increased London General's licence to accommodate the Metrobus buses.<ref>[http://issuu.com/goaheadlondon/docs/bus_talk_-_issue_27_-_april_2014 Go-Ahead London welcomes Metrobus garages into fold] ''[[Bus Talk]]'' issue 27 April 2014</ref><ref>\"Metrobus within Go-Ahead London\" ''The London Bus'' ([[London Omnibus Traction Society]]) issue 598 June 2014 page 7</ref><ref>\"Go-Ahead London\" ''[[Buses Magazine]]'' issue 713 August 2014 page 71</ref> However, as at September 2014, the buses continued to carry Metrobus branding.

{{refimprove|section|date=February 2019}}
London General operates 9 bus garages.

===Sutton (A)===
As at February 2020, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 80|80]], [[London Buses route 93|93]], [[London Buses route 151|151]], [[London Buses route 154|154]], [[London Buses route 164|164]] (partial Sunday allocation only), [[London Buses route 213|213]].<ref name=Busroutes>[https://www.goaheadlondon.com/routes] Go-Ahead London </ref>

====History====
Opened by the [[London General Omnibus Company]] in January 1924 at cost of £30,000, Sutton garage had a capacity for 100 buses. During its early years, less than half of the garage was put to use, holding only 40 buses by 1926. This would change somewhat by the extension of the [[London Underground|Underground]] to [[Morden]] and major house-building projects in the area. Between 1945 and 1953, it had an allocation of exactly 100 Utility [[Daimler Company|Daimlers]] (classed as Ds) numbered from D182 - D281. By 1952, the garage had 128 buses allocated, achieved mainly by parking buses in surrounding streets. However, this would soon fall again, to 100 in 1966, 82 in 1976 and 62 in 1987. The garage passed to the reborn London General bus company in the run-up to privatisation in 1985. Sutton Garage also partly took control of [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] at a yard in [[Colliers Wood]] (AA) in 1989, after Cityrama withdrew from their contract. Sutton was responsible for providing drivers for the service, whilst Merton garage were contracted to do the maintenance. By 1994, the garage allocation had grown to 85 buses and again to 92 in 2001, including 10 buses subcontracted to [[Surrey County Council]].

Sutton also helped when Carshalton garage closed in 1964.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

===Putney (AF)===

====History====
With its ancestry going back to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was converted to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a side road with a modest frontage, yet it has an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940 which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was underutilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of [[Putney Bridge]] garage (F) it started to receive both short and long wheelbase [[AEC Routemaster]]s for its central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005 when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.

====History====
The garage was modernised in 1960, and again in 1991 when a new roof was fitted and various stores and welfare areas were moved to provide a larger, unobstructed parking area, which had previously been long and narrow. [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] was also responsible for the maintenance of vehicles for [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] in 1988/9 after the withdrawal of the Cityrama sightseeing company, whilst the route was operated from Sutton garage.

The garage has become [[Go-Ahead London]]'s head office, following the sale of Raleigh House, [[Mitcham]] and the acquisition of the former pub ([[King's Head, Merton]]) next door.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

====History====
A former farm, Green Street Green depot was for many years the only garage for all of Metrobus' London tendered routes since the award of [[London Buses route 61|route 61]] in 1986. More recently routes have been operated from Godstone and in December 2005 a new depot was constructed in Croydon to cope with new tender awards. During mid-2005 major reconstruction started on the Green Street Green site to make improvements and provide an expansion. During these works, a temporary base was being used at [[Sevenoaks]] in next to the base of what was Southlands Travel.

===Waterloo (RA)===
[[Waterloo, London|Waterloo]] garage operates [[Red Arrow (bus)|Red Arrow]] routes [[London Buses route 507|507]] and [[London Buses route 521|521]].<ref name=\"Busroutes\" />

====History====
The garage opened in the early 1980s as a [[Red Arrow (bus)|Red Arrow]] garage and in the 1990s had an allocation of [[AEC Routemaster]]s for [[London Buses route 11|route 11]]. The garage only operates Monday to Friday due to its proximity to residential properties.

In June 2002. the Red Arrow [[Leyland National]]s were replaced by London's first fleet of [[Mercedes-Benz Citaro]] articulated buses. Because of the extra space required to stable these, the route 11 Routemasters were transferred to Stockwell garage. In September 2009 the articulated fleet was replaced by [[Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro]]s.

===Stockwell (SW)===
As of December 2019, [[Stockwell Garage]] operated routes [[London Buses route 11|11]], [[London Buses route 77|77]], [[London Buses route 87|87]], [[London Buses route 88|88]], [[London Buses route 93|93]], [[London Buses route 118|118]], [[London Buses route 155|155]], [[London Buses route 170|170]], [[London Buses route 315|315]], [[London Buses route 322|322]], [[London Buses route 432|432]], [[London Buses route 670|670]], [[London Buses route G1|G1]], [[London Buses route N11|N11]], [[London Buses route N44|N44]], [[London Buses route N87|N87]] and [[London Buses route N155|N155]] <ref name=\"Busroutes\" />

====History====
Opened in 1952 after nearly four years of planning and building with many materials short of supply and problems re-housing residents of the houses that stood on the site.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Stockwell garage is a listed building, and when built was a masterpiece of architectural design incorporating a new roof structure that did not need supports which enabled for a {{convert|73350|sqft|m2|adj=on}} unobstructed parking space.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The offices and workshops are on the edges of the garage but do not take up any of the parking space. In the first few days of operation the garage ran just 11 buses on route 178 which had moved from Rye Lane (Peckham), but then gained more work from the next stage of the tram replacement program for which it had been designed, but it was still well short of capacity. 

More work arrived in late 1953 and early 1954 when routes 77 and 77A (now 87) moved from Victoria garage due to recruitment problems, and the closure of Nunhead which increased the PVR to 110 buses. In the early 1970s the Round London Sightseeing Tours moved to Stockwell. In 1984 Stockwell was chosen to conduct comparative testing on route 170, consisting of [[MCW Metrobus]]es, [[Leyland Titan (B15)|Leyland Titans]], [[Leyland Olympian]]s, [[Dennis Dominator]]s, and [[Volvo Ailsa]]s.

'''Arthur Richard Dillon''' (14 September 1721{{snd}}5 July 1806), [[France|French]] [[archbishop]], was the son of [[Arthur Dillon (1670-1733)]], one of the Irish [[Flight of the Wild Geese|Wild Geese]] who became a general in the [[Irish Brigade (French)|French service]].<ref>Burke's Peerage (2003) p.1148.</ref>

==Birth and origins==
Arthur Richard was born in 1721 at the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] in France. He was the youngest of the five sons of [[Arthur Dillon, Count Dillon|Arthur Dillon]] and his wife Christina Sheldon. His father was born in 1670 in Ireland, had fought for the Jacobites in the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] and had gone to France as the colonel of [[Dillon's Regiment]] with the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]] in April 1690 when Irish troops were sent to France in exchange for French troops sent to Ireland with [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Lauzun]]. He was a younger son of the [[Theobald Dillon, 7th Viscount Dillon|7th Viscount Dillon]]. His father's family was [[Normans in Ireland|Old English]] Irish and descended from Sir Henry Dillon who came to Ireland with [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in 1185.{{sfn|Webb|1878|p=[https://archive.org/details/acompendiumiris00webbgoog/page/n157/ 149, line 7]|ps=: \"...

==Life==
Arthur Richard entered the priesthood and was successively ''curé'' of Elan near [[Charleville-Mézières|Mézières]], vicar-general of [[Pontoise]] (1747), [[bishop of Evreux]] (1753) and [[archbishop of Toulouse]] (1758), [[archbishop of Narbonne]] in 1763, and in that capacity, president of the estates of [[Languedoc]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Dillon, Arthur Richard|volume=8|page=273}}</ref>

He devoted himself much less to the spiritual direction of his [[diocese]] than to its temporal welfare, carrying out many works of public utility, bridges, canals, roads, harbours, etc.; he had chairs of chemistry and of physics created at [[Montpellier]] and at [[Toulouse]], and tried to reduce poverty, especially in Narbonne.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>

From about the age of fifty, until she died in 1804 shortly before Dillon, he lived with his wealthy, widowed niece, Madame de Rothe, daughter of [[Lucius Cary, 6th Viscount Falkland]]. The pair were considered to be lovers, an arrangement considered scandalous even by the jaded standards of the day. They maintained a household primarily at the chateau [[Hautefontaine]], where Dillon kept an extravagant hunt. His great-niece [[Thérèse-Lucy de Dillon]], daughter of Madame de Rothe, was a favourite of the [[Marie Antoinette|queen]].

In 1787 and in 1788 he was a member of the Assembly of Notables called together by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and in 1788 presided over the assembly of the clergy.

==Exile and death==
Having refused to accept the [[civil constitution of the clergy]], Dillon had to leave Narbonne in 1790, then to emigrate (accompanied by de Rothe) to [[Coblenz]] in 1791. Soon afterwards he and de Rothe fled to [[London]], where they lived until his death in 1806, never accepting the [[Concordat of 1801]], which had suppressed his archiepiscopal see.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He died at his mansion in George Street, Portman Square, and was buried  in St Pancras churchyard, which, with no official Catholic cemetery available, was the favoured burial place for the dead émigré community.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Geer|editor1-first=Walter|title=Recollections of the revolution and the empire, from the French of the \"Journal d'une femme de cinquante ans\"|date=1920|publisher=Walter Geer|location=New York|page=283|url=https://archive.org/stream/recollectionsofr00latouoft/recollectionsofr00latouoft_djvu.txt|accessdate=16 May 2016|format=txt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bingham|first1=David|title=The Archbishop of Narbonne's Teeth; Arthur Richard Dillon, 1721{{snd}}1806, St Pancras burial ground|url=http://thelondondead.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/the-archbishop-of-narbonnes-teeth.html|website=The London Dead|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=30 April 2014}}</ref>

==Cemetery excavation==
Between March 2002 and June 2003, part of the [[St Pancras Old Church]] graveyard was excavated<ref>Emery, P.A., and Wooldridge, K., 2011, St Pancras burial ground: excavations for St Pancras International, the London terminus of [[High Speed 1]], 2002-3, Gifford (now Ramboll) Monograph</ref> in preparation for the London terminus of the [[Channel Tunnel]] Rail Link.  During archaeological investigation, Dillon's body was found to have been buried wearing a set of [[porcelain]] [[dentures]]. It is believed that he purchased them from a Parisian dentist named Nicholas de Chemant.<ref>Powers, N.I., 2006 ‘Archaeological evidence for dental innovation: an 18th-century porcelain dental prosthesis belonging to Archbishop Arthur Richard Dillon’, Brit Dental J 201, 459-63</ref> 

The body of Archbishop Dillon was returned to France in March 2007 and now lies in [[Narbonne Cathedral]].<ref>Commission Archéologique et Littéraire de Narbonne, 2008, Arthur-Richard Dillon, dernier Président-Né des Etats de Languedoc, de 1763 à 1790, Bulletin de la Commission Archéologique et Littéraire de Narbonne 51, 27-36</ref> On 19 May 2008, the porcelain dentures were accessioned into the [http://www.cobbecollection.co.uk Cobbe Museum] (currently housed at Hatchlands, East Clandon).

Dillon's name remains listed as one of the important missing graves on the [[Burdett-Coutts memorial]] in [[Old St. Pancras]] Churchyard.

==Birth and origins==
Arthur Richard was born in 1721 at the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] in France. He was the youngest of the five sons of [[Arthur Dillon, Count Dillon|Arthur Dillon]] and his wife Christina Sheldon. His father was born in 1670 in Ireland, had fought for the Jacobites in the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]] and had gone to France as the colonel of [[Dillon's Regiment]] with the [[Irish Brigade (France)|Irish Brigade]] in April 1690 when Irish troops were sent to France in exchange for French troops sent to Ireland with [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Lauzun]]. He was a younger son of the [[Theobald Dillon, 7th Viscount Dillon|7th Viscount Dillon]]. His father's family was [[Normans in Ireland|Old English]] Irish and descended from Sir Henry Dillon who came to Ireland with [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in 1185.{{sfn|Webb|1878|p=[https://archive.org/details/acompendiumiris00webbgoog/page/n157/ 149, line 7]|ps=: \"...

She was a [[Maids of Honour|maid of honour]] to Queen [[Mary of Modena]], wife of [[James II of England|James II]].{{sfn|Burke|1949|p=[https://archive.org/details/burkesgenealogic1949unse/page/603/ 603, right column, line 73]|ps=: \"He m.

==Life==
Arthur Richard entered the priesthood and was successively ''curé'' of Elan near [[Charleville-Mézières|Mézières]], vicar-general of [[Pontoise]] (1747), [[bishop of Evreux]] (1753) and [[archbishop of Toulouse]] (1758), [[archbishop of Narbonne]] in 1763, and in that capacity, president of the estates of [[Languedoc]].<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Dillon, Arthur Richard|volume=8|page=273}}</ref>

He devoted himself much less to the spiritual direction of his [[diocese]] than to its temporal welfare, carrying out many works of public utility, bridges, canals, roads, harbours, etc.; he had chairs of chemistry and of physics created at [[Montpellier]] and at [[Toulouse]], and tried to reduce poverty, especially in Narbonne.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>

From about the age of fifty, until she died in 1804 shortly before Dillon, he lived with his wealthy, widowed niece, Madame de Rothe, daughter of [[Lucius Cary, 6th Viscount Falkland]]. The pair were considered to be lovers, an arrangement considered scandalous even by the jaded standards of the day. They maintained a household primarily at the chateau [[Hautefontaine]], where Dillon kept an extravagant hunt. His great-niece [[Thérèse-Lucy de Dillon]], daughter of Madame de Rothe, was a favourite of the [[Marie Antoinette|queen]].

In 1787 and in 1788 he was a member of the Assembly of Notables called together by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and in 1788 presided over the assembly of the clergy.

==Exile and death==
Having refused to accept the [[civil constitution of the clergy]], Dillon had to leave Narbonne in 1790, then to emigrate (accompanied by de Rothe) to [[Coblenz]] in 1791. Soon afterwards he and de Rothe fled to [[London]], where they lived until his death in 1806, never accepting the [[Concordat of 1801]], which had suppressed his archiepiscopal see.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He died at his mansion in George Street, Portman Square, and was buried  in St Pancras churchyard, which, with no official Catholic cemetery available, was the favoured burial place for the dead émigré community.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Geer|editor1-first=Walter|title=Recollections of the revolution and the empire, from the French of the \"Journal d'une femme de cinquante ans\"|date=1920|publisher=Walter Geer|location=New York|page=283|url=https://archive.org/stream/recollectionsofr00latouoft/recollectionsofr00latouoft_djvu.txt|accessdate=16 May 2016|format=txt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bingham|first1=David|title=The Archbishop of Narbonne's Teeth; Arthur Richard Dillon, 1721{{snd}}1806, St Pancras burial ground|url=http://thelondondead.blogspot.com.au/2014/04/the-archbishop-of-narbonnes-teeth.html|website=The London Dead|accessdate=16 May 2016|date=30 April 2014}}</ref>

==Cemetery excavation==
Between March 2002 and June 2003, part of the [[St Pancras Old Church]] graveyard was excavated<ref>Emery, P.A., and Wooldridge, K., 2011, St Pancras burial ground: excavations for St Pancras International, the London terminus of [[High Speed 1]], 2002-3, Gifford (now Ramboll) Monograph</ref> in preparation for the London terminus of the [[Channel Tunnel]] Rail Link.  During archaeological investigation, Dillon's body was found to have been buried wearing a set of [[porcelain]] [[dentures]]. It is believed that he purchased them from a Parisian dentist named Nicholas de Chemant.<ref>Powers, N.I., 2006 ‘Archaeological evidence for dental innovation: an 18th-century porcelain dental prosthesis belonging to Archbishop Arthur Richard Dillon’, Brit Dental J 201, 459-63</ref> 

The body of Archbishop Dillon was returned to France in March 2007 and now lies in [[Narbonne Cathedral]].<ref>Commission Archéologique et Littéraire de Narbonne, 2008, Arthur-Richard Dillon, dernier Président-Né des Etats de Languedoc, de 1763 à 1790, Bulletin de la Commission Archéologique et Littéraire de Narbonne 51, 27-36</ref> On 19 May 2008, the porcelain dentures were accessioned into the [http://www.cobbecollection.co.uk Cobbe Museum] (currently housed at Hatchlands, East Clandon).

Dillon's name remains listed as one of the important missing graves on the [[Burdett-Coutts memorial]] in [[Old St. Pancras]] Churchyard.

A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a \"[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]\", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.<ref>Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''</ref>

==Early examples==
An early example of the romance genre<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2}}</ref> with multiple twists<ref>{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=93, 95, 97}}</ref> was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale \"[[The Three Apples]]\". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

==Mechanics==
{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.<ref name=\"Baldick2008\">{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}</ref> Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and [[Incest|marries his mother in ignorance]], learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.<ref>John MacFarlane, \"Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis.\" ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.</ref> The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in \"[[The Three Apples]]\", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.<ref name=Pinault>{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}</ref><ref name=Marzolph>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}</ref>

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he did not survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the 1957 movie ''[[Witness for the Prosecution (1957 film)]]'', the plot follows a murder lawsuit in which an experienced star lawyer successfully contends an acquittal by exposing the incriminating statements made by the accused's wife as false. In the twist it is revealed that the wife deceived the jury and the main character actually committed the murder. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled \"[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]\", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].<!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--> In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event,<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}</ref> surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}</ref> This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 }}</ref> Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', the 1920 German silent horror film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
[[Peripeteia]] is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.<ref name=\"PayneBarbera2010\">{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}</ref> Unlike the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode \"[[Time Enough at Last]]\" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===''Deus ex machina''===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning \"god from the machine.\" It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.<ref name=\"Shipley1964\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}</ref> In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the \"deus ex machina\" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. The term is now used pejoratively for any improbable or unexpected contrivance by which an author resolves the complications of the plot in a play or novel, and which has not been convincingly prepared for in the preceding action; the discovery of a lost will was a favorite resort of Victorian novelists.<ref>{{ citation | last1 = Baldick | first1 = Chris | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms | location = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-860883-7 }}</ref>

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.<ref name=\"Asong2012\">{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}</ref> This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named \"Bishop Aringarosa\" draw attention away from the true master villain (\"Aringarosa\" literally translates as \"pink herring\"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel ''[[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]]'' (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins. Another instance is ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'''s Marion Crane (portrayed by [[Janet Leigh]]), who is brutally murdered early in the film. A contemporary example is the character of Charlie in ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'', who is killed before the end of the first hour.

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.<ref name=\"Steiff2011\">{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}</ref> This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. ''[[The Aeneid]]'', another [[epic poem]], uses a similar approach; it begins with the main protagonist, [[Aeneas]], telling stories about the end of the [[Trojan War]] and the first half of his journey to [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.<ref>Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc. Productions |publisher=Plotsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.<ref name=\"Philips2006\">{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}</ref> Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a \"twist ending\". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' and the [[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

A plot twist may be [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]], to prepare the audience to accept it. There are a variety of methods used to execute a plot twist, such as withholding information from the audience or misleading them with ambiguous or false information.

Revealing a plot twist to readers or viewers in advance is commonly regarded as a \"[[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]\", since the effectiveness of a plot twist usually relies on the audience not expecting it. Even revealing the fact that a work contains plot twists – especially at the ending – can also be controversial, as it changes the audience's expectations. However, at least one study suggests that this does not affect the enjoyment of a work.<ref>Jonah Lehrer, [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/08/spoilers-dont-spoil-anything/ Spoilers Don’t Spoil Anything], '' Wired Science Blogs''</ref>

==Early examples==
An early example of the romance genre<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–2}}</ref> with multiple twists<ref>{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=93, 95, 97}}</ref> was the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale \"[[The Three Apples]]\". It begins with a fisherman discovering a locked chest. The first twist occurs when the chest is broken open and a dead body is found inside. The initial search for the murderer fails, and a twist occurs when two men appear, separately claiming to be the murderer. A complex chain of events finally reveals the murderer to be the investigator's own slave.

==Mechanics==
{{section refimprove|date=September 2014}}
Literary analysts have identified several common categories of plot twists, based on how they are executed.

===Anagnorisis===
''[[Anagnorisis]]'', or discovery, is the protagonist's sudden recognition of their own or another character's true identity or nature.<ref name=\"Baldick2008\">{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&pg=PA12|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=12}}</ref> Through this technique, previously unforeseen character information is revealed. A notable example of anagnorisis occurs in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'': [[Oedipus]] kills his father and [[Incest|marries his mother in ignorance]], learning the truth only toward the climax of the play.<ref>John MacFarlane, \"Aristotle's Definition of Anagnorisis.\" ''American Journal of Philology'' - Volume 121, Number 3 (Whole Number 483), Fall 2000, pp. 367-383.</ref> The earliest use of this device as a twist ending in a [[crime fiction|murder mystery]] was in \"[[The Three Apples]]\", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale, where the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] discovers by chance a key item towards the end of the story that reveals the culprit behind the murder to be his own slave all along.<ref name=Pinault>{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}</ref><ref name=Marzolph>{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}</ref>

In [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s 1999 film ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'', a main character, who struggles with his failure to help a former patient who shot him, resolves his conflict by helping a boy who believes he communicates with dead people, only to discover that he did not survive the shooting and is one of the dead people being helped. In the 2001 film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]],'' a mother is convinced that her house is being haunted; at the end of the film, she learns that she and her children are really the ghosts. In the 1957 movie ''[[Witness_for_the_Prosecution_(1957_film)]]'', the plot follows a murder lawsuit in which an experienced star lawyer successfully contends an acquittal by exposing the incriminating statements made by the accused's wife as false. In the twist it is revealed that the wife deceived the jury and the main character actually committed the murder. In the episode of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' titled \"[[Five Characters in Search of an Exit]]\", the viewer discovers at the climax that the characters are discarded toys in a [[clothing bin|donation bin]].<!-- This fact is self evident by watching the episode.--> In ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]'', [[Edward Norton]]'s character realizes that Tyler Durden ([[Brad Pitt]]) is his own [[multiple personality]]. A mental patient in the horror film ''[[The Ward (film)|The Ward]]'' reveals that the three persons she is talking to are all actually herself. Sometimes the audience may discover that the true identity of a character is, in fact, unknown, as in ''[[Layer Cake (film)|Layer Cake]]'' or the eponymous assassins in ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]''.

===Flashback===
[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]], or analepsis, a sudden, vivid reversion to a past event,<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&pg=PA13|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=13}}</ref> surprises the reader with previously unknown information that solves a mystery, places a character in a different light, or reveals the reason for a previously inexplicable action. The [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' employed this type of surprise ending. Sometimes this is combined with the above category, as the flashback may reveal the true identity of one of the characters, or that the protagonist is related to one of the villain's past victims, as [[Sergio Leone]] did with [[Charles Bronson]]'s character in ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' or [[Frederick Forsyth]]'s ''[[The Odessa File]]''.

===Unreliable narrator===
An [[unreliable narrator]] twists the ending by revealing, almost always at the end of the narrative, that the narrator has manipulated or fabricated the preceding story, thus forcing the reader to question their prior assumptions about the text.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Baldick|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mp0s9GgrafUC&pg=PA347|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-920827-2|page=347}}</ref> This [[Motif (literature)|motif]] is often used within [[noir fiction]] and [[Film noir|films]], notably in the film ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. An unreliable narrator motif was employed by Agatha Christie in ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]'', a novel that generated much controversy due to critics' contention that it was unfair to trick the reader in such a manipulative manner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011224193140/http://my.en.com/~mcq/unreliable.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2001-12-24 |title=The ubiquitous unreliable narrator |publisher=My.en.com |date=1996-03-26 |accessdate=2012-12-10 }}</ref> Another example of unreliable narration is a character who has been revealed to be insane and thus causes the audience to question the previous narrative; notable examples of this are in the [[Terry Gilliam]] film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'', [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' (and [[David Fincher]]'s [[Fight Club|film adaptation]]), [[Gene Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Book of the New Sun]]'', the second episode of ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', the 1920 German silent horror film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'', [[Iain Pears]]'s ''[[An Instance of the Fingerpost]]'', ''[[Shutter Island (film)|Shutter Island]]'' and [[Kim Newman]]'s ''[[Life's Lottery]]''.

===Peripeteia===
[[Peripeteia]] is a sudden reversal of the protagonist's fortune, whether for good or ill, that emerges naturally from the character's circumstances.<ref name=\"PayneBarbera2010\">{{cite book|author1=Michael Payne|author2=Jessica Rae Barbera|title=A Dictionary of Cultural and Critical Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjSl5y_i8TEC&pg=PA689|accessdate=23 July 2013|date=31 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-2346-7|page=689}}</ref> Unlike the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' device, peripeteia must be logical within the frame of the story. An example of a reversal for ill would be [[Agamemnon]]'s sudden murder at the hands of his wife [[Clytemnestra]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[The Oresteia]]'' or the inescapable situation [[Kate Hudson]]'s character finds herself in at the end of ''[[The Skeleton Key]]''. This type of ending was a common twist ending utilised by ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', most effectively in the episode \"[[Time Enough at Last]]\" where [[Burgess Meredith]]'s character is robbed of all his hope by a simple but devastating accident with his glasses. A positive reversal of fortune would be Nicholas Van Orton's suicide attempt after mistakenly believing himself to have accidentally killed his brother, only to land safely in the midst of his own birthday party, in the film ''[[The Game (1997 film)|The Game]]''.

===''Deus ex machina''===
''[[Deus ex machina]]'' is a Latin term meaning \"god from the machine.\" It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot.<ref name=\"Shipley1964\">{{cite book|author=Joseph Twadell Shipley|title=Dictionary of World Literature: Criticism, Forms, Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlUVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=1964|publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=156|id=GGKEY:GL0NUL09LL7}}</ref> In [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Ancient Greek theater]], the \"deus ex machina\" ('ἀπὸ μηχανῆς θεός') was the character of a Greek god literally brought onto the stage via a crane (μηχανῆς—''mechanes''), after which a seemingly insoluble problem is brought to a satisfactory resolution by the god's will. The term is now used pejoratively for any improbable or unexpected contrivance by which an author resolves the complications of the plot in a play or novel, and which has not been convincingly prepared for in the preceding action; the discovery of a lost will was a favorite resort of Victorian novelists.<ref>{{ citation | last1 = Baldick | first1 = Chris | title = The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms | location = Oxford | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-19-860883-7 }}</ref>

===Red herring===
A [[red herring]] is a false clue intended to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution.<ref name=\"Asong2012\">{{cite book|author=Linus Asong|title=Detective Fiction and the African Scene: From the Whodunit? to the Whydunit?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DGH1BpSyI2AC&pg=PA31|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=978-9956-727-02-5|page=31}}</ref> This device usually appears in [[detective fiction|detective novels]] and [[mystery fiction]]. The red herring is a type of [[wikt:misdirection|misdirection]], a device intended to distract the [[protagonist]], and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film ''[[Gupt: The Hidden Truth]]'' cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as red herrings in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', the misdeeds of a key character named \"Bishop Aringarosa\" draw attention away from the true master villain (\"Aringarosa\" literally translates as \"pink herring\"). In the [[William Diehl]] novel ''[[Primal Fear (novel)|Primal Fear]]'' (also adapted into a [[Primal Fear (film)|film]]), a defendant named [[Aaron Stampler]] is accused of brutally murdering the Archbishop of Chicago. He is revealed to have a [[dissociative identity disorder]], and is not executed on plea of insanity. Near the end, Aaron's lawyer discovers that he feigned his insanity to avoid the death penalty. Agatha Christie's classic ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A red herring can also be used as a form of false [[foreshadowing]].

=== False protagonist ===
A [[false protagonist]] is a character presented at the start of the story as the main character, but then disposed of, usually killing them. An example is the film ''[[Executive Decision]]'', in which the [[Special forces|special-forces]] team leader, played by highly-billed action star [[Steven Seagal]], is killed shortly after their mission begins. Another instance is ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'''s Marion Crane (portrayed by [[Janet Leigh]]), who is brutally murdered early in the film. A contemporary example is the character of Charlie in ''[[Hereditary (film)|Hereditary]]'', who is killed before the end of the first hour.

===Non-linear narrative===
A [[non-linear narrative]] works by revealing plot and character in non-chronological order.<ref name=\"Steiff2011\">{{cite book|author=Josef Steiff|title=Sherlock Holmes and Philosophy: The Footprints of a Gigantic Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vq24xAyfoq0C&pg=PA96|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9731-5|page=96}}</ref> This technique requires the reader to attempt to piece together the timeline in order to fully understand the story. A twist ending can occur as the result of information that is held until the climax and which places characters or events in a different perspective. Some of the earliest known uses of non-linear story telling occur in ''[[The Odyssey]]'', a work that is largely told in flashback via the narrator [[Odysseus]]. ''[[The Aeneid]]'', another [[epic poem]], uses a similar approach; it begins with the main protagonist, [[Aeneas]], telling stories about the end of the [[Trojan War]] and the first half of his journey to [[Dido]], queen of [[Carthage]]. The nonlinear approach has been used in works such as the films ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'', ''[[Sin City (film)|Sin City]]'', ''[[Premonition (2007 film)|Premonition]]'', ''[[Arrival (film)|Arrival]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'', the television shows [[Lost (TV series)|''Lost'']], ''[[How I Met Your Mother (TV series)|How I Met Your Mother]]'' (especially in many episodes in the later seasons), ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'', ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]'' and the book ''[[Catch-22]]''.<ref>Adrienne Redd, [http://prosetoad.blogspot.com/2006/01/nonlinear-films-and-anticausality-of.html Nonlinear films and the anticausality of Mulholland Dr.], '' Prose Toad Literary Blog''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_02.html |title=Plots Inc. Productions |publisher=Plotsinc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-10}}</ref>

===Reverse chronology===
[[Reverse chronology]] works by revealing the plot in reverse order, i.e., from final event to initial event.<ref name=\"Philips2006\">{{cite book|author=John Edward Philips|title=Writing African History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pq5wGaae5qkC&pg=PA507|accessdate=23 July 2013|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press|isbn=978-1-58046-256-3|page=507}}</ref> Unlike chronological storylines, which progress through causes before reaching a final effect, reverse chronological storylines reveal the final effect before tracing the causes leading up to it; therefore, the initial cause represents a \"twist ending\". Examples employing this technique include the films ''[[Irréversible]]'', ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'', ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' and ''[[5x2]]'', the play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' by [[Harold Pinter]], and [[Martin Amis]]' ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]''. [[Stephen Sondheim]] and [[George Furth|George Furth's]] ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'' and the [[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|1934 Kaufman and Hart play]] that inspired it both tell the story of the main characters in reverse order.

The 1985 [[World Chess Championship]] was played between [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Garry Kasparov]] in [[Moscow]] from September 3 to November 9, 1985. Kasparov won, to become the thirteenth and youngest world champion at the age of 22.<ref name=\"GK bio\">{{cite web

==Background==
It is difficult to view the 1985 [[World Chess Championship]] in isolation, following as it did only 7 months after the highly controversial finish of the [[World Chess Championship 1984|1984 championship]] between the same players.  On 8 February 1985, after 48 games had been contested over 5 months, the 1984 championship was abandoned with no result, becoming the first, and thus far only, chess world championship to finish in this way.<ref>{{cite web

[[Politics]] gave another angle to the Kasparov-Karpov encounters.  Due to the changing political climate in Russia at the time, the matches were often depicted as a clash of ideologies, between \"new Russia\" represented by Kasparov and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and \"old Russia\" represented by Karpov and [[Communist]]s such as [[Leonid Brezhnev]].<ref>{{cite news

===The players===
At the time of the match, Karpov had a [[ELO rating system#FIDE ratings|FIDE rating]] of 2720, while Kasparov was close behind with a rating of 2700. There was a large difference in age between the two players, with Karpov (34) the older by 12 years.

Between the end of the 1984 match and the start of the 1985 match, Kasparov played matches against [[Robert Hübner]] in Germany, winning three games and [[draw (chess)|drawing]] three, and against [[Ulf Andersson]] in Sweden, winning two games and drawing four.<ref name=\"MW\">{{cite web

Karpov also showed that he was still in good form when he won the 1985 OHRA tournament in [[Amsterdam]] with 7/10, not losing a game<ref>{{cite web

|accessdate = 25 September 2016}}</ref>

As in previous World Chess Championships, each of the contestants employed other chess players as \"seconds\" to help with preparation and analysis of [[Adjournment (games)#Chess|adjourned]] games. Karpov's seconds were [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] [[Sergei Makarichev]] and [[Igor Zaitsev]].  Other assistance was provided by [[Efim Geller]] and [[Evgeni Vasiukov]].  Kasparov's seconds were Grandmaster [[Josif Dorfman]] and Alexander Nikitin with [[Gennadi Timoshchenko]] and [[Evgeny Vladimirov]] also helping.

===The match===

The 1985 championships represented a restart of the abandoned match.  Due to the extreme duration of the previous match, [[FIDE]] agreed at a meeting in [[Tunisia]] in July 1985 that the re-arranged championship would be of fixed length, played as the best of 24 games.  If the match had ended at a 12-12 draw, Karpov would have retained his title.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/view/1985karpov-vs-kasparov-game-24-kasparov-becames-wcc|title=1985:Karpov vs Kasparov game 24 (Kasparov becames WCC) - Chess Forums - Chess.com|work=Chess.com|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}</ref>  As Karpov had been leading the 1984 championships, he was also granted an automatic [[World_Chess_Championship_1986|rematch]] if he lost.<ref name=\"MW\" />

The playing regulations were that 40 moves should be made by each player in 2 hours 30 minutes, with games being adjourned to the following day after 40 moves were completed.<ref name=\"SI\">{{cite news

Kasparov's preferred venue was [[Leningrad]] and bids for the match had been received from [[London]] and [[Marseille]].  In the end, with the backing of the [[Soviet Chess Federation]], [[FIDE]] selected Moscow's [[Tchaikovsky Concert Hall]] as the venue for the match.<ref name=\"MW\" />
  
The opening ceremony was held on 2 September, at which the draw for colours was made and won by Kasparov.  This meant that he took the white pieces in Game 1, which started on 3 September 1985.<ref name = \"MW\" />

===Game 1 and 2 - Karpov \"stunned\"===
In Kasparov's own words, his choice of opening for '''game 1''' \"stunned\" Karpov,<ref name = \"K86p1\">Kasparov 1986, p. 1</ref> as the position after only 4 moves was one that had not appeared in any of their previous games.  Indeed, the position after move 5 had never previously appeared in any game that Karpov had played, and Karpov's first five moves took him 50 minutes to play.<ref name = \"K86p1\" /> Kasparov won the game in 42 moves.

Karpov took White in '''game 2''', which was drawn in 65 moves.  Kasparov's analysis suggests that he could have won the game.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 8-10</ref>

===Games 3 to 5 - Karpov turns the tables===
'''Game 3''' was again drawn, this time in only 20 moves with few chances for either side.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 11-13</ref>
'''Game 4''' was won by Karpov as White in 63 moves.  Kasparov noted that \"the entire plan [after Black's 21st move] was put into practice by Karpov extremely strongly and consistently.\"<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 18</ref>
In '''game 5''', Kasparov played with the white pieces and made a number of mistakes and Karpov won in 41 moves. This meant that Karpov had moved from a one-point deficit to a one-point lead in just three days.<ref name = \"K86p22\">Kasparov 1986, p. 22</ref>

Kasparov resolved at this stage \"to play as resolutely as possible\" and \"to go in for a complicated struggle in order to regain the match initiative and if possible wear out my opponent\".<ref name = \"K86p22\" />

Kasparov reports speaking to [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] [[Andras Adorjan]] after game 10, lamenting the opportunities he felt he had missed in games 7, 9 and 10.  Adorjan stated 'The main thing is not the score, but the trend, which, in my opinion is favourable'.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 41</ref> Adorjan's statement came true in game 11, which was won by Kasparov in just 25 moves, following an oversight by Karpov on move 22.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 42-46</ref><ref>[http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2010/09/kasparov-karpov-game-analysis-video-by.html#links Video about the game]</ref>

Games 12, 13 and 15 were all drawn quickly.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 47-52, 57-59</ref>  '''Game 14''' also ended in a draw after forceful and accurate play on both sides.  Kasparov later rated game 14 as \"perhaps the 'cleanest' game of the match\".<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 56</ref>

So the scores after 15 games were level at 7½ - 7½, and the match was already past the halfway point.

===Game 16 - Kasparov's masterpiece===
The first 10 moves of '''game 16''' were identical to those from game 12.  Karpov was the first to deviate, but Kasparov had analysed the position deeply in his preparation before the match, and was able to take the initiative, despite playing with the black pieces.

Kasparov's positioning of a knight deep in his opponent's position as early as move 16 (see first diagram) was spectacular and ultimately decisive.  The knight remained in place until move 34, when Karpov was forced to [[sacrifice]] his [[queen (chess)|queen]] to remove it.

The game progressed as follows (notes based on Kasparov's analysis):

===Games 17 to 23 - Honours even===
Games 17 and 18 were short draws.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 66-69</ref> In '''game 19''' Karpov, with the black pieces, adopted an unusual opening strategy<ref>\"Karpov directs the game along almost unknown lines as early as the 4th move\" Kasparov 1986, p. 70</ref> which eventually backfired on him. Kasparov won the game in 42 moves, to extend his lead to 2 points.  With Kasparov now needing only four draws from five games to become World Champion, Karpov needed to start winning games.

In '''Game 20''', Karpov fought hard to force a victory, but was unable to win the game, and a draw was agreed after 85 moves.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 74-77</ref>  '''Game 21''' also ended in a draw, this time with Kasparov generally in the ascendancy for the majority of the game.<ref>\"In this game I had a very real chance of gaining my twelfth point\" Kasparov 1986, p. 81</ref>

In '''Game 22''', Kasparov made a serious mistake from a good position, and lost the game after further mistakes from both sides.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 82-85</ref>

'''Game 23''' ended in a draw, leaving Kasparov on 12 points against Karpov's 11.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 86-88</ref>  Karpov needed to win with the white pieces to retain the title.

===Game 24 - Karpov's must-win game===
Kasparov called '''game 24''' the \"game of his life\" and has stated that working out the strategy for this encounter was difficult for him.  His playing style did not lend itself to playing for a draw, so he decided to accept an open battle, with chances on both sides.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 89</ref>

Karpov began a direct attack on Kasparov's king as early as move 15, and had chances to build up a strong attack.  Kasparov sacrificed a pawn to blunt the attack and then a second pawn to launch a blistering counterattack. Under pressure from the clock, Karpov made decisive errors on move 36<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 94</ref>  and move 40. Kasparov won the World Championship after Karpov resigned on move 42.

==Results==

The match was played as the best of 24 games. If it had ended 12-12, Karpov would have retained his title.

The 1985 [[World Chess Championship]] was played between [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Garry Kasparov]] in [[Moscow]] from September 3 to November 9, 1985. Kasparov won, to become the thirteenth and youngest world champion at the age of 22.<ref name=\"GK bio\">{{cite web

==Background==
It is difficult to view the 1985 [[World Chess Championship]] in isolation, following as it did only 7 months after the highly controversial finish of the [[World Chess Championship 1984|1984 championship]] between the same players.  On 8 February 1985, after 48 games had been contested over 5 months, the 1984 championship was abandoned with no result, becoming the first, and thus far only, chess world championship to finish in this way.<ref>{{cite web

[[Politics]] gave another angle to the Kasparov-Karpov encounters.  Due to the changing political climate in Russia at the time, the matches were often depicted as a clash of ideologies, between \"new Russia\" represented by Kasparov and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and \"old Russia\" represented by Karpov and [[Communist]]s such as [[Leonid Brezhnev]].<ref>{{cite news

===The players===
At the time of the match, Karpov had a [[ELO rating system#FIDE ratings|FIDE rating]] of 2720, while Kasparov was close behind with a rating of 2700. There was a large difference in age between the two players, with Karpov (34) the older by 12 years.

Between the end of the 1984 match and the start of the 1985 match, Kasparov played matches against [[Robert Hübner]] in Germany, winning three games and [[draw (chess)|drawing]] three, and against [[Ulf Andersson]] in Sweden, winning two games and drawing four.<ref name=\"MW\">{{cite web

|accessdate = 1 November 2009}}</ref>

Karpov also showed that he was still in good form when he won the 1985 OHRA tournament in [[Amsterdam]] with 7/10, not losing a game<ref>{{cite web
|title = Review of ''Garry Kasparov on Modern Chess''

As in previous World Chess Championships, each of the contestants employed other chess players as \"seconds\" to help with preparation and analysis of [[Adjournment (games)#Chess|adjourned]] games. Karpov's seconds were [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmasters]] [[Sergei Makarichev]] and [[Igor Zaitsev]].  Other assistance was provided by [[Efim Geller]] and [[Evgeni Vasiukov]].  Kasparov's seconds were Grandmaster [[Josif Dorfman]] and Alexander Nikitin with [[Gennadi Timoshchenko]] and [[Evgeny Vladimirov]] also helping.

===The match===

The 1985 championships represented a restart of the abandoned match.  Due to the extreme duration of the previous match, [[FIDE]] agreed at a meeting in [[Tunisia]] in July 1985 that the re-arranged championship would be of fixed length, played as the best of 24 games.  If the match had ended at a 12-12 draw, Karpov would have retained his title.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chess.com/clubs/forum/view/1985karpov-vs-kasparov-game-24-kasparov-becames-wcc|title=1985:Karpov vs Kasparov game 24 (Kasparov becames WCC) - Chess Forums - Chess.com|work=Chess.com|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en-US}}</ref>  As Karpov had been leading the 1984 championships, he was also granted an automatic [[World_Chess_Championship_1986|rematch]] if he lost.<ref name=\"MW\" />

The playing regulations were that 40 moves should be made by each player in 2 hours 30 minutes, with games being adjourned to the following day after 40 moves were completed.<ref name=\"SI\">{{cite news

Kasparov's preferred venue was [[Leningrad]] and bids for the match had been received from [[London]] and [[Marseille]].  In the end, with the backing of the [[Soviet Chess Federation]], [[FIDE]] selected Moscow's [[Tchaikovsky Concert Hall]] as the venue for the match.<ref name=\"MW\" />
  
The opening ceremony was held on 2 September, at which the draw for colours was made and won by Kasparov.  This meant that he took the white pieces in Game 1, which started on 3 September 1985.<ref name = \"MW\" />

===Game 1 and 2 - Karpov \"stunned\"===
In Kasparov's own words, his choice of opening for '''game 1''' \"stunned\" Karpov,<ref name = \"K86p1\">Kasparov 1986, p. 1</ref> as the position after only 4 moves was one that had not appeared in any of their previous games.  Indeed, the position after move 5 had never previously appeared in any game that Karpov had played, and Karpov's first five moves took him 50 minutes to play.<ref name = \"K86p1\" /> Kasparov won the game in 42 moves.

Karpov took White in '''game 2''', which was drawn in 65 moves.  Kasparov's analysis suggests that he could have won the game.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 8-10</ref>

===Games 3 to 5 - Karpov turns the tables===
'''Game 3''' was again drawn, this time in only 20 moves with few chances for either side.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 11-13</ref>
'''Game 4''' was won by Karpov as White in 63 moves.  Kasparov noted that \"the entire plan [after Black's 21st move] was put into practice by Karpov extremely strongly and consistently.\"<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 18</ref>
In '''game 5''', Kasparov played with the white pieces and made a number of mistakes and Karpov won in 41 moves. This meant that Karpov had moved from a one-point deficit to a one-point lead in just three days.<ref name = \"K86p22\">Kasparov 1986, p. 22</ref>

Kasparov resolved at this stage \"to play as resolutely as possible\" and \"to go in for a complicated struggle in order to regain the match initiative and if possible wear out my opponent\".<ref name = \"K86p22\" />

===Games 17 to 23 - Honours even===
Games 17 and 18 were short draws.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 66-69</ref> In '''game 19''' Karpov, with the black pieces, adopted an unusual opening strategy<ref>\"Karpov directs the game along almost unknown lines as early as the 4th move\" Kasparov 1986, p. 70</ref> which eventually backfired on him. Kasparov won the game in 42 moves, to extend his lead to 2 points.  With Kasparov now needing only four draws from five games to become World Champion, Karpov needed to start winning games.

In '''Game 20''', Karpov fought hard to force a victory, but was unable to win the game, and a draw was agreed after 85 moves.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 74-77</ref>  '''Game 21''' also ended in a draw, this time with Kasparov generally in the ascendancy for the majority of the game.<ref>\"In this game I had a very real chance of gaining my twelfth point\" Kasparov 1986, p. 81</ref>

In '''Game 22''', Kasparov made a serious mistake from a good position, and lost the game after further mistakes from both sides.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 82-85</ref>

'''Game 23''' ended in a draw, leaving Kasparov on 12 points against Karpov's 11.<ref>Kasparov 1986, pp. 86-88</ref>  Karpov needed to win with the white pieces to retain the title.

===Game 24 - Karpov's must-win game===
Kasparov called '''game 24''' the \"game of his life\" and has stated that working out the strategy for this encounter was difficult for him.  His playing style did not lend itself to playing for a draw, so he decided to accept an open battle, with chances on both sides.<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 89</ref>

Karpov began a direct attack on Kasparov's king as early as move 15, and had chances to build up a strong attack.  Kasparov sacrificed a pawn to blunt the attack and then a second pawn to launch a blistering counterattack. Under pressure from the clock, Karpov made decisive errors on move 36<ref>Kasparov 1986, p. 94</ref>  and move 40. Kasparov won the World Championship after Karpov resigned on move 42.

==Results==

The match was played as the best of 24 games. If it had ended 12-12, Karpov would have retained his title.

'''Paulo Assunção da Silva''' (born 25 January 1980), known as '''Assunção''', is a Brazilian retired professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]].

He was best known for his positioning and tackling, and also held a [[Portuguese nationality law|Portuguese passport]] due to the many years in spent in the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfp.es/competiciones/inscripciones/inscripciones2.asp?div=1|title=Inscripciones|trans-title=Registrations|publisher=[[Liga de Fútbol Profesional]]|language=Spanish|date=2008|accessdate=19 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731033632/http://www.lfp.es/competiciones/inscripciones/inscripciones2.asp?div=1|archive-date=31 July 2008}}</ref> mainly at the service of [[FC Porto|Porto]]. He also played four years in [[La Liga]] with [[Atlético Madrid]], winning two [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] trophies.

==Club career==
===Early years / Porto===
Assunção was born in [[Várzea Grande, Mato Grosso]]. After first appearing professionally for [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras]] he emigrated to Portugal, having a short stint with [[FC Porto]]'s [[FC Porto B|B-team]] and returning shortly to Palmeiras. In the [[2002–03 Primeira Liga|2002–03 season]] he joined [[Madeira]]'s [[C.D. Nacional]], and made his [[Primeira Liga]] debut on 26 January 2003 in a 0–0 home draw against [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]].

After two highly successful individual campaigns, Assunção was purchased again by Porto, but would be loaned for [[2004–05 Alpha Ethniki|2004–05]] to [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens FC]], managed by former Porto coach [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.jn.pt/arquivo/2005/interior/se-me-dissessem-nao-acreditava-479265.html|title=Se me dissessem, não acreditava|trans-title=If they had told me, I would not believe it|newspaper=[[Jornal de Notícias]]|language=Portuguese|date=6 May 2005|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/paulo-assuncao-peseiro-e-um-grande-treinador|title=Paulo Assunção: «Peseiro é um grande treinador»|trans-title=Paulo Assunção: «Peseiro is a great manager»|publisher=Mais Futebol|last=Germano|first=Almeida|language=Portuguese|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> In July 2005 he returned, going on to be an instrumental element in the team's midfield (alongside [[Raul Meireles]] and [[Lucho González]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=368936.html|title=Paulo Assunção's Porto pride|publisher=UEFA|last=Tavares|first=Nuno|location=Porto|date=22 November 2005|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref> as they eventually won three consecutive league championships.

Assunção left the [[Estádio do Dragão]] after being threatened with a shot to the knee by supporters of the club who wanted him to renew his contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2009/01/26/desporto/noticia/paulo-assuncao-abandonou-fc-porto-por-ter-sido-ameacado-com-tiro-no-joelho-1357571|title=Paulo Assunção abandonou FC Porto por ter sido ameaçado com tiro no joelho|trans-title=Paulo Assunção left FC Porto for being threatened with a shot to the knee|newspaper=[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]|language=Portuguese|date=26 January 2009|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>

===Atlético Madrid===
In early July 2008, after buying out the remainder of his contract, Assunção joined [[Atlético Madrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=730715.html|title=Atlético sign Coupet and Paulo Assunção|publisher=UEFA|date=7 July 2008|accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> He adjusted quickly with the [[Madrid|capital]] club, playing in all [[La Liga]] matches safe four and helping it [[2008–09 La Liga|repeat the fourth-place finish]], with a subsequent [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|qualification]] to the [[UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.diariosigloxxi.com/texto-diario/mostrar/44396/atletico-visitara-europa-proxima-temporada-3-0|title=El Atlético visitará Europa la próxima temporada (3–0)|trans-title=Atlético will visit Europe next season (3–0)|newspaper=Diario Siglo XXI|language=Spanish|date=30 May 2009|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marca.com/2009/08/28/futbol/equipos/atletico/1251460819.html|title=La baja de Assunçao abre la titularidad a Cléber|trans-title=Assunçao out means Cléber is poised to start|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

Defensive-minded Assunção scored his first goal for the ''Colchoneros'' on 17 January 2010, during the team's 3–2 home win against [[Sporting de Gijón]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/275722?cc=5739|title=Forlan fires Atletico to victory|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=17 January 2010|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> whilst continuing as the undisputed first-choice at holding midfielder. He lost that position midway through the [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11 season]], to newly signed [[Mario Suárez (footballer)|Mario Suárez]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2010/11/17/futbol/equipos/atletico/1290033485.html|title=Mario Suárez o Assunçao, la última duda de Quique|trans-title=Mario Suárez or Assunçao, Quique's last doubt|newspaper=Marca|last=Malagón|first=Manuel|language=Spanish|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

In the [[2011–12 La Liga|2011–12 campaign]], Assunção was only fourth-choice in his position after Suárez, [[Gabi (footballer, born 1983)|Gabi]] and [[Tiago Mendes|Tiago]]. He did contribute with six appearances – four starts – as Atlético [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|reached]] and won the [[UEFA Europa League]] [[2012 UEFA Europa League Final|final]].

===São Paulo / Deportivo===
After more than one decade in European football, Assunção returned to his country to play for [[São Paulo FC]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://as.com/futbol/2012/07/21/mas_futbol/1342821611_850215.html|title=Paulo Assunçao deja el Atlético y ficha por el Sao Paulo|trans-title=Paulo Assunçao leaves Atlético and signs for Sao Paulo|newspaper=[[Diario AS]]|language=Spanish|date=21 July 2012|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> The deal was confirmed on 21 July 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com.br/noticia/270099_sao-paulo-anuncia-contratacao-de-volante-paulo-assuncao-ex-atletico-de-madri|title=São Paulo anuncia contratação de volante Paulo Assunção, ex-Atlético de Madri|trans-title=São Paulo announce signing of holding midfielder Paulo Assunção, formerly of Atlético de Madrid|publisher=[[ESPN Brasil]]|language=Portuguese|date=21 July 2012|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref> but, on 28 December, it was terminated by mutual consent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/sao-paulo/noticia/2012/12/paulo-assuncao-pede-e-sao-paulo-aceita-rescindir-contrato-do-volante.html|title=Paulo Assunção pede e São Paulo aceita rescindir contrato do volante|trans-title=Paulo Assunção requests and São Paulo accept to terminate holding midfielder's contract|publisher=[[Rede Globo|Globo Esporte]]|last=Lozetti|first=Alexandre|language=Portuguese|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogdobirner.virgula.uol.com.br/2012/12/28/paulo-assuncao-deixa-o-sao-paulo-e-deve-retornar-a-espanha/|title=Paulo Assunção deixa o São Paulo e deve retornar à Espanha|trans-title=Paulo Assunção leaves São Paulo and must return to Spain|publisher=Blog do Birner|last=Birner|first=Vitor|language=Portuguese|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=28 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231170755/http://blogdobirner.virgula.uol.com.br/2012/12/28/paulo-assuncao-deixa-o-sao-paulo-e-deve-retornar-a-espanha/|archive-date=31 December 2012}}</ref> with the player returning to Spain and joining [[Deportivo de La Coruña]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/es/news/27/liga-de-españa/2013/01/08/3656577/paulo-assunçao-ficha-por-el-deportivo-de-la-coruña|title=Paulo Assunçao ficha por el Deportivo de la Coruña|trans-title=Paulo Assunçao signs for Deportivo de la Coruña|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|language=Spanish|date=8 January 2013|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref>

He was best known for his positioning and tackling, and also held a [[Portuguese nationality law|Portuguese passport]] due to the many years in spent in the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lfp.es/competiciones/inscripciones/inscripciones2.asp?div=1|title=Inscripciones|trans-title=Registrations|publisher=[[Liga de Fútbol Profesional]]|language=Spanish|date=2008|accessdate=19 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731033632/http://www.lfp.es/competiciones/inscripciones/inscripciones2.asp?div=1|archive-date=31 July 2008}}</ref> mainly at the service of [[FC Porto|Porto]]. He also played four years in [[La Liga]] with [[Atlético Madrid]], winning two [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] trophies.

==Club career==
===Early years / Porto===
Assunção was born in [[Várzea Grande, Mato Grosso]]. After first appearing professionally for [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras]] he emigrated to Portugal, having a short stint with [[FC Porto]]'s [[FC Porto B|B-team]] and returning shortly to Palmeiras. In the [[2002–03 Primeira Liga|2002–03 season]] he joined [[Madeira]]'s [[C.D. Nacional]], and made his [[Primeira Liga]] debut on 26 January 2003 in a 0–0 home draw against [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]].

After two highly successful individual campaigns, Assunção was purchased again by Porto, but would be loaned for [[2004–05 Alpha Ethniki|2004–05]] to [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens FC]], managed by former Porto coach [[Fernando Santos (Portuguese footballer)|Fernando Santos]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.jn.pt/arquivo/2005/interior/se-me-dissessem-nao-acreditava-479265.html|title=Se me dissessem, não acreditava|trans-title=If they had told me, I would not believe it|newspaper=[[Jornal de Notícias]]|language=Portuguese|date=6 May 2005|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/paulo-assuncao-peseiro-e-um-grande-treinador|title=Paulo Assunção: «Peseiro é um grande treinador»|trans-title=Paulo Assunção: «Peseiro is a great manager»|publisher=Mais Futebol|last=Germano|first=Almeida|language=Portuguese|date=20 December 2012|accessdate=6 August 2019}}</ref> In July 2005 he returned, going on to be an instrumental element in the team's midfield (alongside [[Raul Meireles]] and [[Lucho González]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=368936.html|title=Paulo Assunção's Porto pride|publisher=UEFA|last=Tavares|first=Nuno|location=Porto|date=22 November 2005|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref> as they eventually won three consecutive league championships.

Assunção left the [[Estádio do Dragão]] after being threatened with a shot to the knee by supporters of the club who wanted him to renew his contract.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.publico.pt/2009/01/26/desporto/noticia/paulo-assuncao-abandonou-fc-porto-por-ter-sido-ameacado-com-tiro-no-joelho-1357571|title=Paulo Assunção abandonou FC Porto por ter sido ameaçado com tiro no joelho|trans-title=Paulo Assunção left FC Porto for being threatened with a shot to the knee|newspaper=[[Público (Portugal)|Público]]|language=Portuguese|date=26 January 2009|accessdate=13 May 2018}}</ref>

===Atlético Madrid===
In early July 2008, after buying out the remainder of his contract, Assunção joined [[Atlético Madrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=730715.html|title=Atlético sign Coupet and Paulo Assunção|publisher=UEFA|date=7 July 2008|accessdate=22 April 2010}}</ref> He adjusted quickly with the [[Madrid|capital]] club, playing in all [[La Liga]] matches safe four and helping it [[2008–09 La Liga|repeat the fourth-place finish]], with a subsequent [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|qualification]] to the [[UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.diariosigloxxi.com/texto-diario/mostrar/44396/atletico-visitara-europa-proxima-temporada-3-0|title=El Atlético visitará Europa la próxima temporada (3–0)|trans-title=Atlético will visit Europe next season (3–0)|newspaper=Diario Siglo XXI|language=Spanish|date=30 May 2009|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marca.com/2009/08/28/futbol/equipos/atletico/1251460819.html|title=La baja de Assunçao abre la titularidad a Cléber|trans-title=Assunçao out means Cléber is poised to start|newspaper=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|language=Spanish|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

Defensive-minded Assunção scored his first goal for the ''Colchoneros'' on 17 January 2010, during the team's 3–2 home win against [[Sporting de Gijón]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report/_/id/275722?cc=5739|title=Forlan fires Atletico to victory|publisher=[[ESPN FC|ESPN Soccernet]]|date=17 January 2010|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> whilst continuing as the undisputed first-choice at holding midfielder. He lost that position midway through the [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11 season]], to newly signed [[Mario Suárez (footballer)|Mario Suárez]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2010/11/17/futbol/equipos/atletico/1290033485.html|title=Mario Suárez o Assunçao, la última duda de Quique|trans-title=Mario Suárez or Assunçao, Quique's last doubt|newspaper=Marca|last=Malagón|first=Manuel|language=Spanish|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref>

In the [[2011–12 La Liga|2011–12 campaign]], Assunção was only fourth-choice in his position after Suárez, [[Gabi (footballer, born 1983)|Gabi]] and [[Tiago Mendes|Tiago]]. He did contribute with six appearances – four starts – as Atlético [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|reached]] and won the [[UEFA Europa League]] [[2012 UEFA Europa League Final|final]].

After more than one decade in European football, Assunção returned to his country to play for [[São Paulo FC]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://as.com/futbol/2012/07/21/mas_futbol/1342821611_850215.html|title=Paulo Assunçao deja el Atlético y ficha por el Sao Paulo|trans-title=Paulo Assunçao leaves Atlético and signs for Sao Paulo|newspaper=[[Diario AS]]|language=Spanish|date=21 July 2012|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> The deal was confirmed on 21 July 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com.br/noticia/270099_sao-paulo-anuncia-contratacao-de-volante-paulo-assuncao-ex-atletico-de-madri|title=São Paulo anuncia contratação de volante Paulo Assunção, ex-Atlético de Madri|trans-title=São Paulo announce signing of holding midfielder Paulo Assunção, formerly of Atlético de Madrid|publisher=[[ESPN Brasil]]|language=Portuguese|date=21 July 2012|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref> but, on 28 December, it was terminated by mutual consent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/sao-paulo/noticia/2012/12/paulo-assuncao-pede-e-sao-paulo-aceita-rescindir-contrato-do-volante.html|title=Paulo Assunção pede e São Paulo aceita rescindir contrato do volante|trans-title=Paulo Assunção requests and São Paulo accept to terminate holding midfielder's contract|publisher=[[Rede Globo|Globo Esporte]]|last=Lozetti|first=Alexandre|language=Portuguese|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=28 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogdobirner.virgula.uol.com.br/2012/12/28/paulo-assuncao-deixa-o-sao-paulo-e-deve-retornar-a-espanha/|title=Paulo Assunção deixa o São Paulo e deve retornar à Espanha|trans-title=Paulo Assunção leaves São Paulo and must return to Spain|publisher=Blog do Birner|last=Birner|first=Vitor|language=Portuguese|date=28 December 2012|accessdate=28 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231170755/http://blogdobirner.virgula.uol.com.br/2012/12/28/paulo-assuncao-deixa-o-sao-paulo-e-deve-retornar-a-espanha/|archive-date=31 December 2012}}</ref> with the player returning to Spain and joining [[Deportivo de La Coruña]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/es/news/27/liga-de-españa/2013/01/08/3656577/paulo-assunçao-ficha-por-el-deportivo-de-la-coruña|title=Paulo Assunçao ficha por el Deportivo de la Coruña|trans-title=Paulo Assunçao signs for Deportivo de la Coruña|publisher=[[Goal (website)|Goal]]|language=Spanish|date=8 January 2013|accessdate=9 January 2013}}</ref>

In January 2014, 34-year-old Assunção signed for [[Levadiakos F.C.]] in the [[Superleague Greece]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.levadiakosfc.gr/στον-λεβαδειακο-ο-paulo-assuncao/|script-title=el:Στον ΛΕΒΑΔΕΙΑΚΟ ο Paulo Assunção|trans-title=Paulo Assunção in Levadiakos|publisher=Levadiakos F.C|language=Greek|date=January 2014|accessdate=1 October 2016}}</ref> leaving in June after failing to appear in any competitive matches.

'''Andrei «Le Général» Viktorovich Markov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Викторович Марков}}; born 20 December 1978) is a [[Russians|Russian]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman]] who is currently playing for [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL). He formerly played from 2000 to 2017 with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). He holds both Russian and Canadian citizenship.

==Playing career==
Markov was drafted by the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the sixth round, 162nd overall, in the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]]. After being considered one of the best defencemen in Russia in 2000, he came over to [[North America]] and split time with the Canadiens and their then-minor league affiliate, the [[Quebec Citadelles]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). After rounding out his defensive game, he has become a regular in the Canadiens' starting line-up and is widely considered to be their most complete defenceman.

During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], Markov played in his native Russia with [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] of the [[Russian Superleague]] (RSL).

Markov signed a four-year contract with the Canadiens on 28 May 2007, keeping him with the team through the [[2010–11 NHL season|2010–11 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/ctvnews/sportsstory.asp?story_id=209144|title=Markov inks four-year deal with Habs|date=28 May 2007|website=TSN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155201/http://www.tsn.ca/ctvnews/sportsstory.asp?story_id=209144|archive-date=29 September 2007|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref> He had a career year in the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], and was selected to his first [[56th National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] as a starter, in [[Atlanta]].
[[File:Andrei Markov1.jpg|thumb|left|Markov with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in 2010]]
On 1 October 2009, Markov suffered a lacerated ankle injury after colliding with teammate [[Carey Price]]'s skate and was initially expected to be out of the Canadiens' lineup until February 2010. Markov made a full recovery almost two months ahead of schedule and returned to action on 19 December 2009, when the Canadiens faced the [[New York Islanders]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=302814 |title=Markov to Return To Habs Lineup Saturday Against Islanders |publisher=Tsn.ca |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> Markov ended up jump-starting the Habs' offence with two goals in his return en route to a 3–0 victory. During the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs]] against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] on 30 April, Markov suffered a leg injury after being hit by [[Matt Cooke]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=320066 |title=Canadiens' Markov Injured By Cooke Hit In First Period He was out for the playoffs with a knee injury |publisher=Tsn.ca |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref>

On 16 July 2010, Markov became a [[Canadians|Canadian citizen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2010/07/15/sp-nhl-canadiens-markov.html |title=Habs' Markov to get Canadian citizenship |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |accessdate=2010-07-15 |date=2010-07-16}}</ref> During the 2010–11 season, he played only seven games, earning three points (one goal and two assists). On 13 November 2010, Markov suffered a knee injury in a game against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and underwent surgery 8 December 2010, missing the remainder of the season.

On 23 June 2011, Markov signed a three-year contract with the Canadiens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=369816 |title=Canadiens re-sign Markov to three-year, $17.25 million contract |publisher=Tsn.ca |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> On 10 March 2012, he played in his first game in over a year, tallying an assist in a 4–1 victory over the [[Vancouver Canucks]].

'''Andrei Viktorovich Markov''' ({{lang-ru|Андрей Викторович Марков}}; born 20 December 1978) is a [[Russians|Russian]]-[[Canadians|Canadian]] professional [[ice hockey]] [[defenceman]] who is currently playing for [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl]] of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL). He formerly played from 2000 to 2017 with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). He holds both Russian and Canadian citizenship.

==Playing career==
Markov was drafted by the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in the sixth round, 162nd overall, in the [[1998 NHL Entry Draft]]. After being considered one of the best defencemen in Russia in 2000, he came over to [[North America]] and split time with the Canadiens and their then-minor league affiliate, the [[Quebec Citadelles]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL). After rounding out his defensive game, he has become a regular in the Canadiens' starting line-up and is widely considered to be their most complete defenceman.

During the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]], Markov played in his native Russia with [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] of the [[Russian Superleague]] (RSL).

Markov signed a four-year contract with the Canadiens on 28 May 2007, keeping him with the team through the [[2010–11 NHL season|2010–11 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/ctvnews/sportsstory.asp?story_id=209144|title=Markov inks four-year deal with Habs|date=28 May 2007|website=TSN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155201/http://www.tsn.ca/ctvnews/sportsstory.asp?story_id=209144|archive-date=29 September 2007|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref> He had a career year in the [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08 season]], and was selected to his first [[56th National Hockey League All-Star Game|NHL All-Star Game]] as a starter, in [[Atlanta]].
[[File:Andrei Markov1.jpg|thumb|left|Markov with the [[Montreal Canadiens]] in 2010]]
On 1 October 2009, Markov suffered a lacerated ankle injury after colliding with teammate [[Carey Price]]'s skate and was initially expected to be out of the Canadiens' lineup until February 2010. Markov made a full recovery almost two months ahead of schedule and returned to action on 19 December 2009, when the Canadiens faced the [[New York Islanders]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=302814 |title=Markov to Return To Habs Lineup Saturday Against Islanders |publisher=Tsn.ca |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> Markov ended up jump-starting the Habs' offence with two goals in his return en route to a 3–0 victory. During the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs]] against the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] on 30 April, Markov suffered a leg injury after being hit by [[Matt Cooke]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=320066 |title=Canadiens' Markov Injured By Cooke Hit In First Period He was out for the playoffs with a knee injury |publisher=Tsn.ca |date=2010-04-30 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref>

On 16 July 2010, Markov became a [[Canadians|Canadian citizen]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2010/07/15/sp-nhl-canadiens-markov.html |title=Habs' Markov to get Canadian citizenship |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] |accessdate=2010-07-15 |date=2010-07-16}}</ref> During the 2010–11 season, he played only seven games, earning three points (one goal and two assists). On 13 November 2010, Markov suffered a knee injury in a game against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and underwent surgery 8 December 2010, missing the remainder of the season.

On 23 June 2011, Markov signed a three-year contract with the Canadiens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=369816 |title=Canadiens re-sign Markov to three-year, $17.25 million contract |publisher=Tsn.ca |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}</ref> On 10 March 2012, he played in his first game in over a year, tallying an assist in a 4–1 victory over the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. On 23 June 2014, Markov re-signed with the Canadiens to a three-year contract worth an annual average value of $5.75 million.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Canadiens|first1=Montreal|title=Canadiens agree to terms on a three-year contract extension with defenseman Andrei Markov.|url=http://canadiens.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=723488 |website=canadiens.nhl.com|publisher=[[Montreal Canadiens]]|accessdate=23 June 2014}}</ref> On 15 September 2014, Markov was named an alternate captain for the Canadiens, along with [[P.

{{History of Czechoslovakia}}

'''The First Czechoslovak Republic''' emerged from the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in October 1918. The new state consisted mostly of territories inhabited by [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]], but also included areas containing majority populations of other nationalities, particularly [[Germans]] (22.95 %), who accounted for more citizens than the state's second state nation of the [[Slovaks]]<ref name=\"Teich\"> {{cite book|author=Mikulas Teich|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|pages=375|title=Bohemia in History}} </ref>, [[Hungarians]] (5.47 %) and [[Ruthenians]] (3.39 %). The new state comprised the total of [[Bohemia]] whose borders did not coincide with the language border between German and Czech. Despite initially developing [[Elections in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|effective representative institutions]] alongside a [[Economy of Communist Czechoslovakia#Before socialism|successful economy]], the deteriorating international economic situation in the 1930s gave rise to growing ethnic tensions. The dispute between the Czech and German populations, fanned by the rise of [[National Socialism]] in neighbouring Germany, resulted in the loss of territory under the terms of the [[Munich Agreement]] and subsequent events in the autumn of 1938, bringing about the end of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|First Republic]].

==Independence==
[[Image:TGM Tabor 21.12.1918 3462a.jpg|thumb|right|Tomáš Masaryk returning from exile]]

Following the [[Pittsburgh Agreement]] of May 1918, the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]], created in Washington,<ref>Preclík, Vratislav. Masaryk a legie (Masaryk and legions), váz. kniha, 219 pages, first issue - vydalo nakladatelství Paris Karviná, Žižkova 2379 (734 01 Karvina, Czech Republic) ve spolupráci s Masarykovým demokratickým hnutím (Masaryk Democratic Movement, Prague), 2019, {{ISBN|978-80-87173-47-3}}, pages 101-102, 124–125, 128, 129, 132, 140–148, 184–190.</ref> was published by the [[Czechoslovak National Council]], signed by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Masaryk]], [[Štefánik]] and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] on October&nbsp;18, 1918 in [[Paris]], and proclaimed on October&nbsp;28 in [[Prague]]. Towards the end of the [[First World War]] which led to the collapse of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], several ethnic groups and territories with different historical, political, and economic traditions were blended into new state structures. In the face of such obstacles, the creation of [[democracy]] in Czechoslovakia was indeed a triumph.

Initial authority within [[Czechoslovakia]] was assumed by the newly created [[National Assembly]] on November&nbsp;14, 1918. Because territorial demarcations were uncertain and [[elections]] impossible, the provisional National Assembly was constituted on the basis of the 1911 [[election]]s to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Austrian parliament]] with the addition of 54 representatives from [[Slovakia]]. [[National minorities]] were not represented. Hungarians remained loyal to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]].

On November&nbsp;12, 1918, the short-lived [[Republic of German Austria]] was declared, with the intent of unifying with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], relying on [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]'s principle of [[self-determination]]. The state claimed all the German-speaking areas of the former [[Cisleithania]], including [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|those in Czechoslovakia]].

The National Assembly of Czechoslovakia elected [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] as its first president, chose a provisional government headed by [[Karel Kramář]], and drafted a [[provisional constitution]].

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] convened in January 1919. The [[Czech people|Czech]] delegation was led by Kramář and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]], premier and foreign minister respectively, of the Czechoslovak provisional government. The conference approved the establishment of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]], to encompass the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|crown lands]] of the historic [[Bohemian Kingdom]] ([[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]]), Slovakia, and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. The inclusion of Ruthenia provided a common frontier with [[Romania]], an important ally against Hungary. To address concerns of the British delegation that the incorporation of exclusively German-settled areas violates the principle of [[self-determination]], the [[Czech people|Czech]] delegation had presented to the conference a memorandum containing misrepresentations of the German-settled areas. No German or Austrian delegation was present the conference. Additionally, the memorandum proposed the [[Swiss Confederation]] as a model for the constitution of the new state, which however was not realized in the new state.<ref>{{cite book|lang=de|author=Wolfgang Hippmann|title=Vogelfrei und der Heimat beraubt. Die Vertreibung der Sudetendeutschen 1945|pages=11}}</ref>  

In March 1919<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 March 1919, reprinted in ''Daily Telegraph'' 15 March 2019, page 32</ref> there were reports that:
*Austria and Czechoslovakia had broken off [[diplomatic relations]].
*Czechoslovakia's government in [[Prague]] alleged a conspiracy between Austria and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] to invade Czechoslovakia.
The dispute was over possession of the German-speaking parts of Bohemia and Moravia (later known as the [[Sudetenland]]); their German-speaking inhabitants had declared themselves to part of Austria, and if that was prevented, demanded to be annexed by Saxony and the German Republics. Czechoslovakia wanted to hold onto this area because of its many valuable [[mining|mines]]. Czechoslovakia sent Czech troops into the German area to stop disorders, and the Vienna press printed reports of Czech troops firing on and killing Germans in that area, including 15–20 in [[Kaaden]], 3 in [[Eger]], and 2 in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]]. During this, on about March&nbsp;1, Herr Mayer, Austria's [[Minister of War]] (a native of Eger), went to go to Eger and was arrested at [[Gratzen]] after crossing the border, but was allowed to continue to Eger; two days later he went into Germany via [[Schärding]], and by railway via [[Regensburg]] and [[Passau]] back to Vienna.

In January 1920 the Czechoslovakian army, breaking prior agreements with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], crossed the demarcation line and by force of arms occupied the [[Zaolzie]], where a 60% majority of the population was Polish, compared to 25% Czechs. After brief fights they made a truce on the power of which Czechoslovakia occupied areas to the west of [[Olza River]]. The Czech claim to [[Lusatia]], which had been part of the Bohemian Kingdom until the [[Thirty Years' War]], was rejected. 

On September&nbsp;10, 1919, Czechoslovakia signed the Minorities Treaty, placing its ethnic minorities under the protection of the [[League of Nations]].

==Statehood==
The establishment of the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|Constitution of 1920]] installed a [[parliamentary system]] and [[representative democracy]] with relatively few [[Electoral district|constituents]] for each representative. This allowed a great variety of [[Political party|political parties]] to emerge, with no clear front runner or leading political entity.

[[Tomáš Masaryk|Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] was elected the country's first president in the 1920 election and his guidance helped to hold the country together. A coalition of five Czechoslovak parties, which became known as the \"[[Pětka]]\" (The Five), constituted the backbone of the government and maintained stability. Prime Minister [[Antonin Svehla]] led the Pětka for most of the 1920s and designed a pattern of coalition politics that survived until 1938. Masaryk was re-elected in 1925 and 1929, serving as President until December&nbsp;14, 1935 when he resigned due to poor health. He was succeeded by [[Edvard Beneš]].

[[Image:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|250px|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]

Beneš had served as Czechoslovak [[foreign minister]] from 1918 to 1935, and created the system of alliances that determined the republic's international stance until 1938. A democratic statesman of Western orientation, Beneš relied heavily on the [[League of Nations]] as guarantor of the post war [[status quo]] and the security of newly formed states. He negotiated the [[Little Entente]] (an alliance with [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]]) in 1921 to counter [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[revanchism]] and [[Habsburg]] restoration.

The leaders of Czechoslovakia needed to find solutions for the multiplicity of cultures living within one country. From 1928 and 1940, Czechoslovakia was divided into the four \"lands\" ({{lang-cs|země}}, {{lang-sk|krajiny}}); Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Although in 1927 assemblies were provided for Bohemia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, their jurisdiction was limited to adjusting laws and regulations of the central government to local needs. National minorities were assured special protection; in districts where they constituted 20% of the population, members of minority groups were granted full freedom to use their language in everyday life, in schools, and in matters dealing with authorities. [[Germany|German]] parties also participated in the government starting in 1926, while [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] parties, supporting Hungarian irredentist claims, never joined the Czechoslovak government but were not openly hostile to it.

==Growing conflict==
Due to Czechoslovakia's centralized political structure, nationalism arose in the non-Czech nationalities, and several parties and movements were formed with the aim of broader political autonomy.  The [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party|Slovak People's Party]] led by [[Andrej Hlinka]] is an example.

When German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, fear of German aggression became widespread in eastern Central Europe. Beneš ignored the possibility of a stronger Central European alliance system, remaining faithful to his Western policy. He did, however, seek the participation of the [[Soviet Union]] in an alliance to include [[France]]. (Beneš's earlier attitude towards the Soviet regime had been one of caution.) In 1935 the Soviet Union signed treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. In essence, the treaties provided that the Soviet Union would come to Czechoslovakia's aid, but only if French assistance came first. Hitler himself remarked to his foreign minister von Neurath and top military officials in 1937 that he intended to absorb Bohemia and Austria, with a vague sentence about the need to expel two million Czechs and the eventual elimination of the Czech nation.<ref>''Prague in black: Nazi rule and Czech nationalism, p. 108–109, Chad Carl Bryant, Harvard University Press 2007</ref>

There was [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|a large German minority in Czechoslovakia]], mostly living in [[Sudetenland]]. 
[[File:Czechoslovakia1930linguistic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Linguistic map of interwar Czechoslovakia (c. 1930).]]
They demanded [[autonomy]] within Czechoslovakia, claiming they were oppressed by the national government. The political vehicle for this agitation was the newly founded [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' - SdP) led by [[Konrad Henlein]], and financed with Nazi money. {{Citation needed|reason=other sources tell that the rise of the SdP started before the rise of the Nazis|date=February 2019}} In the 1935 Parliamentary elections, the SdP had a surprise success, securing over 2/3 of the [[Sudeten German]] vote. This worsened diplomatic relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Hitler met with Henlein in Berlin on March&nbsp;28, 1938, and ordered him to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. On April&nbsp;24, the SdP issued the [[Carlsbad Programme]], demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. If these demands were granted, the Sudetenland could then align with Nazi Germany.

On 17 September 1938 Adolf Hitler ordered the establishment of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]], a paramilitary organization that took over the structure of Ordnersgruppe, an organization of ethnic-Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day due to its implication in large number of terrorist activities. The organization was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducting cross border terrorist operations into Czechoslovak territory. Relying on the [[War of aggression#The Convention for the Definition of Aggression|Convention for the Definition of Aggression]], Czechoslovak president [[Edvard Beneš]]<ref>President Beneš' declaration made on 16 December 1941</ref> and the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|government-in-exile]]<ref>Note of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile dated 22 February 1944</ref> later regarded 17 September 1938 as the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war. This understanding has been assumed also by the contemporary [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Czech Constitutional court]].<ref name=\"Con Court ruling\">{{Citation

The dispute between the Czech and German populations, fanned by the rise of [[National Socialism]] in neighbouring Germany, resulted in the loss of territory under the terms of the [[Munich Agreement]] and subsequent events in the autumn of 1938, bringing about the end of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|First Republic]].

Following the [[Pittsburgh Agreement]] of May 1918, the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]], created in Washington,<ref>Preclík, Vratislav. Masaryk a legie (Masaryk and legions), váz. kniha, 219 pages, first issue - vydalo nakladatelství Paris Karviná, Žižkova 2379 (734 01 Karvina, Czech Republic) ve spolupráci s Masarykovým demokratickým hnutím (Masaryk Democratic Movement, Prague), 2019, {{ISBN|978-80-87173-47-3}}, pages 101-102, 124–125, 128, 129, 132, 140–148, 184–190.</ref> was published by the [[Czechoslovak National Council]], signed by [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|Masaryk]], [[Štefánik]] and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]] on October&nbsp;18, 1918 in [[Paris]], and proclaimed on October&nbsp;28 in [[Prague]]. Towards the end of the [[First World War]] which led to the collapse of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], several ethnic groups and territories with different historical, political, and economic traditions were blended into new state structures. In the face of such obstacles, the creation of [[democracy]] in Czechoslovakia was indeed a triumph.

Initial authority within [[Czechoslovakia]] was assumed by the newly created [[National Assembly]] on November&nbsp;14, 1918. Because territorial demarcations were uncertain and [[elections]] impossible, the provisional National Assembly was constituted on the basis of the 1911 [[election]]s to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Austrian parliament]] with the addition of 54 representatives from [[Slovakia]]. [[National minorities]] were not represented. Hungarians remained loyal to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]].

On November&nbsp;12, 1918, the short-lived [[Republic of German Austria]] was declared, with the intent of unifying with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], relying on [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]'s principle of [[self-determination]]. The state claimed all the German-speaking areas of the former [[Cisleithania]], including [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|those in Czechoslovakia]].

The National Assembly of Czechoslovakia elected [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] as its first president, chose a provisional government headed by [[Karel Kramář]], and drafted a [[provisional constitution]].

The [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] convened in January 1919. The [[Czech people|Czech]] delegation was led by Kramář and [[Edvard Beneš|Beneš]], premier and foreign minister respectively, of the Czechoslovak provisional government. The conference approved the establishment of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]], to encompass the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|crown lands]] of the historic [[Bohemian Kingdom]] ([[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]]), Slovakia, and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. The inclusion of Ruthenia provided a common frontier with [[Romania]], an important ally against Hungary. To address concerns of the British delegation that the incorporation of exclusively German-settled areas violates the principle of [[self-determination]], the [[Czech people|Czech]] delegation had presented to the conference a memorandum containing misrepresentations of the German-settled areas. No German or Austrian delegation was present the conference. Additionally, the memorandum proposed the [[Swiss Confederation]] as a model for the constitution of the new state, which however was not realized in the new state.<ref>{{cite book|lang=de|author=Wolfgang Hippmann|title=Vogelfrei und der Heimat beraubt. Die Vertreibung der Sudetendeutschen 1945|pages=11}}</ref>  

In March 1919<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 March 1919, reprinted in ''Daily Telegraph'' 15 March 2019, page 32</ref> there were reports that:
*Austria and Czechoslovakia had broken off [[diplomatic relations]].
*Czechoslovakia's government in [[Prague]] alleged a conspiracy between Austria and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] to invade Czechoslovakia.
The dispute was over possession of the German-speaking parts of Bohemia and Moravia (later known as the [[Sudetenland]]); their German-speaking inhabitants had declared themselves to part of Austria, and if that was prevented, demanded to be annexed by Saxony and the German Republics. Czechoslovakia wanted to hold onto this area because of its many valuable [[mining|mines]]. Czechoslovakia sent Czech troops into the German area to stop disorders, and the Vienna press printed reports of Czech troops firing on and killing Germans in that area, including 15–20 in [[Kaaden]], 3 in [[Eger]], and 2 in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]]. During this, on about March&nbsp;1, Herr Mayer, Austria's [[Minister of War]] (a native of Eger), went to go to Eger and was arrested at [[Gratzen]] after crossing the border, but was allowed to continue to Eger; two days later he went into Germany via [[Schärding]], and by railway via [[Regensburg]] and [[Passau]] back to Vienna.

In January 1920 the Czechoslovakian army, breaking prior agreements with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], crossed the demarcation line and by force of arms occupied the [[Zaolzie]], where a 60% majority of the population was Polish, compared to 25% Czechs. After brief fights they made a truce on the power of which Czechoslovakia occupied areas to the west of [[Olza River]]. The Czech claim to [[Lusatia]], which had been part of the Bohemian Kingdom until the [[Thirty Years' War]], was rejected. 

On September&nbsp;10, 1919, Czechoslovakia signed the Minorities Treaty, placing its ethnic minorities under the protection of the [[League of Nations]].

==Statehood==
The establishment of the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|Constitution of 1920]] installed a [[parliamentary system]] and [[representative democracy]] with relatively few [[Electoral district|constituents]] for each representative. This allowed a great variety of [[Political party|political parties]] to emerge, with no clear front runner or leading political entity.

[[Tomáš Masaryk|Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] was elected the country's first president in the 1920 election and his guidance helped to hold the country together. A coalition of five Czechoslovak parties, which  became known as the \"[[Pětka]]\" (The Five), constituted the backbone of the government and maintained stability. Prime Minister [[Antonin Svehla]] led the Pětka for most of the 1920s and designed a pattern of coalition politics that survived until 1938. Masaryk was re-elected in 1925 and 1929, serving as President until December&nbsp;14, 1935 when he resigned due to poor health. He was succeeded by [[Edvard Beneš]].

[[Image:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|250px|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]

Beneš had served as Czechoslovak [[foreign minister]] from 1918 to 1935, and created the system of alliances that determined the republic's international stance until 1938. A democratic statesman of Western orientation, Beneš relied heavily on the [[League of Nations]] as guarantor of the post war [[status quo]] and the security of newly formed states. He negotiated the [[Little Entente]] (an alliance with [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]]) in 1921 to counter [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[revanchism]] and [[Habsburg]] restoration.

The leaders of Czechoslovakia needed to find solutions for the multiplicity of cultures living within one country. From 1928 and 1940, Czechoslovakia was divided into the four \"lands\" ([[Czech language|Czech]]: \"země\", [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: \"krajiny\"); Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Although in 1927 assemblies were provided for Bohemia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, their jurisdiction was limited to adjusting laws and regulations of the central government to local needs. National minorities were assured special protection; in districts where they constituted 20% of the population, members of minority groups were granted full freedom to use their language in everyday life, in schools, and in matters dealing with authorities. [[Germany|German]] parties also participated in the government starting in 1926, while [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] parties, supporting Hungarian irredentist claims, never joined the Czechoslovak government but were not openly hostile to it.

==Growing conflict==
Due to Czechoslovakia's centralized political structure, nationalism arose in the non-Czech nationalities, and several parties and movements were formed with the aim of broader political autonomy.  The [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party|Slovak People's Party]] led by [[Andrej Hlinka]] is an example.

When German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, fear of German aggression became widespread in eastern Central Europe. Beneš ignored the possibility of a stronger Central European alliance system, remaining faithful to his Western policy. He did, however, seek the participation of the [[Soviet Union]] in an alliance to include [[France]]. (Beneš's earlier attitude towards the Soviet regime had been one of caution.) In 1935 the Soviet Union signed treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. In essence, the treaties provided that the Soviet Union would come to Czechoslovakia's aid, but only if French assistance came first. Hitler himself remarked to his foreign minister von Neurath and top military officials in 1937 that he intended to absorb Bohemia and Austria, with a vague sentence about the need to expel two million Czechs and the eventual elimination of the Czech nation.<ref>''Prague in black: Nazi rule and Czech nationalism, p. 108–109, Chad Carl Bryant, Harvard University Press 2007</ref>

There was [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|a large German minority in Czechoslovakia]], mostly living in [[Sudetenland]]. 
[[File:Czechoslovakia1930linguistic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Linguistic map of interwar Czechoslovakia (c. 1930).]]
They demanded [[autonomy]] within Czechoslovakia, claiming they were oppressed by the national government. The political vehicle for this agitation was the newly founded [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' - SdP) led by [[Konrad Henlein]], and financed with Nazi money. {{Citation needed|reason=other sources tell that the rise of the SdP started before the rise of the Nazis|date=February 2019}} In the 1935 Parliamentary elections, the SdP had a surprise success, securing over 2/3 of the [[Sudeten German]] vote. This worsened diplomatic relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Hitler met with Henlein in Berlin on March&nbsp;28, 1938, and ordered him to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. On April&nbsp;24, the SdP issued the [[Carlsbad Programme]], demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. If these demands were granted, the Sudetenland could then align with Nazi Germany.

On 17 September 1938 Adolf Hitler ordered the establishment of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]], a paramilitary organization that took over the structure of Ordnersgruppe, an organization of ethnic-Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day due to its implication in large number of terrorist activities. The organization was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducting cross border terrorist operations into Czechoslovak territory. Relying on the [[War of aggression#The Convention for the Definition of Aggression|Convention for the Definition of Aggression]], Czechoslovak president [[Edvard Beneš]]<ref>President Beneš' declaration made on 16 December 1941</ref> and the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|government-in-exile]]<ref>Note of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile dated 22 February 1944</ref> later regarded 17 September 1938 as the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war. This understanding has been assumed also by the contemporary [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Czech Constitutional court]].<ref name=\"Con Court ruling\">{{Citation

'''''The House by the Cemetery''''' ({{lang-it|Quella villa accanto al cimitero}}) is a 1981 Italian [[horror film]] directed by [[Lucio Fulci]]. The film stars [[Catriona MacColl]], [[Paolo Malco]], [[Ania Pieroni]], [[Giovanni Frezza]], Silvia Collatina and [[Dagmar Lassander]]. Its plot revolves around a series of murders taking place in a New England home–a home which happens to be hiding a gruesome secret within its basement walls. 

== Plot ==
A woman (Daniela Doria) is in an abandoned house looking for her boyfriend. After she discovers his body stabbed with scissors, she is stabbed in the head with a French knife, and her body is dragged through a cellar door.

In [[New York City]], Bob (Giovanni Frezza) and his parents, Norman and Lucy Boyle (Paolo Malco and Catriona MacColl), are moving into the same house. Norman's ex-colleague, Dr. Peterson, who murdered his mistress before committing suicide, was the previous owner. The Boyles are to stay there, whilst Norman researches old houses. As his mother packs, Bob looks at a photograph of a house and notices a girl in it. In New Whitby, [[Boston]], Bob waits in his parents' car while they collect the house keys. The girl from the photograph appears across the street. The girl, Mae (Silvia Collatina), whom only Bob can see, warns him to stay away. In the real estate office, Mrs. Gittleson (Dagmar Lassander) is annoyed when her colleague hands the couple \"the Freudstein keys\". She insists it is called \"Oak Mansion\", and promises to find the Boyles a babysitter.

Oak Mansion is in a poor state of repair. The cellar door is locked and nailed shut. A woman arrives and introduces herself as Ann, the babysitter (Ania Pieroni). That night, Norman hears noises and finds Ann unblocking the cellar door. The next day, Norman goes to the library to peruse Peterson's materials. The chief librarian, Mr. Wheatley (Carlo De Mejo), appears to recognize him. but Norman claims he is mistaken. The assistant librarian, Daniel Douglas (Giampaolo Saccarola), then informs Norman that Peterson conducted private research at the house. He studied records of area disappearances and other demographic data.

Mae shows Bob a tombstone on the grounds marked \"Mary Freudstein\" and says she is not really buried there. Indoors, Lucy finds the tombstone of \"Jacob Tess Freudstein\" while sweeping the hallway. When Norman returns, he reassures her that some older houses have indoor tombs because of the hard wintry ground. Norman opens the cellar door and walks down the stairs, only to be attacked by a bat, which won't let go until he stabs it repeatedly. Spooked, the family drives down to the real estate office and demands to be re-housed, but are told it will be a few more days before they can move. While the Boyles are at hospital to treat Norman's injuries from the bat, Mrs. Gittleson arrives at the house to tell them of a new property. Letting herself in, she stands over the Freudstein tombstone, which cracks apart, pinning her ankle. A figure emerges, stabs her in the neck with a fireplace poker, and drags her into the cellar.

The next morning, Lucy finds Ann cleaning a bloodstain on the kitchen floor. Ann eludes Lucy's questions about the stain. Over coffee, Norman tells Lucy that he's discovered that Freudstein was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] surgeon who conducted illegal experiments. Norman must travel to New York to research Freudstein. On the way, Norman visits the library and finds an audio cassette of Peterson's, which documents Peterson's increasing madness and reveals what he discovered about Freudstein. Norman destroys the cassette by dropping it into a furnace pipe. 

At the house, Ann goes to the cellar looking for Bob and hears childlike sobbing sounds. Freudstein decapitates her after slashing her throat. Bob sees Ann's head, and exits screaming. Lucy returns to find Bob crying in his room, but refuses to believe Bob's account about Ann. That evening, Bob returns to the cellar looking for Ann but gets locked in. Lucy hears Bob's cries and tries to open the cellar door. When she cannot open it, Norman returns and hacks the door with a hatchet. The rotting right hand of Freudstein (Giovanni De Nava) appears and restrains Bob against the door as the hatchet chops through it. One of Norman's axe blows through the door severs the ghoul's seemingly normal left hand, and he staggers back down the stairs.

Norman and Lucy finally get into the cellar, which contains several mutilated bodies (including Ann, Mrs. Gittleson, and the couple from the beginning of the film), surgical equipment, and a [[slab (casting)|slab]]. Freudstein is a living corpse with rotting flesh. Norman tells Lucy that the 150-year-old Freudstein lives by using his victims' parts to regenerate blood cells. Norman attacks Freudstein, but the ghoul twists the hatchet away. Grabbing a knife from the slab Norman stabs Freudstein, causing rotten flesh and maggots to ooze out of his old lab coat. Freudstein grabs Norman and rips open his throat. Lucy and Bob climb a ladder leading to the underside of the cracked tombstone. Lucy strains to shift the stone, but Freudstein grabs her and drags her down the stairs, killing her by ramming her head into the concrete floor. As Freudstein advances up the ladder, Bob strains to escape. As Freudstein grabs Bob's leg, he is suddenly pulled upwards by Mae. With Mae is her mother, Mary Freudstein (Teresa Rossi Passante), who tells them it's time to leave. Mrs. Freudstein leads Mae and Bob down the wintry grove into an apparent ghost world.

==Production==
Fulci later claimed that after making ''[[The Black Cat (1981 film)|The Black Cat]]'' and ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' that he wanted to make a film in tribute to [[HP Lovecraft]] without the film being based on one of his stories.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=85}}{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=86}} Screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]] was inspired by [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=86}} Sacchetti also stated the film was based on his own personal experiences as a child, being born in a large country house with a large dark basement and that age 9 he had to cross a cemetery at night.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=86}} In his biography, Fulci spoke negatively about Sacchetti's contributions as a screenwriter saying that ''The House by the Cemetery'' was derivative of scenes from ''[[The House That Screamed (1969 film)|The House That Screamed]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=86}} The film went through several changes from the original story by [[Elisa Briganti]] and the script by Sacchetti.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}}  The script was originally titled ''La notte dell'inferno'' ({{translation|The Night of Hell}}) which became ''La casa di Freudstein'' and then ''Quella casa accanto al cimitero''.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}} Sacchetti's script was revised by Fulci and [[Giorgio Mariuzzo]], Mariuzzo claimed he worked as a [[script doctor]] slightly changing work stating that Sacchetti's scripts were often too short.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}} Sacchetti commented on this stating that \"Mariuzzo always intervened afterwards, either because I had to leave to work on another film or refused to make those changes that Lucio demanded. That was the reason for our arguments.\"{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}}

'''''The House by the Cemetery''''' ({{lang-it|Quella villa accanto al cimitero}}) is a 1981 Italian [[horror film]] directed by [[Lucio Fulci]]. The film stars [[Catriona MacColl]], [[Paolo Malco]], [[Ania Pieroni]], [[Giovanni Frezza]], Silvia Collatina and [[Dagmar Lassander]]. Its plot revolves around a series of murders taking place in a New England home–a home which happens to be hiding a gruesome secret within its basement walls. 

== Plot ==
A woman (Daniela Doria) is in an abandoned house looking for her boyfriend. After she discovers his body stabbed with scissors, she is stabbed in the head with a French knife, and her body is dragged through a cellar door.

In [[New York City]], Bob (Giovanni Frezza) and his parents, Norman and Lucy Boyle (Paolo Malco and Catriona MacColl), are moving into the same house. Norman's ex-colleague, Dr. Peterson, who murdered his mistress before committing suicide, was the previous owner. The Boyles are to stay there, whilst Norman researches old houses. As his mother packs, Bob looks at a photograph of a house and notices a girl in it. In New Whitby, [[Boston]], Bob waits in his parents' car while they collect the house keys. The girl from the photograph appears across the street. The girl, Mae (Silvia Collatina), whom only Bob can see, warns him to stay away. In the real estate office, Mrs. Gittleson (Dagmar Lassander) is annoyed when her colleague hands the couple \"the Freudstein keys\". She insists it is called \"Oak Mansion\", and promises to find the Boyles a babysitter.

Oak Mansion is in a poor state of repair. The cellar door is locked and nailed shut. A woman arrives and introduces herself as Ann, the babysitter (Ania Pieroni). That night, Norman hears noises and finds Ann unblocking the cellar door. The next day, Norman goes to the library to peruse Peterson's materials. The chief librarian, Mr. Wheatley (Carlo De Mejo), appears to recognize him. but Norman claims he is mistaken. The assistant librarian, Daniel Douglas (Giampaolo Saccarola), then informs Norman that Peterson conducted private research at the house. He studied records of area disappearances and other demographic data.

Mae shows Bob a tombstone on the grounds marked \"Mary Freudstein\" and says she is not really buried there. Indoors, Lucy finds the tombstone of \"Jacob Tess Freudstein\" while sweeping the hallway. When Norman returns, he reassures her that some older houses have indoor tombs because of the hard wintry ground. Norman opens the cellar door and walks down the stairs, only to be attacked by a bat, which won't let go until he stabs it repeatedly. Spooked, the family drives down to the real estate office and demands to be re-housed, but are told it will be a few more days before they can move. While the Boyles are at hospital to treat Norman's injuries from the bat, Mrs. Gittleson arrives at the house to tell them of a new property. Letting herself in, she stands over the Freudstein tombstone, which cracks apart, pinning her ankle. A figure emerges, stabs her in the neck with a fireplace poker, and drags her into the cellar.

The next morning, Lucy finds Ann cleaning a bloodstain on the kitchen floor. Ann eludes Lucy's questions about the stain. Over coffee, Norman tells Lucy that he's discovered that Freudstein was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] surgeon who conducted illegal experiments. Norman must travel to New York to research Freudstein. On the way, Norman drops by the library and finds a cassette of Peterson's, which explains Freudstein killed his family. Ann goes to the cellar looking for Bob, but Freudstein decapitates her after slashing her throat. Bob sees Ann's head, and exits screaming. Lucy refuses to believe Bob's tale about Ann. That evening, Bob returns to the cellar looking for Ann but gets locked in. Lucy hears Bob's cries and tries to open the cellar door. When she cannot open it, Norman returns and hacks the door with a hatchet. The rotting right hand of Freudstein (Giovanni De Nava) appears and restrains Bob. One of Norman's axe blows through the door severs the ghoul's seemingly normal left hand, and he staggers back down the stairs.

Norman and Lucy finally get into the cellar, which contains several mutilated bodies (including Ann, Mrs. Gittleson, and the couple from the beginning of the film), surgical equipment, and a [[slab (casting)|slab]]. Freudstein is a living corpse with rotting flesh. Norman tells Lucy that the 150-year-old Freudstein lives by using his victims' parts to regenerate blood cells. Norman attacks Freudstein, but the ghoul twists the hatchet away. He grabs a knife from the slab and stabs Freudstein, causing rotten flesh and maggots to ooze out of his old lab coat. Freudstein picks up Norman and rips his throat out. Lucy and Bob climb a ladder leading to the cracked tombstone. Lucy strains to shift the stone, but Freudstein grabs her and drags her down the stairs, killing her by ramming her head into the concrete floor. As Freudstein advances up the ladder, Bob strains to escape. As Freudstein grabs Bob's leg, he is suddenly yanked upwards by Mae. With Mae is her mother, Mary Freudstein (Teresa Rossi Passante), who tells them it's time to leave. Mrs. Freudstein leads Mae and Bob down the wintry grove into an apparent ghost world.

==Production==
Fulci later claimed that after making ''[[The Black Cat (1981 film)|The Black Cat]]'' and ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'' that he wanted to make a film in tribute to [[HP Lovecraft]] without the film being based on one of his stories.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=85}}{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=86}} Screenwriter [[Dardano Sacchetti]] was inspired by [[Henry James]]' ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=86}} Sacchetti also stated the film was based on his own personal experiences as a child, being born in a large country house with a large dark basement and that age 9 he had to cross a cemetery at night.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=86}} In his biography, Fulci spoke negatively about Sacchetti's contributions as a screenwriter saying that ''The House by the Cemetery'' was derivative of scenes from ''[[The House That Screamed (1969 film)|The House That Screamed]]''.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=86}} The film went through several changes from the original story by [[Elisa Briganti]] and the script by Sacchetti.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}}  The script was originally titled ''La notte dell'inferno'' ({{translation|The Night of Hell}}) which became ''La casa di Freudstein'' and then ''Quella casa accanto al cimitero''.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}} Sacchetti's script was revised by Fulci and [[Giorgio Mariuzzo]], Mariuzzo claimed he worked as a [[script doctor]] slightly changing work stating that Sacchetti's scripts were often too short.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}} Sacchetti commented on this stating that \"Mariuzzo always intervened afterwards, either because I had to leave to work on another film or refused to make those changes that Lucio demanded. That was the reason for our arguments.\"{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}} 

''The House by the Cemetery'' was shot on location in [[New York City|New York]], [[Boston]], and [[Concord, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=85}} The film was also shot in studios at De Paolis In.Co.R. Studios in Rome.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=85}} Shooting the film took eight weeks between March 16 and May 1981.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=85}} The film was made on a budget of approximately 600 million [[Italian lire]].{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=85}} Despite the credits stating that the special make-up effects were provided by [[Giannetto di Rossi]] and [[Maurizio Trani]], only Trani worked on the film.{{sfn|Curti|2019|p=89}}

The '''Battle of Burton Bridge''' was fought between Royalist and Parliamentarian forces at [[Burton upon Trent]] on 4 July 1643 during the [[First English Civil War]].  By the time of the battle the town, which had at various times been held by both sides, was garrisoned by a Parliamentarian unit under the command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the town's military governor, Colonel Richard Houghton.  The key river crossing at Burton was desired by Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who was proceeding southwards from Yorkshire with a convoy of supplies destined for King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at Oxford.  The Royalists, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], launched a cavalry charge across the bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their officers, including Sanders and Houghton.  The Queen's convoy proceeded on its way south to Oxford with Tyldesley receiving a knighthood and a promotion in recognition of his victory.  Burton changed hands several more times during the course of the war, before finally coming into Parliament's control in 1646.

== Background ==
The county of Staffordshire, several days travel from the main seat of power in London, had a long-standing disinclination to paying taxes and levies imposed by the King.  [[James I]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was forced to write to the county's [[Justices of the Peace]] for their failure to raise a single penny to support the King's [[Palatinate campaign|campaign to reclaim the Palatinate]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] for his son-in-law [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] in the 1620s.<ref name=\"p3\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=3}}.</ref>  The county was also slow to pay [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s [[ship money]] which began to be levied (in defiance of the Parliament) on the inland counties in 1634 and saw much resistance.<ref name=\"p3\"/>  Open dissent against the King's decrees occurred in 1640 in objection to the levying of 300 men from the county for the King's [[Bishops' Wars|campaign against the Scots]].<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=5}}.</ref>  Riots took place in [[Uttoxeter]] with an armed guard having to be formed to prevent the levy from deserting.<ref name=\"p5\"/>

Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 the town of Burton was largely sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause.<ref name=county>Tringham, General History.</ref>   This was probably, in part, due to the large [[Puritan]] following in the town and Staffordshire's general disapproval of the [[High Church]] practices of the then Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]] (who was later executed for his opposition of Puritanism).<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p4\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=4}}.</ref>

== Early-war Burton ==
Burton's river crossing, a 36-arched medieval structure known as \"Burton Bridge\", was desirable to both sides, being described as \"the only passage over the [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Dove, Central England|Dove]] to the North\", and was positioned between the Royalist towns of Lichfield, Tutbury, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Parliamentarian Stafford and Derby.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p19\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=19}}.</ref>  Despite this strategic location the town was unfortified and possessed few natural defences.<ref name=county/>  Burton would change hands at least a dozen times during the course of the war, first coming to the attention of the Royalists when the [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield|Earl of Chesterfield]] used it as a rendezvous for his forces in late 1642.<ref name=county/>  Chesterfield withdrew his forces to Lichfield for the winter, garrisoning the [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]] which would be the scene of much fighting during the war.<ref name=\"p15\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=15}}.</ref>  There were rumours prior to the war that the town held secret supplies of gunpowder for a catholic rebellion, these were investigated by [[William Paget, 5th Baron Paget|Lord Paget]] (who began the war as a parliamentarian, switched allegiance to the King in 1642 before returning to the side of Parliament in 1644) and found to be false, though the explosion of a store of gunpowder did occur in 1643 causing the roof of [[St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent|St Modwen's Church]] to be destroyed.<ref name=county/><ref>Tringham, Established Church.</ref>

[[File:John Gell.jpg|thumb|left|Sir John Gell]]
East Staffordshire's strategic importance was heightened by its position at the boundary of Royalist and Parliamentarian garrisons in the region.<ref name=\"p16\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=16}}.</ref>  Burton had come to [[roundhead]] attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]].<ref name=county/>  In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton, consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes Molanus, but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an [[Newark-on-Trent#The Civil War|attack on Newark]].<ref name=county/>

Parliament's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  Shortly thereafter, Gell whose forces amounted to around 1,000 infantry, a few horse and 300 partially armed [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlanders]] met with [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], Commander-in-Chief of Cheshire, to organise an attack upon Stafford.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  This became known to the Royalists and the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] was sent with two fast-moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton's plan.<ref name=\"p17\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=17}}.</ref>  Northampton met with troops led by [[Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough|Henry Hastings]] (later Lord Loughborough) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]], during which Northampton was killed.<ref name=\"p17\"/>

During this time [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed at [[Bridlington]], Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King, who was then in [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  In advance of this the King sent his nephew, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], from Oxford with 1,200 horse, 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Prince Rupert's troops evicted garrisons from [[Rushall, West Midlands|Rushall]] and [[Birmingham]] and successfully [[Lichfield Cathedral#Devastation of the English Civil War|recaptured Lichfield]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta's convoy.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell, acting in co-operation with [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey]], commander-in-chief of the East Midlands Association.<ref name=county/>  He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry, 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to [[Tutbury Castle]] which he unsuccessfully attacked.<ref name=\"county\"/><ref name=\"Lewisp19\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=19}}.</ref>

== Battle ==
[[File:Tyldesley.jpg|thumb|Sir Thomas Tyldesley]]
Gell's garrison at Burton was commanded by Captain Thomas Sanders, who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell's force.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him.<ref name=county/>  Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton, of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p20\"/>

In July 1643 the Queen's convoy and its guard advanced from Newark to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and then to Burton.<ref name=\"p20\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=20}}.</ref>  Gell summoned the Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to [[Muster (military)|muster]] for him.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  On 4 July 1643 the Roylist cavalry, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders' men.<ref name=county/> The engagement was described as \"bloody\" and \"desperate\" and, though damage was caused to the town's St Modwen's church, the battle seems to have been decided by the action at the bridge.<ref name=\"p20l\"/><ref name=lanc>Remember Sir Thomas.</ref>  The forces of parliament were decisively beaten and, according to Gell, the town was \"most miserably plundered and destroyed\".<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Henrietta Maria herself recorded that so much loot was taken that her men \"could not well march with their bundles\".<ref name=county/>

The Royalists claimed that they had twice requested the surrender of the town before they attacked and that the Queen forbade any violence against the townsfolk.<ref name=\"p20l\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=20}}.</ref>  Conversely the parliamentarians claimed that 30 of their men were forced into the church and offered to surrender but were refused and were killed by cavaliers in the night.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists were also alleged to have looted the town and raped women before drowning at least 20 civilians in the river.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists took most of the Roundhead officers prisoner including Captain Sanders and Colonel Houghton (and his wife).<ref name=\"p20\"/><ref name=\"p20l\"/>  Sanders was later exchanged and was promoted to Major by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and commissioned by Gell to act as Colonel and to raise a regiment of horse.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Tyldesley was knighted and promoted to brigadier-general for bravery shown in the action.<ref name=\"ODNB\">Blackwood.</ref>

== Aftermath ==
[[File:HenriettaMariaofFrance02.jpg|thumb|Queen Henrietta Maria]]
Having lost Burton, Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] to defend it.<ref name=\"p21\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=21}}.</ref> He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder, 300 muskets, 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses, allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time.<ref name=\"p21\"/>  However Derby was not attacked by the Queen's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall, proceeding according to the King's instructions to avoid delays.<ref name=\"p21\"/>

The new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644.<ref name=county/>  During this attack Gell took the commanding officer (a Major), six captains, eight other officers and 500 men prisoner.<ref name=\"p31\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=31}}.</ref>  Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there, with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack.<ref name=\"p31\"/>  Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby, allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his \"flying army\" at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire.<ref name=\"p31\"/>

A Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644, afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more, before Sanders' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it  narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p31\"/>  Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645.<ref name=county/>  King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646, becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield.<ref name=county/>  After the war and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 Burton remained a place of [[English Dissenters|dissent]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] with large [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] congregations, raising doubts within the [[Church of England]] over the town's loyalty.<ref name=county/>

== Legacy ==
The medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era.<ref name=county/>  A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the [[English Civil War Society]].{{efn|The plaque on the modern bridge commemorating the battle reads: \"near this spot on 2nd July 1643, during the English Civil War, Colonel Thomas Tyldesley led a desperate cavalry charge over the famous 36-arched Trent Bridge to storm the town of Burton, the event being personally witnessed by Queen Henrietta Maria. For this exploit of signal valour, Thomas Tyldesley was subsequently knighted by King Charles I.  This plaque was erected on 2nd July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the English Civil War Society and Burton upon Trent Civic Society.\"}}
Another monument erected at the site of Tyldesley's death at the [[Battle of Wigan Lane]] by one of his [[Cornet (military rank)|cornets]], Alexander Rigby, in 1679 notes his \"desperate storming of Burton-Upon-Trent over a bridge of 36 arches [for which Tyldesley] received the honour of Knighthood\".<ref name=lanc/>  In honour of the battle the [[Burton Bridge Brewery]] markets an ale known as \"Battle Brew\".<ref>Battle Brew.</ref>  A local legend states that Oliver Cromwell was present in the area during the battle and tied his horse to a nail at [[Tatenhill]]'s St Michael's and All Angels Church, just {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the bridge.<ref>Moody.</ref> The medieval Burton bridge was the site of [[Battle of Burton Bridge (1322)|an earlier battle]] in 1322 where [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] defeated the rebellious [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Earl of Lancaster]].<ref name=county/>

The '''Battle of Burton Bridge''' was fought between Royalist and Parliamentarian forces at [[Burton upon Trent]] on 4 July 1643 during the [[First English Civil War]].  By the time of the battle the town, which had at various times been held by both sides, was garrisoned by a Parliamentarian unit under the command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the town's military governor, Colonel Richard Houghton.  The key river crossing at Burton was desired by Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who was proceeding southwards from Yorkshire with a convoy of supplies destined for King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at Oxford.  The Royalists, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], launched a cavalry charge across the bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their officers, including Sanders and Houghton.  The Queen's convoy proceeded on its way south to Oxford with Tyldesley receiving a knighthood and a promotion in recognition of his victory.  Burton changed hands several more times during the course of the war, before finally coming into Parliament's control in 1646.

== Background ==
The county of Staffordshire, several days travel from the main seat of power in London, had a long-standing disinclination to paying taxes and levies imposed by the King.  [[James I]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was forced to write to the county's [[Justices of the Peace]] for their failure to raise a single penny to support the King's [[Palatinate campaign|campaign to reclaim the Palatinate]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] for his son-in-law [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] in the 1620s.<ref name=\"p3\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=3}}.</ref>  The county was also slow to pay [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s [[ship money]] which began to be levied (in defiance of the Parliament) on the inland counties in 1634 and saw much resistance.<ref name=\"p3\"/>  Open dissent against the King's decrees occurred in 1640 in objection to the levying of 300 men from the county for the King's [[Bishops' Wars|campaign against the Scots]].<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=5}}.</ref>  Riots took place in [[Uttoxeter]] with an armed guard having to be formed to prevent the levy from deserting.<ref name=\"p5\"/>

Upon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 the town of Burton was largely sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause.<ref name=county>{{cite book|last=Tringham|first=Nigel J.|title=A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 9 - Burton-upon-Trent&nbsp;— General History|year=2003|publisher=Victoria County History|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=12328}}</ref>   This was probably, in part, due to the large [[Puritan]] following in the town and Staffordshire's general disapproval of the [[High Church]] practices of the then Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]] (who was later executed for his opposition of Puritanism).<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p4\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=4}}.</ref>

== Early-war Burton ==
Burton's river crossing, a 36-arched medieval structure known as \"Burton Bridge\", was desirable to both sides, being described as \"the only passage over the [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Dove, Central England|Dove]] to the North\", and was positioned between the Royalist towns of Lichfield, Tutbury, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Parliamentarian Stafford and Derby.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p19\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=19}}.</ref>  Despite this strategic location the town was unfortified and possessed few natural defences.<ref name=county/>  Burton would change hands at least a dozen times during the course of the war, first coming to the attention of the Royalists when the [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield|Earl of Chesterfield]] used it as a rendezvous for his forces in late 1642.<ref name=county/>  Chesterfield withdrew his forces to Lichfield for the winter, garrisoning the [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]] which would be the scene of much fighting during the war.<ref name=\"p15\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=15}}.</ref>  There were rumours prior to the war that the town held secret supplies of gunpowder for a catholic rebellion, these were investigated by [[William Paget, 5th Baron Paget|Lord Paget]] (who began the war as a parliamentarian, switched allegiance to the King in 1642 before returning to the side of Parliament in 1644) and found to be false, though the explosion of a store of gunpowder did occur in 1643 causing the roof of [[St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent|St Modwen's Church]] to be destroyed.<ref name=county/><ref>{{cite book|last=Tringham|first=Nigel J.|title=A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 9 - Burton-upon-Trent&nbsp;— Established church|year=2003|publisher=Victoria County History|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=12339}}</ref>

East Staffordshire's strategic importance was heightened by its position at the boundary of Royalist and Parliamentarian garrisons in the region.<ref name=\"p16\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=16}}.</ref>  Burton had come to [[roundhead]] attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]].<ref name=county/>  In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton, consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes Molanus, but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an [[Newark-on-Trent#The Civil War|attack on Newark]].<ref name=county/>

Parliament's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  Gell's forces now amounted to around 1,000 infantry, a few horse and 300 partially armed [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlanders]] and he met with [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], Commander-in-Chief of Cheshire, to organise an attack upon Stafford.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  This became known to the Royalists and the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] was sent with two fast-moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton's plan.<ref name=\"p17\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=17}}.</ref>  Northampton met with troops led by [[Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough|Henry Hastings]] (later Lord Loughborough) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]], during which Northampton was killed.<ref name=\"p17\"/>

During this time [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed at [[Bridlington]], Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King, who was then in [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  In advance of this the King sent his nephew, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], from Oxford with 1,200 horse, 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Prince Rupert's troops evicted garrisons from [[Rushall, West Midlands|Rushall]] and [[Birmingham]] and successfully [[Lichfield Cathedral#Devastation of the English Civil War|recaptured Lichfield]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta's convoy.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell, acting in co-operation with [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey]], commander-in-chief of the East Midlands Association.<ref name=county/>  He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry, 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to [[Tutbury Castle]] which he unsuccessfully attacked.<ref name=\"county\"/><ref name=\"Lewisp19\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=19}}.</ref>

Gell's garrison at Burton was commanded by Captain Thomas Sanders, who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell's force.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him.<ref name=county/>  Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton, of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p20\"/>

In July 1643 the Queen's convoy and its guard advanced from Newark to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and then to Burton.<ref name=\"p20\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=20}}.</ref>  Gell summoned the Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to [[Muster (military)|muster]] for him.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  On 4 July 1643 the Roaylist cavalry, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders' men.<ref name=county/><ref name=plaque/>  The engagement was described as \"bloody\" and \"desperate\" and, though damage was caused to the town's St Modwen's church, the battle seems to have been decided by the action at the bridge.<ref name=\"p20\"/><ref name=plaque>The plaque on the modern bridge commemorating the battle reads: \"near this spot on 2nd July 1643, during the English Civil War, Colonel Thomas Tyldesley led a desperate cavalry charge over the famous 36-arched Trent Bridge to storm the town of Burton, the event being personally witnessed by Queen Henrietta Maria.

The Royalists claimed that they had twice requested the surrender of the town before they attacked and that the Queen forbade any violence against the townsfolk.<ref name=\"p20l\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=20}}.</ref>  Conversely the parliamentarians claimed that 30 of their men were forced into the church and offered to surrender but were refused and were killed by cavaliers in the night.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists were also alleged to have looted the town and raped women before drowning at least 20 civilians in the river.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists took most of the Roundhead officers prisoner including Captain Sanders and Colonel Houghton (and his wife).<ref name=\"p20\"/><ref name=\"p20l\"/>  Sanders was later exchanged and was promoted to Major by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and commissioned by Gell to act as Colonel and to raise a regiment of horse.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Tyldesley was knighted and promoted to brigadier-general for bravery shown in the action.<ref name=\"ODNB\">{{citation |last=Blackwood |first=Gordon |contribution=Tyldesley, Sir Thomas (1612–1651) |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |edition=online |publisher=Oxford University Press |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/|year=2004 |accessdate=30 August 2010}} {{subscription}}</ref>

== Aftermath ==
[[File:HenriettaMariaofFrance02.jpg|thumb|Queen Henrietta Maria]]
Having lost Burton, Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] to defend it.<ref name=\"p21\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=21}}.</ref> He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder, 300 muskets, 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses, allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time.<ref name=\"p21\"/>  However Derby was not attacked by the Queen's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall, proceeding according to the King's instructions to avoid delays.<ref name=\"p21\"/>

The new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644.<ref name=county/>  During this attack Gell took the commanding officer (a Major), six captains, eight other officers and 500 men prisoner.<ref name=\"p31\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=31}}.</ref>  Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there, with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack.<ref name=\"p31\"/>  Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby, allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his \"flying army\" at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire.<ref name=\"p31\"/>

A Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644, afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more, before Sanders' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it  narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p31\"/>  Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645.<ref name=county/>  King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646, becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield.<ref name=county/>  After the war and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 Burton remained a place of [[English Dissenters|dissent]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] with large [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] congregations, raising doubts within the [[Church of England]] over the town's loyalty.<ref name=county/>

== Legacy ==
The medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era.<ref name=county/>  A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the [[English Civil War Society]] (the umbrella group for English Civil War re-enactors).<ref name=plaque/> Another monument erected at the site of Tyldesley's death at the [[Battle of Wigan Lane]] by one of his [[Cornet (military rank)|cornets]], Alexander Rigby, in 1679 notes his \"desperate storming of Burton-Upon-Trent over a bridge of 36 arches [for which Tyldesley] received the honour of Knighthood\".<ref name=lanc/>  In honour of the battle the [[Burton Bridge Brewery]] markets an ale known as \"Battle Brew\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Battle Brew|url=http://www.burtonbridgebrewery.co.uk/Bridge/Beers/Battle.shtml|publisher=Burton Bridge Brewery|accessdate=26 February 2012}}</ref>  A local legend states that Oliver Cromwell was present in the area during the battle and tied his horse to a nail at [[Tatenhill]]'s St Michael's and All Angels Church, just {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the bridge.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moody|first=Jenny|title=All is well at church's holey site|url=http://www.burtonmail.co.uk/News/All-is-well-at-churchs-holey-site.htm|accessdate=9 October 2011|newspaper=Burton Mail|date=19 February 2009}}</ref>  The medieval Burton bridge was the site of [[Battle of Burton Bridge (1322)|an earlier battle]] in 1322 where [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] defeated the rebellious [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Earl of Lancaster]].<ref name=county/>
