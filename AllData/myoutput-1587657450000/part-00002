It also describes task forces of other ministries (such as the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]' [[ODON]] and [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]]' special rescue unit)<ref>{{cite web|last=Lunev|first=Stanislav|author-link=Stanislav Lunev|url=http://www.sambofrance.org/documents/degradation.html|title=The Degradation of Russia's Special Forces|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref> in post-Soviet countries.

The [[5th Spetsnaz Brigade]] of Belarus is such an example of non-Russian Spetsnaz forces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/gru/5obrsn.htm|title=5th independent military police Brigade GRU|date=3 October 2014|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Russian Marine Commandos Frogmen II.jpg|thumb|[[Russian commando frogmen|Naval Spetsnaz \"Frogmen\"]] performing operations on land, armed with an [[APS underwater rifle|APS Underwater Rifle]].]] -->\n[[File:Special forces Military of Russia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Russian special operations forces|Spetsnaz SSO]] snipers.]]\n\nThe Russian abbreviations ''spetsnaz'' and ''osnaz'' are [[syllabic abbreviation]]s typical{{clarify|date=June 2017|reason=What does 'typical' mean in this context, and according to whom?}} of [[Soviet era]] Russian, for ''spetsialnovo naznacheniya'' and ''osobovo naznacheniya'', both of which may be interpreted as \"special purpose\". As syllabic acronyms they are not normally [[upper case|capitalized]].\n\nThey are general terms that were used for a variety of Soviet [[special operations]] (''spetsoperatsiya'') units. In addition, many ''[[Cheka]]'' and [[Internal Troops]] units (such as ''[[OMSDON]]'' and ''[[ODON]]'') also included ''osobovo naznacheniya'' in their full names. Regular forces assigned to special tasks were sometimes also referred to by terms such as ''spetsnaz'' and ''osnaz''.\n\n''Spetsnaz'' later referred specifically to special (''spetsialnovo'') purpose (''naznacheniya'') or special operations (spetsoperatsiya; ''spec ops'') forces, and the word's widespread use is a relatively recent, post-''[[perestroika]]'' development in Russian language. The Soviet public used to know very little about their country's special forces until many state secrets were disclosed under the ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") policy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the late 1980s. Since then, stories about ''spetsnaz'' and their purportedly incredible prowess, from the serious to the highly questionable, have captivated the imagination of patriotic Russians, particularly in the midst of the post-Soviet era decay in military and security forces during the era of ''perestroika ''championed by Mikhail Gorbachev and continued under Boris Yeltsin. A number of books about the Soviet military intelligence special forces, such as 1987's ''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/spetsnaz-the-story-behind-the-soviet-sas/oclc/768618982 Spetsnaz: The Story Behind the Soviet SAS]'' by defected [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] agent [[Viktor Suvorov]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spetsnaz. The Story Behind the Soviet SAS|last=Suvorov|first=Victor|publisher=Hamish Hamilton Ltd.|year=1987|isbn=0-241-11961-8|location=London|pages=}}</ref> helped introduce the term to the Western public. In ''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'',<ref>''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'' ({{lang|ru|\u0410\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0443\u043c}}), 1985, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-241-11545-0}}</ref> a book published by Viktor Suvorov after defecting to the west, he alleges that the Spetsnaz used condemned criminals from the Gulag system (even other condemned secret operatives) as \"dolls\" and \"gladiators\" for to-the-death combat training. It is not known when the practice stopped. The author mentions duels to the death becoming more rare during the time of his service due to \"procurement of dolls\" becoming harder. Additionally Suvorov frequently references the co-location of some secret Spetsnaz training facilities that killed prisoners in this way, adjacent to Gulags for this reason.\n\nIn post-Soviet Russia \"''Spetsnaz''\" became a colloquial term as special operations (''spetsoperatsiya''), from police raids to military operations in internal conflicts, grew more common. Coverage of these operations, and the celebrity status of special operations forces in state-controlled media, encouraged the public to identify many of these forces by name: [[SOBR]], [[Alpha Group|Alpha]], [[Vityaz (MVD)|Vityaz]]. The term ''Spetsnaz'' has also continued to be used in several other [[post-Soviet state]]s such as Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan for their own special operations forces. In Russia, foreign special operations forces are also known as \"Spetsnaz\" (for example, [[United States special operations forces]] would be called \"''amerikanskiy spetsnaz''\"). {{Clear}}\n\n==Known operations history==\n===Second World War===\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0412. \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Leonov]] helped lay the foundation for modern day [[Russian commando frogmen|Naval Spetsnaz]] operations.]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], it became clear early on for Soviet leadership that it had an urgent need for immediate intelligence on German land forces in northern Norway and Finland. On 5 July 1941 Admiral [[Arseniy Golovko]] of the [[Northern Fleet]] authorized the formation of a ground reconnaissance detachment. This unit, the [[Russian commando frogmen|4th Special Volunteer Detachment]], was to be recruited from the fleet's athletes and have an initial fill of 65 to 70 personnel. Later the unit was renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Spetsnaz:Russia's Special Forces by Mark Galeotti</ref> The most prominent of these new recruits was [[Viktor Leonov]], who joined the [[Soviet Navy]] in 1937.

Leonov along with Capt. Kulebyakin and 140 men, landed on a Japanese airfield at [[Port Vonsan]], not realizing they were opposed by over 3,500 enemy soldiers.

On 16 November 2007, the [[BBC]] and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that Eduard Koltsov, a [[Russian commando frogmen|Soviet frogman]], claimed to have caught Crabb placing a mine on the [[Sverdlov-class cruiser|''Ordzhonikidze'']] hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat.

It is alleged that through a network of supporting KGB operatives, members of the task force identified each of the perpetrators involved in the crisis; once these had been identified, the team began to take relatives of these militants as hostages. Following the standard Soviet policy of not negotiating with terrorists, some of the hostages taken by Alpha were dismembered, and their body parts sent to the militants.

This was the first use of ''\"spetsnaz\"'' to denote a separate military branch since [[World War II]]. These companies were later expanded to battalions and then to brigades. However, some separate companies (orSpN) and detachments (ooSpN) existed with brigades until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe special-purpose forces of the Armed Forces of the [[Soviet Union]] included fourteen land brigades, two naval brigades and a number of separate detachments and companies, operating under the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)|Main Intelligence Directorate]] (GRU) and collectively known as [[Spetsnaz GRU]]. These units and formations existed in the highest possible secrecy, disguised as [[Russian Airborne Troops|Soviet paratroopers]] (Army spetsnaz) or [[Soviet Naval Infantry|naval infantrymen]] (Naval spetsnaz) by their uniforms and insignia.\n\nTwenty-four years after the birth of Spetsnaz, the Chairman of the KGB General [[Yuri Andropov]] (in that office from 1967 to 1982) established the first counter-terrorist unit. From the late 1970s through to the 1980s, a number of special-purpose units were founded in the KGB (1954\u20131991) and in the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) (1946\u20131954).\n\nDuring the 1990s special detachments were established within the [[Federal Penitentiary Service]] (FSIN) and the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne Troops]] (VDV). Some civil agencies with non-police functions have formed special units also known as ''Spetsnaz'', such as the Leader special centre in the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] (MChS).\n\nIn total, by December 1991, at the time of the collapse of the USSR, the GRU reconnaissance and sabotage formations had:\n* 14 special purpose brigades \n* 2 special purposes regiments\n* 29 independent special purpose companies \n* 5 naval reconnaissance point\n\nIn 2013 a Special Operations Forces Command was established for Special Operations Forces which had earlier been established from around 2009 following a study of Western special-operations forces units and commands.

Other units are stationed in [[Moscow]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Khabarovsk]]. All Alpha operators undergo airborne, mountain and counter-sabotage dive training. Alpha has operated in other countries, most notably [[Operation Storm-333]] (when Alpha and Zenith detachments supported the 154th Independent Spetsnaz Detachment\u2014known as the \"Muslim Battalion\"\u2014of the GRU on a mission to overthrow and kill Afghan president [[Hafizullah Amin]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Take-Down of Kabul: An Effective Coup de Main |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2002/MOUTGrau.htm |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org | accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSpetsgruppa \"V\", abbreviation of the Directorate \u0432 (Russian Cyrillic for V), also known as \"Vega\" in period 1993\u20131995, was formed in 1981, merging two elite Cold War-era KGB special units\u2014Cascade (''Kaskad'') and Zenith (''Zenit'')\u2014which were similar to the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] (responsible for clandestine / covert operations involving sabotage and assassination in other countries) and re-designated for counter-terrorist and counter-sabotage operations. It is tasked with the protection of strategic installations, such as factories and transportation centers. With its Alpha counterparts, it is heavily used in the North Caucasus. Vympel has four operative units in Moscow, with branch offices in nearly every city containing a nuclear power plant.\n\nSpetsgruppa \"S\", abbreviation of the Directorate C (Russian Cyrillic for S), also known as Smerch, but also known as the Service of Special Operations (\u0421\u0421\u041e), is a relatively new unit formed in July 1999. Officers from Smerch are frequently involved with the capture and transfer of various bandit and criminal leaders who help aid disruption in the North Caucasus and throughout Russia. Operations include both direct action against bandit holdouts in Southern Russia as well as high-profile arrests in more densely populated cities and guarding government officials. Because of its initials, this group is casually referred to as \"Smerch\". With the Centre of Special Operations and its elite units, many FSB special forces units operate at the regional level. These detachments are usually known as ROSN or ROSO (Regional Department of Special Designation), such as [[Saint Petersburg]]'s ''Grad'' (Hail) or [[Murmansk]]'s ''Kasatka'' (Orca).\n\n==Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation==\nThe [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR RF]], formerly the [[First Chief Directorate]] of the KGB of the USSR, has its own top secret elite special force within the Operations Department of Directorate Z known as {{Interlanguage link multi|Zaslon (SVR)|ru|3=\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043d (\u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435)|lt=Zaslon}} (\u0417\u0430\u0441\u043b\u043e\u043d) (meaning Screen, Barrier or Shield) about which extremely little is known.

Nevertheless, there were some rumors that such group does indeed exist and is assigned to execute very specific special operations abroad primarily for protection of Russian embassy personnel and internal investigations. It is believed that the group is deep undercover and consists of approximately 300\u2013500 highly experienced operatives speaking several languages and having extensive record of operations while serving in other secret units of the Russian military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vietnamdefence.com/Home/tinhbaoanninh/chiendichtinhbao/Pho-Thu-tuong-Nga-bat-can-tiet-lo-don-vi-dac-nhiem-hanh-dong-cua-tinh-bao-Nga/20145/53688.vnd|title=Vietnamdefence.com \u2013 Tin Qu\u00e2n s\u1ef1 24h|publisher=|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.blouinnews.com/blouinbeatpolitics/2013/05/10/special-force-deployment-to-syria-may-signal-moscows-doubts/|title=Special force deployment to Syria may signal Moscow's doubts|work=BLOUIN BEAT: Politics|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/russian-zaslon-special-operations-2013-5|title=Russian Zaslon Special Operations \u2013 Business Insider|date=19 May 2013|work=Business Insider|accessdate=31 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Soviet MVD and Russian National Guard special forces==\n[[File:VVday2015 47.jpg|thumb|604th Special Purpose Centre operator.]]\n[[File:Beret-water.jpg|thumb|right|Water obstacle phase during tryouts for the OSN [[Maroon Beret]].]]\n[[File:Interpolitex 2012 (477-12).jpg|thumb|SURPAT wearing OSN \"Grom\" operator of the Russian [[Federal Drug Control Service]].]]\nThe special missions units of the [[National Guard of Russia]] (consolidated and replaced the forces of the [[Internal Troops of Russia|MVD Internal Troops]], [[SOBR]], [[OMON]]) includes a number of [[Internal Troops of Russia|Russian Internal Troops]] (VV, successor to the Soviet [[Internal Troops]]) paramilitary units to combat internal threats to the government, such as insurgencies and mutinies.

The [[5th Spetsnaz Brigade]] of Belarus is such an example of non-Russian Spetsnaz forces.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ww2.dk/new/army/gru/5obrsn.htm|title=5th independent military police Brigade GRU|date=3 October 2014|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Russian Marine Commandos Frogmen II.jpg|thumb|[[Russian commando frogmen|Naval Spetsnaz \"Frogmen\"]] performing operations on land, armed with an [[APS underwater rifle|APS Underwater Rifle]].]] -->\n[[File:Special forces Military of Russia 01.jpg|thumb|[[Russian special operations forces|Spetsnaz SSO]] snipers.]]\n\nThe Russian abbreviations ''spetsnaz'' and ''osnaz'' are [[syllabic abbreviation]]s typical{{clarify|date=June 2017|reason=What does 'typical' mean in this context, and according to whom?}} of [[Soviet era]] Russian, for ''spetsialnovo naznacheniya'' and ''osobovo naznacheniya'', both of which may be interpreted as \"special purpose\". As syllabic acronyms they are not normally [[upper case|capitalized]].\n\nThey are general terms that were used for a variety of Soviet [[special operations]] (''spetsoperatsiya'') units. In addition, many ''[[Cheka]]'' and [[Internal Troops]] units (such as ''[[OMSDON]]'' and ''[[ODON]]'') also included ''osobovo naznacheniya'' in their full names. Regular forces assigned to special tasks were sometimes also referred to by terms such as ''spetsnaz'' and ''osnaz''.\n\n''Spetsnaz'' later referred specifically to special (''spetsialnovo'') purpose (''naznacheniya'') or special operations (spetsoperatsiya; ''spec ops'') forces, and the word's widespread use is a relatively recent, post-''[[perestroika]]'' development in Russian language. The Soviet public used to know very little about their country's special forces until many state secrets were disclosed under the ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") policy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the late 1980s. Since then, stories about ''spetsnaz'' and their purportedly incredible prowess, from the serious to the highly questionable, have captivated the imagination of patriotic Russians, particularly in the midst of the post-Soviet era decay in military and security forces during the era of ''perestroika ''championed by Mikhail Gorbachev and continued under Boris Yeltsin. A number of books about the Soviet military intelligence special forces, such as 1987's ''[http://www.worldcat.org/title/spetsnaz-the-story-behind-the-soviet-sas/oclc/768618982 Spetsnaz: The Story Behind the Soviet SAS]'' by defected [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] agent [[Viktor Suvorov]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spetsnaz.

In ''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'',<ref>''[[Aquarium (Suvorov)|Aquarium]]'' ({{lang|ru|\u0410\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0443\u043c}}), 1985, Hamish Hamilton Ltd, {{ISBN|0-241-11545-0}}</ref> a book published by Viktor Suvorov after defecting to the west, he alleges that the Spetsnaz used condemned criminals from the Gulag system (even other condemned secret operatives) as \"dolls\" and \"gladiators\" for to-the-death combat training. It is not known when the practice stopped. The author mentions duels to the death becoming more rare during the time of his service due to \"procurement of dolls\" becoming harder. Additionally Suvorov frequently references the co-location of some secret Spetsnaz training facilities that killed prisoners in this way, adjacent to Gulags for this reason.\n\nIn post-Soviet Russia \"''Spetsnaz''\" became a colloquial term as special operations (''spetsoperatsiya''), from police raids to military operations in internal conflicts, grew more common. Coverage of these operations, and the celebrity status of special operations forces in state-controlled media, encouraged the public to identify many of these forces by name: [[SOBR]], [[Alpha Group|Alpha]], [[Vityaz (MVD)|Vityaz]]. The term ''Spetsnaz'' has also continued to be used in several other [[post-Soviet state]]s such as Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan for their own special operations forces. In Russia, foreign special operations forces are also known as \"Spetsnaz\" (for example, [[United States special operations forces]] would be called \"''amerikanskiy spetsnaz''\"). {{Clear}}\n\n==Known operations history==\n===Second World War===\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u0412. \u041b\u0435\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430.jpg|thumb|[[Viktor Leonov]] helped lay the foundation for modern day [[Russian commando frogmen|Naval Spetsnaz]] operations.]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], it became clear early on for Soviet leadership that it had an urgent need for immediate intelligence on German land forces in northern Norway and Finland. On 5 July 1941 Admiral [[Arseniy Golovko]] of the [[Northern Fleet]] authorized the formation of a ground reconnaissance detachment. This unit, the [[Russian commando frogmen|4th Special Volunteer Detachment]], was to be recruited from the fleet's athletes and have an initial fill of 65 to 70 personnel. Later the unit was renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Spetsnaz:Russia's Special Forces by Mark Galeotti</ref> The most prominent of these new recruits was [[Viktor Leonov]], who joined the [[Soviet Navy]] in 1937.

Leonov along with Capt. Kulebyakin and 140 men, landed on a Japanese airfield at [[Port Vonsan]], not realizing they were opposed by over 3,500 enemy soldiers.

On 16 November 2007, the [[BBC]] and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' reported that Eduard Koltsov, a [[Russian commando frogmen|Soviet frogman]], claimed to have caught Crabb placing a mine on the [[Sverdlov-class cruiser|''Ordzhonikidze'']] hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat.

It is alleged that through a network of supporting KGB operatives, members of the task force identified each of the perpetrators involved in the crisis; once these had been identified, the team began to take relatives of these militants as hostages. Following the standard Soviet policy of not negotiating with terrorists, some of the hostages taken by Alpha were dismembered, and their body parts sent to the militants. The warning was clear: more would follow unless the remaining hostages were released immediately. The show of force worked, and for 20 years, no Soviet or Russian officials was taken captive, until the 2006 [[Abduction of Russian diplomats in Iraq|abduction and murder]] of four Russian embassy staff in [[Iraq]].\n\nHowever, the veracity of this story has been brought into question.

These forces were subordinate to [[Front (military formation)|front]] commanders.<ref>Carey Schofield, ''The Russian Elite: Inside Spetsnaz and the Airborne Forces'', Greenhill, London, 1993, p.34-37</ref> The infamous [[NKVD]] internal-security and espionage agency also had their own special purpose (''osnaz'') detachments, including many saboteur teams who were airdropped into enemy-occupied territories to work with (and often take over and lead) the [[Soviet Partisans]].\n\nIn 1950 [[Georgy Zhukov]] advocated the creation of 46 military ''spetsnaz'' companies, each consisting of 120 servicemen. This was the first use of ''\"spetsnaz\"'' to denote a separate military branch since [[World War II]]. These companies were later expanded to battalions and then to brigades. However, some separate companies (orSpN) and detachments (ooSpN) existed with brigades until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe special-purpose forces of the Armed Forces of the [[Soviet Union]] included fourteen land brigades, two naval brigades and a number of separate detachments and companies, operating under the [[Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)|Main Intelligence Directorate]] (GRU) and collectively known as [[Spetsnaz GRU]]. These units and formations existed in the highest possible secrecy, disguised as [[Russian Airborne Troops|Soviet paratroopers]] (Army spetsnaz) or [[Soviet Naval Infantry|naval infantrymen]] (Naval spetsnaz) by their uniforms and insignia.\n\nTwenty-four years after the birth of Spetsnaz, the Chairman of the KGB General [[Yuri Andropov]] (in that office from 1967 to 1982) established the first counter-terrorist unit. From the late 1970s through to the 1980s, a number of special-purpose units were founded in the KGB (1954\u20131991) and in the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of the USSR|Ministry of Internal Affairs]] (MVD) (1946\u20131954).\n\nDuring the 1990s special detachments were established within the [[Federal Penitentiary Service]] (FSIN) and the [[Russian Airborne Troops|Airborne Troops]] (VDV). Some civil agencies with non-police functions have formed special units also known as ''Spetsnaz'', such as the Leader special centre in the [[Ministry of Emergency Situations (Russia)|Ministry of Emergency Situations]] (MChS).\n\nIn total, by December 1991, at the time of the collapse of the USSR, the GRU reconnaissance and sabotage formations had:\n* 14 special purpose brigades \n* 2 special purposes regiments\n* 29 independent special purpose companies \n* 5 naval reconnaissance point\n\nIn 2013 a Special Operations Forces Command was established for Special Operations Forces which had earlier been established from around 2009 following a study of Western special-operations forces units and commands. The Command was not under the control of the GRU but reported directly to the General Staff \u2013 as did the GRU.<ref name=\"Newsru2013\" />\n\n==List and structure of Soviet and Russian military special forces==\nThe elite units of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]] and [[Russian Armed Forces|Armed Forces of the Russian Federation]] are controlled, for the most part, by the military-intelligence [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] ([[Spetsnaz GRU]]) under the General Staff. They were heavily involved in secret operations and training pro-Soviet forces during the [[Cold War]] and in the wars in Afghanistan during the 1980s and Chechnya during the 1990s and 2000s.

Alpha has operated in other countries, most notably [[Operation Storm-333]] (when Alpha and Zenith detachments supported the 154th Independent Spetsnaz Detachment\u2014known as the \"Muslim Battalion\"\u2014of the GRU on a mission to overthrow and kill Afghan president [[Hafizullah Amin]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Take-Down of Kabul: An Effective Coup de Main |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2002/MOUTGrau.htm |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org | accessdate=2 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSpetsgruppa \"V\", abbreviation of the Directorate \u0432 (Russian Cyrillic for V), also known as \"Vega\" in period 1993\u20131995, was formed in 1981, merging two elite Cold War-era KGB special units\u2014Cascade (''Kaskad'') and Zenith (''Zenit'')\u2014which were similar to the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] (responsible for clandestine / covert operations involving sabotage and assassination in other countries) and re-designated for counter-terrorist and counter-sabotage operations. It is tasked with the protection of strategic installations, such as factories and transportation centers. With its Alpha counterparts, it is heavily used in the North Caucasus. Vympel has four operative units in Moscow, with branch offices in nearly every city containing a nuclear power plant.\n\nSpetsgruppa \"S\", abbreviation of the Directorate C (Russian Cyrillic for S), also known as Smerch, but also known as the Service of Special Operations (\u0421\u0421\u041e), is a relatively new unit formed in July 1999. Officers from Smerch are frequently involved with the capture and transfer of various bandit and criminal leaders who help aid disruption in the North Caucasus and throughout Russia. Operations include both direct action against bandit holdouts in Southern Russia as well as high-profile arrests in more densely populated cities and guarding government officials. Because of its initials, this group is casually referred to as \"Smerch\". With the Centre of Special Operations and its elite units, many FSB special forces units operate at the regional level.
