It was based near [[Capitol Hill]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]\n\nAfter Paul Weyrich's death in 2008, the Foundation was headed by former Virginia governor [[Jim Gilmore]]. Under Gilmore's leadership, the Free Congress Foundation was refocused on economic issues and not social issues. Eventually, the entire organization was renamed to [[American Opportunity]], and is now based in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Weyrich-01.jpg|thumb|FCF founder Paul Weyrich.]]\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the labor union-backed [[National Committee for an Effective Congress]] was highly influential. In 1974, in part to counteract its influence, Weyrich founded the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress (CSFC), whose name implied that the [[United States Congress]] should stop being dominated by labor and other liberal-leaning interest groups.\n\nThe CSFC was organized as a [[grassroots]] organization focused on elective politics. It had some success and was a pioneer in political [[direct mail]] fundraising. It complemented in a respect the activities of the [[Heritage Foundation]], which Weyrich had also co-founded, which researched tax and regulatory issues. However, Weyrich wanted an organization that would focus on conservative social values.\n\nThe CSFC thus became a non-profit [[501(c)(3)]] organization, the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation. It also has a sister organization, Coalitions for America, which, as a [[501(c)(4)]], is permitted to lobby, and a [[political action committee]], the Free Congress PAC, that is permitted to directly endorse and contribute to political candidates.\n\n==Activist training==\nSince its inception, FCF has trained conservatives in basic techniques of activism and election campaigns.\n\nIn 2001, the Foundation published [http://web.archive.org/web/20010713152425/http://www.freecongress.org/centers/conservatism/traditionalist.htm#3a The Integration of Theory and Practice], an activist strategic plan which called for a new approach to activism and the creation of conservative parallel institutions as a counter to existing institutions, which it argued were dominated by the Left.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20010713152425/http://www.freecongress.org/centers/conservatism/traditionalist.htm The Integration of Theory and Practice: A Program for the New Traditionalist Movement] FreeCongressFoundation.org, July 2001. Via Internet Archive.</ref>\n\n==Krieble Institute==\nAnother initiative taken on by the foundation was the training of anti-communists in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. This Institute bore the name of [[Robert Krieble]], the primary donor to these activities.\n\nThrough the Krieble Institute, \"Bob [Krieble] produced the first political commercials ever run on Ukrainian television. They promoted Ukrainian independence. And when 89 percent of the voters agreed with that message, their democratic will drove the last nail into the Soviet coffin.\"<ref>Mike Pence, June 7, 2004, [[Heritage Foundation]], [http://www.heritage.org/research/lecture/renewing-our-commitment-to-limited-government Renewing Our Commitment to Limited Government]</ref>\n\n==Privacy==\nThe foundation's Center for Technology Policy and Coalition for Constitutional Liberties has opposed the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], [[ECHELON]], a [[Identity Cards#Identity cards in the United States|national ID card]] and other measures often supported by conservatives for fighting crime, terrorism and [[illegal immigration]].\n\n==Judicial nominations==\nFCF has been involved in the judicial nominations battles since the early 1980s. Its Center for Law and Democracy and its Coalition for Judicial Restraint have criticized Republican Senators for not being aggressive enough in blocking liberal nominees or in confirming certain conservatives. The CLD has also researched and publicized information about nominees' decisions and writings, either to attack or defend them.\n\nThe FCF has promoted what it sees as a philosophy of judicial restraint, in which judges largely defer to the elected branches of government on controversial political and cultural decisions. The individual most closely associated with this philosophy-and the chief exponent for the Free Congress Foundation's views on this subject for many years-is Thomas Jipping, who has made numerous appearances on television and radio, as well as in both print and online media, supporting conservative judicial nominations put forward by the Bush administration and conversely, opposing what he considered liberal nominees chosen by the previous Clinton administration.\n\n==Cultural conservatism==\n{{See also|Cultural conservatism}}\n[[Image:Woodstock-kids.jpg|thumb|300px|According to FCF leader Weyrich, the counterculture is now mainstream. Hence, traditional values cannot be restored through politics, but they may be promoted by alternative institutions. The image depicts participants in the [[Woodstock]] festival in 1969.]]\n\nFCF played a founding role in galvanizing religious conservative political activism. By the late 1990s, Weyrich declared that social conservatives were no longer a majority having a liberal agenda forced on them by an elite but rather are a dwindling minority that have lost control over the culture; that traditional culture and the [[counterculture]] have traded places. He acknowledged the need for continued political involvement as a matter of self-defense but stated that politics could not restore traditional values or, in his views, hopeless efforts to recapture institutions such as prestige media, academia and mainline churches that had been lost to the [[left-wing politics|left]].\n\nInstead he urged conservatives to invest their time and money in alternative institutions, which would, in his viewpoint, eventually become the norm due to the superior efficacy of traditional values. This sparked a firestorm of criticism from other conservatives, who accused Weyrich of giving up.\n\nThe ideas on \"Cultural Marxism\" promoted by the FCF influenced Anders Behring Breivik, who was responsible for the 2011 Norway attacks.\n\n==Foreign policy and defense==\n[[Image:C13571-8a.jpg|thumb|300px|President Reagan delivering his Strategic Defense Initiative speech. FCF strongly supported the Strategic Defense Initiative, but have been moderate in their support of defense expenditures and opponents of the war on terrorism.]]\nFCF took a hard-line anti-communist stance in the [[Cold War]], rejecting [[d\u00e9tente]] and [[arms control]] and supporting efforts to overthrow communist governments. However, other than [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] which it strongly backed, FCF did not fully endorse the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] program of spending on expensive weapon systems, a stance it continues to this day. It remains hostile to [[China|Communist China]].\n\nFCF has been friendlier to post-communist [[Serbia]] and [[Russia]] than most contemporary conservatives. It was against US intervention in the Balkans, leaning more toward the Orthodox Christian [[Serbs]] than the [[Bosniaks|Muslim Bosnians]] and [[Albanians]].\n\n==Economics and trade==\nFCF departs from other conservative institutions in endorsing a [[protectionist]] approach on [[international trade]]. Furthermore, it is not as purely free-market, supporting government efforts in [[mass transit]] and privacy protection.  These included its publishing a quarterly magazine, ''[[The New Electric Railway Journal]]'', from 1988 to 1996, with FCF's Paul Weyrich and [[William S. Lind]] being its Publisher and Associate Publisher, respectively.<ref name=\"righting the rails\">[[Paul Weyrich|Weyrich, Paul M.]] (Autumn 1993). \"Righting the Rails\". ''TNERJ'', pg. 4. (The headline was a play on words, as the column explained why Weyrich felt it made sense for those on the political \"right\" [conservatives] to support rail transit.) {{ISSN|1048-3845}}</ref><ref name=\"cutting cord\">Kunz, Richard R. (Spring 1996). \"From the Editor: Cutting the Cord\". ''[[The New Electric Railway Journal]]'', p. 2. {{ISSN|1048-3845}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it also supports mainstream conservative views on [[fiscal policy]], calling for reduced spending and taxes.\n\n==Broadcast efforts==\nWeyrich promoted a view that the mainstream news and entertainment media exhibit a [[liberal bias]]. In response, in 1993, FCF launched a Washington, D.C.-based satellite television station called [[National Empowerment Television]] (NET). Its logo featured a square of nine dots, referring to a [[nine dots puzzle|puzzle]] that cannot be solved without drawing lines \"[[wiktionary:out of the box|outside the box]].\"\n\n[[File:National Empowerment Television.jpg|thumb|Logo of National Empowerment Television.]]\nNET served in part as a platform for FCF and Weyrich's views and interests. For example, Weyrich was a supporter of rail and [[Amtrak]] had a program on the channel called ''America on Track''; another program, ''The New Electric Railway Journal'' (an extension of the magazine), covered [[light rail]]. Other programs focused on FCF activity: ''Endangered Liberties'' discussed [[privacy]] issues; ''Legal Notebook'' emphasized judicial nominations, and ''Next Revolution'' covered FCF's take on [[social conservatism]]. A popular program was ''Direct Line with Paul Weyrich'', in which the host interviewed lawmakers and other prominent figures live, permitted the public to call in directly with questions and comments and delivered a commentary in the final segment.\n\nNET was also a broader resource for the conservative and free market movement. Many organizations bought the rights to air programs on the channel, including the [[National Rifle Association]], the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]], the [[Cato Institute]], [[Accuracy in Media]] and others.\n\nThe channel featured high production values and cost a great deal and in response to donor and investor pressure for a clear focus, FCF dropped all programs not directly related to public policy and conservative activism, and rebranded the channel as NET: The Conservative NewsTalk Network, with the initials NET no longer standing for anything and the nine-dot logo replaced with one evoking the US Capitol dome. It also began news reports and updates, and a full-fledged investigative journalism program.\n\nFCF planned to make NET a self-sustaining, even profitable commercial enterprise, rather than a money-losing tool of outreach but was unsuccessful. In a decision he later came to regret bitterly, Weyrich turned over day-to-day operation of the channel to an industry veteran who had been successful with other startups. After a power struggle which Weyrich lost, NET was rebranded again into \"America's Voice\", and the channel abandoned all conservative identity, marketing itself merely as a non-ideological way for the public to make its views known to policymakers. FCF had to pay to retain its four programs on the channel and after controversy over their content, even those were removed. Viewer support collapsed, and [[Dish Network]] dropped it. Eventually America's Voice was sold, becoming \"The Renaissance Network\" (TRN), airing on a few broadcast stations, mainly [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] and low-power channels. Facing ruin, TRN brought back FCF content but it was too little, too late, and the channel folded.\n\nFCF also experimented with radio broadcasting, airing weekly taped programs on the Liberty Works Radio Network and other outlets.\n\n==Center for Cultural Conservatism==\nPart of the larger Free Congress Foundation, the Center for Cultural Conservatism was headed by [[William S. Lind]].[http://www.infrastructurist.com/2009/06/29/how-to-convince-conservatives-to-support-public-transportation-william-lind-explains/]\n\n==Funding==\nThe Free Congress Foundation's revenues for the fiscal year ending 12/31/12 were $574,292 against expenses of $515,329; for the fiscal year ending 12/31/11 were $494,652 against expenses of $776,081; for the fiscal year ending 12/31/10 were $338,560 against expenses of $888,538.<ref>Free Congress Research and Education Foundation IRS Form 990, available at www.guidestar.com</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.freecongress.org/ Official website]\n*[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Free_Congress_Foundation Entry on FCF] from [[SourceWatch]]\n*[http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=4314 Entry] from [[People for the American Way]]\n*[http://www.mediatransparency.org/recipientprofile.php?recipientID=126 Recipient Profile] from [[Media Transparency]]\n*http://www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/picks/0028.html\n\n[[Category:Political and economic think tanks in the United States]]\n[[Category:New Right organizations (United States)]]\n[[Category:1977 establishments in Washington, D.C.]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Infobox non-profit\n| name      = Free Congress Foundation\n| image      = Free Congress Foundation.jpg\n| image_size   = 150px\n| caption     =\n| founder     = [[Paul Weyrich]]\n| type      = [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit\n| tax_id     = \n| registration_id =\n| founded_date  = 1977<ref>mediamouse.org, [http://www.mediamouse.org/resources/right/orgs/free-congress-foundation Free Congress Foundation]</ref>\n| location    = [[Washington, DC]] then [[Alexandria, Virginia]]\n| coordinates   = <!-- {{Coord|LAT|LON|display=inline,title}} -->\n| origins     = \n| key_people   = [[Paul Weyrich]], [[Michael Lind]], [[Jim Gilmore]]\n| area_served   = \n| products    = \n| services    =\n| focus      = \n| mission     = \n| method     = \n| revenue     = \n| endowment    = \n| num_volunteers = \n| num_employees  = \n| num_members   = \n| subsid     = \n| owner      = \n| motto      = \n| former name   =\n| homepage    =\n| dissolved    = \n| footnotes    = \n}}\n\nThe '''Free Congress Research and Education Foundation''', also known as the '''Free Congress Foundation''' or '''FCF''', was a [[American conservatism|conservative]] [[think tank]] founded by [[Paul Weyrich]].
