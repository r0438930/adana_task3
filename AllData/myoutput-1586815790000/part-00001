''Mariner 10'' used the solar [[radiation pressure]] on its [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and its high-gain antenna as a means of [[attitude control]] during flight, the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.\n\nThe components on ''Mariner 10'' can be categorized into four groups based on their common function. The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism.

Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32\u201333</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 \u00b0C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76\u00b0.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30\u201332</ref>\n\nAccurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nThe mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]\n\n''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury.

To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 \u00b0C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43\u201348</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on.

The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision.

The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator.

''Mariner 10'' used the solar [[radiation pressure]] on its [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s and its high-gain antenna as a means of [[attitude control]] during flight, the first spacecraft to use active solar pressure control.\n\nThe components on ''Mariner 10'' can be categorized into four groups based on their common function. The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s various components and scientific instruments were attached to a central hub, which was roughly the shape of an octagonal prism.

Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32\u201333</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 \u00b0C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76\u00b0.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30\u201332</ref>\n\nAccurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nThe mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]\n\n''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury.

To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 \u00b0C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43\u201348</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on.
