They maintained a household primarily at the chateau [[Hautefontaine]], where Dillon kept an extravagant hunt.

he had chairs of chemistry and of physics created at [[Montpellier]] and at [[Toulouse]], and tried to reduce poverty, especially in Narbonne.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFrom about the age of fifty, until she died in 1804 shortly before Dillon, he lived with his wealthy, widowed niece, Madame de Rothe, daughter of [[Lucius Cary, 6th Viscount Falkland]]. The pair were considered to be lovers, an arrangement considered scandalous even by the jaded standards of the day. They maintained a household primarily at the chateau [[Hautefontaine]], where Dillon kept an extravagant hunt. His great-niece [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Lucy de Dillon]], daughter of Madame de Rothe, was a favourite of the [[Marie Antoinette|queen]].\n\nIn 1787 and in 1788 he was a member of the Assembly of Notables called together by [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], and in 1788 presided over the assembly of the clergy.\n\n==Exile and death==\nHaving refused to accept the [[civil constitution of the clergy]], Dillon had to leave Narbonne in 1790, then to emigrate (accompanied by de Rothe) to [[Coblenz]] in 1791.
