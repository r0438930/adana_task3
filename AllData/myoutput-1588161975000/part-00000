The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], Diesel (D), Mixed traffic (M) engine, 2nd generation (2). They entered service in 1962. A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive until its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still retain \"operational status\" on the mainline as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. \n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. Therefore required building a large number of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco.html#class|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives - General Information - I|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n=== Production History ===\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|288x288px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with locomotive number 18040<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3571?list_type=preserved|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster National Railway Museum, Delhi (NRM) WDM-2 18040 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Images|first=Historical Railway|title=India Railways - Indian Government Railways Class WDM2 (DL560C) diesel locomotive Nr. 18041 (Alco 84199 / 1962)|date=2019-12-31|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/124446949@N06/49306888842/|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount.

Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C).A few WDM-2 locos had been rebuilt by [[Diesel-Loco Modernisation Works|Diesel Loco Modernization Works]] (DLMW) in Patiala, Punjab<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dmw.indianrailways.gov.in/works/uploads/File/CompanyProfile_Eng%201.pdf|title=dmw works|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.

The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as Erode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as Ratlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 has a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locomotives can haul both vacuum and air brake wagons. Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locomotives from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locomotives proved to be not that useful as the locomotive pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbo locomotives were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service life. These locomotives can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/gallery/imagebank/Members/Shanx/ShanxMisc/018210_G_001.jpg.html|title=018210_G_001.jpg|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref>.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], Diesel (D), Mixed traffic (M) engine, 2nd generation (2). They entered service in 1962. A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive until its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still retain \"operational status\" on the mainline as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. \n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. Therefore required building a large number of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco.html#class|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Locomotives - General Information - I|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|288x288px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with locomotive number 18040<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3571?list_type=preserved|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster National Railway Museum, Delhi (NRM) WDM-2 18040 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Images|first=Historical Railway|title=India Railways - Indian Government Railways Class WDM2 (DL560C) diesel locomotive Nr. 18041 (Alco 84199 / 1962)|date=2019-12-31|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/124446949@N06/49306888842/|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> being the first WDM-2 of India.

Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed as Erode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed as Ratlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph.

These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locomotives can haul both vacuum and air brake wagons. Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes.

But these locomotives proved to be not that useful as the locomotive pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbo locomotives were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows.
