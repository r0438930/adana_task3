In November 1998 FIL, on the invitation of the Danish [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]], called a meeting between all actors on the Danish internet, companies as well as users, under the banner \"ID MoU\" (\"Internet Danmark Memorandum of Understanding\") in order to establish a long-term agreement on the administration of the .dk domain.\nThe result of \"ID MoU\" was that a number of institutions and organizations established a self-owning institution named [[Dansk INTERNET Forum]] (DIFO) on July 1, 1999, which with the help of external investment bought \"DK Hostmaster A/S\" in December 1999.\n\n===IPv6===\nDK Hostmaster has offered IPv6 glue records for second-level domains since April 4, 2008, when the first DNS provider had IPv6 glue records added in the TLD.<ref>{{cite web|last=Larsen|first=Peter|title=nu med ipv6 p\u00e5 offentlige navneservers|url=http://forum.gratisdns.dk/gratisdns-nyheder/t6924/|work=GratisDNS forum|publisher=GratisDNS|accessdate=18 September 2011}}</ref> IPv6 was enabled at the transport layer to TLD nameservers a few years prior to that.\nJust days prior to the [[World ipv6 day|World IPv6 day]], DK Hostmaster added an IPv6 address in DNS for their web server and that of the web server of its owner, DIFO.\n\n===DNSSEC===\nAfter the DNS root zone was signed in mid-July 2010, the .DK-zone was officially signed using NSEC3 on July 23, 2010, and the root zone was updated July 26, 2010, to include the corresponding DS-record. Since August 1, 2010, customers' DS-records have been included in the DK-zone.\n\n==Second level domains==\nIn general most companies and people register their desired domain name at the second level, e.g. company.dk and lastname.dk.\n\n==Third level domains==\nThird level domains are allocated by second level domain owners. The registry does not run, recommend nor endorse any general second level domains, such as .com.dk, for third parties, and they are generally not seen.\n\n==Oldest .dk domains==\nThe oldest .dk domains still registered in DK Hostmaster's database, are the domains [http://www.dkuug.dk/ dkuug.dk], [http://www.diku.dk/ diku.dk], [https://web.archive.org/web/19961220183642/http://www.bk.dk/ bk.dk], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110719124541/http://www.ibt.dk/ ibt.dk], [http://www.ifad.dk/ ifad.dk], [http://www.lego.dk/ lego.dk], [http://www.mainz.dk/ mainz.dk] and [http://www.nordita.dk/ nordita.dk] which were all registered in 1987 when .dk was registered. With the registration of .dk a dual naming with both .uucp and .dk names was introduced. Of these, diku.dk and ibt.dk can be said to be the oldest names, as these were the initial names on the Danish UUCP network started 2 January 1983.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.iana.org/root-whois/dk.htm IANA .dk whois information]\n* [http://www.dk-hostmaster.dk/ DK Hostmaster A/S]\n* [https://self-service.dk-hostmaster.dk/registrar_list List of .dk approved registrars]\n* [http://www.denet.dk/history/ History of DENet]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{CcTLD}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dk}}\n[[Category:Council of European National Top Level Domain Registries members]]\n[[Category:Internet in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Country code top-level domains]]\n[[Category:Mass media in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1987]]\n[[Category:1987 establishments in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1987]]\n\n[[sv:Toppdom\u00e4n#D]]\n", "name_user": "Majavah", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRace for the .dk domain:clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.dk"}
