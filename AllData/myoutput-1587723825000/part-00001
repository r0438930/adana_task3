The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian [[Territory of Papua]]. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese [[South Seas Detachment]] under Major General [[Tomitar\u014d Horii]] and Australian and Papuan land forces under command of [[New Guinea Force]]. The Japanese objective was to seize [[Port Moresby]] by an overland advance from the north coast, following the [[Kokoda Track]] over the mountains of the [[Owen Stanley Range]], as part of a strategy to isolate Australia from the United States.\n\nJapanese forces landed and established [[beachhead]]s near [[Gona]] and [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] on 21 July 1942. Opposed by [[Maroubra Force]], then consisting of four [[platoon]]s of the [[39th Battalion (Australia)|39th Battalion]] and elements of the [[Papuan Infantry Battalion]], they quickly advanced and captured [[Kokoda]] and its strategically vital airfield on 29 July. Despite reinforcement, the Australian forces were continually pushed back. The veteran [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]] narrowly avoided capture in the [[Battle of Mission Ridge \u2013 Brigade Hill]] from 6 to 8 September. In the [[Battle of Ioribaiwa]] from 13 to 16 September, the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]] under [[Brigadier]] [[Kenneth Eather]] fought the Japanese to a halt but ceded the field to the Japanese, withdrawing to Imita Ridge.\n\nThe Japanese advanced to within sight of Port Moresby but withdrew on 26 September. They had outrun their supply line and had been ordered to withdraw in consequence of reverses suffered at [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]]. The Australian pursuit encountered strong opposition from well-prepared positions around [[Second Battle of Eora Creek \u2013 Templeton's Crossing|Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village]] from 11 to 28 October. Following the unopposed recapture of Kokoda, [[Battle of Oivi\u2013Gorari|a major battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari]] from 4 to 11 November, resulting in a victory for the Australians. By 16 November, two brigades of the Australian [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] had crossed the [[Kumusi River]] at [[Wairopi]], and advanced on the Japanese beachheads in a joint Australian and United States operation. The Japanese forces at [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona|Buna\u2013Gona]] held out until 22 January 1943.\n\nAustralian reinforcement was hampered by the logistical problems of supporting a force in isolated, mountainous, jungle terrain. There were few planes available for aerial resupply, and techniques for it were still primitive. Australian command considered that the [[Vickers machine gun]] and [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|medium mortars]] were too heavy to carry and would be ineffective in the jungle terrain. Without artillery, mortars or medium machine guns, the Australians faced an opponent equipped with mountain guns and light howitzers that had been carried into the mountains and proved to be a decisive advantage. Australian forces were unprepared to conduct a campaign in the jungle environment of New Guinea. The lessons learned during the course of this campaign and the subsequent battle of Buna\u2013Gona led to widespread changes in doctrine, training, equipment and structure, with a legacy that remains until the present day.\n\nIn consequence of the rapid Japanese advance and the perceived failure to quickly counterattack, a \"crisis of command\" resulted, in which manoeuvring by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander]] of Allied Forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], and General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]], commander of Allied Land Forces, resulted in the sackings of three high-ranking Australian officers. The generalship of MacArthur and Blamey has been criticised for unreasonable and unrealistic perceptions of the terrain and conditions under which the campaign was fought\u2014to the detriment of the troops committed to the fighting. The Kokoda Track campaign has been mythologised as Australia's [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and incorporated into the [[Anzac spirit|Anzac legend]] even though the premise of a vastly numerically-superior enemy has since been shown to be incorrect.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic context===\n{{Main||Military history of Australia during World War II|Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II}}\n[[File:ABDA Japanese attacks.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese attacks along the Malay Barrier 23 December 1941 \u2013 21 February 1942.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], the Australian government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack. The entire [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]], deployed to Malaya, [[Battle of Ambon|Ambon]], [[Battle of Timor|Timor]] and [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|Rabaul]], was lost or rendered ineffective as the Japanese rapidly advanced.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=490}} The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) lacked modern aircraft and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) was too small to counter the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The RAAF and RAN were greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths.{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=458, 468}} The [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] was mobilised but, although a large force, it was inexperienced and lacked modern equipment.{{sfn|Grey |1999| p=171}} In response to the threat, the Government appealed to the United States for assistance, and the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th]] and [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]]s of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF) were brought back from the Middle East. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] attempted to divert them to Burma, but the Australian Prime Minister, [[John Curtin]], refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise, two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at [[Ceylon]], where they formed part of the garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.{{sfn|Day |1999|pp=452\u2013457}}\n\nThe Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|considered invading Australia]] in early 1942 but decided against doing so in February that year,{{sfn|Stanley |2008|p=156}} as it was judged to be beyond the Japanese capabilities, and no planning or preparations were undertaken.{{sfn|Stanley|2007|p=29}} Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States and preventing Allied offensive operations by capturing [[Port Moresby]],{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=10}} the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]] and [[New Caledonia]].{{sfn|Horner|1993|pp=4\u20135}}{{sfn|James|2013|p=200}} An attempt to capture Port Moresby by an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]], [[Operation Mo]], was thwarted by the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942. A month later, most of the Japanese [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] fleet was destroyed in the [[Battle of Midway]], further reducing the possibility of major amphibious operations in the South Pacific. Following this, the Japanese began to consider an overland advance on Port Moresby.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|pp=96\u201399}}{{sfn|James|2013|p=202}}\n\n[[File:Curtin MacArthur Blamey (042766).jpg|thumb|right|General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (centre) with General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] (left) and Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] (right) in March 1942]]\nMeanwhile, the Allied [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|Supreme Commander]] in the [[South West Pacific Area]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] set about developing airfields for the defence of Port Moresby, and to strike against the Japanese. The first of these, Operation Boston, was authorised on 20 May and initially planned for the Abau\u2013Mullins Harbor area. [[Milne Bay]] was subsequently determined to be preferable and a garrison force was sent by ship from Port Moresby on 22 June. Another strip at [[Merauke]], on the south coast of [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]] was authorised on 22 June to protect the western flank.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=40\u201342}} On 9 June, MacArthur questioned [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]], the commander of Allied Land Forces, as to measures taken for the defence of the overland approach from [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]].

There were no roads beyond the vicinity of Port Moresby and, by modern standards, these were little more than tracks. As a result, travel north of Port Moresby was largely undertaken by air, or sea.{{sfn|Brune| 2003|pp=84\u201385}} There were a few landing fields around Port Moresby, with others on the northern side of the Owen Stanley Range at the government stations of Buna and Kokoda.{{sfn|Ham|2004|pp=xvi\u2013xvii & 47}}{{refn|Milner refers to the strip at Buna as being \"small and neglected\".{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=50}}|group=notes}}\n\nThe village of [[Kokoda]] is positioned on a plateau in northern foot-hills of the Owen Stanley Range. It overlooks the Yodda Valley (formed by the Mambare River) to its north. The Mambare runs roughly south-east to north-west. Kokoda is approximately {{convert|100|km|adj=on}} direct line from the coastal village of Buna, which formed part of the Japanese beachhead positions occupied on their landing. However, the overland route was approximately {{convert|160|km|round=5}}.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|p=98}} The track to the coast crosses the Kumusi River at Wairopi, approximately {{convert|25|km}} east of Kokoda. The river was spanned there by a wire-rope bridge (Wairopi being Pidgin for wire rope).{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=110}} There was a wide track leading from there to the coast which the Japanese subsequently set about developing as a road for vehicle traffic.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=61}}{{refn|After the initial landing, it was quickly made trafficable for {{convert|60|km|round=5}} from the coast to Sonbo.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|p=107}}|group=notes}}\n\nIn 1942, the village was the site of a government station, rubber plantation and strategically important airstrip. The Kokoda Track is a foot track that runs roughly southwest from Kokoda {{Convert|96|km}} overland ({{Convert|60|km|0}} in a straight line) through the [[Owen Stanley Range]] towards Port Moresby. It was known before the war and had been used as an overland mail route. While there is a \"main track\" that is associated with the fighting during the campaign, there are many parallel, interlocking tracks that follow much the same general course. The southern end of the track is now considered to start at Owers' Corner, {{convert|61|km|mi}} from Port Moresby.{{sfn|James|2009|p=60}} The vehicle track from Port Moresby originally terminated at McDonald's [Corner], where it serviced the McDonald homestead. Between June and late September 1942, around {{convert|11|km|mi}} of road was completed, extending it to Owers' Corner.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=123}}\n\nThe Kokoda Track passed through what was referred to during the early war years as \"the (Kokoda) Gap\".{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=171}} To the Japanese, who had learned of the Gap through vague explorer's accounts,{{sfn|Collie|Marutani|2009|p=55}} it potentially offered a corridor from [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] through the Owen Stanleys along which they could launch a quick advance on Port Moresby. Conversely, the Allies believed it was a narrow and largely impassable path that could be blocked and held with only limited resources.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=17}} In reality, the Gap is a dip in the Owen Stanley Range about {{convert|11|km|sigfig=1}} wide, convenient for aircraft crossing the range to pass through.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=110}}\n\nThe track reaches a height of {{Convert|2190|m|4=0}} as it passes around the peak of [[Mount Bellamy]].{{sfn|P\u00e9russe|1993|p=98}} The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to {{convert|5000|m}} up and down over the full length of the track.{{refn|The Kokoda Track Commemorative web site<ref name=\"DVA Topo\">{{cite web|title=Topography of Kokoda|url=http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/kokoda-topography.php|website=The Kokoda Track|publisher=Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=29 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314053321/http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/kokoda-topography.php|archivedate=14 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and James{{sfn|James|2009|loc=trek map}} give a cross-section of the track.|group=notes}} This markedly increases the distance to be traversed, although there are several flat areas, particularly around [[Myola]]. The vegetation is largely dense jungle. The climate is mostly hot and humid with high rainfall, although the higher parts are cold, particularly at night. The higher elevations are frequently above cloud level, resulting in fog.<ref name=\"DVA Topo\"/>\n\nMyola is close to the watershed. A stream flowing from Myola is part of the headwaters of Eora Creek on the northern watershed.{{sfn|James|2009|p=32}} On the northern part of the track, its course, to Deniki, is determined by Eora Creek. It follows along the side of the steep valley formed by the creek. It crosses the creek from one side to the other at several points along its course. From Deniki, the track descends to the Kokoda plateau.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n===Disease===\n[[File:AWM P02423.011 2nd 4th field ambulance.jpg|thumb|left|Tents of the 2/4th Field Ambulance near Efogi (AWM P02423.011)]]\n\nOperations in New Guinea were impacted by tropical diseases such as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[scrub typhus]], [[tropical ulcer]]s, [[dysentery]] from a range of causes and [[Mycosis|fungal infections]]. Walker observes that the Kokoda Track \"starts and ends with malaria\". Malarial [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] were substantially absent from the cooler, higher elevations along the track. Most cases observed in these areas were relapses rather than primary infections. The immediate vicinity of Port Moresby is relatively dry. While this tends to mitigate the risk of malaria, significant rates of the disease were observed in troops, mainly militia, sent to New Guinea for defence of the port, leading up to the campaign. The risk from malaria was particularly high for troops operating in the coastal area around the southern end of the track and when the Australian forces had been forced back to Imita Ridge. AIF units returning from the Middle East were more aware of the threat this disease posed and arrived with supplies of [[quinine]]. For these reasons, the disease did not have the same degree of significance or impact on operations as it did at [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]] or the subsequent operations at Buna\u2013Gona.{{sfn|Walker|1956|pp=12, 70\u201371 & 108\u2013124}}\n\nAnderson recounts the prevalence of dysentery among Australian troops,{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=125\u2013126}} while James reports that \"more and more [Japanese] succumbed\" to diseases, including dysentery, as they withdrew along the track.{{sfn|James|2009|p=20}} Walker attributes enteric infections to poor field hygiene, contaminated and unpurified water, and a failure to make adequate sanitary provisions along the track during the early part of the campaign. He also identifies that a proportion of diarrhoeal disturbances were attributable to the poor diet (particularly the high-fat content of tinned beef) rather than infection.{{sfn|Walker|1956|p=72}}\n\n===Japanese forces===\n{{main|Order of battle for the Kokoda Track campaign}}\nThe [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|Japanese 17th Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]] was a corps-sized command, based at Rabaul, involved in the New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and Solomon Islands campaigns.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=25}} Following Coral Sea, the 17th Army considered an overland advance on Port Moresby. This was based on pre-war intelligence that a road existed linking it with Kokoda. Initial aerial reconnaissance was inconclusive but plans were made for a reconnaissance in force and to exploit the possibility of an advance along such a route. The 15th&nbsp;Independent Engineer Regiment (less one company) and the South Seas Detachment under Major General Tomitar\u014d Horii were assigned to these tasks. At the time, Horii was unenthusiastic as to the possibility of success, in consideration of the logistical difficulties that would be faced, but he did not press his objection.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|pp=96\u201399}}\n\nAn advance party, under command of Colonel Yokoyama Yosuke of the 15th&nbsp;Independent Engineer Regiment was to consist of the main force of the regiment, the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of the [[144th Infantry Regiment (Imperial Japanese Army)|144th Infantry Regiment]], and the 1st&nbsp;Company, 1st&nbsp;Battalion of the 55th Mountain Artillery Regiment.

Morris said to Lieutenant General [[Sydney Rowell]] on handing over command of NGF, \"The mountains will beat the Nips and we must be careful they don\u2019t beat us.\"{{sfn|James|2009|p=9}}\n\nSubstantially devoid of infrastructure, Morris had set about an ongoing programme to expand, improve and develop harbour and airfield facilities at Port Moresby. Opened in early October, a T-shaped wharf was constructed on Tatana Island. It more than doubled the capacity of the port.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=103}} Under orders from GHQ, an airfield and subsequent port facilities were developed at Milne Bay. This saw Allied forces fortuitously placed to counter the Japanese landing that occurred there. Roads were virtually non-existent. In concert with orders to deploy Maroubra Force to Kokoda, Lieutenant [[Herbert Thomson Kienzle|Bert Kienzle]] was ordered to construct an overland road for its resupply. Historian Peter Brune describes it as \"one of the most ludicrous\" orders ever given.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=97}} Just over {{convert|11|km}} of road was completed by the end of September 1942, from McDonald's to Owers' Corner.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=123}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=26}}\n\nKienzle guided Templeton's B Company of the 39th Battalion across the track to Kokoda.

Kienzle made a brief visit to his homestead in the Yodda Valley and returned with supplies.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=117}} The trek was considered too arduous for the soldiers to carry any heavy equipment.

A porter could carry a load equivalent to 13 days' rations. If he carried rations for a soldier, between them, they would consume the load in 6\u00bd days. This made no allowance for ammunition, other necessary equipment or the porter's return. The trek to Kokoda was 8 days. He concluded that operations could not be sustained without large scale air drops occurring.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=117\u2013118}} Aerial resupply commenced with drop sites at Kagi and Efogi but neither site was particularly suitable. Significant quantities fell outside the drop zone and could not be recovered. Unreliable maps or poor visibility in the drop zone meant that supplies were often misdropped. Recognising that a better drop zone was needed, Kienzle set out on 1 August, to find a large open area he recalled having seen from the air. On 3 August, he identified the smaller of two dry lake beds near the crest of the range, which he called Myola.{{sfnm|McCarthy|1959|1pp=130\u2013131|Kienzle|2011|2pp=136\u2013139|James|2009|3pp=31\u201332|Fitzsimons|2004|4pp=214\u2013215}} Kienzle immediately requested that dropping begin at Myola. Access to this large area alleviated the proportion of supplies lost to the jungle. It also made the task of carriers achievable. He set about establishing it as a supply camp and cut a new track towards Eora Creek. It joined the existing track at Templeton's Crossing, which he also named.{{sfn|Brune|2003|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=32}}\n\n[[File:AWM 013002 2 man load.jpg|thumb|right|Papuan carriers with a two-man load, moving along the track (AWM013002)]]\n\nWhile the discovery of Myola alleviated one of the problems associated with resupply, it did not solve them all.

On 15 June 1942, Morris issued the Employment of Natives Order under the National Security (Emergency Control) Regulations. This provided for the conscription of Papuan labour to support the Australian war effort.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=116}} While resupply of the Australian forces on the track would have collapsed without airdrops, the native carrier force remained an essential component, moving supplies forward from the drop zones under arduous conditions. Captain Geoffrey 'Doc' Vernon wrote of the conditions endured: \"The condition of our carriers at Eora Creek caused me more concern than that of the wounded ... Overwork, overloading ... exposure, cold and underfeeding were the common lot. Every evening scores of carriers came in, slung their loads down and lay exhausted on the ground.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=132}}\n\nOn their return, they would carry back the wounded with care: for which they have been mythologised as the \"[[Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels]]\".{{sfn|Rogerson|2012|p=5}} There are many testaments of praise for the care rendered.{{sfn|James|2009|p=18}} In relation to the carriers, Captain (later Major) Henry Steward wrote after the war that \"the men on the stretchers ...[were] ... tended with the devotion of a mother and the care of a nurse\", while [[Frank Kingsley Norris]] recounted that, \"if night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him as comfortable as possible, fetch him water and feed him if food is available\u2014regardless of their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given instantly\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Brune|2003|pp=188\u2013189}}.</ref>\n\nThe carrier force under command of Kienzle supporting the Australian advance is reported at over 1,600. The total number that worked on the track was significantly larger, with attrition through desertion and sickness. Author Paul Ham estimates a total of up to 3,000 and claims a desertion rate of 30 per cent.{{sfn|Ham|2004|pp=211 & 214}} The ever-increasing need for labour impacted on the communities from which they were conscripted by reducing the capacity for food production.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=264\u2013265}}\n\nThe Japanese also relied on native labour to transport supplies for their forces on the Kokoda Track. Around 2,000 indentured workers were transported to the mainland from Rabaul, and a further 300 residents of the north coast of Papua were recruited. These labourers were poorly treated, and suffered from overwork. Many carriers who became sick or injured were murdered by Japanese forces. This mistreatment caused high desertion rates among the Papuan carriers. As the Japanese had difficulty obtaining replacement carriers, the casualties and desertions contributed to shortfalls in the quantities of supplies which reached the combat troops.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=117}}\n\n====Medical====\n[[File:AWM P02424.085 air ambulance at kokoda.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant]] air ambulance operating at Kokoda, November 1942 (AWM P02424.085)]]\n\nWhen the 21st Brigade joined the fighting early in the campaign, the medical plan was for evacuation forward to Kokoda, and there, by air, on the premise that it would soon be recaptured. This was discarded as it quickly became apparent that this would not happen and any serious casualties were moved back toward Myola. Potts had requested air evacuation but this was refused for a lack of suitable aircraft.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=213\u2013215}}\n\nAs Myola was threatened by the Japanese advance, the casualties gathered there had to be evacuated to the head of the track. The report of then Colonel Norris, the 7th Division's senior medical officer, noted the difficulty of providing sufficient means to move stretchers. Each required eight bearers which meant those wounded who were able to stagger were treated with \"absolute ruthlessness\" and not provided with stretchers. In one case, a casualty with a severely fractured [[patella]] (kneecap) walked for six days and some with worse injuries volunteered to walk to free a stretcher for the more seriously wounded.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Brief Account of the activities of the 7th Australian Division \u2013 Medical Services during Six Months Campaign in Papua|year=1943|journal=AWM|page=54|volume=481/12/13}}</ref>\n\nAs the Australians advanced back along the track to Kokoda, Myola again became the main evacuation point. Aircraft were sent from Australia and approximately 40 patients were evacuated by air before a [[Ford Trimotor]] and a single-engined [[Stinson Aircraft Company|Stinson]] of unspecified model both crashed and further air evacuation from Myola was suspended.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=317}}\n\nWith the recapture of Kokoda, air landings and evacuation could occur from its landing strip and it became the main point of evacuation. As well as C\u201347s landing with supplies, [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant]] light observation aircraft converted for use as air ambulances, flew into Kokoda.{{refn|See caption for AWM photograph {{cite web|title=P02424.085|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/P02424.085}} for details. {{cite web|title=150934|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/150934/}} identifies the plane in that photograph as an [[Aeronca L-3]] but the distinctive difference in the engine cowling identifies this as an L\u20131.|group=notes}} At the start of November, the detachment at Myola was caring for 438 sick and wounded.

This imperial legacy meant a force structure intended for fighting in open country and which was highly reliant on motor transport.{{sfn|Palazzo|2004|pp=86\u201388}} Consequently, weight was not so much a consideration where equipment was not intended to be man-packed. The 109 radio set and associated equipment required nineteen carriers to transport, were temperamental as a result of the \"excessive handling\" and were susceptible to moisture and humidity. In contrast, the Japanese used compact wireless sets and lightweight aluminium signal wire.{{sfn|Threlfall|2008|pp=216\u2013217}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=171}}\n\nCaptured stocks of [[Mills bomb]]s (model 36M) were valued by the Japanese. The lever and striker mechanism of the Mills bomb was considered superior to their own service grenade, the [[Type 99 grenade|Type 99]], which had to be struck on a hard object to ignite the fuze immediately before throwing.{{sfn|Collie|Marutani|2009|pp=73\u201374}}\n\n===Air operations===\n[[File:AWM 025894 Bell P-39 Airacobra and US ground crew.jpg|thumb|right|A USAAF [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] and ground crew, Port Moresby, August 1942 (AWM025894)]]\n\nApart from the significant logistical contribution in support of the Australian forces, air operations included bombing missions against Rabaul, the Japanese base supporting the landings in Papua, and the attempts to resupply and reinforce the beachheads around Buna and Gona.

Regular missions against Buna effectively neutralised the airfield\u2014damaging it almost as fast as it could be repaired, thereby rendering it ineffective.

Morris was moved to command the [[Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit]] (ANGAU). At about this time, 7th Division was deploying to New Guinea and responsibility for the immediate defence of Port Moresby, including Maroubra Force and the Kokoda Track operation was devolved to divisional headquarters under Allan.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=47|McCarthy|1959|2p=140}}{{refn|New Guinea Force Operation Instruction No. 24 of 18 August 1942.<ref>{{cite web|last1=War Diary: New Guinea Force Headquarters and General (Air)|title= AWM52 1/5/51/17: August 1942|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1024131--17-.pdf|pp=41\u201350 (of pdf)|website=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>|group=notes}}\n\nBoth Blamey's [[South West Pacific Area (command)#Allied Land Forces|Allied Land Headquarters]] (LHQ) and MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) were increasingly alarmed by the situation on the track, with Australian forces suffering a series of reversals, and by the Japanese landings at Milne Bay (this battle was fought from 25 August to 7 September 1942). Vasey, then Blamey's deputy chief of the general staff, wrote privately to Rowell on 1 September, that \"GHQ is like a bloody barometer in a cyclone\u2014up and down every two minutes\".{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=225}} MacArthur also had a poor opinion of the Australian troops and no real appreciation of the conditions under which the fighting in New Guinea was being conducted. On 6 September, MacArthur wrote to General [[George Marshall]] that, \"the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking.\"{{sfn|Larrabee|2004|p=324}} Jones observes, \"The attitude that the Australians were poor fighters pervaded thinking at MacArthur's headquarters\".{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=40}}\n\n[[File:AWM 150815 Blamey.jpg|thumb|right|General Sir Thomas Blamey chatting with troops during MacArthur's visit (AWM150815)]]\n\nThe Australian government was also concerned. On 9 September, Army Minister [[Frank Forde]] directed Blamey to visit Port Moresby, which he did, from 12 to 14 September. On his return, he was able to assure the government of his confidence in Rowell and that the situation was in hand.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=200\u2013201}} Nonetheless, MacArthur persuaded the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, to send Blamey to New Guinea to take command there and \"energise the situation\".{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=235}} By this manoeuvre, MacArthur ensured that Blamey would be the scapegoat if Port Moresby fell.{{sfnm|McAulay|1992b|1p=72|Fitzsimons|2004|2p=382|Brune|2003|3p=245|Horner|1978|4p=162}}\n\nMacArthur visited Port Moresby briefly from 2 October. On 3 October, he went as far forward as Owers' Corner, where he spent about an hour.

ROWELL.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell (AWM26583)]]\n\nComplying with Curtin's directive, albeit reluctantly, Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September 1942 with only a small personal staff. It was a situation which Blamey felt was quite reasonable but with which Rowell saw significant difficulties. Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=236}} McCarthy's reporting of the initial situation suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=235\u2013237}} Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters as much as the expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=185}} Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=199\u2013200}} Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=199\u2013203}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=236\u2013240}} Perhaps, more importantly, there was a sense of disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea. In at letter to Major General [[Cyril Clowes]] at Milne Bay, Rowell said on this, \"Either I am fit to command the show or I am not.\"{{sfn|Horner|1984|p=236}}\n\nWhile the situation continued to simmer, it came to a head after Blamey had visited Milne Bay on 25 September at MacArthur's suggestion and ordered Clowes to send a force by air to [[Wanigela, Oro Province|Wanigela]].{{sfn|Horner|1984|p=237}} Major General [[George Kenney]] noted that Rowell was \"not even consulted anymore\".{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=110}} Rowell confronted Blamey on the issue and was relieved of command on 28 September. In a communication to Curtin, Blamey referred to Rowell as insubordinate and obstructive.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=239}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=202\u2013203}} Rowell was replaced by Lieutenant General [[Edmund Herring]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=238}}\n\n=====Allen=====\nOn 9 September 1942, Allen's command responsibilities were narrowed to the direct prosecution of the Kokoda Track campaign and flank protection.{{refn|New Guinea Force Operation Instruction No. 26 of 9 September 1942.<ref>{{cite web|last1=War Diary: New Guinea Force Headquarters and General (Air) (NG Force HQ & G (Air)|title=AWM52 1/5/51/18: September 1942|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1024132--18-.pdf|pp=103\u2013104 (of pdf)|website=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>|group=notes}} Important to subsequent events, NGF retained control of aerial resupply.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=227}} The Australian advance commenced with the attack of 28 September against the (abandoned) Japanese positions on Ioribaiwa Ridge. The 16th Brigade commenced to advance forward on 3 October.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=126}}\n\n[[File:AWM 026750 Maj Gen Allen and Brig Eather.jpg|thumb|left|Major General Arthur Allen (left) and Brigadier Ken Eather (centre), September 1942 (AWM026750)]]\n\nAllen had advanced his headquarters to Menari by 11 October. The 25th Brigade was advancing on two tracks from Efogi, toward Templeton's Crossing. He was mindful of the need to keep his troops fresh enough to fight and of the supply problems imposed by operations over the track. There were already difficulties in air drops meeting the division's needs. These concerns were expressed to Herring on 7 October, including the need to create a reserve over and above the daily needs. As a consequence, the supply programme intensified.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=128\u2013129}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959||pp=260\u2013261}}\n\nOn 5 October, Blamey wrote to MacArthur in \"hard terms\" of the logistical difficulties faced by NGF and specifically, Allen.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=260\u2013262}} Despite this, Blamey and MacArthur pressured Allen to increase his rate of advance and Blamey forced the issue by only arranging for supplies to be dropped at Myola\u2014effectively forcing Allen to advance to meet his point of supply.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=198}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=129}} Anderson discusses this and identifies it as an \"extremely risky\" strategy. Blamey (and Herring) wanted Allen to maintain pressure on the retreating Japanese and push home the advantage. Dropping supplies forward maintains the momentum of advance but this quickly breaks down if the advance is stalled and there are limited reserves. The position of Blamey was premised on the proposition that the Japanese were an enemy in retreat. In fact, they had made a clean break from Ioriabiawa and had established defences that were blocking Allen's advance on both routes to Templeton's Crossing. With supplies dropped at Myola, Allen could not easily support the advance being made along the Mount Bellamy track and, until the position forward of Templeton' Crossing was secured, there was the risk of Myola being compromised.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=128\u2013131 & 206\u2013207}}\n\nOn 17 October, Allen, now at Myola, received the following message from Blamey:\n{{bquote|General MacArthur considers quote extremely light casualties indicate no serious effort yet made to displace enemy unquote. You will attack enemy with energy and all possible speed at each point of resistance. Essential that Kokoda airfield be taken at earliest. Apparent enemy gaining time by delaying you with inferior strength.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=274}}}}\n\nAllen's response was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report could be made by a liaison officer or more senior officer.{{refn|Lieutenant Colonel Minogue, a liaison officer from HQ NGF was forward with Allen, attending a conference at Myola on 23 October, but Blamey acted to relieve Allen before his report was received|group=notes}}{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=208|Horner|1978|2p=206}} MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: \"Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of our troops in my opinion is faulty.\" Allen replied, in part: \"I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel that they could not have done better.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=290\u2013291}} Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having \"botched\" the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. The pressure for more haste thereby contributed to increasing the delays.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=170}} On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|pp=206\u2013209|Horner|1978|2pp=206\u2013213|McCarthy|1959|3p=307}} Allen had vouched for the judgement and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=192 & 208}}\n\n=====Potts=====\n[[File:AWM 026716 Arnold Potts left.jpg|thumb|left|Brigadier Arnold Potts (left), forward area, September 1942 (AWM026716)]]\n\nPotts had been sent forward to Isurava with orders to attack and recapture Kokoda. Instead, his force was unable to withstand the Japanese attacks and he was forced to conduct a fighting withdrawal, suffering a disastrous defeat at Brigade Hill. Increasingly concerned, MacArthur applied pressure to the chain-of-command.{{sfn|James|2009|p=15}} Potts was recalled to Port Moresby by Rowell on 10 September, with Porter as his replacement.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=225}} Horner reports Rowell's motive as dissatisfaction with Potts' \"mishandling\" of his brigade and a need to obtain a first-hand account of conditions.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=152}} Anderson reports Allen agreed with the decision, judging that Potts was \"either tired or losing a grip of the situation\".{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=100}} On arriving at Port Moresby, Potts was interviewed by Rowell and Allen, whereupon, satisfied with his performance, he was returned to command his brigade.\n\nHowever, in a private interview (overheard by Potts' staff captain, Ken Murdoch) on 22 October, the day of the \"running rabbit\" address, Blamey told Potts he was no longer required in New Guinea: \"Failures like the Kokoda Trail ... could not be tolerated\u2014the men had shown that something was lacking ..[and he] blamed the leaders.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=204}}{{refn|This dressing-down indicates the intent of Blamey's subsequent address that day to the soldiers of the 21st Brigade.|group=notes}} Potts was transferred to command the [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigade]] reforming in Darwin, exchanging postings with Brigadier [[Ivan Dougherty]]. Herring has claimed that the decision was his\u2014feeling that Potts needed to be rested and wanting Dougherty to take the position.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=211}} Murdoch was inundated with resignation papers from officers affronted by Potts' treatment. Potts instructed Murdoch to reject all resignations.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=252}}\n\n======The \"running rabbits\" incident======\nOn 22 October, after the relief of the 21st Brigade by the 25th Brigade, Blamey visited [[Koitaki]], near Port Moresby, where the 21st Brigade was encamped. Shortly after relieving Potts, Blamey addressed the men of the 21st Brigade on a [[Parade (military)|parade ground]]. The men of the Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. Instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been \"beaten\" by inferior forces, and that \"no soldier should be afraid to die\". \"Remember,\" Blamey was reported as saying, \"it's the rabbit who runs who gets shot, not the man holding the gun.\"{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}} There was a wave of murmurs and restlessness among the soldiers. Officers and senior [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) managed to quiet the soldiers and many later said that Blamey was lucky to escape with his life. During the march-past, many disobeyed the \"eyes right\" order.{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}} In a later letter to his wife, an enraged Brigadier Potts swore to \"fry his [Blamey's] soul in the afterlife\" over this incident. According to witnesses, when Blamey subsequently visited Australian wounded in the camp hospital, inmates nibbled lettuce, while wrinkling their noses and whispering \"[[Run Rabbit Run|run, rabbit, run]]\" (the chorus of a popular song during the war).{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}}\n\n=====Analysis=====\n[[File:AWM 151139 Lieutenant General Edmund Herring.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Edmund Herring (AWM151139)]]\n\nHistorian Peter Dean acknowledges the general interpretation that the actions of MacArthur and Blamey were \"to salvage their own positions at the expense of the troops\"{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=223}} but reports that MacArthur, himself, was under pressure, citing a cable from the US Joint Chiefs to MacArthur of 16 October, \"reminding him that they viewed the situation in Papua as 'critical{{Single double}}.{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=224}} Dean also notes that this coincided with the relief of Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley|Robert Ghormley]], Commander-in-Chief of US forces in the south Pacific who had operational control of the forces engaged at Guadalcanal.{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=224}} The pressure brought to bear by MacArthur was in the face of \"complicated operational and strategic contexts\", stating that, \"an understanding of these contexts has been poorly done in most accounts of the fighting [in Papua].\"{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=223}} This is encapsulated in correspondence from Brigadier General [[Stephen J. Chamberlin]] (MacArthur's operations chief) to MacArthur's Chief-of-Staff, [[Richard K. Sutherland]], of 30 October 1942: \"the key to our plan of action lies in the success or failure of the South Pacific in holding Guadalcanal ...\" (that is, that the position at Guadalcanal was tenuous).{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=225}}\n\nHowever, with specific reference to Allen, Horner finds, \"MacArthur showed an abysmal lack of trust in his subordinate [Blamey and his view that Allen was doing all he could], and an unwarranted interference in the tactical handling of troops some 1,500 miles from his headquarters.\"{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=214}} While the Curtin government was largely steadfast in recalling the 2nd AIF from the Middle East to Australia against considerable opposition from Churchill,{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=528}}{{refn|Churchill wished to divert at least part of the force to Burma.|group=notes}} Horner observes the government's complete dependence on MacArthur, which compromised Blamey's relationship with it.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=207}} His analysis also observes that these events were underpinned by the logistical problems faced by the NGF on the track and elsewhere.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=135\u2013223}}\n\nHorner's criticism of Blamey in sacking Allen is that he was in no position to accurately assess Allen's performance, observing that if Vasey could be flown into Myola to relieve Allen, then an assessment could have been arranged using the same means. Blamey acted to placate MacArthur because he (Blamey) was unwilling to risk his own job. Blamey had demonstrated \"a remarkable lack of loyalty\" toward his subordinate. To some degree, Herring shares in this criticism.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=211 & 213}} Williams, however, observes that Allen's advance was nonetheless slower than might reasonably have been expected and that the criticisms leveled at him and leading to his sacking were reasonably justified.{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=205}}\n\nHorner observes of Rowell, that his only failure was an inability to work with Blamey and that Blamey was more culpable in that, he was unwilling to risk his own position. He should have shown more trust and loyalty toward his subordinate; negated MacArthur's manoeuvring and avoided the situation.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=187\u2013188}}\n\nRegardless of the justifications made, the sackings created a climate of suspicion, animosity, personal rivalries and a \"toxic atmosphere\" which pervaded the senior ranks and was detrimental to the war effort.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=199}} Horner observes that Blamey trod a precarious line between \"maintaining his own position and protecting the Australian commanders, between risking his own replacement and risking the distrust of his subordinates\".{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=280}} Horner notes, \"the arguments between generals and politicians might seem of little consequence. But the opposite is the case. It was errors by men like MacArthur and Blamey which lead to the near disaster in New Guinea.

It was reinforced by the 3rd Battalion and by the [[2/1st Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/1st Pioneer Battalion]], although the latter did not move forward.

It was the major ridgeline before Imita Ridge and the head of the track. Eather planned to attack, advancing past Porters' flanks with two of his battalions\u2014the [[2/31st Battalion (Australia)|2/31st Battalion]] on the western flank and the [[2/33rd Battalion (Australia)|2/33rd Battalion]] on the eastern flank. The [[2/25th Battalion (Australia)|2/25th Battalion]] was his reserve. It took up a position on the track behind Porter's force. On the night 13\u201314 September, the 25th Brigade bivouacked to the rear of Porter's force ready to advance. As Eather's battalions were deploying, the Japanese attacked. Eather immediately called off the attack and adopted a defensive posture. This had the effect of placing his advancing battalions on either flank and significantly increasing his frontage.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1pp=103\u2013105|McCarthy|1959|2pp=229\u2013230}}<ref name=commemoration/>\n\nFrom Brigade Hill, Kusonose had continued to pursue the Australians with the 2nd/144th and 3rd/144th Battalions. Horii had halted his main force awaiting permission to continue the advance. Kusonose's initial attack was made with half of the 3rd/144th Battalion advancing along the axis of the track, while the 2nd/144th Battalion was to make a flanking attack from the west. Kusonose was able to bring fire on the Australian positions from eight guns. Fighting continued through the day but both attacks had been held. An attack on 15 September was made by his reserve, the second half of the 3rd/144th Battalion against what he thought was the eastern flank of the Australian force. Unaware that Maroubra Force had been reinforced, this lodged in a gap between the Australian 3rd Battalion and the 2/33rd Battalion. Counter attacks by two companies of the 2/25th and two companies of the 2/33rd Battalion that day were unable to dislodge the Japanese from this foothold.{{refn|A Company of the 2/33rd Battalion was initially tasked to attack but found the terrain too difficult.

On the main track from Kokoda to Waropi (at the crossing of the Kumusi River) Horii had constructed strong defensive positions, prepared several weeks before. These were centred on the heights overlooking Oivi, with a position in depth at Gorari, which also covered an approach from the southern parallel track. The 41st Regiment, with a battalion of the 144th Regiment and seven artillery pieces faced an advance from the west. Two battalions of the 144th Regiment held the position at Gorari and a track approaching from the south. The force headquarters was to the immediate rear.<ref name=oivi/>\n\n[[File:Awm 013644 capture Japanese infantry gun - Oivi-Gorari.jpg|thumb|left|A 70 mm infantry gun captured during the fight at Oivi\u2013Gorari.

In fighting that continued until 6 November, it tried unsuccessfully to break the position. Vasey then committed the 25th Brigade, with the [[2/1st Battalion (Australia)|2/1st Battalion]] attached, to an attack from the south toward Gorari. The brigade was to advance along the southern parallel track as far as Waju. The 2/1st Battalion leading, initially overshot this and had to retrace its steps but was ready to advance north on 7&nbsp;November. Horii had become aware of the Australian movement and dispatched his two battalions at Gorari south along the connecting track. They established an all-round defence on a position near Baribe, about halfway between the two parallel tracks. Horii also called the 1st/144th back from Oivi to occupy the position left vacant at Goari.<ref name=oivi/>\n\nOn 8 November, Eather contacted the position at Baribe, enveloping it with the 2/25th and 2/31st Battalions. On 9 November, the 2/33rd and 2/1st Battalions pushed around the Japanese position on the connecting track and advanced on Gorari, where they attacked the 1/144th Battalion and Horii's headquarters. Bombing and strafing attacks were also conducted against the Japanese positions near Oivi. By 10 November, Horii ordered a withdrawal but the situation for the Japanese had degenerated into a rout. Fighting had largely ceased by midday 11 November. The Japanese lost around 430 killed, around 400 wounded and abandoned fifteen artillery pieces among other material.<ref name=oivi/>{{sfnm|McCarthy|1959|1p=324|Milner|1957|2p=121}}\n\n==Advance on Buna\u2013Gona==\n{{main|Battle of Buna\u2013Gona}}\n\n[[File:USA-P-Papua-VI Map VI milner Closing in on Japanese Beachhead 16-21 November 1942 .jpg|thumb|right|Closing in on the Japanese beachhead, 16\u201321 November 1942]]\n\nMost of the Japanese force withdrew to the Kumusi River and 1,200 are estimated to have made the crossing of the flooded river.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=121}} Horii was swept downstream and later drowned.

While most of Vasey's force was rested, patrols continued to search out Japanese survivors and engineers were dealing with the problem of establishing a bridgehead. The crossing of the two brigades was completed on the morning of 16 November and they began their advance on the Japanese beachheads. The 25th Brigade took the track toward Gona while the 16th Brigade advanced along the track toward Sanananda.

They arrived between 15 and 28 September 1942. On 11 September, MacArthur added a plan for the 126th Infantry Regiment to conduct a wide flanking move to the east with the goal to engage the Japanese rear near Wairopi. The 2nd Battalion 126th Regiment, with supporting elements attached, was tasked with traversing the track from Kapa Kapa to Jaure. From Jaure, at the headwaters of the Kumusi River, the force was to advance toward Wairopi. The little-used track from Kapa Kapa to Jaure was {{convert|85|mi|order=flip}} long.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=92\u201394}}\n\n[[File:127507 128th Inf Regt Wanigella .JPG|thumbnail|left|Soldiers of the 128th Inf Regt on the move at Wanigela as they head towards Buna.]]\n\nThe 32nd established a position at Kalikodobu, nicknamed \"Kalamazoo\" by the [[G.I.

The Americans were utterly unprepared for the extremely harsh conditions they faced which significantly delayed their advance.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=92\u2013115}}\n\nThe planned envelopment of the Japanese forces never took place due to both the slow rate of the American advance and the unexpected, rapid withdrawal of the Japanese forces. While the 2/126th crawled over the Kapa Kapa Track, the balance of the 32nd Division was flown to newly developed advance airfields on the north side of the island. The 128th Regiment was flown to the most forward of these, located at Wanigella. From there, troops moved overland toward Buna or were ferried part of the way in coastal vessels, to meetup with Australian forces advancing on the Japanese beachheads.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=115\u2013124}} The first units of the 2/126th arrived in Soputa on 20 November 1942.{{sfn|Gailey|2000|p=109}}\n\nA similar proposal for attacking the Japanese rear near Wairopi was made by Brigadier Potts, following withdrawal of the 21st Brigade after Ioribaiwa. [[Chaforce]], raised from battalions of the 21st Brigade (each contributing a company) was to be assigned the task of penetrating from Myola into the Kumusi River valley. With initial approval to advance to Myola, the operation was subsequently cancelled sometime shortly after 18 October 1942.{{sfn|Paull| 1958| pp= 279\u2013291}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Subsequent events===\nThe Japanese at Buna\u2013Gona were reinforced by fresh units from Rabaul. The joint Australian\u2013[[United States Army]] operation faced a formidable defence that had been prepared well in advance of their arrival and the battle lasted until 22 January 1943. The 39th Battalion participated in the fighting at the beachheads and, following its withdrawal, was only able to parade about 30 members \u2013 its ranks having been greatly depleted by injury and illness.

Most took a \"[[no quarter]]\" attitude, and killed Japanese personnel rather than attempt to take them prisoner in the infrequent occasions where Japanese troops attempted to surrender. Despite official instructions against doing so, Australian soldiers often took the personal possessions of dead Japanese and there were several instances where gold teeth were taken from corpses.

The campaign consisted of a series of battles fought between July and November 1942 in what was then the Australian [[Territory of Papua]]. It was primarily a land battle, between the Japanese [[South Seas Detachment]] under Major General [[Tomitar\u014d Horii]] and Australian and Papuan land forces under command of [[New Guinea Force]]. The Japanese objective was to seize [[Port Moresby]] by an overland advance from the north coast, following the [[Kokoda Track]] over the mountains of the [[Owen Stanley Range]], as part of a strategy to isolate Australia from the United States.\n\nJapanese forces landed and established [[beachhead]]s near [[Gona]] and [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] on 21 July 1942. Opposed by [[Maroubra Force]], then consisting of four [[platoon]]s of the [[39th Battalion (Australia)|39th Battalion]] and elements of the [[Papuan Infantry Battalion]], they quickly advanced and captured [[Kokoda]] and its strategically vital airfield on 29 July. Despite reinforcement, the Australian forces were continually pushed back. The veteran [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]] narrowly avoided capture in the [[Battle of Mission Ridge \u2013 Brigade Hill]] from 6 to 8 September. In the [[Battle of Ioribaiwa]] from 13 to 16 September, the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]] under [[Brigadier]] [[Kenneth Eather]] fought the Japanese to a halt but ceded the field to the Japanese, withdrawing to Imita Ridge.\n\nThe Japanese advanced to within sight of Port Moresby but withdrew on 26 September. They had outrun their supply line and had been ordered to withdraw in consequence of reverses suffered at [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]]. The Australian pursuit encountered strong opposition from well-prepared positions around [[Second Battle of Eora Creek \u2013 Templeton's Crossing|Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village]] from 11 to 28 October. Following the unopposed recapture of Kokoda, [[Battle of Oivi\u2013Gorari|a major battle was fought around Oivi and Gorari]] from 4 to 11 November, resulting in a victory for the Australians. By 16 November, two brigades of the Australian [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]] had crossed the [[Kumusi River]] at [[Wairopi]], and advanced on the Japanese beachheads in a joint Australian and United States operation. The Japanese forces at [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona|Buna\u2013Gona]] held out until 22 January 1943.\n\nAustralian reinforcement was hampered by the logistical problems of supporting a force in isolated, mountainous, jungle terrain. There were few planes available for aerial resupply, and techniques for it were still primitive. Australian command considered that the [[Vickers machine gun]] and [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|medium mortars]] were too heavy to carry and would be ineffective in the jungle terrain. Without artillery, mortars or medium machine guns, the Australians faced an opponent equipped with mountain guns and light howitzers that had been carried into the mountains and proved to be a decisive advantage. Australian forces were unprepared to conduct a campaign in the jungle environment of New Guinea. The lessons learned during the course of this campaign and the subsequent battle of Buna\u2013Gona led to widespread changes in doctrine, training, equipment and structure, with a legacy that remains until the present day.\n\nIn consequence of the rapid Japanese advance and the perceived failure to quickly counterattack, a \"crisis of command\" resulted, in which manoeuvring by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], [[Supreme Allied Commander|Supreme Commander]] of Allied Forces in the [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]], and General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]], commander of Allied Land Forces, resulted in the sackings of three high-ranking Australian officers. The generalship of MacArthur and Blamey has been criticised for unreasonable and unrealistic perceptions of the terrain and conditions under which the campaign was fought\u2014to the detriment of the troops committed to the fighting. The Kokoda Track campaign has been mythologised as Australia's [[Battle of Thermopylae|Thermopylae]] and incorporated into the [[Anzac spirit|Anzac legend]] even though the premise of a vastly numerically-superior enemy has since been shown to be incorrect.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic context===\n{{Main||Military history of Australia during World War II|Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II}}\n[[File:ABDA Japanese attacks.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese attacks along the Malay Barrier 23 December 1941 \u2013 21 February 1942.]]\nAfter the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]], the Australian government and many Australians feared that Japan would invade the Australian mainland. Australia was ill-prepared to counter such an attack. The entire [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]], deployed to Malaya, [[Battle of Ambon|Ambon]], [[Battle of Timor|Timor]] and [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|Rabaul]], was lost or rendered ineffective as the Japanese rapidly advanced.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=490}} The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) lacked modern aircraft and the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) was too small to counter the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The RAAF and RAN were greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths.{{sfn|Dennis et al.|2008|pp=458, 468}} The [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] was mobilised but, although a large force, it was inexperienced and lacked modern equipment.{{sfn|Grey |1999| p=171}} In response to the threat, the Government appealed to the United States for assistance, and the [[6th Division (Australia)|6th]] and [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]]s of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF) were brought back from the Middle East. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] attempted to divert them to Burma, but the Australian Prime Minister, [[John Curtin]], refused to authorise this movement. As a compromise, two brigades of the 6th Division disembarked at [[Ceylon]], where they formed part of the garrison until they returned to Australia in August 1942.{{sfn|Day |1999|pp=452\u2013457}}\n\nThe Japanese [[Imperial General Headquarters]] [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|considered invading Australia]] in early 1942 but decided against doing so in February that year,{{sfn|Stanley |2008|p=156}} as it was judged to be beyond the Japanese capabilities, and no planning or preparations were undertaken.{{sfn|Stanley|2007|p=29}} Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States and preventing Allied offensive operations by capturing [[Port Moresby]],{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=10}} the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]] and [[New Caledonia]].{{sfn|Horner|1993|pp=4\u20135}}{{sfn|James|2013|p=200}} An attempt to capture Port Moresby by an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]], [[Operation Mo]], was thwarted by the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942. A month later, most of the Japanese [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] fleet was destroyed in the [[Battle of Midway]], further reducing the possibility of major amphibious operations in the South Pacific. Following this, the Japanese began to consider an overland advance on Port Moresby.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|pp=96\u201399}}{{sfn|James|2013|p=202}}\n\n[[File:Curtin MacArthur Blamey (042766).jpg|thumb|right|General [[Douglas MacArthur]] (centre) with General Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] (left) and Prime Minister [[John Curtin]] (right) in March 1942]]\nMeanwhile, the Allied [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|Supreme Commander]] in the [[South West Pacific Area]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] set about developing airfields for the defence of Port Moresby, and to strike against the Japanese. The first of these, Operation Boston, was authorised on 20 May and initially planned for the Abau\u2013Mullins Harbor area. [[Milne Bay]] was subsequently determined to be preferable and a garrison force was sent by ship from Port Moresby on 22 June. Another strip at [[Merauke]], on the south coast of [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]] was authorised on 22 June to protect the western flank.{{sfn|Milner|1957|pp=40\u201342}} On 9 June, MacArthur questioned [[General (Australia)|General]] Sir [[Thomas Blamey]], the commander of Allied Land Forces, as to measures taken for the defence of the overland approach from [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]].

There were no roads beyond the vicinity of Port Moresby and, by modern standards, these were little more than tracks. As a result, travel north of Port Moresby was largely undertaken by air, or sea.{{sfn|Brune| 2003|pp=84\u201385}} There were a few landing fields around Port Moresby, with others on the northern side of the Owen Stanley Range at the government stations of Buna and Kokoda.{{sfn|Ham|2004|pp=xvi\u2013xvii & 47}}{{refn|Milner refers to the strip at Buna as being \"small and neglected\".{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=50}}|group=notes}}\n\nThe village of [[Kokoda]] is positioned on a plateau in northern foot-hills of the Owen Stanley Range. It overlooks the Yodda Valley (formed by the Mambare River) to its north. The Mambare runs roughly south-east to north-west. Kokoda is approximately {{convert|100|km|adj=on}} direct line from the coastal village of Buna, which formed part of the Japanese beachhead positions occupied on their landing. However, the overland route was approximately {{convert|160|km|round=5}}.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|p=98}} The track to the coast crosses the Kumusi River at Wairopi, approximately {{convert|25|km}} east of Kokoda. The river was spanned there by a wire-rope bridge (Wairopi being Pidgin for wire rope).{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=110}} There was a wide track leading from there to the coast which the Japanese subsequently set about developing as a road for vehicle traffic.{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=61}}{{refn|After the initial landing, it was quickly made trafficable for {{convert|60|km|round=5}} from the coast to Sonbo.{{sfn|Bullard|2007|p=107}}|group=notes}}\n\nIn 1942, the village was the site of a government station, rubber plantation and strategically important airstrip. The Kokoda Track is a foot track that runs roughly southwest from Kokoda {{Convert|96|km}} overland ({{Convert|60|km|0}} in a straight line) through the [[Owen Stanley Range]] towards Port Moresby. It was known before the war and had been used as an overland mail route. While there is a \"main track\" that is associated with the fighting during the campaign, there are many parallel, interlocking tracks that follow much the same general course. The southern end of the track is now considered to start at Owers' Corner, {{convert|61|km|order=flip}} from Port Moresby.{{sfn|James|2009|p=60}} The vehicle track from Port Moresby originally terminated at McDonald's [Corner], where it serviced the McDonald homestead. Between June and late September 1942, around {{convert|7|mi|km}} of road was completed, extending it to Owers' Corner.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=123}}\n\nThe Kokoda Track passed through what was referred to during the early war years as \"the (Kokoda) Gap\".{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=171}} To the Japanese, who had learned of the Gap through vague explorer's accounts,{{sfn|Collie|Marutani|2009|p=55}} it potentially offered a corridor from [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]] through the Owen Stanleys along which they could launch a quick advance on Port Moresby. Conversely, the Allies believed it was a narrow and largely impassable path that could be blocked and held with only limited resources.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=17}} In reality, the Gap is a dip in the Owen Stanley Range about {{convert|11|km|sigfig=1}} wide, convenient for aircraft crossing the range to pass through.{{sfn|Kienzle|2011|p=110}}\n\nThe track reaches a height of {{Convert|2190|m|4=0}} as it passes around the peak of [[Mount Bellamy]].{{sfn|P\u00e9russe|1993|p=98}} The terrain rises and falls with regularity, up to {{convert|5000|m}} up and down over the full length of the track.{{refn|The Kokoda Track Commemorative web site<ref name=\"DVA Topo\">{{cite web|title=Topography of Kokoda|url=http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/kokoda-topography.php|website=The Kokoda Track|publisher=Australian Government Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=29 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314053321/http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/kokoda-topography.php|archivedate=14 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and James{{sfn|James|2009|loc=trek map}} give a cross-section of the track.|group=notes}} This markedly increases the distance to be traversed, although there are several flat areas, particularly around [[Myola]]. The vegetation is largely dense jungle. The climate is mostly hot and humid with high rainfall, although the higher parts are cold, particularly at night. The higher elevations are frequently above cloud level, resulting in fog.<ref name=\"DVA Topo\"/>\n\nMyola is close to the watershed. A stream flowing from Myola is part of the headwaters of Eora Creek on the northern watershed.{{sfn|James|2009|p=32}} On the northern part of the track, its course, to Deniki, is determined by Eora Creek. It follows along the side of the steep valley formed by the creek. It crosses the creek from one side to the other at several points along its course. From Deniki, the track descends to the Kokoda plateau.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=109\u2013110}}\n\n===Disease===\n[[File:AWM P02423.011 2nd 4th field ambulance.jpg|thumb|left|Tents of the 2/4th Field Ambulance near Efogi (AWM P02423.011)]]\n\nOperations in New Guinea were impacted by tropical diseases such as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], [[scrub typhus]], [[tropical ulcer]]s, [[dysentery]] from a range of causes and [[Mycosis|fungal infections]]. Walker observes that the Kokoda Track \"starts and ends with malaria\". Malarial [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] were substantially absent from the cooler, higher elevations along the track. Most cases observed in these areas were relapses rather than primary infections. The immediate vicinity of Port Moresby is relatively dry. While this tends to mitigate the risk of malaria, significant rates of the disease were observed in troops, mainly militia, sent to New Guinea for defence of the port, leading up to the campaign. The risk from malaria was particularly high for troops operating in the coastal area around the southern end of the track and when the Australian forces had been forced back to Imita Ridge. AIF units returning from the Middle East were more aware of the threat this disease posed and arrived with supplies of [[quinine]]. For these reasons, the disease did not have the same degree of significance or impact on operations as it did at [[Battle of Milne Bay|Milne Bay]] or the subsequent operations at Buna\u2013Gona.{{sfn|Walker|1956|pp=12, 70\u201371 & 108\u2013124}}\n\nAnderson recounts the prevalence of dysentery among Australian troops,{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=125\u2013126}} while James reports that \"more and more [Japanese] succumbed\" to diseases, including dysentery, as they withdrew along the track.{{sfn|James|2009|p=20}} Walker attributes enteric infections to poor field hygiene, contaminated and unpurified water, and a failure to make adequate sanitary provisions along the track during the early part of the campaign. He also identifies that a proportion of diarrhoeal disturbances were attributable to the poor diet (particularly the high-fat content of tinned beef) rather than infection.{{sfn|Walker|1956|p=72}}\n\n===Japanese forces===\n{{main|Order of battle for the Kokoda Track campaign}}\nThe [[Seventeenth Army (Japan)|Japanese 17th Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Harukichi Hyakutake]] was a corps-sized command, based at Rabaul, involved in the New Guinea, Guadalcanal, and Solomon Islands campaigns.{{sfn|Smith|2000|p=25}} Following Coral Sea, the 17th Army considered an overland advance on Port Moresby. This was based on pre-war intelligence that a road existed linking it with Kokoda. Initial aerial reconnaissance was inconclusive but plans were made for a reconnaissance in force and to exploit the possibility of an advance along such a route.

A porter could carry a load equivalent to 13 days' rations. If he carried rations for a soldier, between them, they would consume the load in 6\u00bd days. This made no allowance for ammunition, other necessary equipment or the porter's return. The trek to Kokoda was 8 days. He concluded that operations could not be sustained without large scale air drops occurring.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=117\u2013118}} Aerial resupply commenced with drop sites at Kagi and Efogi but neither site was particularly suitable. Significant quantities fell outside the drop zone and could not be recovered. Unreliable maps or poor visibility in the drop zone meant that supplies were often misdropped. Recognising that a better drop zone was needed, Kienzle set out on 1 August, to find a large open area he recalled having seen from the air. On 3 August, he identified the smaller of two dry lake beds near the crest of the range, which he called Myola.{{sfnm|McCarthy|1959|1pp=130\u2013131|Kienzle|2011|2pp=136\u2013139|James|2009|3pp=31\u201332|Fitzsimons|2004|4pp=214\u2013215}} Kienzle immediately requested that dropping begin at Myola. Access to this large area alleviated the proportion of supplies lost to the jungle. It also made the task of carriers achievable. He set about establishing it as a supply camp and cut a new track towards Eora Creek. It joined the existing track at Templeton's Crossing, which he also named.{{sfn|Brune|2003|pp=112\u2013113}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=32}}\n\n[[File:AWM 013002 2 man load.jpg|thumb|right|Papuan carriers with a two-man load, moving along the track (AWM013002)]]\n\nWhile the discovery of Myola alleviated one of the problems associated with resupply, it did not solve them all.

Transport aircraft in the theatre at this time were largely operated by the [[Fifth Air Force]], with Major General [[George Kenney]] commanding Allied Air Forces. MacArthur released six [[Douglas SBD Dauntless|Douglas Dauntless]] dive bombers, one [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] and two transports. He noted that, at the time, there were only thirty transport planes in Australia and, of these, only 50 per cent were available at any one time.{{sfn|Brune|2003|p=124}} His response stated that the resources being made available should be sufficient for the {{convert|20000|lb|kg|order=flip|sigfig=1}} of supplies necessary to supply forces at [[Kanga Force|Wau]] and along the track (as estimated by Rowell) each day.

Successive withdrawals towards the start of the track eased the supply burden. As Allen advanced, following the withdrawing Japanese forces, he was acutely aware of the logistical problems facing his force. He faced pressure from Blamey and MacArthur to advance his forces without being able to assure their supply.

Meanwhile, allied airpower interfered with the Japanese line-of-communication, particularly at the Kumusi River, making it uncrossable by day. Soldiers advanced from Kokoda carrying 16 days' rations. The advance, from the end of July until Ioribaiwa, in mid September was to last for over forty-five days.

On 15 June 1942, Morris issued the Employment of Natives Order under the National Security (Emergency Control) Regulations. This provided for the conscription of Papuan labour to support the Australian war effort.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=116}} While resupply of the Australian forces on the track would have collapsed without airdrops, the native carrier force remained an essential component, moving supplies forward from the drop zones under arduous conditions. Captain Geoffrey 'Doc' Vernon wrote of the conditions endured: \"The condition of our carriers at Eora Creek caused me more concern than that of the wounded ... Overwork, overloading ... exposure, cold and underfeeding were the common lot. Every evening scores of carriers came in, slung their loads down and lay exhausted on the ground.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=132}}\n\nOn their return, they would carry back the wounded with care: for which they have been mythologised as the \"[[Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels]]\".{{sfn|Rogerson|2012|p=5}} There are many testaments of praise for the care rendered.{{sfn|James|2009|p=18}} In relation to the carriers, Captain (later Major) Henry Steward wrote after the war that \"the men on the stretchers ...[were] ... tended with the devotion of a mother and the care of a nurse\", while [[Frank Kingsley Norris]] recounted that, \"if night finds the stretcher still on the track, they will find a level spot and build a shelter over the patient. They will make him as comfortable as possible, fetch him water and feed him if food is available\u2014regardless of their own needs. They sleep four each side of the stretcher and if the patient moves or requires any attention during the night, this is given instantly\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Brune|2003|pp=188\u2013189}}.</ref>\n\nThe carrier force under command of Kienzle supporting the Australian advance is reported at over 1,600.

Author Paul Ham estimates a total of up to 3,000 and claims a desertion rate of 30 per cent.{{sfn|Ham|2004|pp=211 & 214}} The ever-increasing need for labour impacted on the communities from which they were conscripted by reducing the capacity for food production.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=264\u2013265}}\n\nThe Japanese also relied on native labour to transport supplies for their forces on the Kokoda Track. Around 2,000 indentured workers were transported to the mainland from Rabaul, and a further 300 residents of the north coast of Papua were recruited. These labourers were poorly treated, and suffered from overwork. Many carriers who became sick or injured were murdered by Japanese forces. This mistreatment caused high desertion rates among the Papuan carriers. As the Japanese had difficulty obtaining replacement carriers, the casualties and desertions contributed to shortfalls in the quantities of supplies which reached the combat troops.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=117}}\n\n====Medical====\n[[File:AWM P02424.085 air ambulance at kokoda.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Stinson L-1 Vigilant]] air ambulance operating at Kokoda, November 1942 (AWM P02424.085)]]\n\nWhen the 21st Brigade joined the fighting early in the campaign, the medical plan was for evacuation forward to Kokoda, and there, by air, on the premise that it would soon be recaptured.

The report of then Colonel Norris, the 7th Division's senior medical officer, noted the difficulty of providing sufficient means to move stretchers. Each required eight bearers which meant those wounded who were able to stagger were treated with \"absolute ruthlessness\" and not provided with stretchers. In one case, a casualty with a severely fractured [[patella]] (kneecap) walked for six days and some with worse injuries volunteered to walk to free a stretcher for the more seriously wounded.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Brief Account of the activities of the 7th Australian Division \u2013 Medical Services during Six Months Campaign in Papua|year=1943|journal=AWM|page=54|volume=481/12/13}}</ref>\n\nAs the Australians advanced back along the track to Kokoda, Myola again became the main evacuation point.

Initially it was intended that the guns would be moved by pack horse; however, following the unit's arrival in [[Port Moresby]] in early October it soon became clear that horses would be unsuited to the humid conditions in New Guinea with the guns to be moved by [[jeep]]s and native carriers instead.{{sfn|Horner|1995|p=342}} It took about 90 porters to move one gun without ammunition.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=357}} The battery did not take part in the fighting along the track but on 15 November, a detachment with one gun was flown into Kokoda to support the Australian 7th Division.{{sfnm|McCarthy|1959|1p=355|Horner|1995|2pp=342\u2013344|3a1=Allan|3a2=Cutts|3y=1994|3pp=40\u201341 & 62}}\n\nAn Australian infantry battalion had a mortar platoon with four [[Ordnance ML 3 inch mortar|Ordnance ML 3-inch mortar]]s, capable of throwing a {{convert|4.5|kg}} round {{convert|1500|m|yd}}.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=221|Threlfall|2008|2p=157\u2013160,276}}{{refn|At about this time, improvements increased the range to about {{convert|2500|m|yds}}.|group=notes}} Battalions also had access to the [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers medium machine gun]].{{refn|The establishment of Vickers within battalions at the time is unclear and likely varied between Militia and AIF units.

McCarthy recounts instances where Australian mortars and Vickers machine guns brought into service were quickly targeted and taken out by Japanese artillery.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=297\u2013298}} There was also a high rate of misfires with mortar ammunition that had been airdropped and, after such a round exploded in the barrel and killed the crew, the use of airdropped mortar ammunition was suspended by the 16th Brigade.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=301}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=184\u2013185}}\n\nThe Japanese carried into the mountains thirteen artillery pieces and employed fifteen in the Battle of Oivi\u2013Gorari at the end of the campaign.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=111}}{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=152}} While Anderson reports that approximately 940 men were responsible for carrying the guns, ammunition and other paraphernalia across the Owen Stanleys, he concludes that, despite this burden: \"Throughout the Kokoda campaign the Japanese held one distinct advantage over the Australians: artillery. The Japanese use of artillery pieces in each Kokoda battle was a force multiplier, and the Australians were never able to match the Japanese ranged weapons.\" He attributes around 35 per cent of the Australian casualties to the Japanese artillery but observes that the effect upon morale was perhaps of equal significance: \"The helplessness felt by the men who were subjected to relentless bombardment without the means to retaliate sapped both their number and their spirit.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=111}} Williams asserts that: \"Japanese artillery provided an important, perhaps decisive, role on the battlefields of the Kokoda Track.\"{{sfn|Williams|2012|p=161}}\n\n====Other equipment====\n[[File:AWM P02038.146 James Pashley.jpg|thumb|left|Radio set operated by Signalman James Pashley (AWM P02038.146)]]\n\nAustralian soldiers initially entered battle wearing a khaki uniform which contrasted with the darker greens of the jungle. Moreover, webbing of the 21st Brigade had been bleached white from their service in Syria. In contrast, the Japanese wore a green uniform more suited to the jungle environment and were adept at camouflage. By the time the 25th Brigade was committed to the fighting, it was wearing jungle green\u2014albeit that these were khaki uniforms that had been quickly dyed. This dye ran and caused skin complaints among the wearers.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=118}}\n\nMuch of the Australian equipment was standardised across the British army and the Commonwealth. This imperial legacy meant a force structure intended for fighting in open country and which was highly reliant on motor transport.{{sfn|Palazzo|2004|pp=86\u201388}} Consequently, weight was not so much a consideration where equipment was not intended to be man-packed. The 109 radio set and associated equipment required nineteen carriers to transport, were temperamental as a result of the \"excessive handling\" and were susceptible to moisture and humidity. In contrast, the Japanese used compact wireless sets and lightweight aluminium signal wire.{{sfn|Threlfall|2008|pp=216\u2013217}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=171}}\n\nCaptured stocks of [[Mills bomb]]s (model 36M) were valued by the Japanese.

Regular missions against Buna effectively neutralised the airfield\u2014damaging it almost as fast as it could be repaired, thereby rendering it ineffective.

Morris was moved to command the [[Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit]] (ANGAU). At about this time, 7th Division was deploying to New Guinea and responsibility for the immediate defence of Port Moresby, including Maroubra Force and the Kokoda Track operation was devolved to divisional headquarters under Allan.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=47|McCarthy|1959|2p=140}}{{refn|New Guinea Force Operation Instruction No. 24 of 18 August 1942.<ref>{{cite web|last1=War Diary: New Guinea Force Headquarters and General (Air)|title= AWM52 1/5/51/17: August 1942|url=https://www.awm.gov.au/images/collection/pdf/RCDIG1024131--17-.pdf|pp=41\u201350 (of pdf)|website=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=3 May 2017}}</ref>|group=notes}}\n\nBoth Blamey's [[South West Pacific Area (command)#Allied Land Forces|Allied Land Headquarters]] (LHQ) and MacArthur's General Headquarters (GHQ) were increasingly alarmed by the situation on the track, with Australian forces suffering a series of reversals, and by the Japanese landings at Milne Bay (this battle was fought from 25 August to 7 September 1942). Vasey, then Blamey's deputy chief of the general staff, wrote privately to Rowell on 1 September, that \"GHQ is like a bloody barometer in a cyclone\u2014up and down every two minutes\".{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=225}} MacArthur also had a poor opinion of the Australian troops and no real appreciation of the conditions under which the fighting in New Guinea was being conducted. On 6 September, MacArthur wrote to General [[George Marshall]] that, \"the Australians have proven themselves unable to match the enemy in jungle fighting. Aggressive leadership is lacking.\"{{sfn|Larrabee|2004|p=324}} Jones observes, \"The attitude that the Australians were poor fighters pervaded thinking at MacArthur's headquarters\".{{sfn|Jones|1989|p=40}}\n\n[[File:AWM 150815 Blamey.jpg|thumb|right|General Sir Thomas Blamey chatting with troops during MacArthur's visit (AWM150815)]]\n\nThe Australian government was also concerned. On 9 September, Army Minister [[Frank Forde]] directed Blamey to visit Port Moresby, which he did, from 12 to 14 September. On his return, he was able to assure the government of his confidence in Rowell and that the situation was in hand.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=200\u2013201}} Nonetheless, MacArthur persuaded the Australian Prime Minister, John Curtin, to send Blamey to New Guinea to take command there and \"energise the situation\".{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=235}} By this manoeuvre, MacArthur ensured that Blamey would be the scapegoat if Port Moresby fell.{{sfnm|McAulay|1992b|1p=72|Fitzsimons|2004|2p=382|Brune|2003|3p=245|Horner|1978|4p=162}}\n\nMacArthur visited Port Moresby briefly from 2 October. On 3 October, he went as far forward as Owers' Corner, where he spent about an hour. He was present as the 16th Brigade, under Brigadier [[John Lloyd (brigadier)|John Lloyd]], was commencing its advance along the track.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=127|Horner|1978|2p=195|McCarthy|1959|3p=280}} He subsequently established his advance headquarters in Port Moresby on 6 November 1942 (just after Kokoda was reoccupied) until January 1943.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=230}}\n\n====Command crisis====\nThe \"command crisis\" is referred to by McCarthy (among others) in the Australian official history as part of a chapter title: \"Ioriabiawa: and a command in crisis\".{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=229}}{{sfn|James|2009|p=16}} Academic and historian, [[David Horner]]'s first book is titled, ''Crisis of Command: Australian Generalship and the Japanese Threat, 1941\u20131943'', in which he studies the generalship in these early stages of the war with Japan.{{sfn|Horner|1978}} Anderson notes that, while the \"command crisis\" specifically relates to Blamey's sacking of Rowell, the phrase can also be applied to the sackings of Allen and Potts.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=199}}\n\n=====Rowell=====\n[[File:AWM 026583 LIEUTENANT-GENERAL S.F. ROWELL.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell (AWM26583)]]\n\nComplying with Curtin's directive, albeit reluctantly, Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September 1942 with only a small personal staff. It was a situation which Blamey felt was quite reasonable but with which Rowell saw significant difficulties. Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=236}} McCarthy's reporting of the initial situation suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=235\u2013237}} Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters as much as the expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=185}} Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=199\u2013200}} Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=199\u2013203}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=236\u2013240}} Perhaps, more importantly, there was a sense of disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea. In at letter to Major General [[Cyril Clowes]] at Milne Bay, Rowell said on this, \"Either I am fit to command the show or I am not.\"{{sfn|Horner|1984|p=236}}\n\nWhile the situation continued to simmer, it came to a head after Blamey had visited Milne Bay on 25 September at MacArthur's suggestion and ordered Clowes to send a force by air to [[Wanigela, Oro Province|Wanigela]].{{sfn|Horner|1984|p=237}} Major General [[George Kenney]] noted that Rowell was \"not even consulted anymore\".{{sfn|Kenney|1949|p=110}} Rowell confronted Blamey on the issue and was relieved of command on 28 September.

The 16th Brigade commenced to advance forward on 3 October.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=126}}\n\n[[File:AWM 026750 Maj Gen Allen and Brig Eather.jpg|thumb|left|Major General Arthur Allen (left) and Brigadier Ken Eather (centre), September 1942 (AWM026750)]]\n\nAllen had advanced his headquarters to Menari by 11 October. The 25th Brigade was advancing on two tracks from Efogi, toward Templeton's Crossing. He was mindful of the need to keep his troops fresh enough to fight and of the supply problems imposed by operations over the track. There were already difficulties in air drops meeting the division's needs. These concerns were expressed to Herring on 7 October, including the need to create a reserve over and above the daily needs. As a consequence, the supply programme intensified.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=128\u2013129}}{{sfn|McCarthy|1959||pp=260\u2013261}}\n\nOn 5 October, Blamey wrote to MacArthur in \"hard terms\" of the logistical difficulties faced by NGF and specifically, Allen.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=260\u2013262}} Despite this, Blamey and MacArthur pressured Allen to increase his rate of advance and Blamey forced the issue by only arranging for supplies to be dropped at Myola\u2014effectively forcing Allen to advance to meet his point of supply.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=198}}{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=129}} Anderson discusses this and identifies it as an \"extremely risky\" strategy. Blamey (and Herring) wanted Allen to maintain pressure on the retreating Japanese and push home the advantage. Dropping supplies forward maintains the momentum of advance but this quickly breaks down if the advance is stalled and there are limited reserves. The position of Blamey was premised on the proposition that the Japanese were an enemy in retreat. In fact, they had made a clean break from Ioriabiawa and had established defences that were blocking Allen's advance on both routes to Templeton's Crossing. With supplies dropped at Myola, Allen could not easily support the advance being made along the Mount Bellamy track and, until the position forward of Templeton' Crossing was secured, there was the risk of Myola being compromised.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=128\u2013131 & 206\u2013207}}\n\nOn 17 October, Allen, now at Myola, received the following message from Blamey:\n{{bquote|General MacArthur considers quote extremely light casualties indicate no serious effort yet made to displace enemy unquote. You will attack enemy with energy and all possible speed at each point of resistance. Essential that Kokoda airfield be taken at earliest. Apparent enemy gaining time by delaying you with inferior strength.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=274}}}}\n\nAllen's response was measured. He requested that any decision on his progress be deferred until a report could be made by a liaison officer or more senior officer.{{refn|Lieutenant Colonel Minogue, a liaison officer from HQ NGF was forward with Allen, attending a conference at Myola on 23 October, but Blamey acted to relieve Allen before his report was received|group=notes}}{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|1p=208|Horner|1978|2p=206}} MacArthur and Blamey continued to press Allen through the delays experienced at Templeton's Crossing and Eora Village. To his credit, Allen stood by his subordinates. Just as the 16th Brigade was advancing on Eora Village, a signal from MacArthur through Blamey on 21 October further pressured Allen: \"Operations reports show that progress on the trail is NOT repeat NOT satisfactory. The tactical handling of our troops in my opinion is faulty.\" Allen replied, in part: \"I have complete confidence in my brigade commanders and troops and feel that they could not have done better.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|pp=290\u2013291}} Allen's trust may have been misplaced though, as Anderson describes Lloyd as having \"botched\" the tactical handling of the first two days of the engagement at Eora Village that were just then unfolding. He also notes that the downward pressure being applied for haste likely weighed heavily in Lloyd's decision to proceed initially with a frontal attack. The pressure for more haste thereby contributed to increasing the delays.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=170}} On 28 October, Blamey ordered Allen's recall and replacement by Vasey.{{sfnm|Anderson|2014|pp=206\u2013209|Horner|1978|2pp=206\u2013213|McCarthy|1959|3p=307}} Allen had vouched for the judgement and professionalism of his brigade commanders (in this case, specifically Lloyd) and in this, he was ultimately responsible; however, Anderson opines that Allen's replacement may have been inevitable, regardless of the justification.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|pp=192 & 208}}\n\n=====Potts=====\n[[File:AWM 026716 Arnold Potts left.jpg|thumb|left|Brigadier Arnold Potts (left), forward area, September 1942 (AWM026716)]]\n\nPotts had been sent forward to Isurava with orders to attack and recapture Kokoda. Instead, his force was unable to withstand the Japanese attacks and he was forced to conduct a fighting withdrawal, suffering a disastrous defeat at Brigade Hill. Increasingly concerned, MacArthur applied pressure to the chain-of-command.{{sfn|James|2009|p=15}} Potts was recalled to Port Moresby by Rowell on 10 September, with Porter as his replacement.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=225}} Horner reports Rowell's motive as dissatisfaction with Potts' \"mishandling\" of his brigade and a need to obtain a first-hand account of conditions.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=152}} Anderson reports Allen agreed with the decision, judging that Potts was \"either tired or losing a grip of the situation\".{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=100}} On arriving at Port Moresby, Potts was interviewed by Rowell and Allen, whereupon, satisfied with his performance, he was returned to command his brigade.\n\nHowever, in a private interview (overheard by Potts' staff captain, Ken Murdoch) on 22 October, the day of the \"running rabbit\" address, Blamey told Potts he was no longer required in New Guinea: \"Failures like the Kokoda Trail ... could not be tolerated\u2014the men had shown that something was lacking ..[and he] blamed the leaders.\"{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=204}}{{refn|This dressing-down indicates the intent of Blamey's subsequent address that day to the soldiers of the 21st Brigade.|group=notes}} Potts was transferred to command the [[23rd Brigade (Australia)|23rd Brigade]] reforming in Darwin, exchanging postings with Brigadier [[Ivan Dougherty]].

Shortly after relieving Potts, Blamey addressed the men of the 21st Brigade on a [[Parade (military)|parade ground]]. The men of the Maroubra Force expected congratulations for their efforts in holding back the Japanese. Instead of praising them, Blamey told the brigade that they had been \"beaten\" by inferior forces, and that \"no soldier should be afraid to die\". \"Remember,\" Blamey was reported as saying, \"it's the rabbit who runs who gets shot, not the man holding the gun.\"{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}} There was a wave of murmurs and restlessness among the soldiers. Officers and senior [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCOs) managed to quiet the soldiers and many later said that Blamey was lucky to escape with his life. During the march-past, many disobeyed the \"eyes right\" order.{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}} In a later letter to his wife, an enraged Brigadier Potts swore to \"fry his [Blamey's] soul in the afterlife\" over this incident. According to witnesses, when Blamey subsequently visited Australian wounded in the camp hospital, inmates nibbled lettuce, while wrinkling their noses and whispering \"[[Run Rabbit Run|run, rabbit, run]]\" (the chorus of a popular song during the war).{{sfn|Brune||2003|pp=257\u2013258}}\n\n=====Analysis=====\n[[File:AWM 151139 Lieutenant General Edmund Herring.jpg|thumb|right|Lieutenant General Edmund Herring (AWM151139)]]\n\nHistorian Peter Dean acknowledges the general interpretation that the actions of MacArthur and Blamey were \"to salvage their own positions at the expense of the troops\"{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=223}} but reports that MacArthur, himself, was under pressure, citing a cable from the US Joint Chiefs to MacArthur of 16 October, \"reminding him that they viewed the situation in Papua as 'critical{{Single double}}.{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=224}} Dean also notes that this coincided with the relief of Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley|Robert Ghormley]], Commander-in-Chief of US forces in the south Pacific who had operational control of the forces engaged at Guadalcanal.{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=224}} The pressure brought to bear by MacArthur was in the face of \"complicated operational and strategic contexts\", stating that, \"an understanding of these contexts has been poorly done in most accounts of the fighting [in Papua].\"{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=223}} This is encapsulated in correspondence from Brigadier General [[Stephen J. Chamberlin]] (MacArthur's operations chief) to MacArthur's Chief-of-Staff, [[Richard K. Sutherland]], of 30 October 1942: \"the key to our plan of action lies in the success or failure of the South Pacific in holding Guadalcanal ...\" (that is, that the position at Guadalcanal was tenuous).{{sfn|Dean|2013|p=225}}\n\nHowever, with specific reference to Allen, Horner finds, \"MacArthur showed an abysmal lack of trust in his subordinate [Blamey and his view that Allen was doing all he could], and an unwarranted interference in the tactical handling of troops some 1,500 miles from his headquarters.\"{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=214}} While the Curtin government was largely steadfast in recalling the 2nd AIF from the Middle East to Australia against considerable opposition from Churchill,{{sfn|Maughan|1966|p=528}}{{refn|Churchill wished to divert at least part of the force to Burma.|group=notes}} Horner observes the government's complete dependence on MacArthur, which compromised Blamey's relationship with it.{{sfn|Horner|1978|p=207}} His analysis also observes that these events were underpinned by the logistical problems faced by the NGF on the track and elsewhere.{{sfn|Horner|1978|pp=135\u2013223}}\n\nHorner's criticism of Blamey in sacking Allen is that he was in no position to accurately assess Allen's performance, observing that if Vasey could be flown into Myola to relieve Allen, then an assessment could have been arranged using the same means.

The [[2/25th Battalion (Australia)|2/25th Battalion]] was his reserve. It took up a position on the track behind Porter's force. On the night 13\u201314 September, the 25th Brigade bivouacked to the rear of Porter's force ready to advance. As Eather's battalions were deploying, the Japanese attacked. Eather immediately called off the attack and adopted a defensive posture.

Kusonose's initial attack was made with half of the 3rd/144th Battalion advancing along the axis of the track, while the 2nd/144th Battalion was to make a flanking attack from the west. Kusonose was able to bring fire on the Australian positions from eight guns. Fighting continued through the day but both attacks had been held. An attack on 15 September was made by his reserve, the second half of the 3rd/144th Battalion against what he thought was the eastern flank of the Australian force. Unaware that Maroubra Force had been reinforced, this lodged in a gap between the Australian 3rd Battalion and the 2/33rd Battalion.

These were centred on the heights overlooking Oivi, with a position in depth at Gorari, which also covered an approach from the southern parallel track. The 41st Regiment, with a battalion of the 144th Regiment and seven artillery pieces faced an advance from the west.

The brigade was to advance along the southern parallel track as far as Waju. The 2/1st Battalion leading, initially overshot this and had to retrace its steps but was ready to advance north on 7&nbsp;November. Horii had become aware of the Australian movement and dispatched his two battalions at Gorari south along the connecting track.

On 11 September, MacArthur added a plan for the 126th Infantry Regiment to conduct a wide flanking move to the east with the goal to engage the Japanese rear near Wairopi. The 2nd Battalion 126th Regiment, with supporting elements attached, was tasked with traversing the track from Kapa Kapa to Jaure.

Despite official instructions against doing so, Australian soldiers often took the personal possessions of dead Japanese and there were several instances where gold teeth were taken from corpses.

Senior military commanders including MacArthur and Blamey were unaware of the extraordinarily difficult terrain and the extreme conditions in which the battles would be fought, and orders given to the commanders were sometimes unrealistic given the conditions on the ground.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=226\u2013227}} In the end though, the strategy used against the Japanese in Papua\u2014widely criticised at the time\u2014led to an eventual, though costly, victory.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}} The American official historian Samuel Milner judged that \"the only result, strategically speaking\" of the Kokoda track campaign and subsequent fighting in Papua \"was that after six months of bitter fighting and some 8,500 casualties, including 3,000 dead, the South West Pacific Area was exactly where it would have been the previous July had it been able to secure the beachhead before the Japanese got there\".{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=378}} More recently, Australian historian Nicholas Anderson has concluded that while the Kokoda Track was a significant Allied victory, it was less important to the outcome of the Pacific War than the defeat of the main Japanese effort at this time during the Guadalcanal Campaign.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=213}}\n\nThe campaign also served to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the individual soldiers and the lower level commanders.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}} Following this and the fighting that followed at Buna\u2013Gona, the American and Australian armies would take steps to improve individual and unit training and medical and logistic infrastructure would also be greatly improved, with an increased focus upon air transport to solve the supply problem.{{sfn|McCarthy|1959|p=335}}{{sfn|Milner|1957|p=376}} Within the Australian Army, there was a major restructure with the formation of [[Jungle division]]s which addressed manpower issues and were more suited to operations in jungle environments. There was a significant reduction in the scale of motor transport, and Jeeps, with greater cross-country mobility, were employed rather than trucks. At battalion level, changes included increasing the number of mortars to eight, the addition of a machine gun platoon with four Vickers guns to enhance organic fire support, and a removal of the [[Universal Carrier|carrier]] platoon.{{sfn|Palazzo|2004|pp=86\u2013101}} The [[Land Warfare Centre (Australia)|Land Warfare Centre]], as it is now known, was established at [[Canungra, Queensland]], with an emphasis on training for jungle warfare.{{sfn|Anderson|2014|p=213}} Adrian Threlfall, in his thesis and subsequent book explores the challenges faced and how these shaped the Australian Army as a jungle warfare force.{{sfn|Threlfall|2008}}{{sfn|Threlfall|2014}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kokoda Track Memorial Walkway]]\n* [[The Kokoda Challenge]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|group=notes|colwidth=30em}}\n\n;Citations\n{{reflist|20em}}\n;Bibliography\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Allan |first1=Jack |last2=Cutts |first2=Chris |year=1994 |title=As It Seemed To Us: The 1st Australian Mountain Battery, RAA, AIF |publisher=AEbis |location=Brisbane, Queensland |isbn=978-0-646-17515-7 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Nicholas |title=To Kokoda |series=Australian Army Campaigns Series \u2013 14 |year=2014 |publisher=Big Sky Publishing |location=Sydney, New South Wales |isbn=978-1-922132-95-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|author=Blakeley, Herbert|title=The 32nd Infantry Division in World War II|publisher=Thirty-Second Infantry Division History Commission|location=Maison, Wisconsin|year=1957|oclc=3465460}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Brune|first=Peter|title=A Bastard of a Place: The Australians in Papua|publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]]|location=Crows Nest, New South Wales|year=2003|isbn=1-74114-403-5|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Bullard |first=Steven (translator) |title=Japanese Army Operations in the South Pacific Area: New Britain and Papua Campaigns, 1942\u201343 |publisher=Australian War Memorial| year=2007 |location=Canberra |url=http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/088031725e4569e4ca256f4f00126373/1fcb61d633972daaca257291000abf44?OpenDocument |isbn=978-0-9751904-8-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Coates |first=John|authorlink=John Coates (general) |title=An Atlas of Australia's Wars |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne |isbn=0-19-555914-2 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book | last1 = Collie | first1 = Craig | last2 = Marutani | first2 = Hajime | title = The Path of Infinite Sorrow: The Japanese on the Kokoda Track | publisher = Allen & Unwin | location = Crows Nest, New South Wales | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-74175-839-9 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Coulthard-Clark|first=Chris|title=The Encyclopaedia of Australia's Battles|year= 1998|publisher=Allen & Unwin|location=Sydney|isbn=1-86448-611-2|ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Craven|first=Wesley|author2=Cate, James |title=Army Air Forces in World War II, Volume 1: Plans and Early Operations\u2014January 1938 to August 1942|year=1948|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|location=Chicago |oclc=704158}}\n* {{cite book |last=Day |first=David|title=John Curtin.
