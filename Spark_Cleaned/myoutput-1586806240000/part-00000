They make me wanna cry and curl up into a ball. If Wikipedia edits this, I will delete their Minecraft account.\n\nThe sock is stretched out fully so that it is long enough to cover the puppeteer's wrist and part of the arm. Often, the puppeteer hides behind a stand and raise the hand above it so that only the puppet is visible. Sock puppeteers may also stand in full view along with their puppets and hold conversations with them using [[ventriloquism]].\n\n==Composition==\nSock puppets can be made from socks or stockings of any color.  Any sock may be used to create a puppet, but socks that are too tattered may fall apart during a performance, so they are usually bought new. Additions can be glued on in order to give the sock a personality. Streamers and felt strings might be glued on for hair. Buttons or [[googly eyes]] (obtained from craft or fabric stores) are used for the puppet's eyes.\n\n==Uses==\nSock puppets are often used for the education and entertainment of children. They can be used in elaborate puppet shows or children's plays, much as marionettes would be. The process of making sock puppets is popularly taught as a creative activity in elementary schools.

In the United States, children's entertainer [[Shari Lewis]] was known for her television show ''[[Lamb Chop's Play-Along]]'' featuring the sock puppets [[Lamb Chop (puppet)|Lamb Chop]], Charlie Horse, and Hush Puppy. Sock puppets are often used because they are less intimidating and scary, and, therefore, very child-friendly.\n\nSock puppets have also been used in television programming aimed at adults. The 1980s saw the introduction of the [[Ed the Sock]] character on local cable in Toronto, and the ''[[Sifl and Olly]]'' show aired on [[MTV]] in the 1990s. Both of these were aimed at teenagers and young adults. Sock puppets have also appeared in advertising geared towards adults.
