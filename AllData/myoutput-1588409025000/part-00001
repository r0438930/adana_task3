Although S\u00f6dermalm usually is considered an island, water to both its north and south does not flow freely but passes through [[Lock (water navigation)|locks]].\n\nS\u00f6dermalm is connected to its surrounding areas by a number of bridges. It connects to [[Gamla stan]] to the north by [[Slussenomr\u00e5det|Slussen]], a grid of road and rail and a lock that separates the [[M\u00e4laren|lake M\u00e4laren]] from the [[Baltic Sea]], to [[L\u00e5ngholmen]] to the northwest by one of the city's larger bridges, [[V\u00e4sterbron]], to the islet [[Reimersholme]] to the west, to [[Liljeholmen]] to the southwest by the bridge [[Liljeholmsbron]], to \u00c5rsta by [[\u00c5rstabroarna|\u00c5rstabron]] and [[Skansbron]], to [[Johanneshov]] by [[Johanneshovsbron]] and [[Skanstullsbron]] to the south, and, finally, to [[S\u00f6dra Hammarbyhamnen]] to the east by Danvikstull Bridge.\n\nAdministratively, S\u00f6dermalm is part of [[Stockholm Municipality]]. It constitutes, together with [[Gamla stan]] and some other districts, from 2007 the administrative district ''S\u00f6dermalms stadsdelsomr\u00e5de'', often translated as [[S\u00f6dermalm borough]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stockholm, S\u00f6dermalm, \u00c5s\u00f6gatan.Teckning av Ferdinand Boberg - Nordiska museet - NMA.0090969.jpg|thumb|Wooden buildings on S\u00f6dermalm in 1924, drawn by [[Ferdinand Boberg]].]]\nThe name S\u00f6dermalm (as ''Suthaermalm'') is first mentioned in 1288 in a letter from Bishop Anund of Str\u00e4ngn\u00e4s. Until the early 17th century S\u00f6dermalm was mainly a rural, agricultural area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stockholm Stories|url=http://www.stockholmstories.com/southern-island/|accessdate=14 April 2014}}</ref> Its first urban areas were planned and built in the mid 17th century, comprising a mixture of working class housing, such as the little red cottages of which a few can still be seen in northeastern S\u00f6dermalm, and the summer houses and pavilions of wealthier families, such as [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s pavilion, which is now in the outdoor museum [[Skansen]]. During this time, it was also the location of perhaps the first theatre in Scandinavia, [[Bj\u00f6rng\u00e5rdsteatern]]. S\u00f6dermalm is often poetically named ''S\u00f6ders h\u00f6jder'' (\"heights of the south\"), which reflects its topography of sheer cliffs and rocky hills. Indeed, the hills of S\u00f6dermalm provide remarkable views of [[Stockholm]]'s skyline.\n\nIn the 18th century, the working-class cottages that clung to [[Mariaberget]], the steep cliffs facing [[Riddarfj\u00e4rden]], were replaced by the large buildings that are still present today. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century that urbanization grasped the entire width of S\u00f6dermalm, and even today parts of S\u00f6dermalm have a rural feeling to them, as for instance the landscape of tiny [[allotment (gardening)|allotments]] that climb the slopes of [[Eriksdal]].\n\nS\u00f6dermalm was once known as the \"slum\" area of Stockholm. However today, S\u00f6dermalm is known as the home of [[Bohemianism|bohemian]], [[alternative culture]] and a broad range of [[cultural amenities]]. Meanwhile, the growing demand for housing, as well as an increasing [[gentrification]] of Stockholm's central parts, makes apartments in S\u00f6dermalm more and more difficult or expensive to come by.
