Hansen''''' (born March 12, 1954) is an American [[novelist]] and [[professor]] from [[Wisconsin]], now living in [[Stillwater, Minnesota]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHansen was born in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] and lived in [[Illinois]] from the age of 10 to 25. He earned a BA in Political Science (with a minor in English and Anthropology) in 1976, and an MA in English in 1980; both from the University of Illinois. In 1993 he completed a [[Ph.D]] in English at the University of Minnesota with a focus on [[Technical Communication]]. During the years between his MA and Ph.D, he worked in the computer industry in a variety of technical and managerial positions.\n\n===Career===\nHansen has published several academic articles and a few short stories, but ''The Skeleton Train'' is his first novel. Published in 2010 by [[Sky Blue Waters Press]], ''The Skeleton Train'' tells the story of Jason Audley; what many have referred to as a modern-day [[Huckleberry Finn]]. Jason narrates a story that begins when he is fourteen in an industrial Illinois town. The story includes his closest friend, Davey, and a young woman they encounter while hopping [[Rail freight transport|freight trains]] called The Pheadra.<ref name=\"Sky\">\n{{cite web\n |url        =http://www.skybluewaterspress.com/skeleton-train/\n |title        =Skeleton Train\n |last        =Sky Blue Waters Press\n |website        =skybluewaterspress.com\n |accessdate        =July 18, 2013\n |url-status        =dead\n |archiveurl        =https://web.archive.org/web/20131101071202/http://www.skybluewaterspress.com/skeleton-train/\n |archivedate        =November 1, 2013\n }}</ref>\n\nHansen's second novel, ''Winter Lake'', published in 2012, is a sequel to ''The Skeleton Train'' and picks up Jason's life in northern Wisconsin seven years later.
