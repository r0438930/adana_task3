The programme, a mixture of action/adventure and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]], involved a team of independent crime-fighting technology experts, who faced a variety of threats involving computers and other modern technology. It was originally broadcast on Saturday evenings on [[BBC One]], and was produced for the BBC by the independent production company [[Carnival Films]]. In July 2014, [[London Live (TV channel)|London Live]], a local digital terrestrial station in London, began airing a complete re-run from Series 1.\n\n==Overview==\nThe series was devised by Carnival boss [[Brian Eastman]] and producer Stuart Doughty with input from veteran writer-producer [[Brian Clemens]], who had previously worked on ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. Clemens described ''Bugs'' as \"an ''Avengers'' for the 1990s\". Other notable series writers included [[Colin Brake]] and [[Stephen Gallagher]]. Two episodes (\"Bugged Wheat\" and \"Hollow Man\"), were written by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], who went on to create the series ''[[Smallville]]''. The theme tune was written by [[Gavin Greenaway]].\nThe programme was a mixture of action/adventure and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]], with a reliance on fast-paced plots, technical gadgetry, stunts and explosions. Much of the programme's filming took place around the [[London Docklands]] area, which had recently been redeveloped with projects such as [[Canary Wharf]]. This was intended to give a modern, and perhaps even slightly futuristic, feel to locations of the episodes. The production was originally based at two warehouses of Blackwall Basin, on the [[Isle of Dogs]] in London. After the [[1996 Docklands bombing|IRA bombing of the South Quay Plaza]], the crew had to travel further to find intact buildings for exterior locations.<ref>[[SFX Magazine]], May 1996, p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe plot of the programme involved a team of specialist independent crime-fighting technology experts, who faced a variety of threats involving computers and other modern technology. The main trio of regulars were Nick Beckett ([[Jesse Birdsall]]), Ros Henderson ([[Jaye Griffiths]]) and Ed ([[Craig McLachlan]] in series one to three, [[Steven Houghton]] in series four). Initially an independent team, they began working alongside the government agency 'Bureau of Weapons Technology' in series two and from series three, with the original Bureau decimated, they came under the authority of the newly created Bureau 2, whose head was codenamed Jan ([[Jan Harvey]]) (her real first name was revealed to be Barbara, but her surname was never given) and her secretary, Alex Jordan (Paula Hunt).\nThe series evolved, as a result, from a series of relatively unconnected one-off episodes to an overarching 'soap opera' complete with office romances. There has been controversy over Ed's surname - because he was never called anything other than \"Ed\", some people have taken his surname to be Russell, simply because he was addressed as \"Dr Russell\" in one episode. However, that was more likely a pseudonym, as both Ros and Beckett used plenty of false names throughout the series.\n\nThe programme came close to cancellation at the conclusion of its third series, but due to an exciting cliffhanger ending deliberately included by the production team, and strong foreign sales, a fourth was commissioned. The final series suffered from being moved to an earlier timeslot on Saturday evenings, and for only having the first eight of its produced ten episodes scheduled for broadcast.<ref>Original announcement of BUGs series four's eight episode run on the Official BUGs website {{cite web |url=http://www.bugs.co.uk/s4news.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505003804/http://www.bugs.co.uk/s4news.html |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> Coupled with the [[Omagh Bombing]] forcing the [[BBC]] to postpone the series for a week, this meant that the concluding three episodes would not be broadcast until a year later. Another attempt to save the show by giving the series a cliffhanger ending was not successful, and the ending of the final episode &mdash; where Alex has just married boyfriend Adam, only to have him killed at the wedding and Ros and Beckett are abducted by an attacker unseen by the audience but recognised by Beckett &mdash; was never resolved.\n\nThe series has something of a minor cult following in the UK, not least for glaring production faults - for example in the first episode the cast are quite clearly stepping onto pre-chalked outlines to aid what was presumably a necessarily short external shot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\nOverall 40 episodes were produced, ten in each of the four series. [[Virgin Publishing]] produced novelizations of the episodes of the first series, but these were not successful and subsequent episodes were not novelised. As of 2005, the series is available on [[DVD]] in series-by-series box set form, released by [[Revelation Films]]. A complete box set collection of all four series is also available.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jaye Griffiths]] as Rosalyn \"Ros\" Henderson\n* [[Jesse Birdsall]] as Nicholas Beckett\n* [[Craig McLachlan]] as Ed (Series 1\u20143)\n* [[Jan Harvey]] as Jan (Series 3\u20144)\n* Paula Hunt as Alex Jordan (Series 3\u20144)\n* Martin McDougall as Lacombe (Series 1\u20142)\n* [[Steven Houghton]] as Ed Russell (Series 4)\n* Gareth Marks as Jean-Daniel Marcel (Series 1\u20142)\n* [[Michael Grandage]] as Channing Hardy (Series 3\u20144)\n* [[Joseph May]] as Adam Mosby (Series 4)\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series 1 (1995)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF;\"\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 1\n | Title= Out of the Hive\n | Aux1= Duncan Gould\n | Aux2= Brian Farnham\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|1|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= Helicopter pilot Ed, electronics expert Ros Henderson and government agent Nick Beckett find themselves working together in an attempt to prevent the theft of a powerful satellite device from a government agency.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 2\n | Title= Assassins Inc.\n | Aux1= Stephen Gallagher\n | Aux2= Ken Grieve\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|8|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= When Ed, Ros and Beckett set out on a mission to bring down hi-tech weapons dealer Irene Campbell, she targets the team with her latest and most lethal technology.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 3\n | Title= All Under Control\n | Aux1= Duncan Gould\n | Aux2= Brian Farnham\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|15|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= When a passenger aircraft is hijacked by remote control, the Gizmos team is called in to investigate the plane's state-of-the-art navigation system.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 4\n | Title= Down Among the Dead Men\n | Aux1= Stephen Gallagher\n | Aux2= Ken Grieve \n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|22|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= Hired to investigate the link between the theft of ship components and the former employee of a large city bank, the Gizmos team encounter theft, murder, and a bank heist by submarine.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 5\n | Title= Shotgun Wedding\n | Aux1= Brian Clemens\n | Aux2= Ken Grieve\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|29|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= When the team's plan to protect Italian politician Anna Fabrizi from a lethal assassin goes horribly wrong, Ed is forced to go undercover and must make an impossible decision - kill Anna Fabrizi or die.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 6\n | Title= Stealth\n | Aux1= Stephen Gallagher\n | Aux2= Ken Grieve\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|5|6|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= When Gizmos are hired to provide security for the launch of a new sports car, they instead become caught up in the theft of a prototype nuclear-powered stealth tank, which could destroy the city if not recovered.\nNote: The next episode would be shown in two weeks time due to the BBC's live coverage of the [[1995 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest 1995]].<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/bf0cd00f5dc04cfcb76685e2d70545c6</ref>\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 7\n | Title= Manna from Heaven\n | Aux1= Gregory Evans\n | Aux2= Brian Farnham\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|5|20|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= Phodex is a revolutionary type of food which could end world famine.

The programme, a mixture of action/adventure and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]], involved a team of independent crime-fighting technology experts, who faced a variety of threats involving computers and other modern technology. It was originally broadcast on Saturday evenings on [[BBC One]], and was produced for the BBC by the independent production company [[Carnival Films]]. In July 2014, [[London Live (TV channel)|London Live]], a local digital terrestrial station in London, began airing a complete re-run from Series 1.\n\n==Overview==\nThe series was devised by Carnival boss [[Brian Eastman]] and producer Stuart Doughty with input from veteran writer-producer [[Brian Clemens]], who had previously worked on ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]''. Clemens described ''Bugs'' as \"an ''Avengers'' for the 1990s\". Other notable series writers included [[Colin Brake]] and [[Stephen Gallagher]]. Two episodes (\"Bugged Wheat\" and \"Hollow Man\"), were written by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]], who went on to create the series ''[[Smallville]]''. The theme tune was written by [[Gavin Greenaway]].\nThe programme was a mixture of action/adventure and [[Science fiction on television|science fiction]], with a reliance on fast-paced plots, technical gadgetry, stunts and explosions. Much of the programme's filming took place around the [[London Docklands]] area, which had recently been redeveloped with projects such as [[Canary Wharf]]. This was intended to give a modern, and perhaps even slightly futuristic, feel to locations of the episodes. The production was originally based at two warehouses of Blackwall Basin, on the [[Isle of Dogs]] in London. After the [[1996 Docklands bombing|IRA bombing of the South Quay Plaza]], the crew had to travel further to find intact buildings for exterior locations.<ref>[[SFX Magazine]], May 1996, p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe plot of the programme involved a team of specialist independent crime-fighting technology experts, who faced a variety of threats involving computers and other modern technology. The main trio of regulars were Nick Beckett ([[Jesse Birdsall]]), Ros Henderson ([[Jaye Griffiths]]) and Ed ([[Craig McLachlan]] in series one to three, [[Steven Houghton]] in series four). Initially an independent team, they began working alongside the government agency 'Bureau of Weapons Technology' in series two and from series three, with the original Bureau decimated, they came under the authority of the newly created Bureau 2, whose head was codenamed Jan ([[Jan Harvey]]) (her real first name was revealed to be Barbara, but her surname was never given) and her secretary, Alex Jordan (Paula Hunt).\nThe series evolved, as a result, from a series of relatively unconnected one-off episodes to an overarching 'soap opera' complete with office romances. There has been controversy over Ed's surname - because he was never called anything other than \"Ed\", some people have taken his surname to be Russell, simply because he was addressed as \"Dr Russell\" in one episode. However, that was more likely a pseudonym, as both Ros and Beckett used plenty of false names throughout the series.\n\nThe programme came close to cancellation at the conclusion of its third series, but due to an exciting cliffhanger ending deliberately included by the production team, and strong foreign sales, a fourth was commissioned. The final series suffered from being moved to an earlier timeslot on Saturday evenings, and for only having the first eight of its produced ten episodes scheduled for broadcast.<ref>Original announcement of BUGs series four's eight episode run on the Official BUGs website {{cite web |url=http://www.bugs.co.uk/s4news.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505003804/http://www.bugs.co.uk/s4news.html |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref> Coupled with the [[Omagh Bombing]] forcing the [[BBC]] to postpone the series for a week, this meant that the concluding three episodes would not be broadcast until a year later. Another attempt to save the show by giving the series a cliffhanger ending was not successful, and the ending of the final episode &mdash; where Alex has just married boyfriend Adam, only to have him killed at the wedding and Ros and Beckett are abducted by an attacker unseen by the audience but recognised by Beckett &mdash; was never resolved.\n\nThe series has something of a minor cult following in the UK, not least for glaring production faults - for example in the first episode the cast are quite clearly stepping onto pre-chalked outlines to aid what was presumably a necessarily short external shot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\nOverall 40 episodes were produced, ten in each of the four series. [[Virgin Publishing]] produced novelizations of the episodes of the first series, but these were not successful and subsequent episodes were not novelised. As of 2005, the series is available on [[DVD]] in series-by-series box set form, released by [[Revelation Films]]. A complete box set collection of all four series is also available.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jaye Griffiths]] as Rosalyn \"Ros\" Henderson\n* [[Jesse Birdsall]] as Nicholas Beckett\n* [[Craig McLachlan]] as Ed (Series 1\u20143)\n* [[Jan Harvey]] as Jan (Series 3\u20144)\n* Paula Hunt as Alex Jordan (Series 3\u20144)\n* Martin McDougall as Lacombe (Series 1\u20142)\n* [[Steven Houghton]] as Ed Russell (Series 4)\n* Gareth Marks as Jean-Daniel Marcel (Series 1\u20142)\n* [[Michael Grandage]] as Channing Hardy (Series 3\u20144)\n* [[Joseph May]] as Adam Mosby (Series 4)\n\n==Episodes==\n===Series 1 (1995)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF;\"\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#D48142;\"| Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 1\n | Title= Out of the Hive\n | Aux1= Duncan Gould\n | Aux2= Brian Farnham\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|1|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= Helicopter pilot Ed, electronics expert Ros Henderson and government agent Nick Beckett find themselves working together in an attempt to prevent the theft of a powerful satellite device from a government agency.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 2\n | Title= Assassins Inc.\n | Aux1= Stephen Gallagher\n | Aux2= Ken Grieve\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|8|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= When Ed, Ros and Beckett set out on a mission to bring down hi-tech weapons dealer Irene Campbell, she targets the team with her latest and most lethal technology.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 3\n | Title= All Under Control\n | Aux1= Duncan Gould\n | Aux2= Brian Farnham\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|15|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= When a passenger aircraft is hijacked by remote control, the Gizmos team is called in to investigate the plane's state-of-the-art navigation system.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 4\n | Title= Down Among the Dead Men\n | Aux1= Stephen Gallagher\n | Aux2= Ken Grieve \n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|22|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= Hired to investigate the link between the theft of ship components and the former employee of a large city bank, the Gizmos team encounter theft, murder, and a bank heist by submarine.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 5\n | Title= Shotgun Wedding\n | Aux1= Brian Clemens\n | Aux2= Ken Grieve\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|4|29|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= When the team's plan to protect Italian politician Anna Fabrizi from a lethal assassin goes horribly wrong, Ed is forced to go undercover and must make an impossible decision - kill Anna Fabrizi or die.\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 6\n | Title= Stealth\n | Aux1= Stephen Gallagher\n | Aux2= Ken Grieve\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|5|6|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= When Gizmos are hired to provide security for the launch of a new sports car, they instead become caught up in the theft of a prototype nuclear-powered stealth tank, which could destroy the city if not recovered.\nNote: The next episode would be shown in two weeks time due to the BBC's live coverage of the [[1995 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest 1995]].<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/bf0cd00f5dc04cfcb76685e2d70545c6</ref>\n | LineColor= D48142\n}}\n{{Episode list\n | EpisodeNumber= 7\n | Title= Manna from Heaven\n | Aux1= Gregory Evans\n | Aux2= Brian Farnham\n | OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|1995|5|20|df=yes}}\n | ShortSummary= Phodex is a revolutionary type of food which could end world famine.
