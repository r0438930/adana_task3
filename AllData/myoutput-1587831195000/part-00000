Under Sheikh Sharif's leadership, the [[Transitional Federal Government]] attempted driving out Al-Shabaab from the capital city and its surroundings, establishing security, peace and reconciliation through the difficult transitional period. \n\n==Early life and education==\nBorn on 25 July 1964 in [[Mahaday]] a town in the southern the Middle Shabelle region where he acquired the knowledge of the Islamic teachings, Arabic and the memorisation of the Qur'an as a child. Sheikh Sharif is from the [[Abgaal]] clan ( [[Abgaal|Cabdale Agoonyar]]) sub-clan of the [[Hawiye]] clan one of Somalia's four main clans, which dominates in the capital. He began his education at the Sheikh Sufi Institute, which was associated with [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Egypt]]. He studied at Libyan and Sudanese universities in the mid-1990s, where he earned a bachelor's degree in [[Law]] and Islamic [[Shariah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7865808.stm|title=Profile: Somalia's President Ahmed|publisher=BBC News|date=3 February 2009}}</ref> Thus, his religious upbringing and education allowed him to succeed his father as the spiritual leader of the Idriseeyah sect of [[Sunni]] Islam in Somalia.\n\nSheikh Sharif completed his fellowship in [[Boston University]] in January 2012.\n\n==Political career==\nSheikh Sharif departed for Somalia in 2000 at a time when Somalia was under the control of warlords and friends could not visit each other in Mogadishu due to clan separation and mistrust. The legacy of the civil war was apparent everywhere in Somalia and Sheikh Sharif had ambitions of saving his country and his people, a dream which no one could imagine could come true at the time. He established Al Shuruuq Agency, a cultural and heritage institution and the Federation of Adolescents in Mogadishu which facilitated social interaction for young Somalis who had never before crossed the boundaries formed by the warlords. As a result, the residents of Mogadishu began to cross the lines where friends, schoolmates, and elders can come together and express themselves in a positive way. Sheikh Sharif became a regional attorney of his home province, middle Shabelle, where he was elected chairman of a provincial court in Jowhar between 2001 and 2002.\n\n===Islamic Courts Union===\n{{Main|Islamic Courts Union}}\n\nArmed groups in the Somali capital who exploited the disintegration of the central government had been responsible for countless kidnappings and killings. The court was established through a campaign which Sheikh Ahmed led to secure the release of an abducted child. The court was successful in securing the release of the child and other abductees as well as looted vehicles. The court went on to suppress the violence of gangs and warlords which was prevalent throughout the capital. Subsequently, all five Islamic courts united and Sheikh Sharif was chosen to become the chair of the newly formed Islamic Courts Union.<ref name=\"SOMALIAS-MODERATE-ISLAMIST-LEADER\">\n{{cite news|title=Somalia's Moderate Islamist Leader|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5072268.stm|date=12 June 2006|accessdate=17 January 2007|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nHe was always seen as the moderate face of the Islamic Courts Union, who came from a long line of religious leaders and was elected as chairman. Somalia was already beginning to see swift political and economic changes under his first six months of leadership. Warlords and their influence were eliminated from the city with the help of the people's support which made it possible for the first time in sixteen years to re-open Mogadishu International Airport and the port.\n\nAt the time the Transitional Federal Government which was established in Mbagathi, Nairobi in 2004, was a fragile body which was divided and weak. The Ethiopian army invaded Somalia claiming that it was trying to help the Transitional Federal Government and overthrew the Islamic Court Union. Sheikh Sharif was detained by Kenyan police at the border between Kenya and Somalia in January 2007. He then met with the US Ambassador to Kenya for talks concerning cooperation with the Transitional Federal Government.

The legacy of the civil war was apparent everywhere in Somalia and Sheikh Sharif had ambitions of saving his country and his people, a dream which no one could imagine could come true at the time. He established Al Shuruuq Agency, a cultural and heritage institution and the Federation of Adolescents in Mogadishu which facilitated social interaction for young Somalis who had never before crossed the boundaries formed by the warlords. As a result, the residents of Mogadishu began to cross the lines where friends, schoolmates, and elders can come together and express themselves in a positive way. Sheikh Sharif became a regional attorney of his home province, middle Shabelle, where he was elected chairman of a provincial court in Jowhar between 2001 and 2002.\n\n===Islamic Courts Union===\n{{Main|Islamic Courts Union}}\n\nArmed groups in the Somali capital who exploited the disintegration of the central government had been responsible for countless kidnappings and killings. The court was established through a campaign which Sheikh Ahmed led to secure the release of an abducted child. The court was successful in securing the release of the child and other abductees as well as looted vehicles. The court went on to suppress the violence of gangs and warlords which was prevalent throughout the capital. Subsequently, all five Islamic courts united and Sheikh Sharif was chosen to become the chair of the newly formed Islamic Courts Union.<ref name=\"SOMALIAS-MODERATE-ISLAMIST-LEADER\">\n{{cite news|title=Somalia's Moderate Islamist Leader|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5072268.stm|date=12 June 2006|accessdate=17 January 2007|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nHe was always seen as the moderate face of the Islamic Courts Union, who came from a long line of religious leaders and was elected as chairman. Somalia was already beginning to see swift political and economic changes under his first six months of leadership. Warlords and their influence were eliminated from the city with the help of the people's support which made it possible for the first time in sixteen years to re-open Mogadishu International Airport and the port.\n\nAt the time the Transitional Federal Government which was established in Mbagathi, Nairobi in 2004, was a fragile body which was divided and weak. The Ethiopian army invaded Somalia claiming that it was trying to help the Transitional Federal Government and overthrew the Islamic Court Union. Sheikh Sharif was detained by Kenyan police at the border between Kenya and Somalia in January 2007. He then met with the US Ambassador to Kenya for talks concerning cooperation with the Transitional Federal Government.
