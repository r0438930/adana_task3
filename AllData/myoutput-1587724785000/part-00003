In July 1909, on only her second voyage, the ship, en route from [[Durban]] to [[Cape Town]], disappeared with 211 passengers and crew aboard. No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Design and construction==\nIn September 1907 W. Lund & Sons placed an order with [[Barclay Curle|Barclay, Curle & Co.]] of [[Glasgow]] for a new cargo and passenger vessel to be delivered within 12 months that was specially designed for their [[Blue Anchor Line]] trade between United Kingdom and Australia. The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W. Taverner, wife of the Agent-General of Victoria, being the sponsor.<ref name=miramar>{{csr|register=MSI|id=1125741|shipname=Waratah|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref><ref name=mar>{{cite news |title=Launches-Scotch. |date=1 October 1908 |newspaper=Marine Engineer & Naval Architect |page=92 |volume=XXXI }}</ref>\n\nThe ship was of the spar-deck type, and had three complete decks \u2013 lower, main and spar. The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day. At the time of construction, ''Waratah'' was not equipped with a radio, which was not unusual at the time.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=118|ps=}}\n\nThe sea trials were held on 23 October 1908 on the Firth of Clyde, during which the steamer was able to successfully maintain a mean speed of {{convert|15|kn|mph km/h}} over several runs on the measured mile.

The fire was largely brought under control by noon on the same day but continued reigniting until 10 December. The fire was apparently caused by the heat emitted by several reducing and steam valves located on the starboard side of the engine room. While the roof of the engine room was insulated, the starboard side was evidently not. The repairs were performed at Sydney to the chief engineer's satisfaction.\n\nDuring her maiden trip the steamer was scrutinized by the Captain and the crew, as one of the criteria used in acceptance trials was the ship's handling and stability. Captain Ilbery was not completely satisfied and, considering he was previously in charge of ''Geelong'', presumably reported to the owners that the ship did not have the same stability as his old vessel. He was especially concerned with the difficulty of properly loading the steamer to maintain her stability, which resulted in a heated exchange between the owners and the builders following the vessel's return to England.\n\nThe subsequent inquiry into her sinking raised some disputed reports of instability on this voyage.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77352720 |title=THE S.S.

Sawyer, an engineer and experienced sea traveller, left the ship and sent the following [[Telegram|cable]] to his wife in London: \"Thought Waratah top-heavy, landed Durban\". Sawyer later testified to the London inquiry that he had booked passage on ''Waratah'' through to Cape Town, but had decided to disembark at Durban, as he had been nervous about the behaviour of the ship during his voyage. He also claimed that he had been disturbed by visions he saw in dreams during the voyage of a man \"dressed in a very peculiar dress, which I had never seen before, with a long sword in his right hand, which he seemed to be holding between us. In the other hand he had a rag covered with blood.\" Sawyer claimed that he took these visions to be a warning to leave the ship at the earliest opportunity. In any event his decision to leave the ship at Durban saved his life.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=120|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n===Disappearance===\nThe ''Waratah'' left Durban at approximately 20:15 on 26 July with 211 passengers and crew. At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nAt around 17:30 on the 27th, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw the smoke of a steamer on the horizon, there was so much smoke that her captain wondered if the steamer was on fire. When darkness fell, the crew of the ''Harlow'' could see the steamer's running lights approaching, but still {{convert|10|to|12|mi|km}} behind them, when there were suddenly two bright flashes from the direction of the steamer and the lights vanished. The captain thought they were caused by explosions, but the mate of the ''Harlow'' who had also seen them, thought the flashes were brush fires on the shore (a common phenomenon in the area at that time of year). The captain agreed and did not even enter the events in the log \u2013 only when he learnt of the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' did he think the events significant.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}} Reportedly the ''Harlow'' was {{convert|180|mi|km}} from Durban.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189442/the_new_york_times/ |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 September 1909 |page=6 |title=Saw Steamer Blow Up. |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |date=24 September 1909 |title=The Loss of the Waratah. |page=12 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24189605/the_times/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=1 October 2018}}{{free access}}</ref>\n\nThat same evening at around 21:30 the [[Union-Castle Line]]r ''Guelph'', heading north to Durban from the Cape of Good Hope, passed a ship and exchanged [[International Code of Signals|signals]] by [[Signal lamp|lamp]], but because of the bad weather and poor visibility was able to identify only the last three letters of her name as \"T-A-H.\"{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=122, 138|ps=}}\n\nAnother possible sighting, which was not disclosed to the Inquiry at the time, was by Edward Joe Conquer, a [[Cape Mounted Riflemen|Cape Mounted Rifleman]] who on 28 July 1909, was posted to carry out military exercises on the banks of the mouth of the [[Xora River]] along with Signaller H.Adshead. He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

No trace of the ship has ever been found.\n\n==Search efforts==\n===Contemporary searches===\nInitially, the non-appearance of the ship did not cause alarm as it was not uncommon for ships to arrive at port days, or occasionally even weeks overdue. As ''Waratah'' was considered unsinkable, it was at first thought likely that she had been delayed by a breakdown or mechanical fault, and was still adrift. Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

It quickly came to focus on the supposed instability of the ''Waratah''.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=129|ps=}} Evidence was greatly hampered by the lack of any survivors from the ship's final voyage (other than the small number, including Claude Sawyer, who had disembarked in [[Durban]]). Most evidence came from passengers and crew from ''Waratah's'' maiden voyage, her builders and those who had handled her in port.\n\nThe expert witnesses all agreed that the ''Waratah'' was designed and built properly and sailed in good condition.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=130|ps=}} She had passed numerous inspections, including those by her builders, her owners, the Board of Trade and two by [[Lloyd's of London]], who gave her the classification \"+100 A1\"&nbsp;\u2013 their top rating,{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=118, 130|ps=}} granted only to ships Lloyds had inspected and assessed throughout the design, construction, fitting out and [[sea trial]]s, on top of the two valuations and inspections Lloyds had made of the completed ''Waratah''.\n\nHowever many witnesses who had travelled on the ship testified that the ''Waratah'' felt unstable, frequently [[Angle of list|listed]] to one side even in calm conditions, [[Ship motions|rolled]] excessively, and was very slow to come upright after leaning into a swell, and had a tendency for her [[bow (ship)|bow]] to dip into oncoming waves rather than ride over them.<ref name=\"NLA14/9/09\"/><ref name=\"NLAInqreport\">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

This passenger, physicist Professor [[William Henry Bragg|William Bragg]], concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. When slowly rolled over towards one side, she reached a point of equilibrium and would stay leaning over until a shift in the sea or wind pushed her upright.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=131|ps=}}<ref name=\"NLAInqreport\"/>\n\nOther passengers and crew members commented on her lack of stability, and those responsible for handling the ship in port said she was so unstable when unladen that she could not be moved without [[Ballast tank|ballast]].{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=130, 140|ps=}} But for every witness of this opinion, another could be found who said the opposite. Both former passengers and crew members (ranking from stokers to a deck officer) said the ''Waratah'' was perfectly stable, with a comfortable, easy roll.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=133|ps=}} Many said they felt she was especially stable.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5153599 |title=THE S.S.

It did not blame the Blue Anchor Line, but did make several negative comments in regard to the company's practices in determining the performance and seaworthiness of its new ships.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=141|ps=}} Correspondence between Captain Ilbery and the line's managers show he commented on numerous details about the ship's fixtures, fittings, cabins, public rooms, ventilation and other areas, but failed to make any mention at the basic level of the ''Waratah's'' seaworthiness and handling. Equally, the company never asked Captain Ilbery about these areas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=139\u2013141|ps=}} This led some to speculate that Ilbery had concerns about the ''Waratah'' and its stability, but deliberately kept such doubts quiet. However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.

The owners wanted the ship to be an improved version of their existing steamer {{SS|Geelong||6}} and therefore most specifications were based upon those of ''Geelong''. The vessel was laid down at Barclay, Curle & Co's Clydeholm Yard in Whiteinch and launched on 12 September 1908 (yard number 472), with Mrs J. W.

The first-class accommodations were built on the promenade, bridge and boat decks and could house 128 passengers. In addition, a nursery was provided on the ship for first-class passenger's convenience. The vessel also had third-class passenger accommodations constructed on the poop deck that could house upward of 300 people, but was certified for only 160. ''Waratah'' was constructed for both speed and luxury, and had eight [[state room]]s and a salon whose panels depicted its namesake flower, as well as a luxurious music lounge complete with a minstrel's gallery. With an intent of being also an emigrant ship, her cargo holds would be converted into large dormitories capable of holding almost 700 [[steerage]] passengers on the outward journeys, while on the return the steamer would be laden with general cargo, mainly frozen meat, dairy products, wool and metal ore from Australia. In order to be able to carry frozen produce, her entire front end was fitted with refrigerating machinery and cold chambers. She also had Kirkcaldy's distilling apparatus installed on board capable of producing {{convert|5500|impgal|l|abbr=in}} of fresh water a day.

At around 04:00 on 27 July she was spotted astern on the starboard side by the [[Clan Line]] steamer ''Clan MacIntyre'', As ''Waratah'' was a faster ship she drew level with ''Clan MacIntyre'' by about 06:00, at which point both vessels communicated by [[signal lamp]], and exchanged customary information about the name and destination of their respective ships. ''Waratah'' going approximately 13 knots, then overtook ''Clan MacIntyre'', at a location abeam of the [[Bashee River]] and remained in sight, speeding gradually away from ''Clan MacIntyre'' until she disappeared over the horizon by about 09:30. This was the final confirmed sighting of ''Waratah''. Later that day, the weather deteriorated quickly (as is common in that area), with increasing wind and rough seas. On 28 July a [[hurricane]] sprang up in the area, so bad that the captain of the ''Clan MacIntyre'' said it was the worst weather he had experienced at sea in his 13 years as a seaman, with winds of exceptional strength causing tremendous seas.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}} \n\nThere were several further unconfirmed sightings:{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=120-123|ps=}}   \n[[File:SS 'Waratah' at Port Adelaide, 1909.jpeg|thumb|The ''Waratah'' at [[Port Adelaide]] just before her last voyage.]]\nAt around 17:30 on the 27th, a ship called the ''Harlow'' saw the smoke of a steamer on the horizon, there was so much smoke that her captain wondered if the steamer was on fire.

He recorded in his diary that he and Adshead had observed through a telescope a steamship which matched the description of the ''Waratah'', which appeared to be struggling slowly against heavy seas in a south-westerly direction. Conquer observed the ship roll heavily to [[starboard]], and then before it was able to right itself, a following wave rolled over the ship, which then disappeared from view, leading Conquer to believe it had gone under. He reported his sightings to his base camp and to his Orderly Sergeant, who apparently did not take the matter seriously.

Fears started to grow for her safety, when ships which had left Durban after ''Waratah'' and had travelled on a similar course began arriving at Cape Town, and reported having seen no sign of her en route. The first search effort was launched on 1 August, when the [[tugboat]] ''T.E. Fuller'' was sent out to look for any sign of the ship, but was forced to turn back after encountering dreadful weather. She later returned to search along the coast.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|p=51|ps=}} The Royal Navy deployed cruisers {{HMS|Pandora|1900|6}} and [[HMS Forte (1893)|HMS ''Forte'']] (and later {{HMS|Hermes|1898|6}}) to search for the ''Waratah''.

However, it is also possible that neither he nor the Blue Anchor Line felt it necessary to cover such areas, because the ''Waratah'' was heavily based on a previous (and highly successful) Blue Anchor ship, the ''[[Geelong (ship)|Geelong]]'', and so the ''Waratah's'' handling was assumed to be the same.\n\nIt is certainly true that many passenger ships of the period were made slightly top-heavy. This produced a long, comfortable but unstable roll, which many passengers preferred to a short, jarring but stable roll. Many trans-Atlantic liners were designed this way, and after a few voyages those operating them learnt how to load, ballast and handle them correctly and the ships completed decades of trouble-free service. It may have been the ''Waratah's'' misfortune to encounter an unusually heavy storm or freak wave on only her second voyage, before she could be trimmed correctly. This slightly top-heavy design could also account for the strongly opposed opinions of witnesses about whether or not the ship felt stable. An inexperienced or uninformed person on the ship might conclude that the long, slow, soft roll of the ship felt comfortable and safe, whilst someone with more seagoing experience or a knowledge of ship design would have felt that the same motion was unstable. In regards to the witnesses claiming the ''Waratah's'' instability in port when unladen, this may have been true. However, virtually all ocean-going ships (which are, after all, designed to carry a large weight of cargo) need to be ballasted to some extent when moved unladen, so the ''Waratah'' was certainly not unique in this respect. The witnesses would have been well aware of this&nbsp;\u2013 that they still came forward to attest that they regarded the ''Waratah'' as dangerously unstable in these conditions does suggest that the ship was exceptional in some respect.\n\nThe ''Waratah'' was also a mixed-use ship. Passenger liners, with a small cargo volume relative to their gross tonnage had fairly constant and predictable ballasting requirements. A ship like the ''Waratah'' would carry a wide range of cargoes, and even different cargoes on the same voyage, making the matter of ballasting both more complex and more crucial.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=146|ps=}} When she disappeared, the ''Waratah'' was carrying a cargo of 1,000 tons of [[lead]] concentrate, which may have suddenly shifted, causing the ship to capsize.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=|ps=}}\n\nThe inquiry concluded that the three ships reporting potential sightings of the ''Waratah'' on the evening of 26 July could not all have seen her given the distance between them and the time of the sightings, unless the ''Waratah'' had reached [[Mbashe River]] and exchanged signals with the ''Clan MacIntyre'' but then turned around and headed back to Durban, to be sighted by the ''Harlow''.\n\n==Theories to explain the disappearance==\n[[File:SS Waratah colour postcard.jpg|thumb|Artists impression of ''Waratah'' at sea.]]\nTheories which have been put forward to explain the disappearance include:\n\n===Freak wave===\nA theory advanced to explain the disappearance of the ''Waratah'' is an encounter with a freak wave, also known as a [[rogue wave]], in the ocean off the South African coast.<ref name=\"Econ1\">{{cite news | title = Monsters of the deep \u2013 Huge, freak waves may not be as rare as once thought | publisher = Economist Magazine | date = 17 September 2009 | url = http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14446734 | accessdate = 2009-10-04 }}</ref> Such waves are known to be common in that area of the ocean. It is most likely that the ''Waratah'', with what seems to be marginal stability and already ploughing through a severe storm, was hit by a giant wave. This either rolled the ship over outright or stove in her cargo hatches, filling the holds with water and pulling the ship down almost instantly. If the ship capsized or rolled over completely, any buoyant debris would be trapped under the wreck, explaining the lack of any bodies or wreckage in the area.  This theory was given credibility through a paper by Professor Mallory of the University of Cape Town (1973) which suggested that waves of up to 20 metres (66 feet) in height did occur between [[Richards Bay]] and [[Cape Agulhas]]. This theory also stands up if the ''Waratah'' is assumed to have been stable and seaworthy \u2013 several ships around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] have been severely damaged and nearly sunk by freak waves flooding their holds. Throughout the world ships such as ''[[Melanie Schulte]]'' (a German ship lost in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]) {{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=149|ps=}} and [[MV Derbyshire|MV ''Derbyshire'']] (a British [[bulk carrier]] sunk in the [[Pacific Ocean]]) have suddenly broken up and sunk within minutes in extreme weather.\n\nSome have also suggested that instead of sinking, the ship was incapacitated by a freak wave and, having lost her rudder and without any means of contacting land, was swept southwards towards [[Antarctica]] to either be lost in the open ocean or founder on Antarctica itself.  No evidence except the absence of the wreck supports this theory, however.\n\n===Cargo shift===\nThe ''Waratah'' was carrying in her cargo holds around 1,000 tons of [[lead]] and 300 tons of lead [[ore concentrate]], which is known under certain circumstances to liquefy due to the motion of the ship. This can affect the stability of the ship due to the [[free surface effect]], potentially causing it to [[capsize]]. Today ore concentrates are treated as a hazardous cargo, with special measures required for its transport in ships; however, in 1909 there was little awareness about the dangers of carrying this cargo.{{sfnp|Smith|2009|pp=46,161|ps=}}<ref>{{cite web |title=CARGO LIQUEFACTION AND DANGERS TO SHIPS |url=https://www.ifsma.org/resources/Cargo-Liquefaction.pdf |publisher=International Federation of Shipmasters' Associations |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Whirlpool===\nBoth at the time of the disappearance and since, several people have suggested that the ''Waratah'' was caught in a [[whirlpool]] created by a combination of winds, currents and a deep [[ocean trench]], several of which are known to be off the southeast coast of Africa. This would explain the lack of wreckage, but there is no firm evidence that a whirlpool of sufficient strength to almost instantly suck down a {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} ocean liner could be created as suggested.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|pp=147\u201349|ps=}}\n\n===Explosion===\nGiven the evidence from the officers of the ''Harlow'' (see above), it has been speculated that the ''Waratah'' was destroyed by a sudden explosion in one of her coal bunkers. Coal dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the ''Waratah'' to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.{{sfnp|Harris|1989|p=48|ps=}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe ''Waratah's'' disappearance, the inquiry and the criticism of the Blue Anchor Line generated much negative publicity. The line's ticket sales dropped severely and, coupled with the huge financial loss taken in the construction of the ''Waratah'' (which, like many ships of the time, was [[insurance|under-insured]]), forced the company to sell its other ships to its main competitor [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] and declare voluntary [[liquidation]] in 1910.<ref>[http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm Blue Anchor Line] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043213/http://www.theshipslist.com/ships/lines/blueanchor.htm |date=12 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1913, a Brisbane newspaper, ''[[Daily Mail (Brisbane)|The Daily Mail]]'', suspected its competitor ''[[The Daily Standard (Brisbane)|The Daily Standard]]'' was copying its news stories.
