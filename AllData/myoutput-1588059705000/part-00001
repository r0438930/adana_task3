He photographed his friends and family at play \u2013 running and jumping; racing home-built race cars; making kites, gliders as well as aeroplanes; and climbing the Eiffel Tower. He also photographed sport events, such as the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing|Coupe Gordon Bennett]] and the [[French Grand Prix]], early flights of aviation pioneers such as [[Gabriel Voisin]], [[Louis Bl\u00e9riot]], [[Hubert Latham]], [[Louis Paulhan]] and [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]]. He also captured in his camera, tennis players such as [[Suzanne Lenglen]] at the French Open tennis championships.  Many of his initial, famous photographs were originally captured through [[stereoscopy|stereo]], but he also produced a vast number of images in all formats and media including glass plates in various sizes, [[autochrome]]s, and film.\n\nWhile he sold a few photographs to sporting magazines such as ''La Vie au Grand Air'', in middle age he concentrated on painting which also was his source of income and living. However, he continued taking photographs and maintained written journals about them throughout his life. At age of 69 his boyhood photographs were 'discovered' by Charles Rado of the [[Rapho (agency)|Rapho]] agency who introduced Lartigue to [[John Szarkowski]], curator of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], who arranged an exhibition of his work at the museum. [[Life magazine]] published the photos in 1963.\n\nThis exhibition gained him fame and exposure to the industry. He then got opportunities to work with several fashion magazines and became famous in other countries as well. In 1974, he was commissioned by the newly elected President of France [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] to shoot his official portrait. The result was a simple photo, simply lit, using the national flag as a background. He was rewarded with his first French retrospective at the [[Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris|Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]] the following year, which paved the way for more commissions from fashion and decoration magazines.\n\nAlthough best known as a photographer, Lartigue was also a good painter. He often showed up in the official salons in Paris and in the south of France from 1922. He was friends with a wide selection of literary and artistic celebrities including the playwright [[Sacha Guitry]], the singer [[Yvonne Printemps]], the painters [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and the artist-playwright-filmmaker [[Jean Cocteau]]. He also worked on the sets of the film-makers [[Jacques Feyder]], [[Abel Gance]], [[Robert Bresson]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] and [[Federico Fellini]], and many of these celebrities became the subject of his photographs. Lartigue, however, photographed everyone he came in contact with. His most frequent muses were his three wives, and his mistress of the early 1930s, the Romanian model Ren\u00e9e Perle.\n\nHis first book, ''Diary of a Century'' was published in collaboration with [[Richard Avedon]]. The book was mentioned at the Rencontres d'Arles Book Award in 1971.  The next year he was elected as the festival's guest of honor. He continued taking photographs throughout the last three decades of his life, finally achieving commercial success. An evening screening was presented by Michel Tournier: \"Jacques-Henri Lartigue & Jeanloup Sieff.\"\n\nIn 1974, his work was included in the group exhibition  \"Filleuls et parrains.\" In 1984, the movie \"Lartigue, ann\u00e9e 90,\" by Fran\u00e7ois Reichenbach was released. At the same time his work \"Les 6 x 13 de Jacques-Henri Lartigue\" was exhibited in the festival. One of the evenings screening was \"J.-H. Lartigue, l'amateur de r\u00eave\" by Patrick Roegiers, in 1994, and a last exhibition was presented: \"Lartigue a cent ans.\"\n\n== Award ==\n* 1984: The Cultural Award from the [[German Society for Photography]] (DGPh)<ref>\"[http://www.dgph.de/english/the-cultural-award-of-the-deutsche-gesellschaft-fuer-photographie The Cultural Award of the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Photographie (DGPh)]\".
