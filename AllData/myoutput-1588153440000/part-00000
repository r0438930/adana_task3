This fort was under control of [[Alauddin Khalji]] and later under the Faruki. In 1601 the Khandesh Suba was in the hands of Moghuls, this fort was handed over to Ramajipant of Bhadgaon in return of the victory over Ashirigad. The Bakhar records depict this fort to be under the control of [[Shivaji]] Maharaj. In 1752 under the Treaty of Bhalki, this fort was surrendered by Nizam to [[Peshwa]]. In 1762 [[Madhavrao Peshwa]] handed over this fort to Vitthal Shivdev for yearly revenue of Rupees ten thousand for the fort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trekshitiz.com/trekshitiz/Ei/Rajdeher-Trek-R-Alpha.html|title=Rajdeher, Western Ghats, Sahyadri, Adventure, Trekking|website=trekshitiz.com}}</ref> In 1764 the Pawar brothers of [[Chalisgaon]] revolted against Peshwa, which was crushed by Bajirao-II by sending Vittalrao Vinchurkar to capture [[Chalisgaon]], the Rajdeher fort was also brought under the control of Peshwas. On 15 April 1818 this fort was won by Col. Prother of [[British forces]], after a fierce battle with Nikam Deshmukh.\n\n==How to reach==\nThe nearest town is [[Chandwad]] which is 66&nbsp;km from [[Nashik]]. The base village of the fort is Rajdeherwadi which is 11&nbsp;km from Chandwad. There are good hotels at Chandwad. The trekking path starts from the hillock west of the Rajdeherwadi. The route is very safe and wide. There are no trees on the trekking route. It takes about two hours to reach the entrance gate of the fort. The path is marked with limestone markings. The trek path is very clearly seen from the base village. The night stay on the fort can be made in the caves on the fort, however, the stay at the temple in the base village is a routine night stay halt for the trekkers. The villagers from the local village make night stay and food arrangements at a reasonable cost.\n\n==Places to see==\nThere is a single gate on the main entrance path of the fort. The main entrance gate has an inscription in farsi. There is a rock cut water cistern on the fort. The water is available round the year for drinking purpose. It takes about one hour to visit the fort top.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Rajdher 1.jpg|Climb to the entrance of fort\nFile:Rajdher2.jpg|Rockcut underground Water cistern\nFile:Rajdher3.jpg|Top of the fort\nFile:Rajdher4.jpg|The rock cut steps\nFile:Rajdher5.jpg|The trek path\nFile:Rajdher6.jpg|water cistern\nFile:Rajdher7.jpg|Inscription in farsi\n</gallery>\n\n'''{{Coord|20|23|11.9|N|74|11|40|E|display=title}}Nearest Villages'''\n\nRajdher wadi\n\nKapshi\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Rajdher Fort}}\n* [[List of forts in Maharashtra]]\n* [[List of forts in India]]\n* [[Baji Rao II]]\n* [[Marathi people|Marathi People]]\n* [[Maratha Navy]]\n* [[List of Maratha dynasties and states]]\n* [[Maratha War of Independence]]\n* [[Battles involving the Maratha Empire]]\n* [[Maratha Army]]\n* [[Maratha titles]]\n* [[Military history of India]]\n* [[List of people involved in the Maratha Empire]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Forts in Maharashtra}}\n{{MarathaEmpire}}\n\n{{Adventure travel}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures of the Maratha Empire]]\n[[Category:Forts in Nashik district]]\n[[Category:16th-century forts in India]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Maharashtra]]\n[[Category:Hiking trails in India]]\n[[Category:Backpacking|*]]\n[[Category:Hiking]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox Military Structure\n|name =  Rajdeher Fort\n|native_name   = \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0927\u0947\u0930 \u0915\u093f\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093e/\u0922\u0947\u0930\u0940 \n|partof = Ajintha Satmal Hill Range\n|location = [[Nashik district]], [[Maharashtra]]\n|image = [[File:Rajdher Fort.jpg|300px]]\n|caption = Rajdher fort from Rajdherwadi\n|map_type=India Maharashtra\n|map_size = 300\n|map_caption = Shown within [[Maharashtra]]\n|type = Hill fort\n|coordinates = {{coord|20|23|11.9|N|74|11|40|E}}\n|materials = Stone\n|height = 4410 Ft.\n|used = \n|condition = Ruins \n|ownership = Government of India\n|open_to_public = Yes\n}}\n\n'''Rajdeher Fort ''' is a fort located 10&nbsp;km from [[chandwad]], [[Nashik district]], of [[Maharashtra]].
