He later entered federal politics and served as a [[Australian Senate|Senator]] for [[South Australia]] from 1901 to 1903. He was the first of four Australian politicians from the [[Downer family]] dynasty.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in [[Adelaide]], John Downer (the son of [[Downer family|Henry Downer]] who came to [[South Australia]] in 1838 and his wife Jane, ''n\u00e9e'' Field) was educated on a scholarship at [[St Peter's College, Adelaide]], where he was a brilliant student.<ref>Downer, Alick (2012). ''The Downers of South Australia'', p. 35. Wakefield Press, Adelaide. {{ISBN|9781743051993}}</ref> On 23 March 1867 he was admitted to the bar, and soon won a reputation as being among Adelaide's most talented and eloquent lawyers.\n\n==South Australian politician==\n[[File:John Downer (Australian politician).jpg|thumb|right|Downer in 1898]]\nDowner became a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1878, the same year in which he was elected to the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] for [[Barossa Valley|Barossa]]. He represented this constituency until 1901, leaving it only to enter federal politics.\n\nIn the House of Assembly he soon made his mark and became [[Attorney-General of South Australia|Attorney-General]] in [[John Cox Bray]]'s cabinet on 24 June 1881. He endeavoured to bring in several law reforms, and though his married women's property bill was not passed, he succeeded in carrying bills allowing accused persons to give evidence on oath, and amending the insolvency and marriage acts. The government was defeated in June 1884, but a year later, on 16 June 1885, Downer himself became Premier for the first time, as well as being Attorney-General once again.\n\nWhile Premier, Downer oversaw the construction of the first train line from Adelaide to Melbourne. He also made significant contributions to establishing irrigation settlements along the Murray River. Although this ministry lasted two years and passed a fair amount of legislation, it was often in difficulties, and in June 1886 had to be reconstructed.\n\nAt the [[1887 Colonial Conference|Colonial Conference]] held in London during 1887, Downer represented South Australia, but during his return journey to Australia his government was defeated. This ministry was responsible for a tariff imposing increased protective duties. Downer was not in office again for several years, but in October 1892 again became Premier, taking also the portfolio of Chief Secretary. In May 1893 he exchanged this for the position of [[Treasurer of South Australia]], but was ousted at the [[1893 South Australian colonial election|1893 election]] by liberal [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] [[Charles Kingston|Kingston]] with the support of the new [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor Party]] led by [[John McPherson (Australian politician)|John McPherson]]. Downer remarked of this party: 'They are very clever fellows. I have great respect for the way they use either side for their purposes with absolute impartiality'. For most of the period until 1899 Downer led the Opposition.\n\nDowner was a strong federalist and had represented South Australia at the 1883 and 1891 [[Federation of Australia|conventions]]. At the latter meeting, he took an important part in protecting the interests of the smaller states, and was a member of the constitutional committee. He was elected one of the 10 representatives of South Australia at the 1897 convention, and was again on the constitutional committee.\n\n==Federal politician and return to state politics==\nAt the time of Federation in 1901, Downer was elected as one of the inaugural [[Senate of Australia|senators]] for the [[Protectionist Party]] in [[South Australia]] at the first [[Parliament of Australia]], but he did not seek re-election in 1903. He entered the [[South Australian Legislative Council]] as a [[National Defence League]] ([[Liberal Union (South Australia)|Liberal Union]] from 1910) representative of the southern district in 1905, and continued to be re-elected until his death on 2 August 1915.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article59414161 |title=Family Notices |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)]] |volume=LXXX |issue=21,446 |location=South Australia |date=5 August 1915 |accessdate=7 June 2016 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Character==\n[[Alfred Deakin]] assessed Downer in the following terms: 'bull-headed, and rather thick-necked, \u2026 with the dogged set of the mouth of a prize fighter' and 'smallish eyes'. Downer was regarded a first-rate barrister, and some of his speeches to juries were singled out by contemporaries as laudable examples of forensic art. He was equally successful in parliamentary debate; one of his colleagues called him the best debater in a house that contained Charles Kingston, [[Frederick Holder]], [[John Cockburn (Australian politician)|John Cockburn]], and [[John Jenkins (Australian politician)|John Jenkins]].\n\nIn politics Downer tended to be conservative without being obstinate. He described himself as a [[Tory]], and partly on account of this he often found himself in a minority during his later years in parliament.
