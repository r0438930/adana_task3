Bergtheil saw the potential of European settlement along the coast and approached the British colonial office for immigrants. When first the British and then the Bavarian governments rejected his plans, he turned to the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] for support. Thirty-five peasant families (about 188 people) from the [[Osnabr\u00fcck]]-[[Bremen]] district accepted his offer and arrived in Natal on 23 March 1848. They were settled near Port Natal and called their new home ''Neu-Deutschland'' (New Germany).\n\nBergtheil's cotton scheme failed after the first two crops were ravaged by bollworm. Furthermore, the ginning machinery he had ordered from England never arrived. The settlers soon abandoned cotton in favour of market gardening, and when their five-year contracts with Bergtheil ended many did not renew them. The fledgling community may well have foundered within a generation since the immigrants did not maintain contact with Germany and had no vision of a distinctly German community.

He also taught Scripture in the little German school which the settlers had established. In 1852 the congregation was briefly moved to Emmaus because of famine on the coast and declining numbers of settlers.
