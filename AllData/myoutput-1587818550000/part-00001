Hoping to gain both plunder and a powerful [[vassal state]], Mongol leader [[Genghis Khan]] commanded some initial raids against Western Xia before launching a full-scale invasion in 1209. This marked both the first major invasion conducted by Genghis and the beginning of the [[Mongol invasion of China]]. Despite a major set-back during a nearly year-long siege of the capital, [[Yinchuan]], when the diverted river accidentally flooded their camp, the Mongols convinced Emperor [[Li Anquan]] to surrender in January 1210. For nearly a decade the Western Xia served the Mongols as vassals and aided them in the [[Mongol\u2013Jin War]], but when Genghis [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invaded]] the Islamic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] in 1219, Western Xia attempted to break away from the Empire and ally with the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]]. Angered by this betrayal, in 1225 Genghis Khan sent a second, [[punitive expedition]] into Western Xia. Genghis intended to annihilate the entire Western Xia culture, and his campaign systematically destroyed Western Xia cities and the countryside, culminating in the siege of the capital in 1227 along with forays into Jin territory. Near the end of the siege, in August 1227, Genghis Khan died from an uncertain cause, though some accounts say he was killed in action against Western Xia. After his death, Yinchuan fell to the Mongols and most of its population was massacred. The destruction of Western Xia during the second campaign was near total. According to [[John Man (author)|John Man]], Western Xia is little known to anyone other than experts in the field precisely because of Genghis Khan's policy calling for their complete eradication. He states that \"There is a case to be made that this was the first ever recorded example of attempted [[genocide]].

Cromwell invaded Ireland with his [[New Model Army]] on behalf of [[England]]'s [[Rump Parliament]] in August 1649. Following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], most of Ireland came under the control of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Catholic Confederation]]. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English [[Cavalier|Royalists]], who had been defeated by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]]. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country\u2014bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (or Eleven Years' War). However, [[guerrilla warfare]] continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] against [[Roman Catholics]] (the vast majority of the population) and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|confiscated large amounts of their land]]. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (1651\u20131660), this policy was enhanced with the passing of the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement of Ireland]] in 1652. Its goal was a further transfer of land from Irish to English hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The immediate war aims and the longer term policies of the English Parliamentarians resulted in an attempt by the English to transfer the native population to the western fringes to make way for Protestant settlers.

He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the [[Condrusi]] and [[Eburones]], who were both under the protection of the [[Treveri]] to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar's Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, where a horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp. The Usipetes and Tencteri were thrown into disarray and forced to flee, pursued by Caesar's cavalry, to the confluence of the Rhine and Meuse. Many were killed attempting to cross the rivers.<ref>[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[s:Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 4#1|4.1-15]]</ref><ref>Lee, K.H. \"Caesar's Encounter with the Usipetes and the Tencteri.\" ''Greece & Rome'' 2nd vol. 2 (1969): 100-103.</ref> They found refuge on the other side of the Rhine amongst the [[Sicambri]].

It was carried out by Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet state security and secret police, acting on behalf of Joseph Stalin. Within three days, Beria's NKVD used cattle trains to deport women, children, the elderly, even Communists and members of the Red Army, to the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, several thousand kilometres away.

Professor Lyman H. Legters argued that the Soviet penal system, combined with its resettlement policies, should count as genocidal since the sentences were borne most heavily specifically on certain ethnic groups, and that a relocation of these ethnic groups, whose survivial depends on ties to its particular homeland, \"had a genocidal effect remediable only by restoration of the group to its homeland\".{{sfn|Legters|1992|p=104}} Soviet dissidents Ilya Gabay{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=150}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]]{{sfn|Allworth|1998|p=216}} both classified the event as a genocide.

The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.</ref>-->\n<!--<ref name=Benz>{{cite book|author=Benz, Wolfgang|title=The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=0-231-11214-9|pp=152\u201353}}</ref>-->\n\n<ref name=Wheatcroft2001>{{cite book|last=Wheatcroft|first=Stephen G.|year=2001|chapter=Current knowledge of the level and nature of mortality in the Ukrainian famine of 1931\u20133|chapterurl=http://www.melgrosh.unimelb.edu.au/documents/SGW-UkranianFamine_mortality.pdf |editor=V.

Hoping to gain both plunder and a powerful [[vassal state]], Mongol leader [[Genghis Khan]] commanded some initial raids against Western Xia before launching a full-scale invasion in 1209. This marked both the first major invasion conducted by Genghis and the beginning of the [[Mongol invasion of China]]. Despite a major set-back during a nearly year-long siege of the capital, [[Yinchuan]], when the diverted river accidentally flooded their camp, the Mongols convinced Emperor [[Li Anquan]] to surrender in January 1210. For nearly a decade the Western Xia served the Mongols as vassals and aided them in the [[Mongol\u2013Jin War]], but when Genghis [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invaded]] the Islamic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]] in 1219, Western Xia attempted to break away from the Empire and ally with the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] and [[Song dynasty|Song dynasties]]. Angered by this betrayal, in 1225 Genghis Khan sent a second, [[punitive expedition]] into Western Xia. Genghis intended to annihilate the entire Western Xia culture, and his campaign systematically destroyed Western Xia cities and the countryside, culminating in the siege of the capital in 1227 along with forays into Jin territory. Near the end of the siege, in August 1227, Genghis Khan died from an uncertain cause, though some accounts say he was killed in action against Western Xia. After his death, Yinchuan fell to the Mongols and most of its population was massacred. The destruction of Western Xia during the second campaign was near total. According to [[John Man (author)|John Man]], Western Xia is little known to anyone other than experts in the field precisely because of Genghis Khan's policy calling for their complete eradication. He states that \"There is a case to be made that this was the first ever recorded example of attempted [[genocide]]. It was certainly very successful ''[[ethnocide]]''.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Man|first=John|authorlink=John Man (author)|title=Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection|year=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York City|isbn=9780312366247|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXTv9a0HZakC|pages=116\u2013117}}</ref> However, some members of the Western Xia royal clan emigrated to western [[Sichuan]], northern [[Tibet]], even possibly [[Northeast India]], in some instances becoming local rulers.<ref>[[Herbert Franke (sinologist)|Franke, Herbert]] and [[Denis C.

Cromwell invaded Ireland with his [[New Model Army]] on behalf of [[England]]'s [[Rump Parliament]] in August 1649. Following the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]], most of Ireland came under the control of the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Catholic Confederation]]. In early 1649, the Confederates allied with the English [[Cavalier|Royalists]], who had been defeated by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the [[English Civil War]]. By May 1652, Cromwell's Parliamentarian army had defeated the Confederate and Royalist coalition in Ireland and occupied the country\u2014bringing to an end the [[Irish Confederate Wars]] (or Eleven Years' War). However, [[guerrilla warfare]] continued for a further year. Cromwell passed a series of [[Penal Laws (Ireland)|Penal Laws]] against [[Roman Catholics]] (the vast majority of the population) and [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|confiscated large amounts of their land]]. During the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (1651\u20131660), this policy was enhanced with the passing of the [[Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652|Act of Settlement of Ireland]] in 1652. Its goal was a further transfer of land from Irish to English hands.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} The immediate war aims and the longer term policies of the English Parliamentarians resulted in an attempt by the English to transfer the native population to the western fringes to make way for Protestant settlers.

He discovered that a number of Gaulish tribes had attempted to pay these Germani generously to leave, but the Tencteri and Usipetes had ranged further, coming to the frontiers of the [[Condrusi]] and [[Eburones]], who were both under the protection of the [[Treveri]] to their south. Caesar convened a meeting of the Gaulish chiefs, and, pretending he did not know of their attempts at bribery, demanded cavalry and provisions for war against the Tencteri and Usipetes. The Germanic cavalry, although outnumbered by Caesar's Gallic horsemen, made the first attack, forcing the Romans to retreat. Caesar describes a characteristic battle-tactic they used, where a horsemen would leap down to their feet and stab enemy horses in the belly. Accusing them of violating the truce, Caesar refused to accept any more ambassadors, arresting some who came requesting a further truce, and led his full force against the Germanic camp.

It was carried out by Lavrentiy Beria, head of the Soviet state security and secret police, acting on behalf of Joseph Stalin. Within three days, Beria's NKVD used cattle trains to deport women, children, the elderly, even Communists and members of the Red Army, to the Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan, several thousand kilometres away.

Professor Lyman H. Legters argued that the Soviet penal system, combined with its resettlement policies, should count as genocidal since the sentences were borne most heavily specifically on certain ethnic groups, and that a relocation of these ethnic groups, whose survivial depends on ties to its particular homeland, \"had a genocidal effect remediable only by restoration of the group to its homeland\".{{sfn|Legters|1992|p=104}} Soviet dissidents Ilya Gabay{{sfn|Fisher|2014|p=150}} and [[Pyotr Grigorenko]]{{sfn|Allworth|1998|p=216}} both classified the event as a genocide.

The genocide seldom entered Western discourse, both due to ignorance and to the Cold-War politics which made West Germany a new ally of the United States.The first significant work on the subject published in English was [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s ''Final Solution'' (1953), which, relying almost exclusively on German documentation, estimated 4.9 million dead. This figure is now considered extremely conservative. [[Raul Hilberg]]'s 1961 ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'' became a classic in the field of Holocaust literature and made the genocide of the Jews known to the wider public, Hilberg estimated its victims to be 5.1 million lives, or 4.9 - 5.4 million broadly construed. The [[Adolf Eichmann#Trial|trial of Adolph Eichmann]] further raised awareness of the genocide, Eichmann also provided documentation and testimony which revised the number of the dead.The first work to arrive at a figure comparable to modern estimates was [[Lucy Dawidowicz]]'s ''[[The War Against the Jews]]'', published in 1975, the book provided detailed listings by country of the number of Jews killed in the Holocaust which are still used as a reference in modern Holocaust studies. Dawidowicz researched birth and death records in many cities of prewar Europe to come up with a death toll of 5,933,900 Jews. After the opening of Soviet records, scholarship arrived at a death toll of about 6 million Jews. Gutman and Rozett's [[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]] was published in 1990 and estimated slightly over 5.9 million Jews were murdered.[[Wolfgang Benz]]'s ''The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide'', published 1995, gave a toll of 6.2 million.</ref>-->\n<!--<ref name=Benz>{{cite book|author=Benz, Wolfgang|title=The Holocaust: A German Historian Examines the Genocide|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|year=1999|isbn=0-231-11214-9|pp=152\u201353}}</ref>-->\n\n<ref name=Wheatcroft2001>{{cite book|last=Wheatcroft|first=Stephen G.|year=2001|chapter=Current knowledge of the level and nature of mortality in the Ukrainian famine of 1931\u20133|chapterurl=http://www.melgrosh.unimelb.edu.au/documents/SGW-UkranianFamine_mortality.pdf |editor=V.
