The film was directed by [[Tom Shadyac]], written by [[Steve Oedekerk]], based on the characters created by [[Steve Koren]] and [[Mark O'Keefe (screenwriter)|Mark O'Keefe]] from the original film. It stars [[Steve Carell]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] reprising their roles as Evan Baxter and God, respectively, with newcomers [[Lauren Graham]] and [[John Goodman]].\n\nProduction of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of [[Noah's Ark]]. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive comedy film]] ever (this record was later overtaken by ''[[Men in Black 3]]''). In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.\n\nThe film opened on June 22, 2007, and made less than its budget of $175 million worldwide, while receiving generally negative reviews from critics. ''Evan Almighty'' was also a financial failure and was notable for allegations that the many animals used in the film were treated poorly, but [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] insisted the animals were treated humanely.\n\n==Plot==\nNewly elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]], former local television news reporter Evan Baxter leaves his hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]], and later moves to the community of Prestige Crest, located in the fictional town of Huntsville, Virginia, where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to [[God in Christianity|God]] to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan, also prays that she, Evan and their three sons, Dylan, Jordan, and Ryan will be closer together as an entire family. On his first day at Congress, Evan receives a letter from his greedy boss, Congressman Chuck Long, who provides him with a prime office and the opportunity to join Long as the junior co-sponsor to his Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act (CINPLAN) bill. Over the next several days, strange events in Evan's life occur:\n\n* Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased under his name, and ancient tools and [[gopher wood]] are delivered there.\n* Pairs of animals start following him around everywhere he goes.\n* He uncontrollably starts growing a beard that keeps instantly growing back no matter how many times he shaves.\n* The number 614 starts appearing in various forms throughout his daily routines.\n\nEvan comes to realize that this number actually refers to verse 14 in chapter 6 of the [[Book of Genesis]], where God instructs [[Noah]] to build [[Noah's Ark|an ark]] in preparation for a [[Flood myth|coming flood]]. Although Evan initially rejects this idea, God himself starts appearing to Evan in various guises, assuring him that a flood will be coming and the only way Evan can change the world will be to build the ark instead. Evan himself decides to start building the ark with the tools and materials provided, giving him an opportunity to get closer to his sons, although Joan sees this as a [[midlife crisis]].\n\nAlthough Evan still maintains his career in Congress, his appearance alienates his three staffers, Rita Daniels, Marty Stringer, and Eugene Tennanbaum, and the animals that follow him everywhere become very disruptive. God reappears and provides Evan a robe, and warns him the flood will come mid-day on September 22. When Evan dons the robe, he finds he is unable to wear any other clothes, the robe seemingly displacing anything else he wears. Outraged by Evan's slothful appearance during the session, Long fires him and has his name removed from the Public Land Act bill. Believing that Evan has gone insane, Joan leaves him, causing Evan to continue building the ark alone. In a restaurant, God disguise himself as a waiter, where He encounters and later assures her that she should see this as an opportunity for the entire family to get closer to each other. Joan is inspired and finally returns to Evan and help him finish the ark to prepare for the flood.\n\nOn September 22, Evan's staffers show him the research that Long had planned to build Prestige Crest after damming off a nearby water source, but Long had cut many corners in building the dam instead. The staffers suspect Long would do the same with the Public Land Act Bill. With the ark complete, the police try to destroy it with a wrecking ball, as it violates land codes. As animals start to load the ark, and rain falls, Evan realizes that the flood will be a result of Long's dam failing. He warns the onlookers to get aboard the ark as the dam actually breaks apart, destroying all the houses of Prestige Crest. The ark later floods the streets of [[Washington, D.C.]] and comes to a halt in front of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], interrupting the vote for the Public Land Act Bill. This results in Evan accusing Long of cost-cutting leading to the dam's failure, leading to several other members of Congress voting against the bill.\n\nLong is being put under investigation for his profiteering behaviour while in office, while all the animals returned to their natural habitats. Evan is finally reinstated in Congress, all the changes forced on him by God are no longer remaining. Evan re-encounters God again during a hike, and He states that his life is now perfect as he prayed for, being closer to his family and having changed the world for the better through his one [[random act of kindness|Act of Random Kindness]] (ARK).\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- poster billing -->\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Evan Baxter, a former news reporter who is now a congressman\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as God\n* [[Lauren Graham]] as Joan Baxter, Evan's wife\n* [[John Goodman]] as Congressman Chuck Long, a senior congressman\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Marty Stringer, Evan's chief of staff\n* [[Jimmy Bennett]] as Ryan Baxter, Evan and Joan's youngest son\n* [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]] as Jordan Baxter, Evan and Joan's middle son\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as Dylan Baxter, Evan and Joan's oldest son\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Rita Daniels, Evan's assistant\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Eugene Tennanbaum, one of Evan's staffers \n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Eve Adams, the Baxters' real estate agent\n<!-- end of poster billing, rest from credits -->\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Ed Carson (Ark Reporter)\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Ark Reporter\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Builder\n* [[Harve Presnell]] as Congressman Burrows\n* Madison Mason as Congressman Dodd\n* [[Bruce Gray]] as Congressman Hughes\n* [[Paul Collins (actor)|Paul Collins]] as Congressman Stamp\n* [[Jim Doughan]] and [[Meagen Fay]] as Neighbors\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Officer Collins\n* [[Jon Stewart]] has a cameo appearance as himself\n\n<!-- NEED NOTABILITY\n* [[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]] as Susan Ortega (Uncredited)\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Officer Collins\n* [[Maile Flanagan]] as [[Mail carrier|Mail Carrier]]\n* [[Lisa Arch]] and [[Simon Helberg]] as staffers\n* [[David Barrera]] and [[Ed Helms]] as Ark reporters\n* Ruth Williamson as neighbor\n* [[Jim Doughan]] as neighbor\n* Michael Roper as Congressional Reporter\n* Emily Eby as Animal Wrangler\n* [[Bart the Bear 2]] and Honey Bump as bears\n-->\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe film's screenplay was originally titled ''The Passion of the Ark'' and was written by [[Bobby Florsheim]] and [[Josh Stolberg]].<ref name=\"KillerMoviess\">{{cite news|url=http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html |publisher=Killer Movies |title=Columbia Get \"The Passion Of The Ark\" |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp1AMoVu?url=http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html |archive-date=August 8, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It became the subject of a seven-studio bidding war in April 2004.

In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]''.<ref name=\"VFXWorld1\" /> [[Lighting]] was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] stage, and the [[visual effects]] company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.<ref name=\"VFXWorld1\" />\n\n[[File:Huntsville Festival of Fine Arts.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Signage on a lamppost in downtown Waynesboro, Virginia for ''Evan Almighty'' filming.]]\nRhythm & Hues created 300 pairs of animals for use on the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots.<ref name=\"UPEA\" /> R&H was also assisted by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided a large number of composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements.<ref name=\"UPEA\" /> In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R&H and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months.

The film was directed by [[Tom Shadyac]], written by [[Steve Oedekerk]], based on the characters created by [[Steve Koren]] and [[Mark O'Keefe (screenwriter)|Mark O'Keefe]] from the original film. It stars [[Steve Carell]] and [[Morgan Freeman]] reprising their roles as Evan Baxter and God, respectively, with newcomers [[Lauren Graham]] and [[John Goodman]].\n\nProduction of the film began in January 2006. Several visual effect companies were used to provide [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is a modern-day retelling of [[Noah's Ark]]. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive comedy film]] ever (this record was later overtaken by ''[[Men in Black 3]]''). In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.\n\nThe film opened on June 22, 2007, and made less than its budget of $175 million worldwide, while receiving generally negative reviews from critics. ''Evan Almighty'' was also a financial failure and was notable for allegations that the many animals used in the film were treated poorly, but [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] insisted the animals were treated humanely.\n\n==Plot==\nNewly elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]], former local television news reporter Evan Baxter leaves his hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]], and later moves to the community of Prestige Crest, located in the fictional town of Huntsville, Virginia, where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to [[God in Christianity|God]] to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan, also prays that she, Evan and their three sons, Dylan, Jordan, and Ryan will be closer together as an entire family. On his first day at Congress, Evan receives a letter from his greedy boss, Congressman Chuck Long, who provides him with a prime office and the opportunity to join Long as the junior co-sponsor to his Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act (CINPLAN) bill. Over the next several days, strange events in Evan's life occur:\n\n* Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased under his name, and ancient tools and [[gopher wood]] are delivered there.\n* Pairs of animals start following him around everywhere he goes.\n* He uncontrollably starts growing a beard that keeps instantly growing back no matter how many times he shaves.\n* The number 614 starts appearing in various forms throughout his daily routines.\n\nEvan comes to realize that this number actually refers to verse 14 in chapter 6 of the [[Book of Genesis]], where God instructs [[Noah]] to build [[Noah's Ark|an ark]] in preparation for a [[Flood myth|coming flood]]. Although Evan initially rejects this idea, God himself starts appearing to Evan in various guises, assuring him that a flood will be coming and the only way Evan can change the world will be to build the ark instead. Evan himself decides to start building the ark with the tools and materials provided, giving him an opportunity to get closer to his sons, although Joan sees this as a [[midlife crisis]].\n\nAlthough Evan still maintains his career in Congress, his appearance alienates his three staffers, Rita Daniels, Marty Stringer, and Eugene Tennanbaum, and the animals that follow him everywhere become very disruptive. God reappears and provides Evan a robe, and warns him the flood will come mid-day on September 22. When Evan dons the robe, he finds he is unable to wear any other clothes, the robe seemingly displacing anything else he wears. Outraged by Evan's slothful appearance during the session, Long fires him and has his name removed from the Public Land Act bill. Believing that Evan has gone insane, Joan leaves him, causing Evan to continue building the ark alone. In a restaurant, God disguise himself as a waiter, where He encounters and later assures her that she should see this as an opportunity for the entire family to get closer to each other. Joan is inspired and finally returns to Evan and help him finish the ark to prepare for the flood.\n\nOn September 22, Evan's staffers show him the research that Long had planned to build Prestige Crest after damming off a nearby water source, but Long had cut many corners in building the dam instead. The staffers suspect Long would do the same with the Public Land Act Bill. With the ark complete, the police try to destroy it with a wrecking ball, as it violates land codes. As animals start to load the ark, and rain falls, Evan realizes that the flood will be a result of Long's dam failing. He warns the onlookers to get aboard the ark as the dam actually breaks apart, destroying all the houses of Prestige Crest. The ark later floods the streets of [[Washington, D.C.]] and comes to a halt in front of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], interrupting the vote for the Public Land Act Bill. This results in Evan accusing Long of cost-cutting leading to the dam's failure, leading to several other members of Congress voting against the bill.\n\nLong is being put under investigation for his profiteering behaviour while in office, while all the animals returned to their natural habitats. Evan is finally reinstated in Congress, all the changes forced on him by God are no longer remaining. Evan re-encounters God again during a hike, and He states that his life is now perfect as he prayed for, being closer to his family and having changed the world for the better through his one [[random act of kindness|Act of Random Kindness]] (ARK).\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- poster billing -->\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Evan Baxter, a former news reporter who is now a congressman\n* [[Morgan Freeman]] as God\n* [[Lauren Graham]] as Joan Baxter, Evan's wife\n* [[John Goodman]] as Congressman Chuck Long, a senior congressman\n* [[John Michael Higgins]] as Marty Stringer, Evan's chief of staff\n* [[Jimmy Bennett]] as Ryan Baxter, Evan and Joan's youngest son\n* [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]] as Jordan Baxter, Evan and Joan's middle son\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as Dylan Baxter, Evan and Joan's oldest son\n* [[Wanda Sykes]] as Rita Daniels, Evan's assistant\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Eugene Tennanbaum, one of Evan's staffers \n* [[Molly Shannon]] as Eve Adams, the Baxters' real estate agent\n<!-- end of poster billing, rest from credits -->\n* [[Ed Helms]] as Ed Carson (Ark Reporter)\n* [[Rachael Harris]] as Ark Reporter\n* [[Brian Howe (actor)|Brian Howe]] as Builder\n* [[Harve Presnell]] as Congressman Burrows\n* Madison Mason as Congressman Dodd\n* [[Bruce Gray]] as Congressman Hughes\n* [[Paul Collins (actor)|Paul Collins]] as Congressman Stamp\n* [[Jim Doughan]] and [[Meagen Fay]] as Neighbors\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Officer Collins\n* [[Jon Stewart]] has a cameo appearance as himself\n\n<!-- NEED NOTABILITY\n* [[Catherine Bell (actress)|Catherine Bell]] as Susan Ortega (Uncredited)\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Officer Collins\n* [[Maile Flanagan]] as [[Mail carrier|Mail Carrier]]\n* [[Lisa Arch]] and [[Simon Helberg]] as staffers\n* [[David Barrera]] and [[Ed Helms]] as Ark reporters\n* Ruth Williamson as neighbor\n* [[Jim Doughan]] as neighbor\n* Michael Roper as Congressional Reporter\n* Emily Eby as Animal Wrangler\n* [[Bart the Bear 2]] and Honey Bump as bears\n-->\n\n==Production==\n\n===Screenplay===\nThe film's screenplay was originally titled ''The Passion of the Ark'' and was written by [[Bobby Florsheim]] and [[Josh Stolberg]].<ref name=\"KillerMoviess\">{{cite news|url=http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html |publisher=Killer Movies |title=Columbia Get \"The Passion Of The Ark\" |accessdate=March 14, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5rp1AMoVu?url=http://www.killermovies.com/p/thepassionoftheark/articles/3877.html |archive-date=August 8, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It became the subject of a seven-studio bidding war in April 2004.

In addition, ILM used similar tools that were used on their prior film ''[[Poseidon (film)|Poseidon]]''.<ref name=\"VFXWorld1\" /> [[Lighting]] was also an issue as the characters on the ark had been filmed on a [[Chroma key|greenscreen]] stage, and the [[visual effects]] company had to ensure that the lighting matched that of the characters and the outside setting. Details were added to the ark for long-distance shots to make the design of the ark more appealing and relate the ark's size to scale in comparison to the amount of water. To complete the scene, ILM used thirty to sixty crew members and produced 200 shots over a yearlong period between April 2006 and May 2007.<ref name=\"VFXWorld1\" />\n\n[[File:Huntsville Festival of Fine Arts.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Signage on a lamppost in downtown Waynesboro, Virginia for ''Evan Almighty'' filming.]]\nRhythm & Hues created 300 pairs of animals for use on the ark and fifteen pairs with higher detail for closeup shots.<ref name=\"UPEA\" /> R&H was also assisted by C.I.S. Hollywood, another visual effects company, who provided a large number of composites, involving hundreds of greenscreen animal elements.<ref name=\"UPEA\" /> In scenes where there are multiple species of animals, crew members would film the animals on the greenscreen and R&H and C.I.S would digitally add the animals one at a time, sometimes taking several weeks to a couple of months.
