It was released on November 21, 1989 through [[Nettwerk]]. The album notably features [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] frontman [[Al Jourgensen]] (credited as Alien Jourgensen) who performed electric guitar and vocals on several songs. The album spawned two singles, \"[[Tin Omen (song)|Tin Omen]]\" and \"[[Worlock]]\", the latter of which becoming one of the band's most recognizable songs. The cover art was made by longtime Skinny Puppy collaborator [[Steven R. Gilmore]]. In 1993 the CD edition was reissued by Nettwerk to correct [[Audio mastering|mastering]] errors in the original release.<ref name=\"Kern\">{{cite book |title=Skinny Puppy:  The Illustrated Discography (Second Edition) |last=Kern |first=Jay |year=2010 |publisher=Mythos Press  |page=33}}</ref>\n\n''Rabies'' was a commercial success for the band, but received mixed reviews from critics upon release, several of whom drew parallels between the record and Ministry's style, both favorably and unfavorably.

For ''Rabies'', lead singer/songwriter Nivek Ogre brought in friend and Ministry frontman, [[Al Jourgensen]].  Ogre had met Jourgensen during the recording of the [[PTP (band)|PTP]] song \"Show Me Your Spine\" in 1987. Ogre later toured with Ministry (Ogre can be seen and heard on the ''[[In Case You Didn't Feel Like Showing Up]]'' video and CD) and would also go on to provide vocals for Jourgensen's side project [[Revolting Cocks]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Radio|first1=Joe|title=Interview: Al Jourgensen and Ogre, 1989|url=http://www.prongs.org/ministry/alogre|website=prongs.org|accessdate=May 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=Gilmore>{{cite magazine|last1=Gilmore|first1=Steven|title=The Peril's of Puppy|url=http://litany.net/interviews/ipso89.htm|work=Ipso Facto Magazine|issue=7|date=1989}}</ref>  The other two members of Skinny Puppy, cEvin Key (drummer) and Dwayne Goettel (keyboardist/synthesist), did not approve of Jourgensen's takeover, creating a \"glacial coldness\" between the band members.<ref name=Liner>'''''Rabies''''' liner notes</ref><ref name=24hours>{{cite magazine|title=24 Hours in Vancouver|url=http://litany.net/interviews/altpress91.html|work=Alternative Press|issue=35|date=February 1991}}</ref> A couple years following the release of ''Rabies'', Key mentioned to ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' that he believed Jourgensen's motive for assisting in the album's production was to try and break up Skinny Puppy.<ref name=24hours />\n\nMuch of the album had been written before Jourgensen was officially involved, though Key has mentioned that the process was influenced by the notion that Jourgensen might join them in the studio to \"jam.\"  The group took into consideration what type of music Jourgensen would be interested in making, thus writing guitar heavy material such as \"[[Tin Omen (song)|Tin Omen]],\"<ref name=24hours /> a song which makes reference to the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].<ref name=\"Milwaukee\">{{cite web|last1=Nichols|first1=Kathy|title=Skinny Puppy bring politicized industrial, over-the-top theatrics to The Rave (Nov 17, 2015)|url=http://milwaukeerecord.com/music/skinny-puppy-bring-politicized-industrial-over-the-top-theatrics-to-the-rave/|website=Milwaukee Record|publisher=Milwaukeerecord.com|accessdate=June 5, 2016}}</ref> \"Fascist Jock Itch,\" also written with Jourgensen in mind,<ref name=24hours /> was inspired by an incident between Ogre and a few [[skinheads]].

In 1993, the album was digitally remastered and re-released on Nettwerk.<ref name=\"Kern\"/>\n\nOnly one promotional video was produced for ''Rabies''. The \"[[Worlock]]\" video was primarily a rhythmically edited string of horror movie clips featuring outtakes and clips from the band's earlier video, \"[[Stairs and Flowers]]\" (from the album ''[[Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse]]''). The video, which opens with a \"Rated X\" graphic, was intended to be a critique of the concept of censorship in America.<ref name=Gilmore /> Many of the movie clips featured in the video were from films made by controversial Italian filmmaker [[Dario Argento]], whose work has a reputation for being heavily censored by US distributors in order to gain \"R-Ratings\" from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gracey|first1=James|title=Dario Argento|date=2010|publisher=Oldcastle Books|isbn=978-1842433188}}</ref> For the \"Worlock\" video Skinny Puppy included footage deleted from the US versions of such Argento films as ''[[Deep Red]]'', ''[[Suspiria]]'', ''[[Tenebrae (film)|Tenebrae]]'', ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]'', and ''[[Opera (film)|Opera]]''. Other films included in the music video include, ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'', ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]]'', ''[[Bad Taste]]'', ''[[Dead & Buried|Dead and Buried]]'', ''[[Luther The Geek]]'', ''[[Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer]]'', ''[[From Beyond (film)|From Beyond]]'', ''Death Warmed Up'', ''[[Eraserhead]]'' and ''[[Altered States]]''.\n\nDue to the graphic violence of the horror film clips used in the video, and also copyright violations, \"Worlock\" was subsequently banned by [[MTV]], and did not receive any television airplay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Banned from MTV: 10 Videos that got the Axe|url=http://www.citypages.com/music/banned-from-mtv-10-videos-that-got-the-axe-6651239|work=City Pages|date=July 2011|ref=Banned from MTV: 10 Videos that got the Axe}}</ref> In 1992, Skinny Puppy released a compilation of their music videos, but \"Worlock\" was noticeably absent. According to Nettwerk, the video was omitted partially due to copyright problems and also because of concern the video would be banned by other countries which might find the video's content obscene.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} However, in recent years the video has been widely bootlegged among fans on the [[Internet]]. \"Backing\" videos for \"Tin Omen\" and \"Choralone\" were produced for the ''Too Dark Park'' tour in 1990, and have also been spread on the Internet.\n\nA limited run of promotional mechanical pencils were made and sent to college (and possibly other) radio stations along with the album.  Shaped like a syringe the pencils were white with black lettering \"SKINNY [PUPPY]\" and white on black lettering \"RABIES\".  They were approximately 4 inches in length.\n\nThe Mutants of Rock Tour, which was to include a quadruple bill including Skinny Puppy, Ministry, [[KMFDM]], and [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]], was to begin on December 27, 1989. However, according to Key, the tour was called off when Skinny Puppy collectively decided to pull out, citing concerns regarding the band's then uncertain situation. Key suggested a potential line of shows for the summer of 1990, but expressed little faith in any tour supporting ''Rabies'' ever happening.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ulina |first1=Lloyd |title=Rabid Curiosity: Skinny Puppy |journal=[[Discorder]] |date=February 1990 |page=8}}</ref> Ogre ultimately joined Ministry's tour for ''[[The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=29|author=Wolanski, Coreen|title=Skinny Puppy:  Every Dog Has Its Day|magazine=[[Exclaim!]]|year=2002|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=Allmusic>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r18164/review|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review]</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[The Boston Globe]]''\n|rev2score = Unfavorable<ref name=\"boston\">{{cite journal |last1=Fertig |first1=Beth |title=Skinny Puppy - Rabies |journal=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=March 22, 1990 |page=99}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Kerrang!]]''\n|rev3score = Unfavorable<ref name=\"Kerrang!\">{{cite magazine|last1=Lukes|first1=Daniel|title=Where to Start with Skinny Puppy|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|date=March 3, 2007|issue=1148|page=53|url=http://img131.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=77522_skinny02_122_457lo.jpg#|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''\n|rev4score = Favorable<ref name=\"Essential\">{{cite journal |last1=Gold |first1=Jonathan |last2=Kendrick |first2=David |title=Essential Industrial Albums |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 19, 1992 |page=183}}</ref>\n|rev5 = [[Sputnikmusic]]\n|rev5score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=Sputnik>[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=8528 Sputnikmusic review]</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Tampa\">{{cite journal |last1=Carey |first1=Jean |title=Skinny Puppy - Rabies |journal=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |date=February 2, 1990 |page=95}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[Washington Post]]''\n|rev7score = Favorable<ref name=jenkins />\n}}<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\nSince the album's release, reception from both critics and fans has been mixed. ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' said ''Rabies'' was more of a Skinny Puppy/Ministry hybrid and was not representative of the group's best work.<ref name=24hours />\n\nTim DiGravina from [[AllMusic|Allmusic]] stated that ''Rabies'' was a solid release, even though he felt the band was not performing \"at their peak\". He goes on to praise the album's implementation of movie dialogue, particularly commending its use in the songs \"Worlock\", \"Tin Omen\", and \"Rivers\". DiGravina was, however, less impressed by Jourgensen's contributions, asserting that the same qualities which made ''The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste'' a good album were not suitable for ''Rabies''.<ref name=Allmusic /> Trey Spencer from [[Sputnikmusic]] was less favorable, calling the record one of the group's \"low points\". He was critical of the album's use of simple (and sometimes \"formless\") song structures and claimed that the sampling brought nothing meaningful to the table. Spencer was more receptive to the song \"Worlock\", calling it the band's \"defining moment\", but concludes by saying that \"the rest of the album consists of two good Industrial Metal songs, three average songs, and five songs that aren\u2019t worth wasting your time on\".<ref name=Sputnik />\n\nBeth Fertig of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' panned the album as \"just another festering collection of noise\", but pointed out the use of humor on songs such as \"Fascist Jock Itch\" as a positive element of the band's music.<ref name=\"boston\" /> Daniel Lukes of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' said that despite a \"handful of undeniably classic tracks\", the album comes across more as a collection of \"Ministry B-sides\" than a typical Skinny Puppy record.<ref name=\"Kerrang!\" />\n\nIn a positive review from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', writers Jonathan Gold and David Kendrick list ''Rabies'' as an essential industrial album, calling it a \"slightly atypical\" offering that \"also rocks a little harder\".<ref name=\"Essential\" /> This sentiment was echoed by ''[[CMJ]]'''s Brad Filicky, who called the album \"a masterpiece of the industrial genre\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Filicky|first1=Brad|title=CMJ Silver Salute|magazine=CMJ New Music Report|date=July 21, 2003|volume=76|issue=8|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ghGxEXpetmAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Jean Carey of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' praised the album, calling attention to the use of sampling, the song \"Worlock\", and Ogre's vocal work, which was compared to a \"crazed [[Jimmy Durante]]\".

In 1993, the album was digitally remastered and re-released on Nettwerk.<ref name=\"Kern\"/>\n\nOnly one promotional video was produced for ''Rabies''. The \"[[Worlock]]\" video was primarily a rhythmically edited string of horror movie clips featuring outtakes and clips from the band's earlier video, \"[[Stairs and Flowers]]\" (from the album ''[[Mind: The Perpetual Intercourse]]''). The video, which opens with a \"Rated X\" graphic, was intended to be a critique of the concept of censorship in America.<ref name=Gilmore /> Many of the movie clips featured in the video were from films made by controversial Italian filmmaker [[Dario Argento]], whose work has a reputation for being heavily censored by US distributors in order to gain \"R-Ratings\" from the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gracey|first1=James|title=Dario Argento|date=2010|publisher=Oldcastle Books|isbn=978-1842433188}}</ref> For the \"Worlock\" video Skinny Puppy included footage deleted from the US versions of such Argento films as ''[[Deep Red]]'', ''[[Suspiria]]'', ''[[Tenebrae (film)|Tenebrae]]'', ''[[Phenomena (film)|Phenomena]]'', and ''[[Opera (film)|Opera]]''. Other films included in the music video include, ''[[The Beyond (film)|The Beyond]]'', ''[[Hellbound: Hellraiser II]]'', ''[[Bad Taste]]'', ''[[Dead & Buried|Dead and Buried]]'', ''[[Luther The Geek]]'', ''[[Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer]]'', ''[[From Beyond (film)|From Beyond]]'', ''Death Warmed Up'', ''[[Eraserhead]]'' and ''[[Altered States]]''.\n\nDue to the graphic violence of the horror film clips used in the video, and also copyright violations, \"Worlock\" was subsequently banned by [[MTV]], and did not receive any television airplay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Banned from MTV: 10 Videos that got the Axe|url=http://www.citypages.com/music/banned-from-mtv-10-videos-that-got-the-axe-6651239|work=City Pages|date=July 2011|ref=Banned from MTV: 10 Videos that got the Axe}}</ref> In 1992, Skinny Puppy released a compilation of their music videos, but \"Worlock\" was noticeably absent. According to Nettwerk, the video was omitted partially due to copyright problems and also because of concern the video would be banned by other countries which might find the video's content obscene.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} However, in recent years the video has been widely bootlegged among fans on the [[Internet]]. \"Backing\" videos for \"Tin Omen\" and \"Choralone\" were produced for the ''Too Dark Park'' tour in 1990, and have also been spread on the Internet.\n\nA limited run of promotional mechanical pencils were made and sent to college (and possibly other) radio stations along with the album.  Shaped like a syringe the pencils were white with black lettering \"SKINNY [PUPPY]\" and white on black lettering \"RABIES\".  They were approximately 4 inches in length.\n\nThe Mutants of Rock Tour, which was to include a quadruple bill including Skinny Puppy, Ministry, [[KMFDM]], and [[My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult]], was to begin on December 27, 1989. However, according to Key, the tour was called off when Skinny Puppy collectively decided to pull out, citing concerns regarding the band's then uncertain situation. Key suggested a potential line of shows for the summer of 1990, but expressed little faith in any tour supporting ''Rabies'' ever happening.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ulina |first1=Lloyd |title=Rabid Curiosity: Skinny Puppy |journal=[[Discorder]] |date=February 1990 |page=8}}</ref> Ogre ultimately joined Ministry's tour for ''[[The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=29|author=Wolanski, Coreen|title=Skinny Puppy:  Every Dog Has Its Day|magazine=[[Exclaim!]]|year=2002|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=Allmusic>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r18164/review|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review]</ref>\n|rev2 = ''[[The Boston Globe]]''\n|rev2score = Unfavorable<ref name=\"boston\">{{cite journal |last1=Fertig |first1=Beth |title=Skinny Puppy - Rabies |journal=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=March 22, 1990 |page=99}}</ref>\n|rev3 = ''[[Kerrang!]]''\n|rev3score = Unfavorable<ref name=\"Kerrang!\">{{cite magazine|last1=Lukes|first1=Daniel|title=Where to Start with Skinny Puppy|magazine=[[Kerrang!]]|date=March 3, 2007|issue=1148|page=53|url=http://img131.imagevenue.com/img.php?image=77522_skinny02_122_457lo.jpg#|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|rev4 = ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''\n|rev4score = Favorable<ref name=\"Essential\">{{cite journal |last1=Gold |first1=Jonathan |last2=Kendrick |first2=David |title=Essential Industrial Albums |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 19, 1992 |page=183}}</ref>\n|rev5 = [[Sputnikmusic]]\n|rev5score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=Sputnik>[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=8528 Sputnikmusic review]</ref>\n|rev6 = ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''\n|rev6score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref name=\"Tampa\">{{cite journal |last1=Carey |first1=Jean |title=Skinny Puppy - Rabies |journal=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |date=February 2, 1990 |page=95}}</ref>\n|rev7 = ''[[Washington Post]]''\n|rev7score = Favorable<ref name=jenkins />\n}}<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\nSince the album's release, reception from both critics and fans has been mixed. ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' said ''Rabies'' was more of a Skinny Puppy/Ministry hybrid and was not representative of the group's best work.<ref name=24hours />\n\nTim DiGravina from [[AllMusic|Allmusic]] stated that ''Rabies'' was a solid release, even though he felt the band was not performing \"at their peak\". He goes on to praise the album's implementation of movie dialogue, particularly commending its use in the songs \"Worlock\", \"Tin Omen\", and \"Rivers\". DiGravina was, however, less impressed by Jourgensen's contributions, asserting that the same qualities which made ''The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste'' a good album were not suitable for ''Rabies''.<ref name=Allmusic /> Trey Spencer from [[Sputnikmusic]] was less favorable, calling the record one of the group's \"low points\". He was critical of the album's use of simple (and sometimes \"formless\") song structures and claimed that the sampling brought nothing meaningful to the table. Spencer was more receptive to the song \"Worlock\", calling it the band's \"defining moment\", but concludes by saying that \"the rest of the album consists of two good Industrial Metal songs, three average songs, and five songs that aren\u2019t worth wasting your time on\".<ref name=Sputnik />\n\nBeth Fertig of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' panned the album as \"just another festering collection of noise\", but pointed out the use of humor on songs such as \"Fascist Jock Itch\" as a positive element of the band's music.<ref name=\"boston\" /> Daniel Lukes of ''[[Kerrang!]]'' said that despite a \"handful of undeniably classic tracks\", the album comes across more as a collection of \"Ministry B-sides\" than a typical Skinny Puppy record.<ref name=\"Kerrang!\" />\n\nIn a positive review from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', writers Jonathan Gold and David Kendrick list ''Rabies'' as an essential industrial album, calling it a \"slightly atypical\" offering that \"also rocks a little harder\".<ref name=\"Essential\" /> This sentiment was echoed by ''[[CMJ]]'''s Brad Filicky, who called the album \"a masterpiece of the industrial genre\".<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Filicky|first1=Brad|title=CMJ Silver Salute|magazine=CMJ New Music Report|date=July 21, 2003|volume=76|issue=8|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ghGxEXpetmAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=January 18, 2019}}</ref> Jean Carey of the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' praised the album, calling attention to the use of sampling, the song \"Worlock\", and Ogre's vocal work, which was compared to a \"crazed [[Jimmy Durante]]\".
