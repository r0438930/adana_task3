It currently has three sections, which are Kindergarten, Primary and Secondary. Historically, it had four sections including Kindergarten, Primary, Secondary (including sixth-form), and Business Studies.\n\n==Co-Curricular Activities Committee (For Secondary Section only)==\nThe Co-Curricular Activities Committee was established in 1994. The departments of Co-Curricular Activities Committee are as follows:\n\n*'''Student Council Executive Committee''' - In the beginning of school term every year, the election of \"Student Council\" is held which enables two cabinets to compete for becoming the ruling council of the year. Students take part in the election under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis. Members from the Student Council Executive Committee have to bear up with the prefect duties as they are also the \"Student Leaders\".\n*'''Student Council Representative Committee''' - It is formed by the \"Student Leaders\". It implements the duty of supervising the works done by \"Student Council Executive Committee\".\n*'''Student Council Service Team''' - Assists the \"Student Council Executive Committee\" to carry out the charitable works of caring for the needs of underprivileged minorities within the Wanchai community.\n*'''Rosarian Editorial Board''' - Reports the campus news and publishes the literary articles, which is accountable to the supervision of \"Student Council Executive Committee\"\n*'''House Captain Liaison Committee''' - Each House appoints two captains to form this Committee\n*'''House Executive Committee''' - The House Captains, who are elected under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis, form this Committee. All elected captains have to bear up with the prefect duties as they are also the \"Student Leaders\".\n*'''Sports Association''' - Formed by representatives of different sports teams\n*'''New Youth Society''' - Formerly known as \"Catholic Students Society\", which is administered by the Religious Department of the Dominican Priests\n*'''Altar Service Team''' - Administered by the Religious Department of the Dominican Priests\n*'''Discipline Team''' - \"Student Leaders\" from different Houses accomplish the prefect duties, and they elect their favourite Head Prefects.\n*'''Library Service Team'''\n*'''Red Cross Youth Unit'''\n*'''Boys Scouts Team'''\n*'''Youth Ambassadors Team'''\n*'''School Choir'''\n*'''Singing and Guitar Club'''\n*'''Lion Dance Team'''\n*'''Mobile Apps Programming Club'''\n*'''Horticulture Club'''\n*'''School Annual Editorial Board''' - Publishes School Annual every year. Members are responsible for the editorial tasks of reporting the official event news of Kindergarten, Primary Section and Secondary Section.\n\nBetween September 1994 and July 2004, the \"Student Council Executive Committee\", \"Student Council Representative Committee\", \"Student Council Service Team\", \"Rosarian Editorial Board\", \"House Captain Liaison Committee\", \"House Executive Committee\" and \"Sports Association\" under the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\" were independent from the operations of \"Discipline Team\". Since September 2004, a system called \"an integration among Student Council, Houses, Sports Association and Discipline Team\" has been implemented. Members from the four Student Council units, the elected captains from the six houses, and representatives from \"Sports Association\" are consistently regarded as \"Student Leaders\". They have to bear up with the prefect duties assigned by the \"Discipline Team\" while tackling with their leadership duties within the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\". Moreover, all the \"Student Leaders\" have to elect several \"Head Prefects\" under a \"one man, one vote\" basis.\n\n==House System (For Secondary Section only)==\nThere are six Houses in total, which are administered by the \"House Captain Liaison Committee\" from the \"Co-Curricular Activities Committee\". \"Student Leaders\" from six Houses have to take part in the prefect duties of the Discipline Team at the same time. Each teacher, including the two Deputy Principals and the Officer of Student Affairs, is given a House identity as well. Captains from the six Houses are elected by their corresponding housemates within the campus under a \"one-man, one vote\" basis. The elected Captains form the \"House Executive Committee\":\n\n*'''Dragon House'''\n:Yellow is the House colour, whereas [[dragon]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Eagle House'''\n:Brown is the House colour, whereas [[eagle]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Flamingo House'''\n:Red is the House colour, whereas [[flamingo]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Peacock House'''\n:Blue is the House colour, whereas [[peacock]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Phoenix House'''\n:Orange is the House colour, whereas [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n*'''Unicorn House'''\n:Green is the House colour, whereas [[unicorn]] is the auspicious animal.\n\n==Supervisor==\nSince the establishment of Rosaryhill School, the position of Supervisor was accomplished by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priests. Fr. He Yousun now serves as the Supervisor in Rosaryhill School.\n\n==List of Principals (For Secondary Section only)==\nSince the establishment of Rosaryhill School, the position of Secondary Section Principal was accomplished by [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priests.\n\nSince September 2006, there was a change which Francis Tsung Pui-sum (\u53e2\u57f9\u68ee\u5148\u751f), a Chinese intellectual, succeeded the position as the Principal of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section). Francis Tsung Pui-sum became the first-ever Chinese intellectual to serve as the Principal of Secondary Section in the history of Rosaryhill School.\n\nSince September 2015, 'Cherry Wong (\u9ec3\u78a7\u745c\u5973\u58eb) succeeded the position as the Principal of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section).

Since 2001, there has been approval of Visual Arts curriculum in Form 6 and Form 7 levels. Students were then allowed to register for the Visual Arts examinations from the [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]] and the [[Hong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination]]. Since 2009, to keep abreast with the new 3-3-4 education system, students were allowed to register for the Visual Arts examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\nThe new 3-3-4 education was implemented in the Music curriculum for Form 4, Form 5 and Form 6 students in 2009. Form 6 students were allowed to register for the Music examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\n==History Education (For Secondary Section only)==\nThe History Education (or \"World History\" Education) of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section) is renowned with its requirement that the Form 4 and Form 5 students of the \"Arts Stream\" from the old era of [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination]] had to take this academic discipline as a compulsory subject. Form 6 and Form 7 students could freely choose to study History in either \"[[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination]]\" module or '\"[[Hong Kong Advanced Supplementary Level Examination]]\" module.\n\nThe \"Two History Teachers System\" was Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section)'s unique innovation from the history of education development in Hong Kong.\n\nSince 2009, to keep abreast with the new 3-3-4 education system, students were allowed to register for the History examination from the [[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education]].\n\nSince 1994, the History Department of Rosaryhill School (Secondary Section) participated in the competitions and research schemes organized by [[Hong Kong Museum of History]], [[Hong Kong Professional Teachers' Union]], [[The Hong Kong Institute for Promotion of Chinese Culture]] and the Moral and Civic Education Team of HKSAR [[Education Bureau]].
