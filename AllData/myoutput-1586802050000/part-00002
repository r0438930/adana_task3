Through El Paso, US&nbsp;62 begins at the [[Paso del Norte International Bridge|Santa Fe Street Bridge]], and follows Santa Fe Street, then Paisano Drive. At the Paisano Drive underpass for [[Interstate 10|I-10]] (I-10 exit 23B), US&nbsp;62 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[U.S. Route 180|US&nbsp;180]], while US&nbsp;180 ends its concurrency with I-10. The route then follows Montana Avenue, continuing the concurrency with US&nbsp;180 until [[Seminole, Texas|Seminole]]. Before exiting Texas, the route passes through the Salt Flats of Texas, the southern base of [[Guadalupe Peak]], the highest point in Texas, and [[Guadalupe Mountains National Park]].\n\n===New Mexico===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in New Mexico}}\nThrough New Mexico, US&nbsp;62 is entirely concurrent with [[U.S. Route 180 in New Mexico|US&nbsp;180]]. The highway continues past [[Carlsbad Caverns National Park]] and [[White's City, New Mexico|White's City]] into the city of [[Carlsbad, New Mexico|Carlsbad]]. In Carlsbad, [[U.S. Route 285|US&nbsp;285]] joins US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;180 for approximately {{convert|2.2|mi|km}}, then heads east to [[Hobbs, New Mexico|Hobbs]]. US&nbsp;62 comes within {{convert|12|mi|km}} of the [[Waste Isolation Pilot Plant|WIPP Plant]] while also coming across several State Highway termini: [[New Mexico State Road 360]] (NM&nbsp;360), [[New Mexico State Road 176|NM&nbsp;176]], [[New Mexico State Road 243|NM&nbsp;243]], [[New Mexico State Road 529|NM&nbsp;529]], [[New Mexico State Road 483|NM&nbsp;483]], [[New Mexico State Road 360|NM&nbsp;360]], and [[New Mexico State Road 8|NM&nbsp;8]] along the {{convert|70|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch. US&nbsp;62 comes into Hobbs along Marland Boulevard. After coming close to [[Hobbs High School]]'s Watson Stadium, US&nbsp;62 leaves Hobbs going east to the Texas\u2013New Mexico state line.\n\n===Texas Panhandle===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Texas}}\nAfter re-entering Texas, US&nbsp;62 continues east through Seminole where US&nbsp;180 heads east towards [[Lamesa, Texas|Lamesa]] and US&nbsp;62 turns north northeast along a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 385|US&nbsp;385]] through [[Seagraves, Texas|Seagraves]] and [[Brownfield, Texas|Brownfield]]. In Brownfield, US&nbsp;62 picks up [[U.S. Route 82|US&nbsp;82]]/[[U.S. Route 380|US&nbsp;380]] from [[Plains, Texas|Plains]] for a four-way concurrency for about two blocks, where US&nbsp;380 heads east toward [[Tahoka, Texas|Tahoka]]. US&nbsp;385 drops off approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later to head northwest toward [[Levelland, Texas|Levelland]]. US&nbsp;82 continues as a concurrency with US&nbsp;62 into [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. US&nbsp;62 splits from US&nbsp;82 and joins with [[Texas State Highway 114|State Highway&nbsp;114]] (SH&nbsp;114) for approximately {{convert|10|mi|km}} along the [[Campus of Texas Tech University|campus]] of [[Texas Tech University]]'s southern border. On the east side of Lubbock, US&nbsp;82 joins back into US&nbsp;62/SH&nbsp;114 and then continues east passes through [[Lorenzo, Texas|Lorenzo]], then leaves off the concurrency and forms a spur around [[Ralls, Texas|Ralls]], locally known as the \"US&nbsp;62 Loop\". The route then turns north to form a concurrency with [[Texas State Highway 207|SH&nbsp;207]] up to [[Floydada, Texas|Floydada]], where [[U.S. Route 70|US&nbsp;70]] joins in for {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} east and then SH&nbsp;207 turns north of the east side of Floydada. US&nbsp;62/US&nbsp;70 then east through [[Matador, Texas|Matador]] to [[Paducah, Texas|Paducah]], and north again dropping off US&nbsp;70 and gaining [[U.S. Route 83|US&nbsp;83]] through [[Childress, Texas|Childress]] to a point {{convert|17|mi|km}} to the north of Childress where it turns east alone, before crossing the Texas\u2013Oklahoma border {{convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} west of [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]].\n\n===Oklahoma===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in Oklahoma}}\nUS&nbsp;62 runs east from the Texas border across Southwest [[Oklahoma]] through [[Hollis, Oklahoma|Hollis]], [[Gould, Oklahoma|Gould]] and [[Altus, Oklahoma|Altus]] and then continues east bypassing the communities of [[Headrick, Oklahoma|Headrick]], [[Snyder, Oklahoma|Snyder]], [[Indiahoma, Oklahoma|Indiahoma]] and [[Cache, Oklahoma|Cache]] into [[Lawton, Oklahoma|Lawton]]. On the north side of Lawton, US&nbsp;62 joins [[I-44]] as a concurrent route for {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Fort Sill|Fort Sill Military Reservation]] and then splits on its own at Exit 46 near Medicine Park to continue north through [[Apache, Oklahoma|Apache]] then north and east toward [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]]. From Anadarko, US&nbsp;62 runs east through [[Verden, Oklahoma|Verden]] to [[Chickasha, Oklahoma|Chickasha]] and northeast through [[Newcastle, Oklahoma|Newcastle]] before returning to a concurrent route with I-44 into [[Oklahoma City]] and then with [[Interstate 240 (Oklahoma)|I-240]] and [[I-35]] through much of the city before leaving I-35 at Northeast 23rd Street (exit 130) {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} east of the Oklahoma State Capitol. It leaves Oklahoma City at 23rd street and heads east through [[Midwest City, Oklahoma|Midwest City]], [[Spencer, Oklahoma|Spencer]], [[Nicoma Park, Oklahoma|Nicoma Park]], [[Choctaw, Oklahoma|Choctaw]], [[Harrah, Oklahoma|Harrah]], [[Meeker, Oklahoma|Meeker]] and [[Boley, Oklahoma|Boley]] to [[Okemah, Oklahoma|Okemah]]. At Okemah, US&nbsp;62 overlaps [[I-40]] for {{convert|18|mi|km}} to [[Henryetta, Oklahoma|Henryetta]]. US&nbsp;62 then leaves I-40 to continue north to [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma|Okmulgee]] and east to [[Muskogee, Oklahoma|Muskogee]], and heads northeast through [[Fort Gibson, Oklahoma|Fort Gibson]] and [[Tahlequah, Oklahoma|Tahlequah]] and into Arkansas.\n\nIn addition to sections of I-44, I-240, I-35 and I-40, US&nbsp;62 also runs concurrent with other US&nbsp;highways over its miles across Oklahoma including US&nbsp;281 from Lawton to Anadarko and US&nbsp;277 from Lawton north about 11 miles (both including the {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} I-44 concurrency north of Lawton), US&nbsp;81 in the Chickasha city limits, a second US&nbsp;277 concurrency from Chickasha to Newcastle, US&nbsp;75 from Henryetta to Okmulgee, US&nbsp;64 from an intersection near Taft to Muskogee and US&nbsp;69 in the Muskogee city limits. US&nbsp;62 business routes are designated through the cities of Snyder and Muskogee.\n\n===Arkansas===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Arkansas}}\n[[File:US&nbsp;62 near Busch, Arkansas.jpg|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll County]] west of [[Eureka Springs, Arkansas]].]]\nIn the state of [[Arkansas]], US&nbsp;62 runs {{convert|329.9|mi|km}} from the [[Oklahoma]] border near [[Summers, Arkansas|Summers]] east to the [[Missouri]] border in [[St. Francis, Arkansas|St. Francis]], serving the northern portion of the state. The route passes through several cities and towns, including [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], [[Prairie Grove, Arkansas |Prairie Grove]], [[Springdale, Arkansas|Springdale]], [[Bentonville, Arkansas|Bentonville]], [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]], [[Mountain Home, Arkansas|Mountain Home]], [[Pocahontas, Arkansas|Pocahontas]], and [[Piggott, Arkansas|Piggott]]. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrent with several highways in Arkansas including [[Interstate 49|I-49]] and [[U.S. Route 71|US&nbsp;71]] between Fayetteville and Bentonville, [[U.S. Route 412|US&nbsp;412]] through much of the state, [[U.S. Route 65|US&nbsp;65]] in the Harrison area, and with [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]] and [[U.S. Route 67|US&nbsp;67]] (Future [[Interstate 57|I-57]]) in northeast Arkansas.\n\n===Missouri===\nUS&nbsp;62 enters Missouri from Arkansas at Whitaker Place, and proceeds more or less easterly across the Missouri Bootheel via [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] to [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]].  Between Malden and New Madrid, US&nbsp;62 was designated as '''Route&nbsp;82''' in 1922. The part west of Malden was unnumbered until it became US&nbsp;62.  At New Madrid US&nbsp;62 begins a concurrency with US&nbsp;61.  The combined US&nbsp;61/62 goes north as far as [[Sikeston, Missouri|Sikeston]], where US&nbsp;62 resumes its easterly direction.  From Sikeston US&nbsp;62 runs east to [[Charleston, Missouri|Charleston]], where it is concurrent with Business I-57 for a short distance.  After crossing I-57, US&nbsp;62 becomes concurrent with US&nbsp;60, this concurrency continues until US&nbsp;60/62 leave Missouri by way of the [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|Mississippi River bridge]] into Cairo Ill.\n\n===Illinois===\n{{main|U.S. Route 60 in Illinois}}\nUS 62 overlaps [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]] for its entire length, {{convert|0.92|mi|km|2}}, in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"ittc\">{{cite web |author= Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url= http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title= T2 GIS Data |publisher= [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] |access-date= June 2, 2006}}</ref> It crosses Illinois at its very southern tip between the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers at [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]. US&nbsp;62 enters Illinois from Missouri by means of [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|a bridge over the Mississippi River]], turning east at [[U.S. Route 51|US&nbsp;51]] with US&nbsp;51 joining the concurrency. The three routes immediately cross into Kentucky by means of [[Cairo Ohio River Bridge|crossing the Ohio River]].\n\n===Kentucky===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Kentucky}}\nUS&nbsp;62 runs right through the tourist section of Western [[Kentucky]]; between the cities of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] and [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]], it passes [[Kentucky Lake]] and [[Lake Barkley]], two large manmade lakes. From there US&nbsp;62 heads east through the cities of [[Princeton, Kentucky|Princeton]], [[Central City, Kentucky|Central City]], [[Beaver Dam, Kentucky|Beaver Dam]], [[Leitchfield, Kentucky|Leitchfield]], [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Lawrenceburg, Kentucky|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Midway, Kentucky|Midway]]. For much of this portion, US&nbsp;62 is paralleled by portions of the Kentucky Parkway System, including the [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] ([[Interstate 69 in Kentucky|I-69]]) and the [[Bluegrass Parkway]], which have taken most long-distance and freight traffic off the old US&nbsp;62 route. After passing through [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] and [[Cynthiana, Kentucky|Cynthiana]] it leaves Kentucky in [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] over the [[Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge]].\n\nUS&nbsp;62 is the only US Highway to cross the Ohio River twice.<ref group=lower-alpha>I-275 around Cincinnati is the only other numbered highway to do so.)</ref> It crosses the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, connecting the far western region of Kentucky with the southern tip of Illinois. Its other crossing over the Ohio River connects the northeastern Kentucky city of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] and the southwestern Ohio village of [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]].\n\n===Ohio===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Ohio}}\n[[File:OhioByway.JPG|upright|thumb|A US&nbsp;62 marker in [[Killbuck, Ohio]], in [[Amish]] Country, also marked as an [[Ohio Scenic Byways|Ohio Byway]] ]]\nUS&nbsp;62 enters [[Ohio]] from [[Kentucky]], crossing the [[Ohio River]] at [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]]. After the river crossing, the highway follows [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] until [[Ripley, Ohio|Ripley]] and US&nbsp;68 until just east of [[Georgetown, Ohio|Georgetown]]. From there, US&nbsp;62 enters the towns of [[Russellville, Ohio|Russellville]], [[Hillsboro, Ohio|Hillsboro]], and [[Washington Court House, Ohio|Washington Court House]]. In Washington Court House, US&nbsp;62 meets up with [[Ohio State Route 3|State Route&nbsp;3]] (SR&nbsp;3) and continues all the way into [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], passing through the towns of [[Mount Sterling, Ohio|Mount Sterling]], [[Orient, Ohio|Orient]], [[Harrisburg, Ohio|Harrisburg]], and [[Grove City, Ohio|Grove City]]. After heading toward downtown Columbus, US&nbsp;62 diverts from SR&nbsp;3 onto [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] (Broad Street) for a few blocks to Nelson Road. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrently with [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|I-670]] near [[Port Columbus International Airport]] until the eastern side of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|I-270]] where US&nbsp;62 heads toward [[Gahanna, Ohio|Gahanna]], [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], [[Johnstown, Ohio|Johnstown]], [[Utica, Ohio|Utica]], [[Millersburg, Ohio|Millersburg]], and [[Navarre, Ohio|Navarre]]. About {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} north of Navarre, US&nbsp;62 joins up with [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] into [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], where US&nbsp;62 heads north along [[Interstate 77|I-77]]. The highway passes [[West Lawn Cemetery]] and the [[McKinley National Memorial|President William McKinley memorial and tomb]] in Canton. At exit&nbsp;107B on I-77, US&nbsp;62 heads northeast to [[Alliance, Ohio|Alliance]], and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]. It leaves Ohio near [[Hubbard, Ohio|Hubbard]] and enters [[Pennsylvania]] near the interchange for [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|I-80]].\n\n===Pennsylvania===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Pennsylvania}}\nUS&nbsp;62 enters [[Pennsylvania]] from Ohio in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]]. Also, at the Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania state line, signage for US&nbsp;62 changes from an east\u2013west to north\u2013south.

US&nbsp;62 crosses the river at [[Oil City, Pennsylvania|Oil City]], at [[Tionesta, Pennsylvania|Tionesta]], and twice again in the [[Warren, Pennsylvania|Warren]] area, once near Buckaloons Recreational Area in the [[Allegheny Islands Wilderness]] region, where it is concurrent with [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]] for a short distance.\n\n===New York===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in New York}}\n[[File:US 62 south in Niagara Falls.JPG|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in Niagara Falls, just after the terminus at NY&nbsp;104]]\nWhile most of the route is an east\u2013west route, US&nbsp;62 takes a north\u2013south directionality in Pennsylvania and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is signed north\u2013south in northern Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nUS&nbsp;62 enters New York State from Pennsylvania in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], south of [[Frewsburg, New York|Frewsburg]], past which it intersects with [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]] (Southern Tier Expressway). Following a northeasterly course, US&nbsp;62 enters [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]], crosses [[Cattaraugus Creek]] to enter [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and passes through the village of [[Gowanda, New York|Gowanda]], taking a more northerly direction. At the village of [[Hamburg (village), New York|Hamburg]], US&nbsp;62 turns northeast, passing Buffalo Raceway and the [[Erie County Fair]], [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90|I-90]]), continues northward through [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] as South Park Avenue and passes through [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] as South Park Avenue and Bailey Avenue. The Bailey Avenue section from [[New York State Route 5]] (NY&nbsp;5) at the Buffalo city line to [[New York State Route 324|NY 324]] is maintained by Erie County as County Road 152.\n\nUS&nbsp;62 briefly overlaps NY&nbsp;324 (Sheridan Drive) in the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], and turns northward as Niagara Falls Boulevard, intersects [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]], then exits [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and enters [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], as US&nbsp;62 crosses the [[Erie Canal]] / [[Tonawanda Creek]] and travels into the town of [[Wheatfield, New York|Wheatfield]]. The highway intersects [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]] and turns to the northwest intersecting [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] and [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]]. On the east side of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] the route diverges into US&nbsp;62 and its parallel route, [[U.S. Route 62 Business (Niagara Falls, New York)|Business US&nbsp;62]], (formerly NY&nbsp;62A). Within the city of Niagara Falls, US&nbsp;62 runs \"backwards\", bearing west for several miles as Ferry Avenue southbound (eastbound) and Walnut Avenue northbound (westbound) and terminates on Main Street, while is still signed north\u2013south. The northern (eastern) terminus for both US&nbsp;62 and Business US&nbsp;62 is at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] (Main Street), less than {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} from the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] and U.S. Customs. The Rainbow Bridge then crosses the [[Niagara River]] into Canada, offering side-views of the famous [[Niagara Falls]].\n\n<ref>http://www.nysenate.gov/news/new-national-veterans-highway</ref> In 2009, Legislation was proposed in the NY State Legislature for a bill (S.6277-A/A.9939-A) designating all of US Route 62 in New York State as the \"National Veterans Highway\".  The measure was sponsored by then Senator William Stachowski, and Assemblyperson Francine Delmonte as proposed by the Sons of the American Legion Post 880 as a way to salute and commemorate the service and sacrifice of all veterans of the US.  The Bill was signed into law by Governor David Paterson on July 30, 2010.  The designation runs from the Pennsylvania State Line south of Frewsburg, NY to a northern terminus near the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, NY.

US&nbsp;62 runs concurrent with several highways in Arkansas including [[Interstate 49|I-49]] and [[U.S. Route 71|US&nbsp;71]] between Fayetteville and Bentonville, [[U.S. Route 412|US&nbsp;412]] through much of the state, [[U.S. Route 65|US&nbsp;65]] in the Harrison area, and with [[U.S. Route 63|US&nbsp;63]] and [[U.S. Route 67|US&nbsp;67]] (Future [[Interstate 57|I-57]]) in northeast Arkansas.\n\n===Missouri===\nUS&nbsp;62 enters Missouri from Arkansas at Whitaker Place, and proceeds more or less easterly across the Missouri Bootheel via [[Malden, Missouri|Malden]] to [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]].  Between Malden and New Madrid, US&nbsp;62 was designated as '''Route&nbsp;82''' in 1922. The part west of Malden was unnumbered until it became US&nbsp;62.  At New Madrid US&nbsp;62 begins a concurrency with US&nbsp;61.  The combined US&nbsp;61/62 goes north as far as [[Sikeston, Missouri|Sikeston]], where US&nbsp;62 resumes its easterly direction.  From Sikeston US&nbsp;62 runs east to [[Charleston, Missouri|Charleston]], where it is concurrent with Business I-57 for a short distance.  After crossing I-57, US&nbsp;62 becomes concurrent with US&nbsp;60, this concurrency continues until US&nbsp;60/62 leave Missouri by way of the [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|Mississippi River bridge]] into Cairo Ill.\n\n===Illinois===\n{{main|U.S. Route 60 in Illinois}}\nUS 62 overlaps [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]] for its entire length, {{convert|0.92|mi|km|2}}, in [[Illinois]].<ref name=\"ittc\">{{cite web |author= Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url= http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title= T2 GIS Data |publisher= [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] |access-date= June 2, 2006}}</ref> It crosses Illinois at its very southern tip between the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers at [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]. US&nbsp;62 enters Illinois from Missouri by means of [[Cairo Mississippi River Bridge|a bridge over the Mississippi River]], turning east at [[U.S. Route 51|US&nbsp;51]] with US&nbsp;51 joining the concurrency. The three routes immediately cross into Kentucky by means of [[Cairo Ohio River Bridge|crossing the Ohio River]].\n\n===Kentucky===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Kentucky}}\nUS&nbsp;62 runs right through the tourist section of Western [[Kentucky]]; between the cities of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] and [[Eddyville, Kentucky|Eddyville]], it passes [[Kentucky Lake]] and [[Lake Barkley]], two large manmade lakes. From there US&nbsp;62 heads east through the cities of [[Princeton, Kentucky|Princeton]], [[Central City, Kentucky|Central City]], [[Beaver Dam, Kentucky|Beaver Dam]], [[Leitchfield, Kentucky|Leitchfield]], [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky|Elizabethtown]], [[Bardstown, Kentucky|Bardstown]], [[Lawrenceburg, Kentucky|Lawrenceburg]] and [[Midway, Kentucky|Midway]]. For much of this portion, US&nbsp;62 is paralleled by portions of the Kentucky Parkway System, including the [[Western Kentucky Parkway]] ([[Interstate 69 in Kentucky|I-69]]) and the [[Bluegrass Parkway]], which have taken most long-distance and freight traffic off the old US&nbsp;62 route. After passing through [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] and [[Cynthiana, Kentucky|Cynthiana]] it leaves Kentucky in [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] over the [[Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge]].\n\nUS&nbsp;62 is the only US Highway to cross the Ohio River twice.<ref group=lower-alpha>I-275 around Cincinnati is the only other numbered highway to do so.)</ref> It crosses the Ohio River between Illinois and Kentucky, connecting the far western region of Kentucky with the southern tip of Illinois. Its other crossing over the Ohio River connects the northeastern Kentucky city of [[Maysville, Kentucky|Maysville]] and the southwestern Ohio village of [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]].\n\n===Ohio===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Ohio}}\n[[File:OhioByway.JPG|upright|thumb|A US&nbsp;62 marker in [[Killbuck, Ohio]], in [[Amish]] Country, also marked as an [[Ohio Scenic Byways|Ohio Byway]] ]]\nUS&nbsp;62 enters [[Ohio]] from [[Kentucky]], crossing the [[Ohio River]] at [[Aberdeen, Ohio|Aberdeen]]. After the river crossing, the highway follows [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] until [[Ripley, Ohio|Ripley]] and US&nbsp;68 until just east of [[Georgetown, Ohio|Georgetown]]. From there, US&nbsp;62 enters the towns of [[Russellville, Ohio|Russellville]], [[Hillsboro, Ohio|Hillsboro]], and [[Washington Court House, Ohio|Washington Court House]]. In Washington Court House, US&nbsp;62 meets up with [[Ohio State Route 3|State Route&nbsp;3]] (SR&nbsp;3) and continues all the way into [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], passing through the towns of [[Mount Sterling, Ohio|Mount Sterling]], [[Orient, Ohio|Orient]], [[Harrisburg, Ohio|Harrisburg]], and [[Grove City, Ohio|Grove City]]. After heading toward downtown Columbus, US&nbsp;62 diverts from SR&nbsp;3 onto [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] (Broad Street) for a few blocks to Nelson Road. US&nbsp;62 runs concurrently with [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|I-670]] near [[Port Columbus International Airport]] until the eastern side of [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|I-270]] where US&nbsp;62 heads toward [[Gahanna, Ohio|Gahanna]], [[New Albany, Ohio|New Albany]], [[Johnstown, Ohio|Johnstown]], [[Utica, Ohio|Utica]], [[Millersburg, Ohio|Millersburg]], and [[Navarre, Ohio|Navarre]]. About {{convert|2.6|mi|km}} north of Navarre, US&nbsp;62 joins up with [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] into [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], where US&nbsp;62 heads north along [[Interstate 77|I-77]]. The highway passes [[West Lawn Cemetery]] and the [[McKinley National Memorial|President William McKinley memorial and tomb]] in Canton. At exit&nbsp;107B on I-77, US&nbsp;62 heads northeast to [[Alliance, Ohio|Alliance]], and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]. It leaves Ohio near [[Hubbard, Ohio|Hubbard]] and enters [[Pennsylvania]] near the interchange for [[Interstate 80 in Pennsylvania|I-80]].\n\n===Pennsylvania===\n{{main|U.S. Route 62 in Pennsylvania}}\nUS&nbsp;62 enters [[Pennsylvania]] from Ohio in [[Sharon, Pennsylvania|Sharon]]. Also, at the Ohio\u2013Pennsylvania state line, signage for US&nbsp;62 changes from an east\u2013west to north\u2013south. US&nbsp;62 also runs north-northeast from the Ohio border towards New York.<ref name=mapguy>{{cite web |author=Mapguy |date=April 5, 2010 |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |title=End of U.S. Highway 62 |url=http://www.usends.com/60-69/062/062.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202030315/http://usends.com/60-69/062/062.html |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}{{self-published source|date=December 2014}}</ref> US&nbsp;62 passes through [[Mercer, Pennsylvania|Mercer]] and runs across country to [[Franklin, Pennsylvania|Franklin]]. At this point US&nbsp;62 enters the [[Allegheny River]] valley and follows this river for {{convert|45|mi|km}}. US&nbsp;62 crosses the river at [[Oil City, Pennsylvania|Oil City]], at [[Tionesta, Pennsylvania|Tionesta]], and twice again in the [[Warren, Pennsylvania|Warren]] area, once near Buckaloons Recreational Area in the [[Allegheny Islands Wilderness]] region, where it is concurrent with [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]] for a short distance.\n\n===New York===\n{{Main|U.S. Route 62 in New York}}\n[[File:US 62 south in Niagara Falls.JPG|thumb|US&nbsp;62 in Niagara Falls, just after the terminus at NY&nbsp;104]]\nWhile most of the route is an east\u2013west route, US&nbsp;62 takes a north\u2013south directionality in Pennsylvania and [[New York (state)|New York]]. It is signed north\u2013south in northern Pennsylvania and New York.\n\nUS&nbsp;62 enters New York State from Pennsylvania in [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua County]], south of [[Frewsburg, New York|Frewsburg]], past which it intersects with [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]] (Southern Tier Expressway). Following a northeasterly course, US&nbsp;62 enters [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]], crosses [[Cattaraugus Creek]] to enter [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and passes through the village of [[Gowanda, New York|Gowanda]], taking a more northerly direction. At the village of [[Hamburg (village), New York|Hamburg]], US&nbsp;62 turns northeast, passing Buffalo Raceway and the [[Erie County Fair]], [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90|I-90]]), continues northward through [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] as South Park Avenue and passes through [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] as South Park Avenue and Bailey Avenue. The Bailey Avenue section from [[New York State Route 5]] (NY&nbsp;5) at the Buffalo city line to [[New York State Route 324|NY 324]] is maintained by Erie County as County Road 152.\n\nUS&nbsp;62 briefly overlaps NY&nbsp;324 (Sheridan Drive) in the town of [[Amherst, New York|Amherst]], and turns northward as Niagara Falls Boulevard, intersects [[Interstate 290 (New York)|I-290]], then exits [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] and enters [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], as US&nbsp;62 crosses the [[Erie Canal]] / [[Tonawanda Creek]] and travels into the town of [[Wheatfield, New York|Wheatfield]]. The highway intersects [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]] and turns to the northwest intersecting [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] and [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]]. On the east side of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] the route diverges into US&nbsp;62 and its parallel route, [[U.S. Route 62 Business (Niagara Falls, New York)|Business US&nbsp;62]], (formerly NY&nbsp;62A). Within the city of Niagara Falls, US&nbsp;62 runs \"backwards\", bearing west for several miles as Ferry Avenue southbound (eastbound) and Walnut Avenue northbound (westbound) and terminates on Main Street, while is still signed north\u2013south. The northern (eastern) terminus for both US&nbsp;62 and Business US&nbsp;62 is at [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] (Main Street), less than {{convert|2,000|ft|m}} from the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)|Rainbow Bridge]] and U.S. Customs. The Rainbow Bridge then crosses the [[Niagara River]] into Canada, offering side-views of the famous [[Niagara Falls]].\n\n<ref>http://www.nysenate.gov/news/new-national-veterans-highway</ref> In 2009, Legislation was proposed in the NY State Legislature for a bill (S.6277-A/A.9939-A) designating all of US Route 62 in New York State as the \"National Veterans Highway\".  The measure was sponsored by then Senator William Stachowski, and Assemblyperson Francine Delmonte as proposed by the Sons of the American Legion Post 880 as a way to salute and commemorate the service and sacrifice of all veterans of the US.  The Bill was signed into law by Governor David Paterson on July 30, 2010.  The designation runs from the Pennsylvania State Line south of Frewsburg, NY to a northern terminus near the Rainbow Bridge in Niagara Falls, NY.  Designations have also been successful in Illinois and Kentucky to this point.\n\n==Future==\nIn Ohio, there are plans to reroute US&nbsp;62 onto a divided highway from Alliance to [[Salem, Ohio|Salem]], part of a larger relocation of both US&nbsp;62 and [[Ohio State Route 14|SR&nbsp;14]], then from downtown Youngstown to I-80 as part of the \"Hubbard Arterial\".<ref>[http://www.eastgatecog.org/reg-trac.asp Eastgate Regional Council of Governments: T.R.A.C.
