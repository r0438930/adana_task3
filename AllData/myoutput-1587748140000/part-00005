''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.\n\nZipf's law was originally formulated in terms of [[quantitative linguistics]], stating that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the [[Brown Corpus]].<ref>{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gen\u00e7ay|pages=133\u2013153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

The goodness-of-fit tests yield that only about 15% of the texts are statistically compatible with this form of Zipf's law. Slight variations in the definition of Zipf's law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Moreno-S\u00e1nchez|first = I|last2 = Font-Clos|first2 = F|last3 = Corral|first3 = A|date = 2016|title = Large-Scale Analysis of Zipf's Law in English Texts|url =|journal = PLOS One|volume = 11|issue = 1|pages = e0147073|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0147073|pmid =26800025|pmc = 4723055|access-date =|arxiv = 1509.04486}}</ref>\n\nIn the example of the frequency of words in the English language, ''N'' is the number of words in the English language and, if we use the classic version of Zipf's law, the exponent ''s'' is 1. ''f''(''k'';&nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.\n\nThe law may also be written:\n\n:<math>f(k;s,N)=\\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}</math>\n\nwhere ''H<sub>N,s</sub>'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].\n\nThe simplest case of Zipf's law is a \"{{sfrac|1|''f''}} function.\" Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur half as often as the first, the third most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|3}} as often as the first, and the ''n''th most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|''n''}} as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.\n\nIn human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.\n\nAs long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 then\n:<math>\\zeta (s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}<\\infty. \\!</math>\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].\n\n==Statistical explanation==\n\n[[File:Zipf 30wiki en labels.png|thumbnail|A plot of the rank versus frequency for the first 10 million words in 30 Wikipedias (dumps from October 2015) in a [[log-log]] scale.]]\n\nAlthough Zipf's Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO'S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF'S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102\u2013108 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}</ref> the reason is still not well understood.<ref>[[L\u00e9on Brillouin]], ''La science et la th\u00e9orie de l'information'', 1959, r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9 en 1988, traduction anglaise r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9e en 2004</ref> However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts.

The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&nbsp; is the total number of the word's occurrences. Most popular words are \"the\", \"of\" and \"and\", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/''x'')&nbsp; line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/''x''<sup>0.5</sup>) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'')<sup>2.0</sup>) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]\n\n''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of \"rank data\", in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''<sup>''s''</sup>''\u03b6''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with \"zeta distribution\", since probability distributions are sometimes called \"laws\". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.\n\nA generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f(k;N,q,s)=\\frac{[\\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\\,</math>\n\nThe \"constant\" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].<ref name=Powers1998/>\n\nZipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.<ref name=\"Adamic2000\"/>\n\nThe Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N.

''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.\n\nZipf's law was originally formulated in terms of [[quantitative linguistics]], stating that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the [[Brown Corpus]].<ref>{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gen\u00e7ay|pages=133\u2013153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

''f''(''k'';&nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.\n\nThe law may also be written:\n\n:<math>f(k;s,N)=\\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}</math>\n\nwhere ''H<sub>N,s</sub>'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].\n\nThe simplest case of Zipf's law is a \"{{sfrac|1|''f''}} function.\" Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur half as often as the first, the third most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|3}} as often as the first, and the ''n''th most common frequency will occur {{sfrac|1|''n''}} as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.\n\nIn human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.\n\nAs long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 then\n:<math>\\zeta (s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}<\\infty. \\!</math>\nwhere ''\u03b6'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].\n\n==Statistical explanation==\n\n[[File:Zipf 30wiki en labels.png|thumbnail|A plot of the rank versus frequency for the first 10 million words in 30 Wikipedias (dumps from October 2015) in a [[log-log]] scale.]]\n\nAlthough Zipf's Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],<ref>{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO'S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF'S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102\u2013108 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 }}</ref> the reason is still not well understood.<ref>[[L\u00e9on Brillouin]], ''La science et la th\u00e9orie de l'information'', 1959, r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9 en 1988, traduction anglaise r\u00e9\u00e9dit\u00e9e en 2004</ref> However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts.

The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&nbsp; is the total number of the word's occurrences. Most popular words are \"the\", \"of\" and \"and\", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/''x'')&nbsp; line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/''x''<sup>0.5</sup>) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x'')<sup>2.0</sup>) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]\n\n''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of \"rank data\", in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''<sup>''s''</sup>''\u03b6''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with \"zeta distribution\", since probability distributions are sometimes called \"laws\". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.\n\nA generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoit Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:\n\n:<math>f(k;N,q,s)=\\frac{[\\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\\,</math>\n\nThe \"constant\" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf\u2013Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].<ref name=Powers1998/>\n\nZipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.<ref name=\"Adamic2000\"/>\n\nThe Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N.

Hence, Zipf law for natural numbers: <math>\\Pr(x) \\approx 1/x</math> is equivalent with number <math>x</math> containing <math>\\log_2(x)</math> bits of information. To add information from a symbol of probability <math>p</math> into information already stored in a natural number <math>x</math>, we should go to <math>x'</math> such that <math>\\log_2(x') \\approx \\log_2(x) + \\log_2(1/p)</math>, or equivalently <math>x' \\approx x/p</math>. For instance, in standard binary system we would have <math>x' = 2x + s</math>, what is optimal for <math>\\Pr(s=0) = \\Pr(s=1) = 1/2</math> probability distribution. Using <math>x' \\approx x/p</math> rule for a general probability distribution is the base of [[Asymmetric Numeral Systems]] family of  [[entropy coding]] methods used in [[data compression]], which state distribution is also governed by Zipf law.\n\nZipf's law also has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora.<ref>{{cite conference |url=https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |title=Parallel Document Identification using Zipf's Law |last1=Mohammadi |first1=Mehdi |date=2016 |book-title=Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora |pages=21\u201325 |location=Portoro\u017e, Slovenia |conference=LREC 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154706/https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-23 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Brevity law]]\n* [[Heaps' law]]\n* [[Menzerath's law]]\n* [[Bradford's law]]\n* [[Benford's law]]\n* [[Demographic gravitation]]\n* [[Frequency list]]\n* [[Gibrat's law]]\n* [[Hapax legomenon]]\n* [[Lorenz curve]]\n* [[Lotka's law]]\n* [[Pareto distribution]]\n* [[Pareto principle]], a.k.a. the \"80\u201320 rule\"\n* [[Principle of least effort]]\n* [[Price's law]]\n* [[Rank-size distribution]]\n* [[King effect]]\n* [[Stigler's law of eponymy]]\n* [[1% rule (Internet culture)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nPrimary:\n* [[George K.
