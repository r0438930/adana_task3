The municipality is unilingually [[Finnish language|Finnish]].\n\n==History==\nIn the early 14th century, permanent settlement began to spread to the Lapuanjoki Valley. Residents came from, among other areas, the settlement center of Suur-Sastamala in Upper Satakunta, which had good land and water connections to the north. The focus of Ostrobothnia's settlement was initially on the lower reaches of the Kyr\u00f6njoki River. The proximity to the sea of the Kvarken area, which is rich in natural resources, was especially attractive. Lapua at that time had some Lapps who considered the region their wilderness area. The name Lapuan was probably given by the coastal Swedes precisely because of the Lapps who lived in the area.\n\nThe [[Battle of Lapua]] was fought between Swedish and [[Russia]]n forces near the outskirts of the town on 14 July 1808 as part of the [[Finnish War]].\nLapua is the seat of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran]] [[Diocese of Lapua]]. The [[Lapua Cathedral]], designed by [[Carl Ludvig Engel]], was built in 1827. In the 1930s the radical [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] ''[[Lapua Movement]]'' was founded and named after the town.\n\n== Lapua State Cartridge Factory ==\nLapua is also home to a large [[ammunition]] factory, which commenced operations in 1927 as the ''State Cartridge Factory''.  This factory was the primary supplier of [[ammunition]] to the [[Finnish Army]] during the [[Winter War]] and [[Continuation War|World War II]]. [[Lapua Cartridge Factory explosion|An explosion occurred]] in a warehouse of this factory on 13 April 1976, resulting in the deaths of 40 employees, mainly women. Sixty children lost a parent in the disaster. This is the worst accidental disaster in Finland's modern history.  After the explosion, the factory was relocated {{convert|5|km|0}} away from the town centre and continues production today as part of the Nordic Ammunition Group ([[Nammo]]) as [[Nammo Lapua]]. The original site of the factory and the surviving buildings are now an arts centre, a library and a theater.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in
