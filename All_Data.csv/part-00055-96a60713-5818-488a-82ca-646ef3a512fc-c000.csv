[[File:Godhuli, Mewar, ca1813.jpg|thumb|''Godhuli'', [[Mewar]], ca. 1813]]
'''Rajput painting''', also called  '''Rajasthani painting''', evolved and flourished in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]] in northern India, mainly during the 17th and 18th centuries.  Artists trained in the tradition of the [[Mughal miniature]] were dispersed from the imperial Mughal court, and developed styles also drawing from local traditions of painting, especially those illustrating the Hindu religious epics, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Ramayana]]''.  Each Rajputana kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|Miniatures]] in manuscripts or single sheets to be kept in albums were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but many paintings were done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelis, particularly, the havelis of [[Shekhawati]], the forts and palaces built by [[Shekhawat]] Rajputs.

Subjects varied, but portraits of the ruling family, often engaged in hunting or their daily activities, were generally popular, as were narrative scenes from the epics or [[Hindu mythology]], as well as some [[genre painting|genre scenes]] of unnamed people.
 
The colours were extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones.  Gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colours was a lengthy process, sometimes taking 2 weeks. Brushes used were very fine.

== Content ==
While there exist a plethora of themes in Rajput paintings, a common motif found throughout Rajput works is the purposeful manipulation of space. In particular, the inclusion of fuller spaces is meant to emphasize the lack of boundaries and inseparability of characters and landscapes. In this way, the individuality of physical characters is almost rejected, allowing both the depicted backgrounds and human figures to be equally expressive.

Outside of a purely artistic standpoint, Rajput paintings were often politically charged and commented on social values of the time. Mewar's rulers wanted these painting to portray their ambitions and establish their legacy. Therefore, paintings were often indicative of a ruler's legacy or their changes made to better society.

Both of these factors clearly distinguish Rajput paintings from Mughal works. While, from a chronological standpoint, both of these cultures clashed with one another, Rajput paintings only superficially adopted Mughal fashion and cultural standards. Elements, such as precise likenesses in portraiture, utilized by popular Mughal artists ([[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]], Hashim, etc.) are not found in Rajput works. Likewise, Rajput techniques are not predominantly seen in [[Mughal painting]]s: \"At the opening of the eighteenth century, therefore, Rajput painting remains recognizably different in intent from traditional Mughal attitudes\"<ref>Beach, 175</ref>

In the late 16th Century, Rajput art schools began to develop distinctive styles, combining indigenous as well as foreign influences such as Persian, Mughal, Chinese and European.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neeraj|first=Jai Singh|title=Splendour Of Rajasthani Painting|year=1991|publisher=Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|pages=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGjTjmL29VIC&pg=PP15&lpg=PP15&dq=shekhawati+painting&source=bl&ots=-1KPo1-Rmd&sig=uBKBi0BtGlqniNoZhs8NxBjGbbs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=djcvUK6POdHRrQfRxIG4Bw&ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=shekhawati%20painting&f=false}}</ref> Rajasthani painting consists of four principal schools that have within them several artistic styles and substyles that can be traced to the various princely states that patronised these artists. The four principal schools are:
# The [[Mewar]] school that contains the [[Chavand, Rajasthan|Chavand]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Devgarh, Rajasthan|Devgarh]], [[Udaipur]] and [[Sawar]] styles of painting
# The [[Marwar]] school comprising the [[Kishangarh]], [[Bikaner style of painting]] from [[Bikaner]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Nagaur]], [[Pali, Rajasthan|Pali]] and [[Ghanerao]] styles
# The [[Hadoti]] school with the [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], [[Bundi]] and [[Jhalawar State|Jhalawar]] styles and
# The Dhundar school of [[Amber, India|Amber]], [[Jaipur]], [[Shekhawati painting]] and [[Uniara]] styles of painting.

The [[Kangra painting|Kangra]] and [[Kullu]] schools of art are also part of Rajput painting. [[Nainsukh]] is a famous artist of [[Pahari painting]], working for Rajput princes who then ruled that far north.

Economic prosperity of commercial community and revival of “Vaisnavism” and the growth of Bhakti Cult were the major factors that contributed greatly to the development of Rajasthani paintings. In the beginning this style was greatly influenced by religious followers like Ramanuja, Meerabai, Tulsidas, Sri Chaitanya, Kabir and Ramanand.

All of Rajputana was affected by the attack of the Mughals but Mewar did not come under their control till the last. This was the reason that Rajasthani school flourished first in Mewar, (the purest form and later on in), Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota- Kalam, Kishangarh, Bikaner and other places of Rajasthan.

In the late 16th Century, Rajput art schools began to develop distinctive styles, combining indigenous as well as foreign influences such as Persian, Mughal, Chinese and European.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neeraj|first=Jai Singh|title=Splendour Of Rajasthani Painting|year=1991|publisher=Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|pages=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PGjTjmL29VIC&pg=PP15&lpg=PP15&dq=shekhawati+painting&source=bl&ots=-1KPo1-Rmd&sig=uBKBi0BtGlqniNoZhs8NxBjGbbs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=djcvUK6POdHRrQfRxIG4Bw&ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=shekhawati%20painting&f=false}}</ref> Rajasthani painting consists of four principal schools that have within them several artistic styles and substyles that can be traced to the various princely states that patronised these artists. The four principal schools are:
# The [[Mewar]] school that contains the [[Chavand, Rajasthan|Chavand]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Devgarh, Rajasthan|Devgarh]], [[Udaipur]] and [[Sawar]] styles of painting
# The [[Marwar]] school comprising the [[Kishangarh]], [[Bikaner style of painting]] from [[Bikaner]], [[Jodhpur]], [[Nagaur]], [[Pali]] and [[Ghanerao]] styles
# The [[Hadoti]] school with the [[Kota, Rajasthan|Kota]], [[Bundi]] and [[Jhalawar State|Jhalawar]] styles and
# The Dhundar school of [[Amber, India|Amber]], [[Jaipur]], [[Shekhawati painting]] and [[Uniara]] styles of painting.

The [[Kangra painting|Kangra]] and [[Kullu]] schools of art are also part of Rajput painting. [[Nainsukh]] is a famous artist of [[Pahari painting]], working for Rajput princes who then ruled that far north.

Economic prosperity of commercial community and revival of “Vaisnavism” and the growth of Bhakti Cult were the major factors that contributed greatly to the development of Rajasthani paintings. In the beginning this style was greatly influenced by religious followers like Ramanuja, Meerabai, Tulsidas, Sri Chaitanya, Kabir and Ramanand.

All of Rajputana was affected by the attack of the Mughals but Mewar did not come under their control till the last. This was the reason that Rajasthani school flourished first in Mewar, (the purest form and later on in), Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bundi, Kota- Kalam, Kishangarh, Bikaner and other places of Rajasthan.

'''Regnecentralen''' ('''RC''') was the first [[Denmark|Danish]] [[computer]] company, founded on October 12, 1955. Through the 1950s and 1960s, they designed a series of computers, originally for their own use, and later to be sold commercially. Descendants of these systems sold well into the 1980s. They also developed a series of high-speed [[paper tape]] machines, and produced [[Data General Nova]] machines under license.

==Genesis==

What would become RC began as an advisory board formed by the Danish ''Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber'' (''Academy of Applied Sciences'') to keep abreast of developments in modern electronic [[Computer|computing devices]] taking place in other countries. After several years in the advisory role, in 1952 they decided to form a computing [[service bureau]] for Danish government, military and research uses. Led by Niels Ivar Bech, the group was also given the details of the [[BESK]] machine being designed at the Swedish Mathematical Center (Matematikmaskinnamndens Arbetsgrupp).

The group decided to build their own version of the BESK to run the bureau, and formed Regnecentralen in October 1955 to complete and run the machine. The result was the [[DASK]], a [[vacuum tube]]-based machine that completed construction in 1956 and went into full operation in February 1957. DASK was followed in 1961 by the fully [[transistor]]ized GIER, used for similar tasks. GIER is an acronym for \"[[Geodætisk Institut]]s Elektroniske Regnemaskine\" (Institute of Geodetics Electronic Calculator) and was introduced there on September 14, 1961. GIER proved to be a useful machine, and went on to be used at many Danish universities. Bech also sold GIER machines to the [[Eastern Bloc]] nations, starting with [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]] and [[Bulgaria]], and later [[Romania]], the [[East Germany]], and [[Yugoslavia]].

RC was also home to [[Peter Naur]], and DASK and GIER became well known for their role in the development of the famous programming language [[ALGOL]]. After the first European ALGOL conference in 1959, RC began an effort to produce a series of compilers, completing one for the DASK in September 1961. A version for the GIER followed in August 1962. Christian Andersen and Peter Schyum Poulsen, another RC employee, wrote the first introductory text on the language, ''Everyman's Desk ALGOL'', in 1961.

==Peripheral business==

To support higher throughput at their own service bureau, RC developed several high-speed [[input/output]] devices. One of their most popular was the [[RC 2000]] [[paper tape]] reader, introduced in 1963. Feeding the tape at 5 meters per second, the 2000 could read 2,000 characters per second (CPS), storing the results in a buffer while the computer periodically read the data back out instead of stopping the tape to wait for the computer to get ready. The machine was later upgraded as the RC 2500, increasing speed to almost 7 meters a second, improving read speed to 2500 CPS. The RC 2000/2500 became a major product for RC during the 1960s, selling 1,500 examples around the world. Several related devices were added to the line, including a high-speed punch and a dedicated data conversion machine that would \"massage\" data between formats to ease the burden on the host computer.

In 1964 Regnecentralen was taken public. Most of the firm's shares were held by its biggest customers.

==New computers==

In the mid-1960s, RC began the design of a small [[integrated circuit]]-based computer system for industrial control and [[automation]] needs, initially to fill a request by a Danish company to automate a chemical factory they were building in [[Poland]]. The [[RC 4000 multiprogramming system|RC 4000]] design emerged in 1966 and was completed for the factory the next year. When combined with appropriate [[peripheral]]s, almost always including an RC 2000 along with several rebranded devices from other companies, the RC 4000 was a highly reliable [[minicomputer]], and went on to be sold across Europe. The [[RC 8000]] from the mid-1970s used newer-generation [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) to shrink the RC 4000 into a single [[rack-mount]] system. The last in the series, the [[RC 9000]], further shrunk the machine and improved performance to about 4 [[Million instructions per second|MIPS]], and was sold in versions that could run either RC 8000 programs, or [[Unix]].

The RC 4000 is famous for its [[operating system]], developed by [[Per Brinch Hansen]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=RC 4000 Computer Software: Multiprogramming System |last=Brinch Hansen |first=Per |publisher=Regnecentralen |year=1969 |isbn= |location=|pages=|url=http://brinch-hansen.net/papers/1969c.pdf}}</ref> Known as the [[RC 4000 multiprogramming system]], it is the first real-world example of a system using a very simple kernel along with a variety of user-selected programs that built up the system as a whole.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://brinch-hansen.net/papers/1970a.pdf|title=The nucleus of a multiprogramming system|last=Brinch Hansen|first=Per|date=April 1970|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=13|issue=4|pages=238–241|doi=10.1145/362258.362278|pmid=|access-date=|citeseerx=10.1.1.105.4204}}</ref> Today this concept is known as a [[microkernel]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Per Brinch Hansen • IEEE Computer Society|url=http://www.computer.org/web/awards/pioneer-per-hansen|website=www.computer.org|accessdate=2015-12-15}}</ref> and efforts to correct for microkernels' poor performance formed the basis of most OS research through the 1970s and 1980s.

[[File:Hillebrandt regnecentralen rc759-piccoline.jpg|thumb|right|175px|A Regnecentralen RC-759 Piccoline, with [[floppy disk]] drive, photographed by Thomas Hillebrandt]]

RC also began selling the [[Data General Nova]] under license in 1970 as the [[RC 7000]], later introducing their own updated version as the [[RC 3600]] the next year. This series filled a niche similar to the RC 4000, but for much smaller installations. The RC 3600 became a fixture of many Danish schools and universities.

During the 1980s, RC produced the [[RC 700]] Piccolo and [[RC 759]] Piccoline systems, which were sold to Danish schools mostly, and to some businesses in Denmark and abroad. The Piccolo was powered by the [[Zilog]] [[Z80A]] CPU, while the Piccoline was powered by the [[Intel]] [[80186]] processor.

Regnecentralen was acquired by [[International Computers Limited]] (ICL) in 1989.

Added new sections and more information,safe,Exiao57,"'''[[HVAC]]''' ('''H'''eating, '''V'''entilation and '''A'''ir '''C'''onditioning) equipment needs a control system to regulate the operation of a heating and/or air conditioning system. Usually a sensing device is used to compare the actual state (e.g. temperature) with a target state. Then the control system draws a conclusion what action has to be taken (e.g. start the blower).

==Direct digital control==
Central controllers and most terminal unit controllers are programmable, meaning the [[Direct Digital Control|direct digital control]] program code may be customized for the intended use. The program features include time schedules, [[Set point (control system)|setpoint]]s, controllers, logic, timers, trend logs, and alarms. The unit controllers typically have analog and digital inputs that allow measurement of the variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and [[analog signal|analog]] and [[Digital data|digital]] outputs for control of the transport medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). Digital inputs are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device. Digital outputs are typically relay contacts used to start and stop equipment, and analog outputs are typically voltage or current signals to control the movement of the medium (air/water/steam) control devices such as valves, dampers, and motors.

Groups of DDC controllers, networked or not, form a layer of system themselves. This \"subsystem\" is vital to the performance and basic operation of the overall HVAC system. The DDC system is the \"brain\" of the HVAC system. It dictates the position of every damper and valve in a system. It determines which fans, pumps, and chiller run and at what speed or capacity. With this configurable intelligency in this \"brain\", we are moving to the concept of building automation.<ref>[http://xinca.com/?p=386 Role on DDC Systems in Building Commissioning]</ref>

==Building Automation System==
More complex HVAC systems can interface to [[Building automation|Building Automation System (BAS)]] to allow the building owners to have more control over the heating or cooling units. The building owner can monitor the system and respond to alarms generated by the system from local or remote locations. The system can be scheduled for occupancy or the configuration can be changed from the BAS. Sometimes the BAS is directly controlling the HVAC components.
Depending on the BAS different interfaces can be used.<ref>{{cite web |last=KMC Controls |title=Understanding Building Automation and Control Systems |url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/products/Understanding_Building_Automation_and_Control_Systems.aspx |access-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519124213/http://www.kmccontrols.com/products/Understanding_Building_Automation_and_Control_Systems.aspx |archive-date=19 May 2013 |df= }}</ref>

Today, there are also dedicated gateways that connect advanced VRV / VRF and Split HVAC Systems with Home Automation and BMS (Building Management Systems) controllers for centralized control and monitoring, obviating the need to purchase more complex and expensive HVAC systems. In addition, such gateway solutions are capable of providing remote control operation of all HVAC indoor units over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.<ref name=hvac>{{cite web|title=CEDIA Find: Cool Automation Integrates Smart Air Conditioners with Third-Party Control Systems|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/cedia_find_cool_automation_integrates_smart_air_conditioners_with_third_par/|publisher=CEPro|accessdate=16 Jun 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617125355/http://www.cepro.com/article/cedia_find_cool_automation_integrates_smart_air_conditioners_with_third_par/|archive-date=17 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Cost and Efficiency ==
Many people do not have a Heating, Ventilation, and Air Condition (HVAC) system in their homes because it is too(1) expensive. However according to this article ''Save Money Through Energy Efficiency(2)'', HVAC is not as expensive as one(3) may think it is<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17897784AFB67270.%2529|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|last=The Bowling Green State University|first=|date=January 20, 2020|website=BG news|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. This article ''Save Money Through Energy Efficiency(2)'' tells us that the main thing to(3) look for when shopping for a HVAC system is to make sure it runs efficiently. One thing to always look for when in the market of a new HVAC system is the energy guide sticker on the machine<ref name=\":0\" />. Although many might choose to not believe that sticker and that it is just there to help with the sales, history shows that many of the newer HVAC systems with the yellow energy guide stickers help save customers hundreds to thousands of dollars depending on how much they use their HVAC system<ref name=\":0\" />. On the yellow energy guide sticker on many of the newer systems, it displays the average(3) cost to run that machine. Once a customer(3) has found the perfect HVAC system, the customer(3) should run it monthly if it is(3) only put into(1) use during specific times of(1) year. It is recommended that if an(3) HVAC system is not being used each month, that it(3) should be turned(1) on and left(1) running for ten to fifteen minutes<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17999DF0E0D40D80.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. On the other hand if the customer is(3) somebody who runs their(3) HVAC system frequently, it is really important to maintain(1) it. Maintenance on an(1) HVAC system includes changing out the air filter, inspecting the areas where air intake takes place,and check for leaks<ref name=\":1\" />. Doing these three steps are super essential and is the key to keeping an(3) HVAC system running for a long time. A customer(3) should do these three steps every couple of months or when it is suspected problem(1)(3) with the(3) HVAC system<ref name=\":1\" />. Some signs that could lead to a potential problem(1)(3) is if the(3) HVAC system does not provide air cool enough<ref name=\":1\" />. That could be due to a leakage in the cooling fluids. Another sign that could mean that the(3) HVAC system is not running perfectly fine is if there is a bad smell to the air that it is providing. That often means that the(3) air filters need to be replaced. Changing the air filters(1)(3) on an(3) HVAC system is really important because they are(1) exposed to a lot of(1) dust depending on where your HVAC system is and it could build up dust from simply just sitting in one's(3) home.

== Design, Modeling, and Marketing ==
Most HVAC systems are used for the same purpose but designed differently<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.proquest.com/products-services/ebooks/ebooks-main.html|title=Products - Ebook Central®|website=www.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. All HVAC systems have an intake, air filter, and air conditioning liquid. However when designing HVAC systems, many engineers design it for a specific(1)(3) setting and/or(1) purpose. When engineers are designing an(1) HVAC system, they try their best to make it compact while still being able to perform at the highest level(1) and experiment with(1) different ways to make HVAC systems(1) as efficient as possible. Even through all the hardships that come from designing a HVAC system, many Mechanical Engineers in particular have a passion for doing.(4) Although it may be hard to get your sales after designing a new HVAC system, marketing the product is very important.(4) The biggest concern that customers have when in the market looking for a new HVAC system is price and reliability<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/17865A6BD8DFB4D0.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. 

== HVAC In Homes ==
Due to the high cost of owning a HVAC system at home, many people do not have one. Although it may be expensive, there are benefits from owning a HVAC system. The main benefit from having an HVAC system installed at home are the health benefits<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/user/login?destination=document-view%3Fp%3DAWNB%26docref%3Dnews/177AAE9EDBD974A0.|title=User account {{!}} NewsBank|website=infoweb.newsbank.com|access-date=2020-03-23}}</ref>. During the summer season when it is hot, many people would open the windows to allow fresh air in. However there are contaminants from the air coming into your house that can lead to sickness for you and your family. What an HVAC system would help do is filter out all the dirty particles and contaminants and ensure that you are indeed breathing in fresh air<ref name=\":2\" />.  

==History==
It was natural that the first HVAC controllers would be [[pneumatic]] since engineers understood fluid control. Thus, [[mechanical engineer]]s could use their experience with the properties of steam and air to control the flow of heated or cooled air.

After the control of air flow and temperature was standardized, the use of electromechanical relays in [[ladder logic]] to switch [[Zone damper|damper]]s became standardized. Eventually, the relays became electronic switches, as [[transistor]]s eventually could handle greater current loads. By 1985, pneumatic controls could no longer compete with this new technology although pneumatic control systems (sometimes decades old) are still common in many older buildings.<ref>{{cite web|last=KMC Controls|title=Pneumatic to Digital: Open System Conversions|url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/images/agiods_files/downloads/Pneumatics_Digital_Conversion_White_Paper.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>

By the year 2000, computerized controllers were common. Today, some of these controllers can even be accessed by web browsers, which need no longer be in the same building as the HVAC equipment. This allows some [[economies of scale]], as a single operations center can easily monitor multiple buildings.

[[Category:Building automation]]
[[Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning]]","'''[[HVAC]]''' ('''H'''eating, '''V'''entilation and '''A'''ir '''C'''onditioning) equipment needs a control system to regulate the operation of a heating and/or air conditioning system. Usually a sensing device is used to compare the actual state (e.g. temperature) with a target state. Then the control system draws a conclusion what action has to be taken (e.g. start the blower).

==Direct digital control==
Central controllers and most terminal unit controllers are programmable, meaning the [[Direct Digital Control|direct digital control]] program code may be customized for the intended use. The program features include time schedules, [[Set point (control system)|setpoint]]s, controllers, logic, timers, trend logs, and alarms. The unit controllers typically have analog and digital inputs that allow measurement of the variable (temperature, humidity, or pressure) and [[analog signal|analog]] and [[Digital data|digital]] outputs for control of the transport medium (hot/cold water and/or steam). Digital inputs are typically (dry) contacts from a control device, and analog inputs are typically a voltage or current measurement from a variable (temperature, humidity, velocity, or pressure) sensing device. Digital outputs are typically relay contacts used to start and stop equipment, and analog outputs are typically voltage or current signals to control the movement of the medium (air/water/steam) control devices such as valves, dampers, and motors.

Groups of DDC controllers, networked or not, form a layer of system themselves. This \"subsystem\" is vital to the performance and basic operation of the overall HVAC system. The DDC system is the \"brain\" of the HVAC system. It dictates the position of every damper and valve in a system. It determines which fans, pumps, and chiller run and at what speed or capacity. With this configurable intelligency in this \"brain\", we are moving to the concept of building automation.<ref>[http://xinca.com/?p=386 Role on DDC Systems in Building Commissioning]</ref>

==Building Automation System==
More complex HVAC systems can interface to [[Building automation|Building Automation System (BAS)]] to allow the building owners to have more control over the heating or cooling units. The building owner can monitor the system and respond to alarms generated by the system from local or remote locations. The system can be scheduled for occupancy or the configuration can be changed from the BAS. Sometimes the BAS is directly controlling the HVAC components.
Depending on the BAS different interfaces can be used.<ref>{{cite web |last=KMC Controls |title=Understanding Building Automation and Control Systems |url=http://www.kmccontrols.com/products/Understanding_Building_Automation_and_Control_Systems.aspx |access-date=12 March 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519124213/http://www.kmccontrols.com/products/Understanding_Building_Automation_and_Control_Systems.aspx |archive-date=19 May 2013 |df= }}</ref>

Today, there are also dedicated gateways that connect advanced VRV / VRF and Split HVAC Systems with Home Automation and BMS (Building Management Systems) controllers for centralized control and monitoring, obviating the need to purchase more complex and expensive HVAC systems. In addition, such gateway solutions are capable of providing remote control operation of all HVAC indoor units over the internet incorporating a simple and friendly user interface.<ref name=hvac>{{cite web|title=CEDIA Find: Cool Automation Integrates Smart Air Conditioners with Third-Party Control Systems|url=http://www.cepro.com/article/cedia_find_cool_automation_integrates_smart_air_conditioners_with_third_par/|publisher=CEPro|accessdate=16 Jun 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617125355/http://www.cepro.com/article/cedia_find_cool_automation_integrates_smart_air_conditioners_with_third_par/|archive-date=17 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Acetal general structure.svg|thumb|Generic structure of acetals]]
An '''acetal''' is a [[functional group]] with the connectivity R<sub>2</sub>C(OR')<sub>2</sub>). Here, the R groups can be organic fragments (a carbon atom, with arbitrary other atoms attached to that) or [[hydrogen]], while the R' groups must be organic fragments not hydrogen. The two R' groups can be equivalent to each other (a \"symmetric acetal\") or not (a \"mixed acetal\"). Acetals are formed from and convertible to [[aldehyde]]s or [[ketone]]s and have the same [[oxidation state]] at the central carbon, but have substantially different chemical stability and reactivity as compared to the analogous [[carbonyl]] compounds. The central carbon atom has four bonds to it, and is therefore [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] and has [[tetrahedral geometry]].

The term '''ketal''' is sometimes used to identify structures associated with [[ketone]]s (both R groups organic fragments rather than hydrogen) rather than [[aldehyde]]s and, historically, the term '''acetal''' was used specifically for the aldehyde-related cases (having at least one hydrogen in place of an R on the central carbon).<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=ketals|file=K03376}}</ref>  The IUPAC originally deprecated the usage of the word ketal altogether, but has since reversed its decision.  However, in contrast to historical usage, ketals are now a subset of acetals, a term that now encompasses all both aldehyde- and ketone-derived structures.

If one of the R groups has an oxygen as the first atom (that is, there are more than two oxygens single-bonded to the central carbon), the functional group is instead an [[orthoester]]. In contrast to variations of R, both R' groups are organic fragments. If one R' is a hydrogen, the functional group is instead a [[hemiacetal]], while if both are H, the functional group is a ketone [[hydrate]] or aldehyde hydrate.

Formation of an acetal occurs when the [[hydroxyl]] group of a [[hemiacetal]] becomes [[protonation|protonated]] and is lost as water. The [[carbocation]] that is produced is then rapidly attacked by a molecule of [[alcohol]]. Loss of the proton from the attached alcohol gives the acetal.

Acetals are stable compared to hemiacetals but their formation is a reversible [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] as with [[ester]]s. As a reaction to create an acetal proceeds, water must be removed from the reaction mixture, for example, with a [[Dean–Stark apparatus]], lest it [[hydrolyse]] the product back to the hemiacetal. The formation of acetals reduces the total number of molecules present (carbonyl + 2 alcohol → acetal + water) and therefore is generally not favourable with regards to [[entropy]]. One situation where it is not entropically unfavourable is when a single [[diol]] molecule is used rather than two separate alcohol molecules (carbonyl + diol → acetal + water). Another way to avoid the entropic cost is to perform the synthesis by acetal exchange, using a pre-existing acetal-type reagent as the OR'-group donor rather than simple addition of alcohols themselves. One type of reagent used for this method is an orthoester. In this case, water produced along with the acetal product is destroyed when it hydrolyses residual orthoester molecules, and this [[side reaction]] also produces more alcohol to be used in the main reaction.

Acetals are used as [[protecting group]]s for [[carbonyl]] groups in organic synthesis because they are stable with respect to hydrolysis by [[base (chemistry)|bases]] and with respect to many oxidizing and reducing agents. They can either protect the carbonyl in a molecule (by temporarily reacting it with an alcohol) or a diol (by temporarily reacting it with a carbonyl). That is, either the carbonyl, or the alcohols, or both could be part of the molecule whose reactivity is to be controlled.

Various specific carbonyl compounds have special names for their acetal forms. For example, an acetal formed from [[formaldehyde]] (two hydrogens attached to the central carbon) is sometimes called a ''formal''<ref>Morrison, Robert T. and Boyd, Robert N., \"Organic Chemistry (6th ed)\". p683. Prentice-Hall Inc (1992).</ref> or the [[methylenedioxy]] group. The acetal formed from [[acetone]] is sometimes called an [[acetonide]].

==Acetalisation==
Acetalisation is the [[organic reaction]] that involves the formation of an acetal (or ketals). One way of acetal formation is the [[nucleophilic addition]] of an alcohol to a ketone or an aldehyde. Acetalisation is often used in organic synthesis to create a protecting group because it is a reversible reaction.

Acetalisation is [[acid]] [[catalysis|catalysed]] with elimination of water; acetals do ''not'' form under [[base (chemistry)|basic]] conditions. The reaction can be driven to the acetal when water is removed from the reaction system either by [[azeotropic distillation]] or trapping water with [[molecular sieve]]s or [[aluminium oxide]].

The carbonyl group in '''1''' takes a proton from [[hydronium]]. The protonated carbonyl group 2 is activated for nucleophilic addition of the alcohol. The structures '''2a''' and '''2b''' are [[mesomer]]s. After [[deprotonation]] of '''3''' by water the [[hemiacetal]] or hemiketal '''4''' is formed. The hydroxyl group in '''4''' is protonated leading to the [[oxonium ion]] '''6''' which accepts a second alcohol group to '''7''' with a final deprotonation to the acetal '''8'''. The reverse reaction takes place by adding water in the same acidic medium. Acetals are stable towards basic media. In a transacetalisation or crossacetalisation a diol reacts with an acetal or two different acetals react with each other. Again this is possible because all the reaction steps are equilibria.

'''Daniel Renoult''' (December 18, 1880 – July 17, 1958) was a [[French Communist Party]] (''Parti communiste français'', PCF) politician, an activist and journalist. He was [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]] from 1944 to his death in 1958, during which he made some major changes and contributions to the city.

When Renoult was a young student, he was caught in the tide of opinion raised by the defense of Captain Dreyfus.

In 1906, he helped, with [[Jean Jaurès]], [[Jules Guesde]] and [[Édouard Vaillant]], in the development of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (''Section Française de l'Internationale Ouvrière'', SFIO) and in 1908, he joined the newspaper ''[[L'Humanité]]'', writing on the topic of parliamentary affairs. He witnessed Jaurès assassination on July 31, 1914. He served as an infantry sergeant in the Middle East. After the conflict, he became a [[pacifist]] and resumed his journalistic profession alongside [[Gabriel Peri]].

[[Soca music|Soca]] is a form of dance music which originated from many calypso music in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It originally combined the melodic lilting sound of calypso with insistent percussion (which is often electronic in recent music) and local chutney music. Soca music has evolved in the last 20 years primarily by musicians from various Anglophone Caribbean countries including Trinidad, Guyana, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Antigua and Barbuda, United States Virgin Islands, [[The Bahamas]], Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica and Belize.

== Junkanoo ==
[[File:Junkanoo.jpg|thumb|left|Junkanoo celebration in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]]]]
The word ''Junkanoo'' is said to be derived from a [[Ghana]]ian leader, [[John Connu]], or from the [[Qujo]] supreme deity ([[Canno]]) and ancestral spirits ([[jannanin]]).  The junkanoo was formerly practiced in [[North Carolina]] and remnants still exist in [[Belize]]. It is most well known, though, from [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] and [[Freeport, Bahamas|Freeport]]. Since the 1950s the influence of [[culture of the United States|American culture]] has increased, mainly through TV and radio broadcasts from [[Florida]] stations, and other [[Caribbean]] styles have made inroads: [[calypso music|calypso]], [[reggae]] and [[Soca music|soca]], from [[Jamaica]], [[Cuba]], [[Trinidad]], and other islands. [[Tourism]] has also had an impact, bringing in Japanese, European and North Americans with their attendant forms of cultural expression. In this milieu more traditional Bahamas performers such as [[Joseph Spence (musician)|Joseph Spence]], have still enjoyed successful careers playing junkanoo, Christian [[hymn]]s and the ''[[ant'em]]s'' of the local [[sea sponge|sponge]] fishermen, which include \"Sloop John B\", later made famous by [[The Beach Boys]].

In 1973, the year the Bahamas achieved independence from the United Kingdom, black professionals of the middle and upper classes began to dominate junkanoo celebrations.  Costuming and competitions became more complex and commonplace, and soon became a tourist draw.

Aside from being a type of drum, [[goombay]] is also a [[percussion music]] made famous by [[Alphonso 'Blind Blake' Higgs]], who played to tourists arriving at [[Nassau International Airport]] for several years.  [[Rake-and-scrape]] music is a unique type of instrumental music made by bending a saw and scraping with a small object, most typically a [[screwdriver]]; it is used to accompany dances derived from European forms like [[polka]] and [[waltz]].  Rake-and-scrape's popularity has been declining in recent years, but performers like [[Lassie Do and the Boys]] continue to keep the tradition alive.  Christian [[rhyming spiritual]]s and the ''[[ant'em]]s'' of [[sponge fishing|sponge fishermen]] are now mostly dead traditions, decimated by the arrival of pop music, a 1930s sponge blight and other causes.

[[E. Clement Bethel]]'s master's thesis on traditional Bahamian music was adapted for the stage by his daughter, [[Nicolette Bethel]] and [[Philip A. Burrows]].  ''[[Music of The Bahamas]]'' was first performed at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1991, and was revived in 2002 for fresh Bahamian audiences.  A recording of that show is available for sale from [[Ringplay Productions]]. hey guys its kim kardashian West

==Rake and scrape== 
{{Main|Rake-and-scrape}}
[[Rake and scrape Music|Rake and scrape]] music is played traditionally with [[Concertinas]], [[Goombay drums]], and a [[Handsaw]]. Rake and scrape is believed to have originated on the island of Cat Island but evidence suggest that it was emerging in many places simultaneously. The earliest reference to usage of the accordion by Bahamians is in 1886 in an Article in the Nassau Guardian. The term rake and scrape became the norm in 1969 by Charles Carter although he claims the people of Cat Island were already calling it that when he visited the Island.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=bp94R0EiBn4C&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=nassau+guardian+concertinas+1886#v=onepage&q=nassau%20guardian%20concertinas%201886&f=false | title=Funky Nassau: Roots, Routes, and Representation in Bahamian Popular Music| isbn=9780520265684| last1=Rommen| first1=Timothy| date=19 May 2011}}</ref><ref>http://www.bahamasentertainers.com/Paper/rkeNscr.html</ref>

==Organology of instruments==

Membranophones: The [[Goombay]] drum is main rhythmic component in rake-n-scrape. It is also referred to a goatskin drum, as the skin of a goat was stretched over a wooden barrel. It is decorated by simple or complex geometric designs in bright colors. The drum is always heated over fire to retain its tone. In 1971, when manufacturers started shipping products in metal barrels, Bahamians switched the drum to metal, slightly changing the tone of the drum.<ref>Ingraham 368</ref>

Idiophones: The main component that makes Rake-N-Scrape unique is the use of the Carpenter's Saw. This instrument is scraped with a nail or butter knife. Bent against the body of the player and flexed, various timbral effects are obtained.<ref>Ingraham 369</ref> In more modern music, the saw is replaced with maracas or a guiro.<ref>Rommen 173</ref>

Aerophones: The accordion is the component that adds the round form which enables dancers to dance the ring dance. This is of European descent. In more modern bands, it is replaced by an electric guitar or electronic keyboard.<ref>Ingraham 369</ref>

The '''music of the Bahamas''' is associated primarily with [[Junkanoo]], a celebration which occurs on [[Boxing Day]] and again on [[New Year's Day]]. [[Parade]]s and other celebrations mark the ceremony.  Groups like [[The Baha Men]], [[Ronnie Butler]] and [[Kirkland Bodie]] have gained massive popularity in Japan, the United States and other places. Other popular Bahamian artists include [[Stileet]] and [[Stevie S]].

[[Frankfurt am Main]] has multiple [[Inland port|inland ports]] which have been converted over time into new residential areas, owing to both their central location and the appeal of the view of the [[Main (river)]] from urban living spaces.

In the direction of flow, these [[Port|ports]] are:

* Port Mainkur (formerly Port Cassella) in the industrial area of [[Fechenheim]]. The port only has a small basin which is occasionally used to provide water to the companies located at the [[Cassella]] Industrial Park.
* [[Frankfurt Osthafen|Osthafen]] is the biggest port in Frankfurt and almost working at full capacity. It consists of the ''Oberhafen (Upper Harbour)'' and the ''Unterhafen'' ''(Lower Harbour)'' which are separated from each other by the [[Offenbach Barrage]]. Oberhafen consists of two basins, both of which flow directly into the Main, and is easily accessible from land via the [[Frankfurt City Link Line|Hafenbahn]] and the nearby A 661 [[Autobahn]]. A third, easterly basin was planned, but it was never built. The Unterhafen has the shape of a [[tuning fork]] and has a [[forebay (reservoir)]] which branches into two separate basins. A planned extension of the ''Nordbecken'' (north basin) was indeed excavated, but it was never connected to the basin. The pit filled up with [[groundwater]] and now forms the [[Schwedlersee]]. The [[Honsellbrücke]] crosses over the forebay and the [[Schmickbrücke]] crosses over the ''Südbecken'' (southern basin).
* The [[Mainkai]], located by the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], was the oldest port in the city. Today it serves as a waterfront. The extension of the Mainkai in the West towards the [[Main-Neckar-Brücke]] is called the [[Untermainkai]]. Until the mid-19th century a narrow [[tributary]] of the Main, called the ''Kleiner Main (Small Main),'' flowed underneath the quay's wall. The tributary was home to a small, off-shore island called ''Mainlust'', until the Kleiner Main was filled in during 1859. After the tributary had been filled in, the [[Nizza (Frankfurt)|Nizza]], an area of green space, developed. Tracks for the Verbindungsbahn still remain in the area, but now serve more of a tourist purpose for the [[Historic Railway, Frankfurt|Historic Railway]] than to transport goods. Companies such as ''Antwerpener Werft, Nizzawerft, Leonhardswert, Fahrtowerft,'' and ''Weseler Werft'' all make reference to the older usage of the port area as a shipyard (''Werft'' in German), as well as a historical loading crane located opposite the [[Städel Museum]]. By the [[Eiserner Steg]] there is still a landing stage for excursion ships; hotel ships also dock downstream to the [[Holbeinsteg]] during exhibition seasons.
* The '''Schaumainkai''', located on the [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]] side of the Main, has become synonymous with the [[Museumsufer]] — a series of museums all located along the Main. Whilst the museums reside by the high banks of the river, the Tiefkai, the lower part of the port, is a green area and one of the most attractive parts of the city. There also exist references here to the previous usage of the port as a shipyard, such as ''Schifferwerft, Dreikönigswerft, Deutschherrnwerft'', and ''Schlachthofwerft''.
* The [[Westhafen]] in the [[Gutleutviertel]] district was converted into an inner-city living quarter. The basin, now connected by two bridges, still remains accessible and serves as a [[yacht harbor]]. The neighbouring [[Heizkraftwerk West]] still continues to receive black coal by ship via its own landing stage.
* The The river port '''Gutleuthof''' downstream of the power plant is still in operation and has a rail connection to the port Hafenbahn.
* The loading dock at [[Griesheim Industry Park|Griesheim Industrial Park]] is still used, albeit it only rarely.
* The [[Höchster Hafen]] below the [[Höchster Altstadt]] was shut down in 1982. A gantry crane from the 1950s (extending to the height of the former power stations), as well as another crane from the 19th century at the mouth of the Niddamm, are reminders of the previous usage as a harbour.
* At the [[Höchst Industrial Park]], there are six dock shelters on the north bank for handling tankers. Between the [[Mittlere Werksbrück|mittlere Werksbrücke]] and the [[Leunabrücke]] is a quay wall several hundred meters long, where ships can also dock. The quay is mainly used to unload power plant coal for the park's combined heat and power plant. On the south side there is a 450-metre-long basin in which several ships can moor at the same time. It is mainly used for the delivery of rock salt for the [[Chloralkali process]] as well as container handling for the ''Rhine-Main Container Port''.

Cargo handling in the Frankfurt ports fluctuates depending on the economic situation, but is slightly declining overall. In 1997, a total of 8,439 ships were handled in all the Frankfurt ports, handling about 4.9 million tonnes of goods. By 2006, the figures had fallen to 5516 ships with approx. 3.5 million tonnes of goods handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frankfurt.de/-/media/d438f2d4342749469924a1947109c1da.ashx|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch Frankfurt am Main 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=frankfurt.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> The decline in bulk goods such as coal, gravel and scrap metal plays a major role in this. In contrast, container handling plays has helped increase numbers.

* Port Mainkur (formerly Port Cassella) in the industrial area of [[Fechenheim]]. The port only has a small basin which is occasionally used to provide water to the companies located at the [[Cassella]] Industrial Park.
* [[Frankfurt Osthafen|Osthafen]] is the biggest port in Frankfurt and almost working at full capacity. It consists of the ''Oberhafen (Upper Harbour)'' and the ''Unterhafen'' ''(Lower Harbour)'' which are separated from each other by the [[Offenbach Barrage]]. Oberhafen consists of two basins, both of which flow directly into the Main, and is easily accessible from land via the [[Frankfurt City Link Line|Hafenbahn]] and the nearby A 661 [[Autobahn]]. A third, easterly basin was planned, but it was never built. The Unterhafen has the shape of a [[tuning fork]] and has a [[forebay (reservoir)]] which branches into two separate basins. A planned extension of the ''Nordbecken'' (north basin) was indeed excavated, but it was never connected to the basin. The pit filled up with [[groundwater]] and now forms the [[Schwedlersee]]. The [[Honsellbrücke]] crosses over the forebay and the [[Schmickbrücke]] crosses over the ''Südbecken'' (southern basin).
* The [[Mainkai]], located by the [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Altstadt]], was the oldest port in the city. Today it serves as a waterfront. The extension of the Mainkai in the West towards the [[Main-Neckar-Brücke]] is called the [[Untermainkai]]. Until the mid-19th century a narrow [[tributary]] of the Main, called the ''Kleiner Main (Small Main),'' flowed underneath the quay's wall. The tributary was home to a small, off-shore island called ''Mainlust'', until the Kleiner Main was filled in during 1859. After the tributary had been filled in, the [[Nizza (Frankfurt)|Nizza]], an area of green space, developed. Tracks for the Verbindungsbahn still remain in the area, but now serve more of a tourist purpose for the [[Historic Railway, Frankfurt|Historic Railway]] than to transport goods. Companies such as ''Antwerpener Werft, Nizzawerft, Leonhardswert, Fahrtowerft,'' and ''Weseler Werft'' all make reference to the older usage of the port area as a shipyard (''Werft'' in German), as well as a historical loading crane located opposite the [[Städel Museum]]. By the [[Eiserner Steg]] there is still a landing stage for excursion ships; hotel ships also dock downstream to the [[Holbeinsteg]] during exhibition seasons.
* The '''Schaumainkai''', located on the [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Sachsenhausen]] side of the Main, has become synonymous with the [[Museumsufer]] — a series of museums all located along the Main. Whilst the museums reside by the high banks of the river, the Tiefkai, the lower part of the port, is a green area and one of the most attractive parts of the city. There also exist references here to the previous usage of the port as a shipyard, such as ''Schifferwerft, Dreikönigswerft, Deutschherrnwerft'', and ''Schlachthofwerft''.
* The [[Westhafen]] in the [[Gutleutviertel]] district was converted into an inner-city living quarter. The basin, now connected by two bridges, still remains accessible and serves as a [[yacht harbor]]. The nighbouring [[Heizkraftwerk West]] still continues to receive black coal by ship via its own landing stage.
* The The river port '''Gutleuthof''' downstream of the power plant is still in operation and has a rail connection to the port Hafenbahn.
* The loading dock at [[Griesheim Industry Park|Griesheim Industrial Park]] is still used, albeit it only rarely.
* The [[Höchster Hafen]] below the [[Höchster Altstadt]] was shut down in 1982. A gantry crane from the 1950s (extending to the height of the former power stations), as well as another crane from the 19th century at the mouth of the Niddamm, are reminders of the previous usage as a harbour.
* At the [[Höchst Industrial Park]], there are six dock shelters on the north bank for handling tankers. Between the [[Mittlere Werksbrück|mittlere Werksbrücke]] and the [[Leunabrücke]] is a quay wall several hundred meters long, where ships can also dock. The quay is mainly used to unload power plant coal for the park's combined heat and power plant. On the south side there is a 450-metre-long basin in which several ships can moor at the same time. It is mainly used for the delivery of rock salt for the [[Chloralkali process]] as well as container handling for the ''Rhine-Main Container Port''.

Cargo handling in the Frankfurt ports fluctuates depending on the economic situation, but is slightly declining overall. In 1997, a total of 8,439 ships were handled in all the Frankfurt ports, handling about 4.9 million tonnes of goods. By 2006, the figures had fallen to 5516 ships with approx. 3.5 million tonnes of goods handled.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frankfurt.de/-/media/d438f2d4342749469924a1947109c1da.ashx|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch Frankfurt am Main 2007|last=|first=|date=|website=frankfurt.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref> The decline in bulk goods such as coal, gravel and scrap metal plays a major role in this. In contrast, container handling plays has helped increase numbers. In 2015, 4.3 million tonnes of goods and 64,794 containers were handled in all Frankfurt ports<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frankfurt.de/-/media/1f590915cd1a481c82b4411931085516.ashx|title=Statistisches Jahrbuch Frankfurt am Main 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=frankfurt.de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>.

'''''El tren de la muerte''''' (\"The Death Train\") refers to a network of Mexican freight trains that are utilized by U.S.-bound migrants to more quickly traverse the length of [[Mexico]], also known as '''''La Bestia''''' (\"The Beast\") and '''''El tren de los desconocidos''''' (\"The train of the unknowns\").

==Passenger risks==

Many of the dangers posed by this journey result from the train itself and the process of climbing aboard and getting off moving trains. Because migrants board between 10 and 15 trains during their 1450-mile journey, which typically begins in [[Arriaga, Chiapas]], the chances of sustaining a major injury are high before they even arrive at Lechería station in [[Mexico City]], which serves as a sort of halfway point before the train route scatters into various directions that head closer to different points on the [[U.S. border]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bridges|first=Levi|title=Central American Migrants Face Perils on Journey North|url=https://nacla.org/news/2013/5/24/central-american-migrants-face-perils-journey-north-0|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref> Often, migrants fall asleep while riding atop trains and are jolted off and onto the tracks where many are killed instantly by decapitation, blood loss, and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].

==In the media==

\"El Tren de la Muerte\" has been depicted in literature, news articles, and in many films, including documentaries. One example is ''[[Which Way Home]]'', which specifically follows the stories of children who have left their homes to come to the United States. The children range in age from 9–15 years old and are from places like Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Mexico. Like many other children, the kids in this documentary travel without an accompanying adult and their mode of transportation is \"El Tren de la Muerte.\" These stories focus on the emotional impact of the journey as well as the physical danger. The documentary also shows what happens to children when they fail to arrive at their destination and are forced to go back to their countries of origin. Many of the other films that center around this topic feature similar stories, such as ''[[Sin Nombre (2009 film)|Sin Nombre]]'', ''[[De Nadie]]'', and ''El Tren de la Muerte''. Most of these films have been acclaimed for bringing to light the many circumstances that migrants endure during their journey to the United States.

[[Sonia Nazario]]'s best-selling novel, \"Enrique's Journey\", also depicts the process and obstacles of train migration. The book depicts the struggles and dangers of the journey north through the eyes of one migrant. It includes explicit details about migrants' encounters with street gangs, corrupt officials, hunger, exhaustion, discrimination, poor weather, and trains.

El Salvadorian journalist Óscar Martínez's book [[The Beast (book)|The Beast]] also depicts the hardships faced by migrants on the journey to the United States.

Other forms of media have also discussed the topic of migration and the means by which migrants travel to the United States. The presses in Central America, Mexico, and the United States cover the topic with a particular focus on the grim and unfortunate aspects of the migration process.

The train was also featured in [[Al Jazeera America]]'s Borderland.

'''Princess Maria Christina of Saxony''' (Maria Christina Anna Theresa Salomea Eulalia Francisca Xaveria; 12 February 1735 &ndash; 19 November 1782) was a Princess of Saxony and later [[Abbess of Remiremont]].

==Life==
She was the daughter of [[Augustus III of Poland]], [[Elector of Saxony]] (as Frederick Augustus II), [[King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] (as Augustus II), and [[Maria Josepha of Austria]], first cousin of [[Empress Maria Theresa]]. 

Maria Christina was born at the [[Wilanów Palace]] in Poland. She came from a close family and her parents made sure they put emphasis on a good education. She was educated in [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[philosophy]], [[geography]], [[religion]], [[drawing]], [[music]] and [[dance]].

Her older sister [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731–1767)|Maria Josepha]] married [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]] in 1747.<ref name=\"Abbess\">{{cite web|url= http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1770.htm |title= Women in Power 1770-1800 |accessdate= 2010-03-02|last= Christensen|first= Martin K.I|work= www.guide2womenleaders.com}}</ref>  

===Abbess===
In 1764, Maria Christina was sent to France to become a [[Coadjutor]]ice at the  [[Abbess of Remiremont|Abbey of Remiremont]] in [[Remiremont]], northern [[France]]. Her position was thanks to the personal intervention of [[Louis XV]] himself.<ref name=\"Abbess\"/>

At the time of her arrival, the abbey was under control of [[Princess Anne Charlotte of Lorraine]], sister of the [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]] and aunt of the future [[Marie Antoinette]].<ref>Marie Antoinette would come to France in 1770 to wed the [[Louis XVI|Duke of Berry]], future Louis XVI</ref>  

In France, she was known as ''Marie Christine de Saxe''.  In 1773, at the death of Anne Charlotte, Maria Christina was named Abbess, a position she would keep until her death. 

Remiremont had seats and votes in the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] including all rights and obligations of an Imperial Princess (such as [[High, middle and low justice|low justice]], [[tax]], [[legislation]], coinage and military service), and enjoyed immunity against [[Violence|temporal power]]. 

She was a frequent visitor to [[Paris]] and was fond of the [[Theatre]] and the city's social life. She spent a great deal of money, the payment of which was made by [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] ([[Duke of Lorraine]] until his death in 1766) and after that the king [[Louis XV]]. Her correspondence with her brother [[Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony|Francis Xavier, Regent of Saxony]] was preserved at Trojes. 

She was created a Dame of the [[Order of the Starry Cross]]. 

Maria Christina bought the Château de Brumath in the town of [[Brumath]]<ref name=\"Brumath\">{{cite web|url= http://www.brumath.fr/mairie-brumath/decouvrir-ville-historique.html |title= ''Historique de Brumath'' |accessdate= 2010-03-05|last= |first=|work= www.brumath.fr}}</ref> in the [[Alsace]] region of France. Purchased in 1775,<ref name=\"Brumath\"/> she chose the building for its location in the country and for its natural setting. She lived a lavish lifestyle at the [[château]] which far outdid her revenues. 

Dying at the château on 19 November 1782, her nephew King [[Louis XVI]] was obliged to pay her debts in the amount of 136,876 livres for his dead aunt.<ref name=\"Brumath\"/> 

She was buried at the abbey in its ''église des Dames'' on the 15 December 1782. She was praised for her intelligence, her conversation and for being a cultivated woman for her age. The château de Brumath was abandoned  and was pillaged in the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"Histoire\">{{cite web |url= http://www.prixeuropeendelitterature.eu/html/fichepays.asp?id=14 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171422/http://www.prixeuropeendelitterature.eu/html/fichepays.asp?id=14 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2011-07-20 |title= ''Brève histoire de Brumath'' |accessdate= 2010-03-05 |work= www.prixeuropeendelitterature.eu }}</ref>

'''Princess Maria Christina of Saxony''' (Maria Christina Anna Theresa Salomea Eulalia Francisca Xaveria; 12 February 1735 &ndash; 19 November 1782) was a Princess of Saxony and later [[Abbess of Remiremont]].

==Life==
She was the daughter of [[Augustus III of Poland]], [[Elector of Saxony]] (as Frederick Augustus I), [[King of Poland]] and [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] (as Augustus II), and [[Maria Josepha of Austria]], first cousin of [[Empress Maria Theresa]]. 

Maria Christina was born at the [[Wilanów Palace]] in Poland. She came from a close family and her parents made sure they put emphasis on a good education. She was educated in [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[philosophy]], [[geography]], [[religion]], [[drawing]], [[music]] and [[dance]].

Her older sister [[Princess Maria Josepha of Saxony (1731–1767)|Maria Josepha]] married [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis, Dauphin of France]] in 1747.<ref name=\"Abbess\">{{cite web|url= http://www.guide2womenleaders.com/womeninpower/Womeninpower1770.htm |title= Women in Power 1770-1800 |accessdate= 2010-03-02|last= Christensen|first= Martin K.I|work= www.guide2womenleaders.com}}</ref>  

===Abbess===
In 1764, Maria Christina was sent to France to become a [[Coadjutor]]ice at the  [[Abbess of Remiremont|Abbey of Remiremont]] in [[Remiremont]], northern [[France]]. Her position was thanks to the personal intervention of [[Louis XV]] himself.<ref name=\"Abbess\"/>

At the time of her arrival, the abbey was under control of [[Princess Anne Charlotte of Lorraine]], sister of the [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor]] and aunt of the future [[Marie Antoinette]].<ref>Marie Antoinette would come to France in 1770 to wed the [[Louis XVI|Duke of Berry]], future Louis XVI</ref>  

In France, she was known as ''Marie Christine de Saxe''.  In 1773, at the death of Anne Charlotte, Maria Christina was named Abbess, a position she would keep until her death. 

Remiremont had seats and votes in the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] including all rights and obligations of an Imperial Princess (such as [[High, middle and low justice|low justice]], [[tax]], [[legislation]], coinage and military service), and enjoyed immunity against [[Violence|temporal power]]. 

She was a frequent visitor to [[Paris]] and was fond of the [[Theatre]] and the city's social life. She spent a great deal of money, the payment of which was made by [[Stanisław Leszczyński]] ([[Duke of Lorraine]] until his death in 1766) and after that the king [[Louis XV]]. Her correspondence with her brother [[Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony|Francis Xavier, Regent of Saxony]] was preserved at Trojes. 

She was created a Dame of the [[Order of the Starry Cross]]. 

Maria Christina bought the Château de Brumath in the town of [[Brumath]]<ref name=\"Brumath\">{{cite web|url= http://www.brumath.fr/mairie-brumath/decouvrir-ville-historique.html |title= ''Historique de Brumath'' |accessdate= 2010-03-05|last= |first=|work= www.brumath.fr}}</ref> in the [[Alsace]] region of France. Purchased in 1775,<ref name=\"Brumath\"/> she chose the building for its location in the country and for its natural setting. She lived a lavish lifestyle at the [[château]] which far outdid her revenues. 

Dying at the château on 19 November 1782, her nephew King [[Louis XVI]] was obliged to pay her debts in the amount of 136,876 livres for his dead aunt.<ref name=\"Brumath\"/> 

She was buried at the abbey in its ''église des Dames'' on the 15 December 1782. She was praised for her intelligence, her conversation and for being a cultivated woman for her age. The château de Brumath was abandoned  and was pillaged in the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"Histoire\">{{cite web |url= http://www.prixeuropeendelitterature.eu/html/fichepays.asp?id=14 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720171422/http://www.prixeuropeendelitterature.eu/html/fichepays.asp?id=14 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2011-07-20 |title= ''Brève histoire de Brumath'' |accessdate= 2010-03-05 |work= www.prixeuropeendelitterature.eu }}</ref>

'''Giurgiu''' ({{IPA-ro|ˈd͡ʒjurd͡ʒju|-|Ro-Giurgiu.ogg}}) is a city in southern [[Romania]]. The seat of [[Giurgiu County]], it lies in the historical region of [[Muntenia]]. It is situated amid mud-flats and marshes on the left bank of the [[Danube]] facing the [[Bulgaria]]n city of [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]] on the opposite bank. Three small islands face the city, and a larger one shelters its port, Smarda. The rich grain-growing land to the north is traversed by a railway to [[Bucharest]], the first line opened in Romania, which was built in 1869 and afterwards extended to Smarda. Giurgiu exports timber, grain, salt and petroleum, and imports coal, iron, and textiles.

The [[Danube Bridge|Giurgiu-Ruse Friendship Bridge]], in the shared [[Bulgaria]]n-Romanian section of the Danube, crosses the river in the outskirts of the city.

==History==
{{Multiple image|align=left|direction=vertical|image1=Raffet - Foire de St. Pierre a Giourgevo.jpg|caption1=|image2=Giurgiu1848.jpg|caption2=Giurgiu in 1837}}
The area around Giurgiu was densely populated at the time of the [[Dacians]] (1st century BC) as archeological evidence shows, and [[Burebista]]'s capital was in this area (it is thought to be in [[Mihăilești|Popeşti]] on the [[Argeş River]]). During [[Roman times]] this was the site of [[Theodorapolis]], a city built by the Roman emperor [[Justinian]] (483-565).

The city of Giurgiu was probably established in the 14th century as a port on the [[Danube]] by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] merchant adventurers, who established a bank and traded in silks and velvets.

One theory is that they called the city after the patron saint of Genoa, San Giorgio ([[St George]]), however [[Nicolae Iorga]] disputes this theory, arguing that Giurgiu is just an old Romanian form of George.<ref>{{cite book |last=Iorga |first=Nicolae |date=1928 |title=Istoria Românilor prin călători |trans-title=History of Romanians through travellers |url=https://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Istoria_românilor_prin_călători/Înainte_de_întemeierea_domniilor |language=ro |location=Bucharest |publisher=Casa Școalelor |isbn= |accessdate= |page=18}}</ref>

It was first mentioned in [[Codex Latinus Parisinus]] in 1395, during the reign of [[Mircea I of Wallachia]], and was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1420 as a way to control the Danube traffic. The Ottomans named the city ''Yergöğü'', as if from ''yer'' 'earth' + ''gök'' 'sky,' but the name was probably given because of the similarity between the pronunciations of \"(San) Giorgio\" and \"Yergöğü\".

As a fortified city, Giurgiu figured often in the wars for the conquest of the lower Danube. It was the site of the October 1595 [[Battle of Giurgiu]], and figured in the struggle of [[Michael the Brave]] (1593–1601) against the Turks and in the later [[Russo-Turkish War (1787-1792)]]. It was burned in 1659. In 1771, the Ottomans built the [[monument istoric|historic]] [[Giurgiu Clocktower]] as a surveillance tower for [[Danube]] traffic. In 1829, its fortifications were finally razed, the only defence left being a castle on the island of Slobozia, connected to the shore by a bridge.

In 1952–1954, during the Communist regime, the [[USSR]] helped build the bridge between Giurgiu and [[Rousse|Ruse]], [[Danube Bridge|The Friendship Bridge]], a bridge on the Danube linking Romania and [[Bulgaria]].

'''''Thru the Mirror''''' is a [[Mickey Mouse]] [[cartoon]] [[short film]] produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] and released by [[United Artists]] in [[1936 in film|1936]]. In this cartoon short, Mickey has a ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]''-type dream that he travels through his mirror and enters a topsy-turvy world where everything is alive. While there, he engages in a [[Fred Astaire]] dance number with a pair of gloves and a pack of cards, until the cards chase him out of the bizarre world. The title is written as ''Thru the Mirror'' on the title card, but the alternative spelling '''''Through the Mirror''''' is used on the poster for the film. In addition, the short film is a parody of the book, ''Through the Looking Glass'', by Lewis Carroll.

==Synopsis==
Mickey falls asleep after reading ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' by [[Lewis Carroll]]. An astral projection of himself (presumably Mickey in his dream state) leaves his body and passes through his mirror into an alternate version of his house. His furniture and possessions have come to life and are complete with faces and personalities, but most of them remain motionless. He jumps on a rocking chair that throws him off in annoyance while a nearby coat rack watches in surprise, and lands on the footrest that behaves like a puppy while Mickey rides on it like a horse until it jumps into the rocking chair. While the chair tries to calm down the footrest, Mickey tries to comfort them, only to end up angering them instead. He bumps into an umbrella, who scolds him until it suddenly drops open and re-closes itself in embarrassment before returning to where it originally was.
Mickey then comes across a nut cracker breaking open a walnut and offers it to him while it eats the shells. After eating the walnut, Mickey's lower body commences to wildly spin around, and it hits his face. While his lower body crazily spins, he suddenly becomes gigantic and then shrinks. The telephone suddenly rings and it throws its receiver down to Mickey, who uses it to climb up to the table. He attempts to answer the call, only to get responses from the phone itself and then proceeds to jump rope with the telephone, who uses its receiver and wire as a jump rope while the radio begins playing music.
Mickey begins to dance his way through his house, tap dancing on a [[top hat]] (wearing a tiny one with a match for a cane) with some gloves (eventually he gets his butt kicked twice by the gloves), [[playing cards]] (some of them hit Mickey's butt during the dance), and eventually the [[Queen of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Queen of Hearts]] card (who resembles [[Greta Garbo]]). The [[joker (playing card)|joker]] on his bicycle notices and alerts the [[King of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|King of Hearts]] who uses the joker's bike to get down there and pulls the queen aside before proceeding to fight for his lady in a sword duel with Mickey, who uses both a [[sewing needle]] and a [[Button (clothing)|button]] as a makeshift sword after the King of Hearts pushes him and gets his butt stabbed by the needle. 
Mickey defeats the king by pushing him into an inkwell, where a stamp takes him out and cleans him. Considering this as the last straw, the king then orders for the cards to be called out to get rid of Mickey for good and the radio acts as an alarm to summon the cards like police cars - \"Calling all cards! Calling all cards!\" in which some come out from the king's throne and some come out from a drawer. Chaos ensues as Mickey runs from the cards. He picks up a fountain pen, hides in a basket of yarn, and uses the pen like a machine gun to fire ink at the cards while wearing a thimble-like a helmet. The pen eventually runs out of ink, allowing the cards to pig-pile on Mickey, who then escapes in a torn sock. After being spotted, the cards give chase again and throw their pictures at him. Mickey then turns on an electric fan to blow the cards back while the telephone calls the police in panic as Mickey swings from a lamp rope and runs on a globe until he trips and falls into the globe's [[Bay of Bengal]] and is thrown out by a figure, who appears to be a small version of Neptune, by impaling Mickey's butt. He then grows back to his normal size and escapes back to the real world through the mirror where he reenters his body. Eventually, he is awakened by his alarm clock and it has all been a dream and goes back to sleep after throwing his alarm clock into a drawer.

[[File:JohnDoreward BockingChurch Essex 1420.png|thumb|[[Monumental brass]] to John Doreward and his third wife Isabella Baynard, St Mary's Church, Bocking, Essex]] 
'''John Doreward''' (died 1420) was a [[Serjeant-at-law]] and [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]] of England.

==Early life==
Outside the affairs of parliament, little is known of Doreward. He was apparently the son of William Doreward of Bocking, Essex who was a [[member of parliament]] for [[Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Essex]] in the eighteenth and twentieth parliaments of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].<ref name=round>Round, J.

==Marriages==
He married Blanche Coggeshall, daughter and heiress of Sir [[William Coggeshall]] (1358–1426), High Sheriff of Essex.<ref>Pedigree of Dorward, Heraldic Visitation of Essex, 1558, p.104[https://archive.org/details/visitationsofess13metc/page/104]</ref> Arms of Dorward: ''Ermine, on a chevron sable three crescents or ''<ref>As impaled by Fodringhay in the stained glass formerly at [[Beaupré Hall]], Norfolk</ref> His second wife was Isabella Baynard of [[Messing-cum-Inworth|Messing]],<ref>[http://www.stmarys-bocking.co.uk/history.htm History] at stmarys-bocking.co.uk, accessed 11 August 2008</ref> as named \"Isabella\" on his monument in St Mary's Church, Bocking, a daughter of Richard Baynard.<ref>Pedigree of Dorward, Heraldic Visitation of Essex, 1558, p.104</ref> He had at least one son, John Doreward, who in 1440 founded an [[almshouse]] to be called the Maison Dieu of the town of Bocking, and later known as the Hospital of Bocking. Among its purposes was to pray for the soul of John Doreward, the founder's father.<ref>'Hospitals: Bocking', in ''A History of the County of Essex: Volume 2'' (1907), [https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39860 p. 183] online at british-history.ac.uk, accessed 11 August 2008</ref>

==Political life==
Doreward was appointed [[High Sheriff of Essex]] and [[High Sheriff of Hertfordshire|Hertfordshire]] for 1399 and elected [[knight of the shire]] (MP) six times for [[Essex (UK Parliament constituency)|Essex]] (1395, Jan 1397, 1399, Jan 1404, May 1413 and April 1414). He was elected Speaker of the House in 1399 and 1413.
  
''The Constitutional History of England in its Origin and Development'', vol. III, p.&nbsp;18 ... In the case of Sir John Cheyne, the Speaker elected in 1399, the excuse of ill-health was accepted by the king as valid; the clergy had in fact objected to the nomination; Sir John Cheyne withdrew, and John Doreward was chosen in his place.<ref>Stubbs p. 454</ref>

The chronicler [[Robert Fabyan]], writing about a hundred years after Doreward's first election as Speaker, gives a more obscure version of events: {{quote|Than this feest with all honoure endyd, upon the morn beyinge Tuysday, the Parlyament was agayne begunne, and upon Wedneysdaye Syr John Cheyney, yt. before that tyme had occupyed as Speker of that Parlyament, by his owne laboure, for cause of such infyrmyties as he tha had, was dyschargyd, and a Squyer named Wyllyam Durwarde was electe to that roume for hym.<ref name=manning/><ref>[[Robert Fabyan|Fabyan, Robert]], ''The Concordaunce of Hystoryes'', publ. as ''The New Chronicles of England and France'' (1515)</ref>}}

The Parliament was almost identical in makeup to the previous parliament held under [[Richard II of England|Richard II]], where thanks to the political manoeuvring of [[John Bussy|Sir John Bussy]] many of Parliament's powers had been stripped from them and given instead to a committee. The summoning of this parliament showed good political judgement on the part of the ''de facto'' king, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]; in the words of Manning \"<nowiki>[Henry]</nowiki> could not have hoped to assemble a body of legislators less favourable to the captive monarch\"<ref name=manning/>

The [[House of Commons of England|Commons]] voted a large subsidy to pay for the war against [[Scotland]] and the defence of [[Ireland]] and [[Calais]] in the hopes that their requests for additional powers would be granted. The commons also voted for the arrest of [[William le Scrope, 1st Earl of Wiltshire|William Scrope]] and Henry Green, both councillors of Richard II.

Doreward was again made Speaker of the House of Commons for the parliament of 1413; this was the first of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], and he was appointed again apparently after his predecessor had resigned from ill-health.<ref name=manning/> The parliament of 1413 granted Henry V a subsidy for four years; an unusually long period, this is understood to be explained by the new king's popularity.

Some historians have assumed that the John Doreward (or Dorewood) in the parliaments of 1399 and 1413 were father and son, but they are evidently the same person; the Speaker of the House of Commons in both cases was a serjeant-at-law, which was not an appointment held by either of Dorewood's sons.

He was appointed a member of Henry IV's council from Nov 1399 to May 1406.

==Monument==
Doreward is commemorated by a [[monumental brass]] in St Mary's Church, Bocking, on the floor before the South Chapel. This gives the year of his death as 1420 and names his second wife as Isabella.<ref>[http://www.stmarys-bocking.co.uk/history.htm History] at stmarys-bocking.co.uk, accessed 11 August 2008</ref> Inscribed in Latin: ''Exoretur mia(?)

The '''Esztergom Synagogue''' is the oldest Jewish synagogue located in [[Esztergom]], [[Hungary]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bratislavaadventure.com/en/travelguide/what-to-see/moorish-synagogue-esztergom.html|title=Bratislava Adventure|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The synagogue was established in 1859 and completed in 1888.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/esztergom|title=Beit Hatfutsot|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The majority of the congregation was deported during the Holocaust.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.funiq.hu/2390-synagogue-esztergom|title=funiQ|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>

The synagogue was damaged during World War II. After a long renovation, it was awarded by ATNSA (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in Esztergom  in 1980 and renamed as ''House of Technology''. In 2006, it served as a conference venue for the municipality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://budapestbeacon.com/jobbik-books-synagogue-for-valentines-day-political-rally/|title=Jobbik books synagogue for Valentine's day political rally|last=Kovács|first=-Zoltán|date=2014-01-30|website=The Budapest Beacon|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>

== History ==
Esztergom has been home for large number of Jewish communities since the [[Árpád dynasty]]. There are references to a synagogue in Esztergom dating back to as early as 1050.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Patai|first=Raphael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLuPS1yVDf8C&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=Esztergom+1050+year+synagogue&source=bl&ots=yDFE5i4J0h&sig=ACfU3U35PE7HquvF-8XZKqyrw-48C4YI6g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_m9H9gNXoAhUEHc0KHdpBDlgQ6AEwFHoECAsQLA#v=onepage&q=Esztergom%201050%20year%20synagogue&f=false|title=The Jews of Hungary: History, Culture, Psychology|date=1996|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-2561-2|language=en}}</ref> This is evidenced by the fact that two Jewish merchants from Regensburg, who came to the city from Russia, met their comrades in front of the synagogue.

After the reformation, Esztergom welcomed Jewish merchants, who built a synagogue for themselves. In 1858, another synagogue was erected on the site of today's synagogue in the former village of Szenttamás.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

About thirty years later, architect [[Ödön Lechner]] and [[Lipót Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the style of Late-romantic period, originally single-story with a gallery for the women of the congregation. It was inaugurated in 1888 by [[Ignác Weisz]], rabbi of [[Immanuel Löw|Immánuel Lőw]] and [[Szeged]].<ref>{{https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/esztergom|date=April 2020}}</ref>

Until World War II, it was frequented by the Jews of Esztergom and the surrounding villages. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and got badly damaged. Most of the Jews — about five hundred — were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imaház utca remains of the original part of the building. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The empty building was awarded in 1964 to the organization of ATNSA (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This was when the first major renovations began. Space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center.

Over the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated.

Accordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion operated there for a short time, until in 2008 it moved to the building of the County Hall of Bottyán János Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN883IN883&q=county+hall+of+botty%C3%A1n+street&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjij9Lm4t7oAhUr8XMBHRfBD0oQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1366&bih=657|title=county hall of bottyán street - Google Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

Recently, controversy has surrounded the Synagogue. In 2014, Hungary's neo-nazi political party book the Synagogue for a political rally.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kovács |first1=Zoltán |title=Jobbik books synagogue for Valentine’s day political rally |url=https://budapestbeacon.com/jobbik-books-synagogue-for-valentines-day-political-rally/ |website=Budapest Beacon |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> Citizens of Esztergom were enraged at the disrespect towards the Jewish community and asked the government to cancel the event.

== Description ==
The two-story monument synagogue is 1216 square meters large and contains a two tower units that jet out from both sides of the façade. These are connected by a triple-arched, arcade foyer. The original 1888 marble staircase leads to a conference room upstairs with interpreting booths.

The Martyr Monument in front of the building was made according to the plans of István Martsa. The original 2.5-meter bronze work was made for the monument competition in Mauthausen and was placed in the Hungarian barracks of the Auschwitz camp museum. Today's statue was erected in 1985. Its pedestal is a bonfire made of railway sleepers. A plaque commemorates the abductees on the wall of the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Myers|first=Richard S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3zM1injK8QC&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=the+Martyr+Monument+hungary+esztergom&source=bl&ots=dKkSf7AhQf&sig=ACfU3U0upkn_0HdwDqXRCigWadwt0STgDA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtx-iHpNzoAhVQIKwKHf5bDDwQ6AEwDXoECAwQKA#v=onepage&q=the%20Martyr%20Monument%20hungary%20esztergom&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Social Thought, Social Science, and Social Policy: Supplement|last2=Varacalli|first2=Joseph A.|date=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8266-9|language=en}}</ref>

After a long time renovation, It was awarded by ATNSA (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in Esztergom  in 1980 and renamed as ''House of Technology''. In 2006, it was  serve as a conference venue by the municipality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://budapestbeacon.com/jobbik-books-synagogue-for-valentines-day-political-rally/|title=Jobbik books synagogue for Valentine's day political rally|last=Kovács|first=-Zoltán|date=2014-01-30|website=The Budapest Beacon|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>

== History ==
Esztergom has been home for large number of Jewish communities since the [[Árpád dynasty]]. There are references to a synagogue in Esztergom dating back to as early as 1050.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Patai|first=Raphael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLuPS1yVDf8C&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=Esztergom+1050+year+synagogue&source=bl&ots=yDFE5i4J0h&sig=ACfU3U35PE7HquvF-8XZKqyrw-48C4YI6g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_m9H9gNXoAhUEHc0KHdpBDlgQ6AEwFHoECAsQLA#v=onepage&q=Esztergom%201050%20year%20synagogue&f=false|title=The Jews of Hungary: History, Culture, Psychology|date=1996|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-2561-2|language=en}}</ref> This is evidenced by the fact that two Jewish merchants from Regensburg, who came to the city from Russia, met their comrades in front of the synagogue.

After the reformation, Esztergom welcomed Jewish merchants, who built a synagogue for themselves. In 1858, another synagogue was erected on the site of today's synagogue in the former village of Szenttamás.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

About thirty years later, architect [[Ödön Lechner]] and [[Lipót Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the style of Late-romantic period, originally single-story with a gallery for the women of the congregation. It was inaugurated in 1888 by [[Ignác Weisz]], rabbi of [[Immanuel Löw|Immánuel Lőw]] and [[Szeged]].<ref>{{https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/esztergom|date=April 2020}}</ref>

Until World War II, it was frequented by the Jews of Esztergom and the surrounding villages. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and got badly damaged. Most of the Jews — about five hundred — were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imaház utca remains of the original part of the building. {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The empty building was awarded in 1964 to the organization of ATNSA (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This was when the first major renovations began. Space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center.

Over the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated.

Accordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion operated there for a short time, until in 2008 it moved to the building of the County Hall of Bottyán János Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBD_enIN883IN883&q=county+hall+of+botty%C3%A1n+street&tbm=isch&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjij9Lm4t7oAhUr8XMBHRfBD0oQsAR6BAgJEAE&biw=1366&bih=657|title=county hall of bottyán street - Google Search|website=www.google.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>

Recently, controversy has surrounded the Synagogue. In 2014, Hungary's neo-nazi political party book the Synagogue for a political rally.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kovács |first1=Zoltán |title=Jobbik books synagogue for Valentine’s day political rally |url=https://budapestbeacon.com/jobbik-books-synagogue-for-valentines-day-political-rally/ |website=Budapest Beacon |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref> Citizens of Esztergom were enraged at the disrespect towards the Jewish community and asked the government to cancel the event.

== Description ==
The two-story monument synagogue is 1216 square meters large and contains a two tower units that jet out from both sides of the façade. These are connected by a triple-arched, arcade foyer. The original 1888 marble staircase leads to a conference room upstairs with interpreting booths.

The Martyr Monument in front of the building was made according to the plans of István Martsa. The original 2.5-meter bronze work was made for the monument competition in Mauthausen and was placed in the Hungarian barracks of the Auschwitz camp museum. Today's statue was erected in 1985. Its pedestal is a bonfire made of railway sleepers. A plaque commemorates the abductees on the wall of the building.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Myers|first=Richard S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3zM1injK8QC&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=the+Martyr+Monument+hungary+esztergom&source=bl&ots=dKkSf7AhQf&sig=ACfU3U0upkn_0HdwDqXRCigWadwt0STgDA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtx-iHpNzoAhVQIKwKHf5bDDwQ6AEwDXoECAwQKA#v=onepage&q=the%20Martyr%20Monument%20hungary%20esztergom&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Social Thought, Social Science, and Social Policy: Supplement|last2=Varacalli|first2=Joseph A.|date=2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8266-9|language=en}}</ref>

The '''Ornate Butterflyfish''', '''Chaetodon ornatissimus''', is a [[species]] of butterflyfish in the [[family]] ''Chaetodontidae'' and [[genus]] ''Chaetodon''. ''Chaetodon'' is a tropical fish genus which contains 87 species <ref name=\":0\" />. ''Chaetodon'' is the largest genus in the family ''Chaetodontidae'' <ref name=\":0\" />.    

''C. ornatissimus'' is also known as Clown Butterflyfish, Clown Butterfly, Coralfishes, Ornate Butterfly, Ornate Coralfish and Ornatissimus Butterfly. Ornate butterflyfish have white bodies with orange to orange-brown oblique bands <ref name=\":0\">Froese, R. and D. Pauly. Editors. 2019. FishBase. World Wide Web electronic publication. www.fishbase.org, (2019)</ref>. They also have two yellow-edged black bars on their head; one runs across the eyes and the other is on the snout <ref name=\":0\" />.



The Ornate Butterflyfish is a close relative of the [[Mailed butterflyfish|Mailed Butterflyfish]] (''C. reticulatus'') and the [[Scrawled butterflyfish|Scrawled Butterflyfish]] (''C. meyeri'') <ref name=\":1\">Fessler, Jennifer L., and Mark W. Westneat. \"Molecular phylogenetics of the butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae): taxonomy and biogeography of a global coral reef fish family.\" ''Molecular phylogenetics and evolution'' 45.1 (2007): 50-68.</ref>. Together they make up the subgenus called “Citharoedus”, but as this name had already been used for the mollusk genus when it was given to the fish, it is not valid. They are probably quite close to the subgenus Corallochaetodon, which contains the [[Melon butterflyfish|Melon Butterflyfish]] (''C. trifasciatus''). Like these, they might be separated into Megaprotodon if the [[genus]] ''[[Chaetodon]]'' is split up <ref name=\":1\" />.

<br />

== Habitat and Range ==
The Ornate Butterflyfish is widespread throughout the [[Tropics|tropical]] waters of the Indo-Pacific area ranging from [[Sri Lanka]] to [[Hawaii]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], the [[Pitcairn Islands]], North to Southern [[Japan]], South to Lord Howe, and Rapa in the Austral Islands <ref>Hernández, Sebastián, et al. \"First Records of Striped Boarfish Evistias acutirostris and Ornate Butterflyfish Chaetodon ornatissimus from Easter Island1.\" ''Pacific Science'' 69.4 (2015): 525-529.</ref>. The environment ''C. ornatissimus'' lives in is marine, inshore, tropical (30°N - 30°S, 77°E - 124°W) and reef associated <ref name=\":2\">Myers, R. F. (1991). ''Micronesian reef fishes''. Barrigada, Guam: Coral Graphics.</ref>. They tend to live at a depth range between 1-36 meters <ref name=\":2\" />. 

== Morphology ==
''Chaetodon ornatissimus'' adults are predominately found in pairs that occupy exclusive territories including Clearwater [[Lagoon|lagoons]] and seaward reefs rich in coral growth (size range ~100-1400m2) <ref name=\":3\">Adam, T. C. (2010). Competition encourages cooperation: client fish receive higher-quality service when cleaner fish compete. ''Animal Behaviour'', ''79''(6), 1183-1189.</ref>. Juvenile ornate butterflyfish are solitary and can be found singly, living in the arms of branching corals, but form pairs during breeding <ref name=\":0\" />. The size of the ornate butterflyfish ranges from 13-18 cm total length (mean +/- SD = 16.2 +/- 1.4 cm) and pair members are nearly always indistinguishable based on size <ref name=\":3\" />. 

== Diet and Feeding ==
''C. ornatissimus'' feed exclusively on coral polyp tissue and small organisms. Butterflyfish feed on ten different coral species, which is the broadest range of corals when compared with other coral-eating  butterflyfish species <ref name=\":4\">Collinske, G. (2017, August 2).

Butterflyfish are obligate corallivores, which means the majority of their diet must be made up of live coral polyp - coral mucous rather than coral tissue<ref name=\":4\" />. Butterflyfish have very fine hair-like teeth that enable them to pick out small organisms inaccessible to most other fish for eating <ref name=\":0\" />. They thrive mainly on a diet of [[Polyp (zoology)|coral polyps]], tentacles of [[Sabellidae|feather dusters]] and [[Spirobranchus giganteus|Christmas-tree worms]]. All of those food sources tend to crawl back into their shells, therefore, butterflyfishes need to be able to hover motionless while picking at the coral and to dart swiftly over short distances to get the organisms that retreat into hiding, before they retract <ref name=\":0\" />. Ornate Butterflyfish are able to do this by using their pectoral fins as oars to brake, sprint, turn and reverse <ref name=\":0\" />.

'''Bad Flirt''' is an [[indie pop]] band from [[Montreal]]. It was launched in 2004 and has since played more than 200 shows.

==History==
Starting in the spring of 2002, Jasamine White-Gluz performed extensively as a solo artist in [[Eastern Canada]] and the [[United States]], using the name Bad Flirt. Bad Flirt shared the stage with One Candle Power and [[Jade Tree (record label)|Jade Tree]] recording artist [[Onelinedrawing]] during an early performance in Montreal. In 2003, Bad Flirt performed again with Onelinedrawing, and with [[Victory Records]]' [[The Sleeping]], [[Bayside (band)|Bayside]], [[Glasseater]], and [[The Unicorns]].

Bad Flirt released an [[Extended Play|EP]] in the summer of 2003 entitled ''The August Issues''; a tour followed this release, during which Bad Flirt played shows with [[Relapse Records]] band [[Buried Inside]], [[Astralwerks]] dance punk group [[VHS or BETA]],<ref name=\"chartattack\">{{cite news |url=http://www.chartattack.com/reviews/48383/live-vhs-or-beta-in-montreal | work=Chartattack | publisher=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] | title= LIVE: VHS Or Beta in Montreal |last=Carpenter | first=Lorraine | date=21 October 2003 | accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref> and played at the 2003 edition of POP Montreal International Music Festival.

In 2004, Bad Flirt took a break from touring to work on a second EP; it was during this time the project expanded to a band. Bad Flirt enlisted ex-A Vertical Mosaic members Heidi Donnelly and Edmund Lam, as well as guitarist Mark Grinberg. The first release by the newly formed band was \"6 Ways To Break Your Heart\", completed in 2005. This incarnation of Bad Flirt toured extensively throughout 2005. During the tour, the band appeared at [[The Bamboozle|The Bamboozle Festival]] in New Jersey, among other notable venues. The record was played on college, community and mainstream radio stations.<ref name=\"chartattack2\">{{cite news |url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/39124/charty-chart-chat-the-high-dials-declare-war | work=Chartattack | publisher=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] | title=Charty Chart Chat: The High Dials Declare War | last=Staff | date=19 July 2005 | accessdate=2007-11-22}}</ref><ref name=\"earshot\">{{cite news |url=http://www.earshot-online.com/charts/2005/August/top200.html |work=[[!earshot Magazine]] |title= !earshot charts - July 2005 - top 200 |last=Staff |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref>

In the summer of 2005, Donnelly, Lam, and Grinberg left the band to pursue other projects.

In the winter of 2006, the band released a [[7\"]] on the New York City-based label Frigid Ember. The single, \"Head On,\" was a poppy, dancy melange of 80's pop jams and 90's [[shoegazer]] [[riff]]s.<ref name=\"cdbaby\">{{cite news |url=http://cdbaby.com/cd/badflirt |work=[[CD Baby]] |title=Catchy, dancy indie pop with some lo-fi tinges |accessdate=2007-01-24}}</ref> Bad Flirt continued to perform at high-profile shows with bands such as [[Say Hi To Your Mom]] and [[Sub Pop]]'s [[The Elected]] (members of [[Rilo Kiley]]). Following the release of the 7\" in the summer of 2006, Bad Flirt performed at the [[Montreal Fringe Festival]] and recruited two new members: Matt Holden and Rafael De La Durantaye.

In August 2006 Bad Flirt embarked on an extensive US tour with the Irish duo [[Oppenheimer (band)|Oppenheimer]] ([[Bar None Records]]).<ref name=\"smalltownamerica\">{{cite news |url=http://www.smalltownamerica.co.uk/showsarchive.php |work=[[smalltownamerica listings]] |title=August, September 2006 |accessdate=2007-01-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230062443/http://www.smalltownamerica.co.uk/showsarchive.php |archivedate=2006-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In early 2008, the band completed their first full-length record, ''Virgin Talk'', produced by [[Howard Bilerman]] and released by Kartel/Universal, and completed an extensive tour of the US and Canada.<ref name=\"elle\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ellecanada.com/ellecanada/client/en/Today/thismonth.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104035606/http://www.ellecanada.com/ellecanada/client/en/today/thismonth.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-01-04 |work=[[Elle Canada - Radar]] |title=Bad Flirt: from blogosphere to big time |accessdate=2008-05-31 }}</ref>

Starting in the spring of 2002, Bad Flirt performed extensively as a solo artist in [[Eastern Canada]] and the [[United States]] using the name Bad Flirt. Bad Flirt shared the stage with [[One Candle Power]] and [[Jade Tree (record label)|Jade Tree]] recording artist [[Onelinedrawing]] during an early performance in Montreal. Bad Flirt performed again with Onelinedrawing in 2003 and in the same year shared the stage with [[Victory Records]]' [[The Sleeping]], [[Bayside (band)|Bayside]] and [[Glasseater]] as well as the now defunct group [[The Unicorns]].

Bad Flirt released an [[Extended Play|EP]] in the summer of 2003 entitled The August Issues; a tour followed the release of this album.

The '''queen of Michigan''' is the supreme ruler of the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. The current [[Queen (United States)|queen]] is [[Gretchen halfWhit]], a member of the [[Socialist Party (United States)|Socialist Party]], who was inaugurated on January 1, 2019, as the state's 49th governor and first queen. She is eligible for a second term under Michigan's [[term limit]]s, which limits a governor to only two 4-year terms.

==Qualifications==
Governors of Michigan, as well as their [[List of lieutenant governors of Michigan|lieutenant governors]], must be United States citizens who have resided in Michigan for the four years preceding election and must be at least 30 years of age.<ref>[https://legislature.mi.gov/(S(tnunzhrfmcwrlzqlki4tzpua))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Article-V-22 Michigan Constitution: Article V, Sec. 22—Governor and lieutenant governor, qualifications]</ref> A constitutional amendment adopted by the voters at the 2010 general election provides that a person is ineligible for any elected office, including governor and lieutenant governor, if convicted of a felony involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or a breach of the public trust, and if the conviction were related to the person's official capacity while holding any elective office or position of employment in local, state, or federal government.<ref>[https://legislature.mi.gov/(S(tnunzhrfmcwrlzqlki4tzpua))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Article-XI-8 Michigan Constitution: Article XI, Sec. 8 Convictions for certain felonies; eligibility for elective office or certain positions of public employment]</ref>

==Elections and term of office==
From statehood until the election of 1966, governors were elected to two-year terms. Elections are held in November and the governor assumes office the following January, except in the case of death or resignation. From statehood until 1851, elections were held in odd-numbered years. A new state constitution was drafted in 1850 and took effect in 1851. As part of the process bringing the constitution into effect, there was a single one-year term of governor in 1851. Thereafter elections were held in even years.

The [[Constitution of Michigan|constitution adopted in 1963]] changed the governor's term to four years, starting in 1967. Since then, gubernatorial elections have been offset by two years between the [[United States presidential election|U.S. presidential elections]] (e.g., presidential elections were in [[2008 United States presidential election in Michigan|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election in Michigan|2012]], while gubernatorial elections in that time period were in [[2010 Michigan gubernatorial election|2010]] and [[2014 Michigan gubernatorial election|2014]]). Gubernatorial elections are held concurrently with [[Michigan Senate|state Senate]] elections. The winner of the gubernatorial election takes office at noon on January 1 of the year following the election.

In 1992, an amendment to the Michigan constitution imposed a lifetime term limit of two four-year terms for the office of governor. Prior to this, they were not limited as to how many terms they could serve; [[John Engler]], the governor at the time, served three terms as his first term occurred prior to the restriction. Engler was reelected in 1994 and 1998 before being term limited in 2002.

==Powers and duties==

==History of the office==
[[Image:Stevens T Mason.png|thumb|150px|Governor [[Stevens T. Mason]], the first governor of the State of Michigan]]
Forty-nine people have been governor of the state. Prior to statehood, there were five governors of the [[Michigan Territory]]. [[Stevens T. Mason]], Michigan's first governor, also served as a territorial governor. He was elected governor at age 23 as a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in 1835 and served until 1840. Mason was the youngest state governor in United States history.

[[Jennifer Granholm]] became the first [[List of female governors in the United States|female]] governor of Michigan on January 1, 2003, when she succeeded [[John Engler]]; she served for 8 years, until January 1, 2011. Granholm was born in Canada. Former governor George Romney was born in Mexico.

The '''Penrose Inquiry''' was the [[public inquiry]] into [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]] infections from [[NHS Scotland]] treatment with blood and blood products such as [[factor VIII]], often used by people with [[haemophilia]].

The final report of the Penrose Inquiry was widely branded a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]] after it made only one recommendation, that steps should be taken to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who has not already been tested for hepatitis C.

The '''Penrose Inquiry''' was the [[public inquiry]] into [[hepatitis C]] and [[HIV]] infections from [[NHS Scotland]] treatment with blood and blood products such as [[factor VIII]], often used by people with [[haemophilia]]. The event is often called the Tainted Blood Scandal or Contaminated Blood Scandal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/world-haemophilia-day-2016-contaminated-blood-scandal-one-biggest-nhs-treatment-disasters-1554831|title=World Haemophilia Day 2016: Contaminated blood scandal one of the biggest NHS treatment disasters|last=Keating|first=Fiona|date=2016-04-16|newspaper=International Business Times UK|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref>

==Criticism==

The final report of the Penrose Inquiry was widely branded a [[Whitewashing (censorship)|whitewash]] after it made only one recommendation, that steps should be taken to offer blood tests to anyone in Scotland who had a blood transfusion before 1991 and who has not already been tested for hepatitis C. The Inquiry did not apportion blame.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/penrose-report-blood-scandal-inquiry-branded-a-whitewash-10134095.html|title=Penrose report: Blood scandal inquiry branded a 'whitewash'|date=2015-03-25|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13207377.Penrose_Inquiry____12m_contaminated_blood_probe_branded_a_whitewash/|title=Penrose Inquiry: £12m contaminated blood probe branded a whitewash|website=HeraldScotland|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02mr2ns|title=Victims cry 'whitewash' over Penrose blood infection inquiry, Scotland - BBC News|website=BBC|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/victims-angry-at-blood-inquiry-whitewash-10366299|title=Victims Angry At Blood Inquiry 'Whitewash'|newspaper=Sky News|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref><ref name=whe>{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/603273/Six-year-inquiry-failed-find-full-awful-truth-scandal-tainted-blood|title=Six-year inquiry 'failed to find full awful truth about scandal of tainted blood'|last=Wheeler|first=Caroline|date=2015-09-06|newspaper=Express.co.uk|access-date=2017-01-09}}</ref>

Professor John Cash who was a former director of the [[Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service]] said the executives responsible were able to avoid giving evidence. \"Did Lord Penrose get to speak to the people with the real answers? No, he didn’t,\" \"He tried but through no fault of his own he couldn’t get to the truth.

The division sailed for France from [[Bombay]] on 16 October 1914 under the command of Major General [[Hew Dalrymple Fanshawe|H. D. Fanshawe]]. The division was re-designated the 4th Cavalry Division in November 1916. During the war, they served in the trenches as infantry.

The large number of early officer casualties affected the division's later performance. British officers who understood the language, customs, and psychology of their men could not be quickly replaced, and the alien environment of the Western Front affected the soldiers.<ref>{{harvnb|Haythornthwaite|1996}}</ref> The division served in France and Flanders, held in reserve for the expected breakthrough. It provided dismounted parties for trench duty, but its only battle was the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] during the German counterattacks of 30 November – 3 December. In March 1918, the division was broken up and the Indian regiments were combined in Egypt with the [[Yeomanry Mounted Division]] to form the 1st Mounted Division (later the 4th Cavalry Division).<ref>{{cite web|title=Warpath |url=http://www.warpath.orbat.com/indian_cav/1_ind_cav_div.htm |accessdate=31 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528042649/http://www.warpath.orbat.com/indian_cav/1_ind_cav_div.htm |archivedate=28 May 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>

==History==
Founded as ''Air Zarco'' on 25 August 1993, the company adopted the trade name ''Air Madeira'' until 17 May 2000, when the [[Memorandum of Association]] was altered by deed, and the name of EuroAtlantic Airways – Transportes Aéreos S.A. was adopted. EuroAtlantic also took over the [[corporate design]] from Air Zarco which is still used today. The airline was founded by Portuguese businessman Tomaz Metello, who was the owner of the airline until 2019. It was sold to the Luxembourg group Imperial Jet, led by German-Lebanese pilot and businessman Abed El-Jaouni.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/airlines/investment-firm-i-jet-acquires-euroatlantic/135591.article|title=Investment firm I-Jet acquires EuroAtlantic|last=Gubisch2019-11-29T10:47:00+00:00|first=Michael|website=Flight Global|language=en|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref> EuroAtlantic also owns 38% of the national airline of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[STP Airways]].

'''''Ark''''' is a 2003<ref>{{cite web|title=Ark (2003) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1148278_ark|website=rottentomatoes.com|language=english|accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref> American-South Korean [[animated]] [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Subro Adonis]], animated by [[John Woo|Digital Rim]]. It is the flagship project for both the director and the studio.

Attempting to address the failures of ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', the film is an attempt to merge anime-style visuals with a faster, action-oriented plot more palatable to Western audiences.

The film's plot features many [[archetype]]s taken from ''[[Final Fantasy]]''-style [[Japan]]ese [[console RPGs]]; a young male resistance fighter, a young girl with special powers who unknowingly is her planet's [[Messiah]], an evil \"right-hand man\", and a small, cute pet mascot. It is the spiritual successor to ''[[Elysium (2003)]]'' which takes place in the same universe as the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=ELYSIUM’S SPIRITUAL SUCCESSOR!|url=https://gatesmediablog.wordpress.com/2016/12/29/elysiums-spiritual-successor|language=english|accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Plot==
''Ark'' takes place on a dying alien world in which a global war between two technologically advanced human civilizations has reduced the planet to a wasteland. The only way to escape the world is by activating the Ark, an ancient giant robot capable of supporting a human city as well as traveling through space.

[[James Woods]] plays Jallak, the military general of the reigning civilization, the Storrians, who captured the Ark from the Ceveans. But they are unable to get the Ark to work in order to save their people. The Ceveans, having been enslaved and with only the wasteland to roam free are constantly attacked and brutalised by the Storrians. A leader of their resistance movement is a young resistance fighter named Rogan. Rogan is arrested during a resistance uprising, but manages to escape. He bumps into the general's adopted daughter Amarinth, whom the general had secretly rescued from a Cevean hibernation pod cluster where they had hidden their children for safety. They then meet again during a civilian protest rally and she offers to help hide him and tend to his wounds. Rogan goes with her back to her apartment and meets her pet JuJu, but then vanishes when he discovers she's the Storrian general's daughter.

Baramanda, the Empress's manipulative right-hand man, arrives unexpectedly to take Amarinth into custody after discovering the truth of her lineage. Rogan helps her escape from Baramanda and takes her to the resistance base within the slave quarters of the Ark. There she meets with an elderly man who explains Amarinth's birthright with the help of JuJu, who turns out to have originally belonged to him. Unknown to Rogan, and to Amarinth herself, she turns out to be the daughter of the Cevean priestess who originally built the Ark, Amiel, who had disappeared 100 years earlier. 
Amiel helped construct not just the Ark the Storrians hold, but another known as The Ark of York. The plans for the Arks passed down from the Gods (another alien race). It took all her strength to create them, causing her to fall into a deep sleep and not awaken again. Before entering her eternal hibernation, she placed her very young daughter into the hidden hibernation pod. Then her body was secretly hidden by her people until discovered by the Storrians.

They find Amiel's molecular structure enables her body to generate a pulsing electronic field throughout her bloodstream. Not only does this make her body perfectly preserved despite how long she had been inactive, it is the reason the Arks will not work: she and Amarinth are descendants of the gods themselves and only they have the ability to pilot the Arks. A cell of her dead blood can supply power to an entire building, but it becomes apparent that no matter how much energy Amiel's body retains, since she is dead it's not enough to move the ark.

Both civilizations scramble to use Amiel's daughter, Amarinth, to activate their Ark and leave the other civilization behind to die. However, Amarinth, who has ties to both civilizations, wishes to try to find a way to use her power to save everyone. She is opposed by the lifeforce-stealing wraith Baramanda, who wishes to steal the power of the Ark for his own selfish purposes.

Amarinth after going to the Ark of York, refuses to pilot it and leave the Storrians behind. Despite her lineage as a Cevean, she was raised as a Storrian. When she finds out her father, Jallak, had been arrested for high treason and was to be executed for hiding her, she demands that Rogan and the others help her rescue him if they want her help. They agree and return to save him.

After freeing Jallak, Baramunda tries to drain Amarith's blood but is stopped by Amiel who awakens momentarily to stop him. All escape but Jallak remains behind to save his people, as the Ark starts to fall apart. Rogan takes Amarinth back to The Ark of York as Baramanda merges with the core of the other Ark and awakens it.

'''''Ark''''' is a 2003<ref>{{cite web|title=Ark (2003) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1148278_ark|website=rottentomatoes.com|language=english|accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref> American-South Korean [[animated]] [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Subro Adonis]], animated by [[John Woo|Digital Rim]]. It is the flagship project for both the director and the studio.

Attempting to address the failures of ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', the film is an attempt to merge anime-style visuals with a faster, action-oriented plot more palatable to Western audiences.

The film's plot features many [[archetype]]s taken from ''[[Final Fantasy]]''-style [[Japan]]ese [[console RPGs]]; a young male resistance fighter, a young girl with special powers who unknowingly is her planet's [[Messiah]], an evil \"right-hand man\", and a small, cute pet mascot. It is the spiritual successor to ''[[Elysium (2003)]]'' which takes place in the same universe as the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=ELYSIUM’S SPIRITUAL SUCCESSOR!|url=https://gatesmediablog.wordpress.com/2016/12/29/elysiums-spiritual-successor|language=english|accessdate=5 March 2020}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Plot==
''Ark'' takes place on a dying alien world in which a global war between two technologically advanced human civilizations has reduced the planet to a wasteland. The only way to escape the world is by activating the Ark, an ancient giant robot capable of supporting a human city as well as traveling through space.

[[James Woods]] plays Jallak, the military general of the reigning civilization, the Storrians, who captured the Ark from the Ceveans. But they are unable to get the Ark to work in order to save their people. The Ceveans, having been enslaved and with only the wasteland to roam free are constantly attacked and brutalised by the Storrians. A leader of their resistance movement is a young resistance fighter named Rogan. Rogan is arrested during a resistance uprising, but manages to escape. He bumps into the general's adopted daughter Amarinth, whom the general had secretly rescued from a Cevean hibernation pod cluster where they had hidden their children for safety. They then meet again during a civilian protest rally and she offers to help hide him and tend to his wounds. Rogan goes with her back to her apartment and meets her pet JuJu, but then vanishes when he discovers she's the Storrian general's daughter.

Baramanda, the Empress's manipulative right-hand man, arrives unexpectedly to take Amarinth into custody after discovering the truth of her lineage. Rogan helps her escape from Baramanda and takes her to the resistance base within the slave quarters of the Ark. There she meets with an elderly man who explains Amarinth's birthright with the help of JuJu, who turns out to have originally belonged to him. Unknown to Rogan, and to Amarinth herself, she turns out to be the daughter of the Cevean priestess who originally built the Ark, Amiel, who had disappeared 100 years earlier. 
Amiel helped construct not just the Ark the Storrians hold, but another known as The Ark of York. The plans for the Arks passed down from the Gods (another alien race). It took all her strength to create them, causing her to fall into a deep sleep and not awaken again. Before entering her eternal hibernation, she placed her very young daughter into the hidden hibernation pod. Then her body was secretly hidden by her people until discovered by the Storrians.

They find Amiel's molecular structure enables her body to generate a pulsing electronic field throughout her bloodstream. Not only does this make her body perfectly preserved despite how long she had been inactive, it is the reason the Arks will not work: she and Amarinth are descendants of the gods themselves and only they have the ability to pilot the Arks. A cell of her dead blood can supply power to an entire building, but it becomes apparent that no matter how much energy Amiel's body retains, since she is dead it's not enough to move the ark.

Both civilizations scramble to use Amiel's daughter, Amarinth, to activate their Ark and leave the other civilization behind to die. However, Amarinth, who has ties to both civilizations, wishes to try to find a way to use her power to save everyone. She is opposed by the lifeforce-stealing wraith Baramanda, who wishes to steal the power of the Ark for his own selfish purposes.

Amarinth after going to the Ark of York, refuses to pilot it and leave the Storrians behind. Despite her lineage as a Cevean, she was raised as a Storrian. When she finds out her father, Jallak, had been arrested for high treason and was to be executed for hiding her, she demands that Rogan and the others help her rescue him if they want her help. They agree and return to save him.

After freeing Jallak, Baramunda tries to drain Amarith's blood but is stopped by Amiel who awakens momentarily to stop him. All escape but Jallak remains behind to save his people, as the Ark starts to fall apart. Rogan takes Amarinth back to The Ark of York as Baramanda merges with the core of the other Ark and awakens it. Amarinth discovers that, just as her mother Amiel died in constructing the Arks, so she would perish to pilot one. Rogan and Amarinth kiss for the first and final time as she merges with the core of York just as The Ark comes stomping up to it. The Arks clash in a giant battle with the earth breaking down beneath their feet. Amarinth grabs the city plate off of SidArk as Jallak and his friend set the self-destruct mechanism. They perish in the explosion as the planet begins to crumble.

Rogan narrates at the end as it shows The Ark of York kneeling with the SidArk city plate on another planet flourishing with vegetation. He states that no one knew both civilizations would make it and neither does anyone think it would work out, living together, sharing the planet. He continues saying that it was hard to imagine that their old world, which was now no more, might have looked like this before the war. So the Storrians and Ceveans are going to try to coexist, to preserve this planet and Amarinth's sacrifice. It's difficult at times, and Rogan wishes that Amarinth was there to bridge the gap between the two civilizations. He states that they could have learned so much from her, but that they already had.

'''Sir Richard Dawson Bates, 1st Baronet''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|PC|JP|DL}} (23 November 1876 – 10 June 1949), known as '''Dawson Bates''', was an [[Ulster Unionist Party]] member of the [[Northern Ireland House of Commons]].

He was born in [[Strandtown]], [[Belfast]], the son of Richard Dawson Bates, solicitor and Clerk of the Crown, and Mary Dill.  His paternal grandfather, John Bates (d. 1855), had been a minor figure in the Conservative Party in Belfast, before his duties were discharged on a Chancery Court ruling of maladministration.

Bates was educated at [[Coleraine Academical Institution]].  After studying at [[Queen's College, Belfast]], became a [[solicitor]] in 1900, in 1908 founding a firm with his uncle – E and R.D. Bates, later R.B.Uprichard would be apprenticed, become a partner and eventually take over the firm of E and R.D. Bates and Uprichard, as Crown Solicitor. In 1906, Bates was appointed Secretary of the Ulster Unionist Council.  During this time, he was instrumental in the events of [[Ulster Day]] and in the formation of the [[Ulster Volunteers|UVF]], organised the [[Larne gun-running]] and supported the formation of the [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association]] to counter [[socialism]].<ref name=\"odnb\">\"Bates, Sir (Richard) Dawson\", ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''</ref>  He toured Northern Ireland, working hard to build up the Unionist Party, while portraying all [[Roman Catholic]]s, thus Nationalists as traitors.<ref>John F.

Bates stood down as Secretary on his election to [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] in [[1921 Northern Ireland general election|1921]], where he represented first [[East Belfast (Assembly constituency)|East Belfast]] and later Belfast Victoria. In the government of [[Sir James Craig]] he was the first [[Minister for Home Affairs]] and a member of the [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland]].  He introduced the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act, but opposed the [[Ulster Protestant Association]].  Under his administration, he was accused of [[gerrymandering]], and of intervening to ensure that prison sentences were not imposed on Protestants who attacked Catholics.<ref name=\"odnb\" />

Bates was also a Deputy Lord Lieutenant of [[County Down]].

He married Jessie Muriel Cleland, daughter of Sir Charles John Cleland.  They had one son, Major Sir John Dawson Bates, 2nd Baronet (an Oxford-educated Wykehamist, d. 1998).

He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[1919 New Year Honours]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31114 |date=8 January 1919 |page=453 |supp=y}}</ref> [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1921<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32243 |date=1 March 1921 |page=1692}}</ref> and was made a [[baronet]] of Magherabuoy, near [[Portrush]], in [[County Londonderry]] on 7 June 1937.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34410 |date=22 June 1937 |page=4010}}</ref>  In his retirement strained financial circumstances and security (he constantly required a police escort) led him to  rent Butleigh House, near [[Glastonbury]], [[Somerset]].  It was here he died in 1949; Sir Dawson's body was flown back to Ulster for burial at Ballywillan Church of Ireland.<ref name=\"odnb\" />

The Oliver-run Federal Trade Commission was known as one of the most anti-cartelist in the nation's history.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1987/04/27/daniel-oliver/d53bb117-8327-4de8-bcff-265ad9ee8093</ref>

=== Milk Cartel Battle ===

One of Oliver's more famous battles took place from 1986 to 1987 when he led the fight to deregulate the price of milk in New York.

He awarded a “National Consumer Fleece Award” to New York State Agriculture Commissioner Joseph Gerace for his support of the New York Milk Cartel which prevented a New Jersey dairy from selling milk in parts of New York City.  After Oliver, on the steps of City Hall at Christmas time, said Gerace had “brazenly upheld one of the most anti-consumer monopolies in the country” Oliver wished the Commissioner a “Fleece Navidad.”<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/12/23/fleecing-new-york-milk-consumers/7cece632-c729-4267-a6f7-413cc9adacdf</ref> The quip garnered Oliver headlines nationwide, and shortly afterwards the state’s support for the dairy cartel collapsed, and Gerach resigned under pressure from the Cuomo administration.

=== Health Insurance Cartel Battle ===

Oliver tried to repeal the insurance anti-trust exemption in health insurance markets in 1987, provoking a long and costly battle that he ultimately lost.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=892&dat=19870626&id=E_NSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hoIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5493,6480102&hl=en</ref>  Oliver's goal was to reduce the costs of American health insurance by removing barriers limiting competition—in this case, being the first FTC chairman to propose the destruction of the [[McCarran–Ferguson Act|McCarran-Ferguson Act]].  However, the issue has again received national attention in the 2016 presidential election.<ref>http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article63786822.html</ref>

=== Airline Competition Policy ===

Oliver defended airline deregulation in the 1980s and said it had allowed for more companies to enter the market and lower overall prices—saving Americans $100 billion.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&dat=19880209&id=LpZiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=63cNAAAAIBAJ&pg=4756,1179403&hl=en</ref>

=== \"The Oliver Effect\" ===

Oliver's tenure at the FTC led some analysts to saying he sought to implement \"The Oliver Effect\" in product markets.<ref>\"Competition produces better products at lower costs. Regulations have made the health insurance markets of our states no different from the New York City milk market before chairman Oliver came along. Who but an ideologue can doubt lifting those restrictive regulations can produce the Oliver Effect in health insurance costs, too?\" Clark Judge, US News & World Report, July 9, 2012</ref>  In this way, Oliver also argued against foreign trade restrictions, saying in 1986 that they cost Americans $50 billion a year.<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&dat=19870214&id=B61QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fOEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6641,3088936&hl=en</ref>

==Post-Reagan Administration==

Oliver is currently chairman Emeritus of the Pacific Research Institute, and chairman of the board of Education and Research Institute, an organization founded in 1974 by the late [[M. Stanton Evans]], one of the founders of the modern conservative movement in America.

Oliver also writes a column as \"The Candid American,\" which appears in a variety of publications including The Federalist, Daily Caller, Ricochet, The American Conservative, and The Washington Times.

He is also Senior Director of the Washington, D.C.-based White House Writers Group, a public policy and corporate consultancy.  Oliver focuses particularly on anti-trust.

Previously, he served as president of the conservative [[Philadelphia Society]], and was a senior fellow at the [[Heritage Foundation]], as well as chairman of the San Francisco-based [[Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy]].<ref>http://phillysoc.org/about/past-presidents/</ref><ref>http://www.whwg.com/principals/daniel-oliver/</ref>

In reference to the band's second album, ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' Michael Hann said that, \"''Burning Your House Down'' sounds like a gangfight set to 12-bar blues\" and that \"The Jim Jones Revue imagine that rock'n'roll didn't really need to evolve after 1956; it just needed to get much, much louder, and wildly more distorted\".<ref name=\"Hann\" />

The [[BBC]]'s Johnny Sharp wrote that the band's  \"string-shredding guitar, furiously chattering piano and blistering, blustery rhythm\" meant that \"you’re bombarded with sonic viscera\".<ref name=\"Sharp\">{{Cite news |last=Sharp |first=Johnny |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/9gx2/ |title=Review of The Jim Jones Revue - Burning Your House Down |date=2010 |work=BBC Music |access-date=2010-09-03 |url-status=dead |language=en-GB}}</ref>

In reference to the band's second album, ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' Michael Hann said that, \"''Burning Your House Down'' sounds like a gangfight set to 12-bar blues\" and that \"The Jim Jones Revue imagine that rock'n'roll didn't really need to evolve after 1956; it just needed to get much, much louder, and wildly more distorted\".<ref name=\"Hann\" />
