Much of his literature concerns racial themes, especially related to the plight of African Americans during the late 19th to mid-20th centuries, who suffered discrimination and violence in the South and the North. Literary critics believe his work helped change [[race relations in the United States]] in the mid-20th century.<ref>Alan Wald, [http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2031 \"On Richard Wright's Centennial: The Great Outsider\"], Solidarity.</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Richard Wright historical marker, Natchez, MS IMG 6941.JPG|thumb|A historic marker in [[Natchez, Mississippi]], commemorating Richard Wright, who was born near the city]]\n\n=== Childhood in the South ===\nRichard Nathaniel Wright was born on September 4, 1908 at Rucker's Plantation, between the train town of Roxie and the larger river city of [[Natchez, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"Rayson2\">Rayson, Ann. \"Richard Wright's Life.\" [https://www.modernamericanpoetry.org ''Modern American Poetry''], Nelson, Cary and Brinkman, Bartholomew, eds.

His grandparents, still mad at him for destroying their house, repeatedly beat Wright and his brother.<ref name=fire/> But while he lived there, he was finally able to attend school regularly. He attended the local Seventh-day Adventist school from 1920 to 1921, with his aunt Addie as his teacher.<ref name=life/><ref name=childhood/> After a year, at the age of 13 he entered the Jim Hill public school in 1921, where he was promoted to sixth grade after only two weeks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 135\u2013138 |url= }}</ref> In his grandparents' [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] home, Richard was miserable, largely because his controlling aunt and grandmother tried to force him to pray to [[God]]. Wright later threatened to move out of his grandmother's home when she would not allow him to work on [[Saturday]]s. His aunt's and grandparents' overbearing attempts to control caused him to permanently hate [[Christians|Christian]]s and their works.<ref name=abuse/>\n\nAt the age of 15, while in eighth grade, Wright published his first story, \"The Voodoo of Hell's Half-Acre,\" in the local Black newspaper ''Southern Register.'' No copies survive.<ref name=\"Rayson2\"/> In Chapter 7 of ''Black Boy'', he described the story as about a villain who sought a widow's home.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher= Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 182\u2013186 |url= }}</ref>\n\nAfter excelling in grade school and junior high, in 1923, Wright earned the position of class [[valedictorian]] of Smith Robertson Junior High School from which he graduated in May 1925.<ref name=\"Rayson2\"/><ref name=life/> He was assigned to write a paper to be delivered at graduation in a public auditorium. Later, he was called to the principal's office, where the principal gave him a prepared speech to present in place of his own. Richard challenged the principal, saying \"the people are coming to hear the students, and I won't make a speech that you've written.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 193\u2013197 |url= }}</ref> The principal threatened him, suggesting that Richard might not be allowed to graduate if he persisted, despite his having passed all the examinations. He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an [[Uncle Tom]], Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. The principal put pressure on one of Richard's uncles to speak to the boy and get him to change his mind, but Richard continued to be adamant about presenting his own speech, and refused to let his uncle edit it. Despite pressure even from his classmates, Richard delivered his speech as he had planned.\n\nIn September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]], constructed for black students in Jackson\u2014the state's schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws\u2014but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money for family expenses.<ref name=\"Rayson3\">Rayson, Ann. \"Richard Wright's Life.\" [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/r_wright/wright_life.htm Modern American Poetry].

He planned to have his mother come to live with him when he could support her, and in 1926, his mother and younger brother did rejoin him. Shortly thereafter, Richard resolved to leave the [[Jim Crow economy|Jim Crow South]] and go to Chicago.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Black Boy |last= Wright |authorlink= |year= 1966 |publisher=Harper and Row |location= New York |isbn= |pages= 276\u2013278|url= }}</ref> His family joined the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], when tens of thousands of blacks left the South to seek opportunities in the more economically prosperous northern and mid-western industrial cities.\n\nWright's childhood in Mississippi, as well as in Memphis, Tennessee, and Elaine, Arkansas, shaped his lasting impressions of American racism.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black Boy |last=Wright |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=New York |isbn=0-06-081250-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig/page/455 455]\u2013459 |url=https://archive.org/details/blackboyamerican00wrig |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n=== Coming of age in Chicago ===\n\nWright and his family moved to Chicago in 1927. After securing employment as a United States postal clerk, during his time off, he read other writers and studied their styles. When he was fired from the post office during the [[Great Depression]], Wright was forced to go [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|on relief]] in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the [[John Reed Club]]. As the club was dominated by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems (\"We of the Red Leaves of Red Books\", for example), for ''[[The New Masses]]'' and other [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |first= Richard |authorlink= |editor= Crossman, Richard |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |publisher= [[Bantam Books]] |location= New York |language= |pages= 109\u201310 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nBy 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, ''Cesspool'', which was published posthumously as ''Lawd Today'' (1963). In January 1936 his story \"Big Boy Leaves Home\" was accepted for publication in ''New Caravan.'' In February of that year, he began working with the [[National Negro Congress]]. In April he chaired the [[South Side Writers Group]], whose members included [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. Wright submitted some of his critical essays and poetry to the group for criticism and read aloud some of his short stories. Through the club, he edited ''Left Front,'' a magazine that the Communist Party shut down in 1937, despite Wright's repeated protests.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 121 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to ''The New Masses'' magazine.\n\nPleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 123\u201326 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>  Some black Communists denounced Wright as a \"[[bourgeois]] intellectual.\"  Wright was essentially [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]]. He had been forced to end his public education after completing junior high school to support his mother and brother.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965|pages= 13\u201316 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= }}</ref>\n\nWright insisted that young communist writers be given space to cultivate their talents.  He had developed a working relationship with a [[black nationalist]] communist, which, along with his dissatisfaction with the attitudes of and restrictions imposed by those in the party, led to a public falling out with the party and a number of its leading members. Wright later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, [[The Communist Party and African-Americans|an African-American communist]] in his essay \"I tried to be a Communist\", published in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as ''American Hunger'', but removed from the actual publication of ''[[Black Boy]]'' upon request by the [[Book of the Month Club]].<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman|title= The God That Failed |year= 1960 |pages= 126\u201334 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}.

Press of Mississippi, 2015, pp. 72\u201373.</ref> Indeed, his relations with the party turned violent; Wright was threatened at knife point by [[fellow traveler|fellow-traveler]] co-workers, denounced as a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]] in the street by strikers, and physically assaulted by former comrades when he tried to join them during the 1936 [[May Day]] march.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= |title=The God That Failed |year=1965 |pages=143\u201345 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nIn 1937, Wright moved to New York, where he forged new ties with some Communist Party members. He worked on the [[Federal Writers' Project]] guidebook to the city, ''New York Panorama'' (1938), and wrote the book's essay on [[Harlem]]. Wright became the Harlem editor of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' a Communist newspaper. Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the ''Daily Worker'' and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine ''New Challenge.'' The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer [[Ralph Ellison]] that would last for years. He was awarded the ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine first prize of $500 for his short story \"Fire and Cloud\".<ref name=\"story\" />\n\nAfter receiving the ''Story'' prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of ''Lawd Today'' and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher [[Harper & Row|Harper]] all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.\n\nWright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled ''[[Uncle Tom's Children]]'' (1938). He based some stories on [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] in the [[Deep South]]. The publication and favorable reception of ''Uncle Tom's Children'' improved Wright's status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of ''New Masses.'' [[Granville Hicks]], a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel ''[[Native Son]],'' which he published in 1940.\n\nBased on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete ''Native Son.'' During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent [[Communists]] whom Wright had known in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T6-lhNKL3ncC&pg=PT147&dq=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton#v=onepage&q=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton&f=false|title=Literary Brooklyn: The Writers of Brooklyn and the Story of American City Life|first=Evan|last=Hughes|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=September 30, 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781429973069}}</ref> They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[Fort Greene Historic District|Fort Greene]] neighborhood.<ref>Oleksinski, Johnny.

It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, was a person bound by the limitations that society placed on African Americans. He gained his own [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts.\n\nWright was criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of ''Native Son,'' people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of ''Native Son'' was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by [[Edwin Rosskam]]. While in Chicago he visited the ''American Negro Exhibition'' with [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Claude McKay]].\n[[File:Canada-Lee-Native-Son-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Canada Lee]] as Bigger Thomas in the [[Orson Welles]] production of ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941)]]\nHe traveled to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], to collaborate with playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''Native Son.'' In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]] for noteworthy achievement. His play ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' opened on Broadway in March 1941, with [[Orson Welles]] as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, ''Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States,'' was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.\n\nWright's memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945) described his early life from [[Roxie, Mississippi|Roxie]] up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It included his clashes with [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. ''American Hunger'', which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of ''Black Boy.'' The [[Library of America]] edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.\n\n''American Hunger'' detailed Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implied he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the book's restored form, Wright used the [[diptych]] structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned \"bourgeois\" books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] in the [[Soviet Union]], but he continued to believe in far-left democratic solutions to political problems.\n\n===France===\n[[File:Plaque Richard Wright, 14 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, Paris 6.jpg|350px|thumbnail|Plaque commemorating Wright's residence in Paris, at 14, rue Monsieur le Prince.]]\n\nFollowing a stay of a few months in [[Qu\u00e9bec, Canada]], including a lengthy stay in the village of Sainte-P\u00e9tronille on the [[\u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans]],<ref>Jean-Christophe Cloutier, Introduction to ''Jack Kerouac, La vie est d'hommage'' (Bor\u00e9al, 2016), pp. 31\u201332.</ref> Wright moved to Paris in 1946.

''The Unfinished Quest of Richard Wright.'' pp. 374</ref> In following Fabre's argument, with respect to Wright's existentialist proclivities during the period of 1946 to 1951, Hue Woodson suggests that Wright's exposure to Husserl and Heidegger \"directly came as an intended consequence of the inadequacies of Sartre's synthesis of [[existentialism]] and [[Marxism]] for Wright.\"<ref>Woodson, Hue (2019). \"Heidegger and ''The Outsider,'' ''Savage Holiday,'' and ''The Long Dream''\" in ''Critical Insights: Richard Wright,'' Ed. Kimberly Drake. p. 62</ref>  His [[Existentialist]] phase was expressed in his second novel, ''[[The Outsider (Richard Wright)|The Outsider]]'' (1953), which described an African-American character's involvement with the Communist Party in New York. He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers [[Chester Himes]] and [[James Baldwin]]. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\" (collected in ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]''), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published ''Savage Holiday.''\n\nAfter becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology ''[[The God That Failed]];'' his essay had been published in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of ''Black Boy.'' He was invited to join the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the [[CIA]]. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the [[FBI]] had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as the teenager Bigger Thomas (Wright was 42) in an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] film version of ''[[Native Son (1951 film)|Native Son]].''\n\nIn mid-1953, Wright traveled to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], where [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as [[Ghana]]. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in [[Accra]] on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the [[U.S. Department of State|US State Department]]. The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah adviser [[George Padmore]] about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a [[Trinidad]]ian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, ''[[Black Power (Richard Wright book)|Black Power]],'' was published in 1954; its London publisher was [[Dennis Dobson]], who also published Padmore's work.<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause'' (2009), pp. 125\u201328.</ref>\n\nWhatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer [[Addison Gayle]], a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the [[Smith Act]].<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement'' (2001), p. 82.</ref>\n\nHistorian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the [[civil rights movement]] during the 1950s in the United States. She found that Wright was under what his friend Chester Himes called \"extraordinary pressure\" to avoid writing about the US.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> As ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine delayed publishing his essay, \"I Choose Exile,\" Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that \"a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.\"<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> He thought the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\">Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds'', pp. 80\u201381.</ref><ref>[http://thisissoulone.tumblr.com/post/21392983785/richard-wright-i-choose-exile-i-am-a-native The essay \"I Choose Exile\" Online published accessed August 5,2018]</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Wright visited [[Indonesia]] for the [[Bandung Conference]]. He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in ''[[The Color Curtain|The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference]].'' Wright was enthusiastic about the possibilities posed by this meeting of newly independent, former colonial nations.

It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0904.html \"Richard Wright, Writer, 52, Dies\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 30, 1960.</ref> A collection of [[short story|short stories]], ''Eight Men,'' was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's  death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.\n\nHis agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page ''Island of Hallucinations'' manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.\n\nOn June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of ''White Man, Listen!,'' Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of [[amoebic dysentery]], probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959 his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and \"four hassles in twelve days\" with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.\n\nOn February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of ''The Long Dream'' received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get ''The Long Dream'' published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of ''Island of Hallucinations,'' for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from [[Doubleday and Sons]].\n\nIn June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the [[Sorbonne]], Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.\n\nIn spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Still interested in literature, Wright helped [[Kyle Onstott]] get his novel ''[[Mandingo (novel)|Mandingo]]'' (1957) published in France.\n\nWright's last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture, \"The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States,\" delivered to students and members of the [[American Church in Paris]]. He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against ''Native Son'' and the quarrels which [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work ''Daddy Goodness'' and gave him the manuscript.\n\nHe died in Paris on November 28, 1960, of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 52. He was interred in [[Le P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]. Wright's daughter Julia has claimed that her father was murdered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rwright.htm |title=Richard Wright |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518164622/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rwright.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nA number of Wright's works have been published posthumously. In addition, some of Wright's more shocking passages dealing with race, sex, and politics were cut or omitted before original publication of works during his lifetime. In 1991, unexpurgated versions of ''Native Son,'' ''Black Boy,'' and his other works were published. In addition, in 1994, his novella ''Rite of Passage'' was published for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/children-s-books-black-history-bookshelf.html |title=Children's Books/Black History; Bookshelf |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1994}}</ref>\n\nIn the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form [[Haiku in English|haiku]] and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was published (''Haiku: This Other World'') with 817 of his own favorite haikus. Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.\n\nA collection of Wright's travel writings was published by [[Mississippi University Press]] in 2001.

Since the late 20th century, critics have had a resurgence of interest in it. ''Black Boy'' remains a vital work of historical, sociological, and literary significance whose seminal portrayal of one black man's search for self-actualization in a racist society strongly influenced the works of African-American writers who followed, such as [[James Baldwin]] and [[Ralph Ellison]].\n\nIt is generally agreed that the influence of Wright's ''Native Son'' is not a matter of literary style or technique.{{sfn|Corkery|2007|pp=17\u201328}} Rather, in this book affected ideas and attitudes, and ''Native Son'' has been a force in the social and intellectual history of the United States in the last half of the 20th century. \"Wright was one of the people who made me conscious of the need to struggle,\" said writer [[Amiri Baraka]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.itvs.org/RichardWright/more_info.html |title= Richard Wright \u2013 Black Boy |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Independent Television Service]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080715231354/http://www.itvs.org/RichardWright/more_info.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, scholars published critical essays about Wright in prestigious journals.

He also tried to entice Richard with an opportunity to become a teacher. Determined not to be called an [[Uncle Tom]], Richard refused to deliver the principal's address, written to avoid offending the white school district officials. The principal put pressure on one of Richard's uncles to speak to the boy and get him to change his mind, but Richard continued to be adamant about presenting his own speech, and refused to let his uncle edit it. Despite pressure even from his classmates, Richard delivered his speech as he had planned.\n\nIn September that year, Wright registered for mathematics, English, and history courses at the new [[Lanier High School (Jackson, Mississippi)|Lanier High School]], constructed for black students in Jackson\u2014the state's schools were segregated under its Jim Crow laws\u2014but he had to stop attending classes after a few weeks of irregular attendance because he needed to earn money for family expenses.<ref name=\"Rayson3\">Rayson, Ann. \"Richard Wright's Life.\" [http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/r_wright/wright_life.htm Modern American Poetry].

After securing employment as a United States postal clerk, during his time off, he read other writers and studied their styles. When he was fired from the post office during the [[Great Depression]], Wright was forced to go [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration|on relief]] in 1931. In 1932, he began attending meetings of the [[John Reed Club]]. As the club was dominated by the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], Wright established a relationship with several party members. Especially interested in the literary contacts made at the meetings, Wright formally joined the Communist Party in late 1933. As a revolutionary poet, he wrote numerous proletarian poems (\"We of the Red Leaves of Red Books\", for example), for ''[[The New Masses]]'' and other [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] periodicals. A power struggle within the Chicago chapter of the John Reed Club had led to the dissolution of the club's leadership; Wright was told he had the support of the club's party members if he was willing to join the party.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |first= Richard |authorlink= |editor= Crossman, Richard |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |publisher= [[Bantam Books]] |location= New York |language= |pages= 109\u201310 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nBy 1935, Wright had completed the manuscript of his first novel, ''Cesspool'', which was published posthumously as ''Lawd Today'' (1963). In January 1936 his story \"Big Boy Leaves Home\" was accepted for publication in ''New Caravan.'' In February of that year, he began working with the [[National Negro Congress]]. In April he chaired the [[South Side Writers Group]], whose members included [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Margaret Walker]]. Wright submitted some of his critical essays and poetry to the group for criticism and read aloud some of his short stories. Through the club, he edited ''Left Front,'' a magazine that the Communist Party shut down in 1937, despite Wright's repeated protests.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 121 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref> Throughout this period, Wright continued to contribute to ''The New Masses'' magazine.\n\nPleased by his positive relations with white Communists in Chicago, Wright was later humiliated in New York City by some white party members who rescinded an offer to find housing for him when they learned his race.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965 |pages= 123\u201326 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}</ref>  Some black Communists denounced Wright as a \"[[bourgeois]] intellectual.\"  Wright was essentially [[Autodidacticism|autodidactic]]. He had been forced to end his public education after completing junior high school to support his mother and brother.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman |title= The God That Failed |year= 1965|pages= 13\u201316 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= }}</ref>\n\nWright insisted that young communist writers be given space to cultivate their talents.  He had developed a working relationship with a [[black nationalist]] communist, which, along with his dissatisfaction with the attitudes of and restrictions imposed by those in the party, led to a public falling out with the party and a number of its leading members. Wright later described this episode through his fictional character Buddy Nealson, [[The Communist Party and African-Americans|an African-American communist]] in his essay \"I tried to be a Communist\", published in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' in 1944. This text was an excerpt of his autobiography scheduled to be published as ''American Hunger'', but removed from the actual publication of ''[[Black Boy]]'' upon request by the [[Book of the Month Club]].<ref>{{Cite book|last= Wright |authorlink= |editor= Crossman|title= The God That Failed |year= 1960 |pages= 126\u201334 |chapter= Richard Wright |quote= |ref= }}.

He worked on the [[Federal Writers' Project]] guidebook to the city, ''New York Panorama'' (1938), and wrote the book's essay on [[Harlem]]. Wright became the Harlem editor of the ''[[Daily Worker]],'' a Communist newspaper. Through the summer and fall he wrote more than 200 articles for the ''Daily Worker'' and helped edit a short-lived literary magazine ''New Challenge.'' The year was also a landmark for Wright because he met and developed a friendship with writer [[Ralph Ellison]] that would last for years. He was awarded the ''[[Story (magazine)|Story]]'' magazine first prize of $500 for his short story \"Fire and Cloud\".<ref name=\"story\" />\n\nAfter receiving the ''Story'' prize in early 1938, Wright shelved his manuscript of ''Lawd Today'' and dismissed his literary agent, John Troustine. He hired Paul Reynolds, the well-known agent of poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]], to represent him. Meanwhile, the Story Press offered the publisher [[Harper & Row|Harper]] all of Wright's prize-entry stories for a book, and Harper agreed to publish the collection.\n\nWright gained national attention for the collection of four short stories entitled ''[[Uncle Tom's Children]]'' (1938). He based some stories on [[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] in the [[Deep South]]. The publication and favorable reception of ''Uncle Tom's Children'' improved Wright's status with the Communist party and enabled him to establish a reasonable degree of financial stability. He was appointed to the editorial board of ''New Masses.'' [[Granville Hicks]], a prominent literary critic and Communist sympathizer, introduced him at leftist teas in Boston. By May 6, 1938, excellent sales had provided Wright with enough money to move to Harlem, where he began writing the novel ''[[Native Son]],'' which he published in 1940.\n\nBased on his collected short stories, Wright applied for and was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], which gave him a stipend allowing him to complete ''Native Son.'' During this period, he rented a room in the home of friends Herbert and Jane Newton, an interracial couple and prominent [[Communists]] whom Wright had known in Chicago.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T6-lhNKL3ncC&pg=PT147&dq=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton#v=onepage&q=Herbert%20and%20jane%20Newton&f=false|title=Literary Brooklyn: The Writers of Brooklyn and the Story of American City Life|first=Evan|last=Hughes|date=August 16, 2011|publisher=Macmillan|accessdate=September 30, 2016|via=Google Books|isbn=9781429973069}}</ref> They had moved to New York and lived at 109 Lefferts Place in [[Brooklyn]] in the [[Fort Greene Historic District|Fort Greene]] neighborhood.<ref>Oleksinski, Johnny.

It was a daring choice. The lead character, Bigger Thomas, was a person bound by the limitations that society placed on African Americans. He gained his own [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] and self-knowledge only by committing heinous acts.\n\nWright was criticized for his concentration on violence in his works. In the case of ''Native Son,'' people complained that he portrayed a black man in ways that seemed to confirm whites' worst fears. The period following publication of ''Native Son'' was a busy time for Wright. In July 1940 he went to Chicago to do research for a folk history of blacks to accompany photographs selected by [[Edwin Rosskam]]. While in Chicago he visited the ''American Negro Exhibition'' with [[Langston Hughes]], [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Claude McKay]].\n[[File:Canada-Lee-Native-Son-1941.jpg|thumb|[[Canada Lee]] as Bigger Thomas in the [[Orson Welles]] production of ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' (1941)]]\nHe traveled to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], to collaborate with playwright [[Paul Green (playwright)|Paul Green]] on a dramatic adaptation of ''Native Son.'' In January 1941 Wright received the prestigious [[Spingarn Medal]] of the [[NAACP]] for noteworthy achievement. His play ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' opened on Broadway in March 1941, with [[Orson Welles]] as director, to generally favorable reviews. Wright also wrote the text to accompany a volume of photographs chosen by Rosskam, which were almost completely drawn from the files of the [[Farm Security Administration]]. The FSA had employed top photographers to travel around the country and capture images of Americans. Their collaboration, ''Twelve Million Black Voices: A Folk History of the Negro in the United States,'' was published in October 1941 to wide critical acclaim.\n\nWright's memoir ''[[Black Boy]]'' (1945) described his early life from [[Roxie, Mississippi|Roxie]] up until his move to Chicago at age 19. It included his clashes with [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] family, his troubles with white employers, and social isolation. It also describes his intellectual journey through these struggles. ''American Hunger'', which was published posthumously in 1977, was originally intended by Wright as the second volume of ''Black Boy.'' The [[Library of America]] edition of 1991 finally restored the book to its original two-volume form.\n\n''American Hunger'' detailed Wright's participation in the John Reed Clubs and the Communist Party, which he left in 1942. The book implied he left earlier, but he did not announce his withdrawal until 1944.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the book's restored form, Wright used the [[diptych]] structure to compare the certainties and intolerance of organized communism, which condemned \"bourgeois\" books and certain members, with similar restrictive qualities of fundamentalist organized religion. Wright disapproved of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge]] in the [[Soviet Union]], but he continued to believe in far-left democratic solutions to political problems.\n\n===France===\n[[File:Plaque Richard Wright, 14 rue Monsieur-le-Prince, Paris 6.jpg|350px|thumbnail|Plaque commemorating Wright's residence in Paris, at 14, rue Monsieur le Prince.]]\n\nFollowing a stay of a few months in [[Qu\u00e9bec, Canada]], including a lengthy stay in the village of Sainte-P\u00e9tronille on the [[\u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans]],<ref>Jean-Christophe Cloutier, Introduction to ''Jack Kerouac, La vie est d'hommage'' (Bor\u00e9al, 2016), pp. 31\u201332.</ref> Wright moved to Paris in 1946.

He also became friends with fellow expatriate writers [[Chester Himes]] and [[James Baldwin]]. His relationship with the latter ended in acrimony after Baldwin published his essay \"Everybody's Protest Novel\" (collected in ''[[Notes of a Native Son]]''), in which he criticized Wright's portrayal of Bigger Thomas as stereotypical. In 1954 Wright published ''Savage Holiday.''\n\nAfter becoming a French citizen in 1947, Wright continued to travel through Europe, Asia, and Africa. He drew material from these trips for numerous nonfiction works. In 1949, Wright contributed to the anti-communist anthology ''[[The God That Failed]];'' his essay had been published in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' three years earlier and was derived from the unpublished portion of ''Black Boy.'' He was invited to join the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], which he rejected, correctly suspecting that it had connections with the [[CIA]]. Fearful of links between African Americans and communists, the [[FBI]] had Wright under surveillance starting in 1943. With the heightened communist fears of the 1950s, Wright was [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] by Hollywood movie studio executives. But in 1950, he starred as the teenager Bigger Thomas (Wright was 42) in an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] film version of ''[[Native Son (1951 film)|Native Son]].''\n\nIn mid-1953, Wright traveled to the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]], where [[Kwame Nkrumah]] was leading the country to independence from British rule, to be established as [[Ghana]]. Before Wright returned to Paris, he gave a confidential report to the United States consulate in [[Accra]] on what he had learned about Nkrumah and his political party. After Wright returned to Paris, he met twice with an officer from the [[U.S. Department of State|US State Department]]. The officer's report includes what Wright had learned from Nkrumah adviser [[George Padmore]] about Nkrumah's plans for the Gold Coast after independence. Padmore, a [[Trinidad]]ian living in London, believed Wright to be a good friend. His many letters in the Wright papers at Yale's Beinecke Library attest to this, and the two men continued their correspondence. Wright's book on his African journey, ''[[Black Power (Richard Wright book)|Black Power]],'' was published in 1954; its London publisher was [[Dennis Dobson]], who also published Padmore's work.<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause'' (2009), pp. 125\u201328.</ref>\n\nWhatever political motivations Wright had for reporting to American officials, he was also an American who wanted to stay abroad and needed their approval to have his passport renewed. According to Wright biographer [[Addison Gayle]], a few months later Wright talked to officials at the American embassy in Paris about people he had met in the Communist Party; at the time these individuals were being prosecuted in the US under the [[Smith Act]].<ref>Carol Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement'' (2001), p. 82.</ref>\n\nHistorian Carol Polsgrove explored why Wright appeared to have little to say about the increasing activism of the [[civil rights movement]] during the 1950s in the United States. She found that Wright was under what his friend Chester Himes called \"extraordinary pressure\" to avoid writing about the US.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> As ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' magazine delayed publishing his essay, \"I Choose Exile,\" Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that \"a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.\"<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\"/> He thought the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.<ref name=\"polsgrove80-81\">Polsgrove, ''Divided Minds'', pp. 80\u201381.</ref><ref>[http://thisissoulone.tumblr.com/post/21392983785/richard-wright-i-choose-exile-i-am-a-native The essay \"I Choose Exile\" Online published accessed August 5,2018]</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Wright visited [[Indonesia]] for the [[Bandung Conference]]. He recorded his observations on the conference as well as on Indonesian cultural conditions in ''[[The Color Curtain|The Color Curtain: A Report on the Bandung Conference]].'' Wright was enthusiastic about the possibilities posed by this meeting of newly independent, former colonial nations. He gave at least two lectures to Indonesian cultural groups, including [[PEN Club]] Indonesia, and he interviewed Indonesian artists and intellectuals in preparation to write ''The Color Curtain.''<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian|title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|pages=153\u2013153, 161}}</ref> Several Indonesian artists and intellectuals whom  Wright met, later commented on how he had depicted Indonesian cultural conditions in his [[travel writing]].<!-- saying what? he got it or did not? --><ref>{{cite journal|last=Vuyk|first=Beb|title=A Weekend with Richard Wright|journal=PMLA|date=May 2011|volume=126|issue=3|pages=810|doi=10.1632/pmla.2011.126.3.798}}</ref>\n\nOther works by Richard Wright included ''White Man, Listen!'' (1957); a novel ''The Long Dream'' (1958), which was adapted as a play and produced in New York in 1960 by [[Ketti Frings]]. It explores the relationship between a man named Fish and his father.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0904.html \"Richard Wright, Writer, 52, Dies\"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 30, 1960.</ref> A collection of [[short story|short stories]], ''Eight Men,'' was published posthumously in 1961, shortly after Wright's  death. These works dealt primarily with the poverty, anger, and protests of northern and southern urban black Americans.\n\nHis agent, Paul Reynolds, sent strongly negative criticism of Wright's 400-page ''Island of Hallucinations'' manuscript in February 1959. Despite that, in March Wright outlined a novel in which his character Fish was to be liberated from racial conditioning and become dominating. By May 1959, Wright wanted to leave Paris and live in London. He felt French politics had become increasingly submissive to United States pressure. The peaceful Parisian atmosphere he had enjoyed had been shattered by quarrels and attacks instigated by enemies of the expatriate black writers.\n\nOn June 26, 1959, after a party marking the French publication of ''White Man, Listen!,'' Wright became ill. He suffered a virulent attack of [[amoebic dysentery]], probably contracted during his 1953 stay on the Gold Coast. By November 1959 his wife had found a London apartment, but Wright's illness and \"four hassles in twelve days\" with British immigration officials ended his desire to live in England.\n\nOn February 19, 1960, Wright learned from his agent Reynolds that the New York premiere of the stage adaptation of ''The Long Dream'' received such bad reviews that the adapter, Ketti Frings, had decided to cancel further performances. Meanwhile, Wright was running into added problems trying to get ''The Long Dream'' published in France. These setbacks prevented his finishing revisions of ''Island of Hallucinations,'' for which he was trying to get a publication commitment from [[Doubleday and Sons]].\n\nIn June 1960, Wright recorded a series of discussions for French radio, dealing primarily with his books and literary career. He also addressed the racial situation in the United States and the world, and specifically denounced American policy in Africa. In late September, to cover extra expenses for his daughter Julia's move from London to Paris to attend the [[Sorbonne]], Wright wrote blurbs for record jackets for Nicole Barclay, director of the largest record company in Paris.\n\nIn spite of his financial straits, Wright refused to compromise his principles. He declined to participate in a series of programs for Canadian radio because he suspected American control. For the same reason, he rejected an invitation from the Congress for Cultural Freedom to go to India to speak at a conference in memory of [[Leo Tolstoy]]. Still interested in literature, Wright helped [[Kyle Onstott]] get his novel ''[[Mandingo (novel)|Mandingo]]'' (1957) published in France.\n\nWright's last display of explosive energy occurred on November 8, 1960, in his polemical lecture, \"The Situation of the Black Artist and Intellectual in the United States,\" delivered to students and members of the [[American Church in Paris]]. He argued that American society reduced the most militant members of the black community to slaves whenever they wanted to question the racial status quo. He offered as proof the subversive attacks of the Communists against ''Native Son'' and the quarrels which [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]] and other authors sought with him. On November 26, 1960, Wright talked enthusiastically with Langston Hughes about his work ''Daddy Goodness'' and gave him the manuscript.\n\nHe died in Paris on November 28, 1960, of a [[heart attack]] at the age of 52. He was interred in [[Le P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]]. Wright's daughter Julia has claimed that her father was murdered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rwright.htm |title=Richard Wright |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518164622/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/rwright.htm |archivedate=May 18, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nA number of Wright's works have been published posthumously. In addition, some of Wright's more shocking passages dealing with race, sex, and politics were cut or omitted before original publication of works during his lifetime. In 1991, unexpurgated versions of ''Native Son,'' ''Black Boy,'' and his other works were published. In addition, in 1994, his novella ''Rite of Passage'' was published for the first time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/13/books/children-s-books-black-history-bookshelf.html |title=Children's Books/Black History; Bookshelf |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 13, 1994}}</ref>\n\nIn the last years of his life, Wright had become enamored of the Japanese poetic form [[Haiku in English|haiku]] and wrote more than 4,000 such short poems. In 1998 a book was published (''Haiku: This Other World'') with 817 of his own favorite haikus. Many of these haikus have an uplifting quality even as they deal with coming to terms with loneliness, death, and the forces of nature.\n\nA collection of Wright's travel writings was published by [[Mississippi University Press]] in 2001.

Since the late 20th century, critics have had a resurgence of interest in it. ''Black Boy'' remains a vital work of historical, sociological, and literary significance whose seminal portrayal of one black man's search for self-actualization in a racist society strongly influenced the works of African-American writers who followed, such as [[James Baldwin]] and [[Ralph Ellison]].\n\nIt is generally agreed that the influence of Wright's ''Native Son'' is not a matter of literary style or technique.{{sfn|Corkery|2007|pp=17\u201328}} Rather, in this book affected ideas and attitudes, and ''Native Son'' has been a force in the social and intellectual history of the United States in the last half of the 20th century. \"Wright was one of the people who made me conscious of the need to struggle,\" said writer [[Amiri Baraka]].<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.itvs.org/RichardWright/more_info.html |title= Richard Wright \u2013 Black Boy |accessdate=2008-10-07 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Independent Television Service]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080715231354/http://www.itvs.org/RichardWright/more_info.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-15}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, scholars published critical essays about Wright in prestigious journals.
