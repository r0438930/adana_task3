The [[mountain range]] is part of the Northern [[Inner Coast Ranges]], of the [[California Coast Ranges]] System.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Mayacamas Mountains are located south of the [[Mendocino Range]], west of [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], and east of [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]] in Mendocino and Lake Counties, and extend south into [[Napa County|Napa]] and [[Sonoma County|Sonoma]] Counties. The range stretches for {{convert|52|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}}<ref>{{gnis|234255|Mayacmas Mountains}}</ref> in a northwest-southeasterly direction.\n\nThe range's highest point is [[Cobb Mountain (California)|Cobb Mountain]], at {{convert|4724|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} in elevation, located in the central section.<ref>{{gnis|1658294|Cobb Mountain}}</ref> There are several other peaks over {{convert|2500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, including [[Mount Saint Helena]] and [[Hood Mountain]].

According to Barrett (Pomo, p. 269), there was a Yukian [[Wappo]] [[village]], Maiya'kma, one mile south of present day [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]].  ''Serro de los Mallacomes'' ([[Mount Saint Helena]]) is shown on a ''dise\u00f1o'' of the [[Rancho Caymus]] grant (1836).  Later the name appears in the title and on the ''dise\u00f1os'' of the Rancho Mallacomes y Plano de Agua Caliente or Moristul [[Ranchos of California|land grant]], dated September 3, 1841, and October 11 and 14, 1843.\n\nThe present spelling is used in the [[Statute]]s of 1850 (pp. 60 f.).  Although this version was also used by the Whitney Survey, confusion persists to the present day.  The Geographic Board (Fifth Report) decided for Miyakma, but in 1941 it reversed this decision in favor of Mayacmas ('not Miyakma, Cobb Mountain Range, Malacomas, Mayacamas, nor St. Helena Range').

It consists of more than 22 power plants scattered across an area of about 30 square miles (78 km2). The Geysers spans the [[Lake County, California|Lake]], [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma]], and [[Mendocino County, California|Mendocino]] counties in California, and provides energy to those counties. \nThe electrical energy is generated when dry steam is pumped from geothermal reservoirs (which are daily recharged with 18 million gallons of wastewater from the local city of Santa Rosa) through turbines.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mark West Springs]]\n*[[Mayacamas Vineyards]]\n*[[Snell Valley]]\n*[[:Category:Natural history of the California Coast Ranges|Natural history of the California Coast Ranges]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book|first=Stuart|last=Allan|title=California Road and Recreation Atlas|year=2005|publisher=[[Benchmark Maps]]|isbn=0-929591-80-1|page=63}}\n*{{cite book|first=Erwin|last=Gudde|title=California Place Names|url=https://archive.org/details/californiaplacen0000gudd|url-access=registration|year=1969|edition=third|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-01574-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/californiaplacen0000gudd/page/196 196]}}\nThe Geysers Geothermal Field, California <ref>https://www.power-technology.com/projects/the-geysers-geothermal-california/</ref>\nhttps://www.power-technology.com/projects/the-geysers-geothermal-california/\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline|Mayacamas Mountains}}\n\n[[Category:Mayacamas Mountains| ]]\n[[Category:California Coast Ranges]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of Mendocino County, California]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of Lake County, California]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of Napa County, California]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of Sonoma County, California]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges of Northern California]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox mountain range\n<!-- *** Heading *** -->\n| name = Mayacamas Mountains\n| native_name = \n| other_name = \n<!-- *** Names **** --> \n| etymology = [[Wappo language]]\n<!-- *** Image *** -->\n| photo = Mount Saint Helena (2007-10-08).JPG\n| photo_caption = [[Mount Saint Helena]]\n<!-- *** Country *** -->\n| country = United States\n| state = California\n| region = \n| district = \n<!-- *** Family *** -->\n| parent = [[California Coast Ranges]]\n| border =\n<!-- *** Locations *** -->\n| range_coordinates = {{coord|38|40|9.663|N|122|37|59.948|W|type:mountain|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| highest = \n| highest_location = [[Cobb Mountain (California)|Cobb Mountain]]\n| elevation_ft = 4724\n| coordinates = {{coord|38|48|27|N|122|44|26|W|type:mountain|format=dms|display=inline}}\n| length_mi = 52 | length_orientation = northwest-southeast\n| width_mi = | width_orientation = \n| area_mi2 = \n<!-- *** Features *** -->\n| geology =\n| orogeny =\n| period =\n<!-- *** Maps *** -->\n| map = California\n| map_relief = yes\n| map_size = 220\n| map_caption = Location of Mayacmas Mountains in [[California]] <ref name=\"gnis\">{{cite gnis|id=234255|name=Mayacmas Mountains|accessdate=2009-05-04}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe '''Mayacamas Mountains''' are located in northwestern [[California]] in the [[United States]].
