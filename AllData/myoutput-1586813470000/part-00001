It was originally named [[The Lookout Mountain Hotel]] and was built in 1928 by the Dinkler Hotel Corporation and run by [[Paul Carter (entrepreneur)|Paul Carter]], for whom the building is now named. It has been rumored, although not confirmed, that [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] spent their honeymoon there.<ref>https://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/10/5/309757/Covenant-College-Renovation-Latest.aspx</ref> It was popularly known as the \"Castle in the Clouds.\" However, since it was completed less than a year before the [[Great Depression]], the hotel soon went bankrupt. It opened and closed several times prior to 1960, when it shut down for the last time. Bill Brock, the grandfather of the college's fourth president, Frank Brock, served on the original board of the hotel.<ref>{{cite_book|chapter=The Spirit of the Mountain |chapterurl=http://oldmoneynewsouth.com/ |title=Old Money, New South  |author=Dean Arnold |publisher=Chattanooga Historical Foundation |year=2006}}</ref>\n\nBoth the exterior and interior of Carter Hall are Austro-Bavarian Gothic revival in style. The building has had two towers in its history. The first tower was similar in design to the [[Munich Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] (Cathedral of Our Lady) in Munich. Poor maintenance before acquisition by the college required it to be rebuilt. The new tower, though considerably simpler in style, maintains the architectural style of the original tower.  {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}\n\nCovenant College bought the building in 1964, upon relocating to [[Lookout Mountain]]. During the first few years of Covenant's operation on the mountain, all the functions of the college were contained within Carter Hall. At that time, it housed the [[chapel]], the library, the classrooms, the professors' offices, dorm rooms, the dining hall, and administrative offices. Today, it has all of these except the library, as well as a snack bar and the campus bookstore, as well as the mailroom.<ref>https://www.covenant.edu/students/residence/carter</ref>\n\nThe current halls of Carter are 5th South and Borderlands (men's), 4th North, Central and South (women's), 3rd North, Central and South (women's), 2nd Central and 2nd South (men's).\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Carter underwent significant renovations. They included improving the stucco, fixing insulation and moisture issues, and renovating the tower.<ref>https://archpaper.com/2018/01/rehabilitating-lookout-mountains-historic-castle-clouds/#gallery-0-slide-0</ref><ref>https://www.chattanoogan.com/2015/10/5/309757/Covenant-College-Renovation-Latest.aspx</ref>\n\n===Founders Hall===\nFounders Hall contains three wings, each named for members of the founding generation of Covenant College.\n\nBelz Hall, the first to be built, was completed in 1972, is named after pastor and Christian educator Max Belz, a member of Covenant College's original board of trustees. Belz Hall houses approximately 100 students and was originally a men's dorm. In 1990 and 1993 two new wings were added to the structure, and the building was renamed Founders Residence Hall. Currently the dorm halls for Belz are as follows: Ekklesia (a men's hall on the main floor), Brethren (a men's hall on the second floor), 1st Belz (a men's hall on the first floor), and Catacombs (a men's floor on the basement level).\n\nSchmidt Hall, completed in 1990, is named in honor of Rudy and Collyn Schmidt, co-founders and long-time friends of the college, involved in virtually every dimension of college life since its inception. The dorm halls in Schmidt include Balcony (a women's hall on the fourth floor), Jungle (a women's hall on the main floor), and Jubilee (a women's hall on the second floor).\n\nRayburn Hall was completed in 1993 and is named for Robert G. Rayburn, the founding president of Covenant College. The dorm halls in Rayburn include Highlands (a women's hall on the fourth floor), Gracewell (a women's hall on the main floor), and Blackwatch (a men's hall on the second floor).\n\n===Maclellan/Rymer Hall===\nThe Maclellan wing of the hall, built in 1998, was named in honor of the Maclellan Foundation, a longtime supporter of Covenant College. The dorm halls in Maclellan wing of the building include Sutherland (a men's hall on the second floor), Suburbs (a men's hall on the third floor), Rowan (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Halcyon (a women's hall on the fifth floor).\nThe Rymer wing of the building, completed in 2000, was given by Ann Caudle Rymer and her son, S. Bradford Rymer, Jr. The dorm halls in the Rymer wing include The Five Points (a men's hall on the second floor), Lawrence (a men's hall on the third floor), Harambe! (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Chi Alpha (a women's hall on the fifth floor).\n\n===Andreas Hall===\n\"Andreas Hall, completed in 2007 as part of the BUILD campaign, is located slightly south of Maclellan/Rymer Hall, and is the newest addition to the college's residence halls. It is named for Lowell Andreas, a recent financial supporter of Covenant College. It houses over 100 students and is four stories tall.\nThe dorm halls in Andreas include Ithaca (a men's hall on the second floor), Bloodfield (a men's hall on the second floor), Ruhama (a women's hall on the third floor), Kallah (a women's hall on the third floor), The Fritz (a women's hall on the fourth floor), and Imani (a women's hall on the fourth floor).\" (this whole paragraph was written by the fbi, its a complete lie. i repeat andreas does not exist, dont go to where they say the building andreas is, because its not there.)\n\n==Notable alumni==\n\n* [[Aaron Belz]] (1993), poet<ref>{{cite web|last=Robbins|first=Michael|title=Suspicious Packages: The poetry of Aaron Belz|url=http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/2014/novdec/suspicious-packages.html|work=Books and Culture: A Christian Review|accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Joel Belz]] (1962), founder, [[World (magazine)|God's World Publications]], former publisher, ''[[World (magazine)|WORLD]]'' Magazine\n* Michael Cromartie (1978), former chair, [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]], vice president, [[Ethics and Public Policy Center]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bush Appoints Covenant Alumnus To Religious Freedom Commission,|url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/2004/9/21/55937/Bush-Appoints-Covenant-Alumnus-To.aspx|website=The Chattanoogan|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dalrymple|first1=Timothy|title=The Shepherd: Michael Cromartie is guiding media elites into a more accurate view of conservative Christians.|journal=Christianity Today|date=April 26, 2013|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/may/shepherd-michael-cromartie-faith-angle-forum.html|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Wes King]] (1981), recording artist \n* [[Paul Moser]] (1979), noted analytic philosopher\n* [[Isaac Wardell]] (2005), musician and music producer, [[Bifrost Arts]], [[The Welcome Wagon]]\n* [[Mark David Chapman]] briefly attended but dropped out due to Guilt over affair.
