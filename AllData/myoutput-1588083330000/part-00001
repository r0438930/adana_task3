As a defensive midfielder, he was comfortable in the fashioned 4\u20132\u20134 system at the beginning of the 1960s, providing his physique to his team. He became important for [[France national football team|France]], fourth at [[Euro 1960]], and a member of the [[FIFA World Cup 1966]] squad in England. He was a cornerstone of the first generation of the great [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne]] winning side which clinched four titles in a row, from 1967 to 1970. For the 1969\u20131970 season, coach [[Albert Batteux]] moved Herbin at [[Fullback (association football)|fullback]] along with [[Bernard Bosquier]]. The association was successful, and Herbin remained at that position till the end of his career.\n\n===Coaching era===\nAfter [[Albert Batteux]]'s departure, Herbin became one of the youngest coaches in France, taking up the coach position at [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne]] at the age of 33. He used the youth academy of the club, which gave him many talented young players such as [[G\u00e9rard Janvion]], [[Dominique Bathenay]], [[Jacques Santini]] and [[Dominique Rocheteau]]. He built up one of the best teams in Europe, but failed in [[UEFA Champions League]] final against [[Bayern Munich]], because of the famous \"squared goalposts\" of [[Hampden Park]] in [[Glasgow]]. Thanks to him and the arrival of [[Michel Platini]] in summer 1979, ''les verts'' remained at the top flight of French football, winning their last [[Ligue 1|French championship]] in 1981.\n\nHerbin, close to club president [[Roger Rocher]], left with him in 1983 and joined [[Olympique Lyonnais]], the great rival of AS Saint-\u00c9tienne. Herbin could not save the team from relegation though. Then, he coached [[Al-Nasr]] and [[RC Strasbourg]], before returning to AS Saint-\u00c9tienne in 1987. However, the glorious past of the team was far away and Herbin left the club again in 1990. He ended his managerial career at [[Red Star Saint-Ouen]] before working for [[French Football Federation]] at the federal council.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Herbin was well known for his red hair.\n*He is the only coach in modern French football who scored a goal for his team. During the last match of 1974\u201375 season, at the age of 36, he played as fullback against [[Troyes AC]] and scored a penalty.
