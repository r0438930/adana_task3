The ''Dominion Forest Reserve Act'', passed in 1906, and the ''Dominion Forest Reserve and Parks Act'', passed in 1911, were among the first legally binding protection of the area. In 1906 the superintendent of forestry monitored permits for cutting timber, which were intended only for settlers of the region.

The ''Dominion Forest Reserve Act'', passed in 1906, and the ''Dominion Forest Reserve and Parks Act'', passed in 1911, were among the first legally binding protection of the area. In 1906 the superintendent of forestry monitored permits for cutting timber, which were intended only for settlers of the region.

Led by J. N.

Since 1918 reforestation had proceeded in the park, and it was planned as a destination for tourists to continue to invest money in the local economy. Although some wanted a national park to be located in the [[Whiteshell Provincial Park|Whiteshell]], a majority voted in favour of locating it in Riding Mountain.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a consequence of this decision logging operations were halted and the value of [[Duck Mountain Provincial Park (Manitoba)|Duck Mountain]] increased.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite book|url=http://manitobia.ca/resources/books/local_histories/289.pdf|title=A Slice of the Parkland: Circa the Late 1890s - 1970s|last=Stozek|first=Edward S.|publisher=Leech Printing|year=2008|isbn=|location=Brandon|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe forest reserve was set aside as a national park in 1929, officially declared Riding Mountain National Park on May 30, 1933.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQKLCbdJ0GQC|title=The Geography of Manitoba: Its Land and Its People|last=Everitt|first=John C.|last2=Welsted|first2=John|last3=Stadel|first3=Christoph|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=9780887553752|language=en}}</ref> The park opened to visitors on July 26 of that year, with Manitoba Lieutenant-Governor [[James Duncan McGregor|James D.
