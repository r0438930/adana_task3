The episodes were written by [[Joseph Mallozzi]], [[Paul Mullie]], [[Executive producer]]s [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]], the episodes were directed by [[Peter DeLuise]]. The episodes were the strongest episodes in the eighth season on the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household ratings]] with fellow ''Stargate SG-1'' episode \"[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order]]\". The episode got strong reviews from major media publishers worldwide.\n\n\"Moebius\" is about the discovery of a Zero Point Module (ZPM) by SG-1, the only problem is that it was taken by [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] after the [[Goa'uld|Earth revolt]] more than five thousand years ago. The team decides to [[Time travel|travel back in time]] to get the ZPM and leave without changing history (based on the fact that Ra and company were most likely unaware of the ZPM's purpose), but they are unable to travel back to present time so they record a video for the [[Government of the United States|United States government]] to find. In the [[alternate timeline]], the government find the tape and subsequently the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] in [[Antarctica]] and decide to establish the [[Stargate Program]] but not to restore the original timeline.\n\n== Plot overview ==\n{{Long plot|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Part 1 ===\n[[Samantha Carter|Samantha \"Sam\" Carter]] reveals the existence of the ''Daedalus'': a new Earth-built battlecruiser which is capable of reaching the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]] and is larger and more advanced than the ''[[Prometheus (Stargate)|Prometheus]]''. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] learns of [[Catherine Langford]]'s death and, after her funeral, receives Catherine's collection of documents and artifacts relating to the Stargate program. From one book in the collection, Daniel learns of the former location of a Zero Point Module (ZPM) in Ancient [[Egypt]]. Daniel and Carter persuade [[Jack O'Neill]] to use the time travel capabilities of the Puddle Jumper [[It's Good to Be King (Stargate SG-1)|they found]] to travel back and take the ZPM, assuming that [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] never knew of its purpose.\n\nOnce they arrive in 3000 B.C., they join in an offering to Ra and witness his cold-blooded murder of an Egyptian making the offering. Teal'c disguises himself as a Horus Jaffa and retrieves the ZPM from Ra's treasury. However, Ra's Jaffa discover the cloaked Jumper after a sandstorm covers it in sand. Unwilling to upset the future by fighting the Jaffa to get the Jumper back, SG-1 decides to live out the rest of their lives in the past, knowing that the rebellion that overthrew Ra will eventually happen. However, an alternate timeline is created in which the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] was never discovered and everything SG-1 have done for the last eight years never happened.\n\nIn this timeline, alternate Daniel is teaching English as a second language, alternate Carter spends her time double-checking other scientists' work, alternate O'Neill is retired from the military and alternate [[Teal'c]] is still the First Prime of [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]. Alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are contacted by the Air Force and brought to Cheyenne Mountain.\n\nAt Cheyenne Mountain, [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]] informs alternate Carter and alternate Daniel that archaeologists found a video camera in a vacuum-sealed [[canopic jar]] at a dig in Giza. The video contains a recording of the original SG-1, explaining who they are and what they were doing, as well as a number of things that are true in their timeline, such as recent political events, Presidents and personal details. Their plan is that if things have changed in the future, then SG-1's alternative selves will travel back in time and fix the past.\n\nAn expedition team is sent to find the Giza Stargate, but find nothing. Instead, they discover that the original Daniel left a tablet where the gate should have been, inscribed with an obscure dialect of Egyptian that only alternate Daniel can read. It reveals that the original [[SG-1]] instigated a successful rebellion against the [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] of 3000 BC. However, this caused him to leave [[Earth]] with the Stargate. However, they do find the Puddle Jumper, and alternate Daniel and alternate Carter figure out how to find the Antarctic Stargate. A team is assembled to go through the Stargate to recruit alternate [[Teal'c]] under the instruction of the Daniel and Carter on the tape. Alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are not going to be on this team.\n\n=== Part 2 ===\nThe scientists working on the recovered Alternate-Puddle Jumper cannot make it work because they do not have the ATA gene. Alternate-O'Neill is called in to operate the Jumper and lead the team through the Stargate to find alternate Teal'c, and agrees that alternate Daniel and alternate Carter are to join the team through the Stargate.\n\nOn Chulak, SG-1 are caught by Jaffa loyal to [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] and imprisoned. Alternate Teal'c defects to their cause and helps them escape but alternate Daniel was made a Goa'uld spy by Apophis and is killed by Teal'c. They escape in the Puddle Jumper, but are chased and damaged by Death Gliders. Unaware of the jumper's cloaking capacity, they believe that only way they can survive is to time-travel. They travel back to 3000 B.C. and use the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] to pass from Chulak to Ancient [[Egypt]] where the original versions of [[SG-1]] were stranded and where [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] is still alive and ruling.\n\nThe original [[SG-1]] attempted the rebellion because O'Neill and Teal'c did not want to stay and O'Neill, Carter and Teal'c were killed when it failed. Daniel, the only survivor, meets with alternate Carter, alternate O'Neill and alternate Teal'c. He has not yet made the tablet detailing the second successful rebellion attempt because it hasn't happened yet. This means that his current plans with the underground of the local populace are destined to succeed, however they lead to the Stargate being removed from Earth by Ra. The plan is to instigate the rebellion, thus diverting Ra's attention, and secure the Stargate to where it was originally buried, allowing the original timeline to evolve as it did.\n\nThe rebellion ultimately succeeds, but not before alternate Carter and alternate-O'Neill show their feelings for each other with a kiss, uncertain if they will survive. Ra's Jaffa surrender, outnumbered by the staff- and zat-armed Egyptians. The alternate SG-1 bury the videotape, along with the ZPM, for the [[SG-1]] of the future to find. The alternate-[[SG-1]] and Daniel from the original [[SG-1]] (of 3000 BC) live out the rest of their lives in Ancient Egypt.\n\nThe original [[SG-1]] of the present day receive the videotape and the ZPM left for them a few weeks before they were to go back in time. As the timeline has been restored, they have no reason to go back in time, and they've gained a ZPM free of charge. The episode ends with SG-1 at O'Neill's cabin, fishing, in a scene identical to the end of \"[[Threads (Stargate SG-1)|Threads]]\", except there are now fish in Jack's pond.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Jay Acovone Creation Con 2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jay Acovone]]'s character [[Charles Kawalsky]] re-emerged after dying in \"[[The Enemy Within (Stargate SG-1)|The Enemy Within]]\"]]\nAfter production wrapped on [[Stargate SG-1 (season 7)|season seven]], the writers came together and pitched out ideas for the eighth and presumably final season.<ref name=spi_cruising>{{cite news |last=McFarland |first=Melanie |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/267484_tv21.html |title=On TV: 'Stargate SG-1' keeps cruising, despite the light years |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=April 21, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> [[Stargate SG-1 (season 5)|Season five]] through [[Stargate SG-1 (season 7)|season seven]] had previously been expected to be the last, but the show got renewed each year.<ref name=ac_811>811 Audio Commentary \"Gemini\" by Will Waring (WW, Director) and Jim Menard (JM, Director of Photography)</ref> They ultimately agreed on about ten initial episodes, two of which should make a two-hour premiere to address left-open issues of the season seven finale.<ref name=spi_cruising/> ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' was originally set to be replaced with a new series entitled ''Stargate Command'', but the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] decided to renew the series for another [[Stargate SG-1 (season 9)|season]].<ref name=ac_901>{{cite video |people=[[Robert C.

(However, Carter's line \"I keep thinking I'm gonna step on a bug and change the future,\" may be taken as a reference to ''The Simpsons'', as Homer's stepping on a bug is what caused the changes in his universe.
