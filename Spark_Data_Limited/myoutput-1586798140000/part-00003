The Americas were invaded and incorporated into the [[Spanish Empire]], with the exception of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[British Canada|Canada]], the north-eastern [[United States]] and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean. The crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region. The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the [[Catholic]] faith through [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] conversions.\n\nBeginning with the 1492 arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the [[Spanish Empire]] would expand across the [[Caribbean]] Islands, half of [[South America]], most of [[Central America]] and much of [[North America]] (including present day [[Mexico]], [[Florida]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] and [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coastal]] regions of the [[United States]]). It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492\u20131832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850\u20131950); the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century, and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty. In contrast, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#European colonization|the indigenous population plummeted]] by an estimated 80% in the first century and a half following Columbus's voyages, primarily through the spread of [[Old World|Afro-Eurasian]] [[Infection|diseases]].<ref name=\"Histoire\">\"La catastrophe d\u00e9mographique\" (The Demographic Catastrophe) in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0322, July\u2013August 2007, p. 17</ref> This has been argued to be the first large-scale act of [[genocide]] [[Genocides in history#1490 to 1914|in the modern era]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|p=297|ref= harv}}</ref> although this claim is disputed due to the introduction of disease, which is considered a byproduct of the [[Columbian exchange]]. [[Mestizaje|Racial mixing]] was a central process in the Spanish colonization of the Americas, and ultimately led to the [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] identity, which combines African, [[Hispanic]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.\n\nSpain enjoyed a cultural [[Spanish Golden Age|golden age]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars. In the early 19th century, the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] resulted in the secession and subsequent [[balkanization]] of most Spanish territories in the Americas, except for [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], which were finally given up in 1898, following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in the Pacific. Spain's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas.\n\n==Conquests==\n[[File:Banner of arms crown of Castille Habsbourg style.svg|thumb|upright=0.55|<center><hr />[[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] territory of [[Crown of Castile]].

Even though Castile and Aragon were ruled jointly by their respective monarchs, they remained separate kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs gave official approval for the plans of Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] for a voyage to reach India by sailing West. The funding came from the queen of Castile, so the profits from Spanish expedition flowed to Castile. In the extension of Spanish sovereignty to its overseas territories, authority for expeditions of discovery, conquest, and settlement resided in the monarchy.<ref>Ida Altman, S.L.

He founded [[La Navidad]] on the island later named [[Hispaniola]] (now divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic), in what is the present-day [[Haiti]] on his first voyage. After its destruction by the indigenous [[Taino]] people, the town of Isabella was begun in 1493, on his second voyage. In 1496 his brother, [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]], founded [[Santo Domingo]]. By 1500, despite a high death rate, there were between 300 and 1000 Spanish settled in the area. The local [[Ta\u00edno]] people continued to resist, refusing to plant crops and abandoning their Spanish-occupied villages. The first mainland explorations were followed by a phase of inland expeditions and conquest. In 1500 the city of [[Nueva C\u00e1diz]] was founded on the island of [[Cubagua]], [[Venezuela]], followed by the founding of [[Aragua (state)|Santa Cruz]] by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in present-day [[Guajira Peninsula|Guajira peninsula]].

Later conquests were protracted campaigns with less spectacular results than the conquest of the Aztecs. The [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]], the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]], the war of Mexico's west, and the [[Chichimeca War]] in northern Mexico expanded Spanish control over territory and indigenous populations.<ref>Robert S.

The victory over the Aztecs was relatively quick, from 1519 to 1521, and aided by his [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and other allies from indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]]. These polities allied against the [[Aztec]] empire, to which they paid tribute following conquest or threat of conquest, leaving the city-states' political hierarchy and social structure in place.\n\nThe [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] was a much longer campaign, from 1551 to 1697, against the [[Maya peoples]] in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] of present-day Mexico and northern [[Central America]]. [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]' landing ashore at present day [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and founding the Spanish city there on April 22, 1519 marked the beginning of 300 years of Spanish hegemony over the region. The assertion of royal control over the Kingdom of New Spain and the initial Spanish conquerors took over a decade, with importance of the region meriting the creation of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. Established by Charles V in 1535, the first viceroy was Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]].\n\nSpain colonized and exerted control of [[Alta California]] through the [[Spanish missions in California]] until the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]].\n\n===Peru===\n{{Main|Spanish conquest of Peru}}\n[[File:Balboa s\u00fcdsee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] claiming possession of the South Sea ([[Pacific Ocean]])]]\n[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|right|Map depicting the route of Pizarro from Panama to Cuzco]]\n\nIn 1532 at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] a group of Spaniards under [[Francisco Pizarro]] and their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous Andean]] [[Indian auxiliaries]] native allies ambushed and captured the Emperor [[Atahualpa]] of the [[Inca Empire]]. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting to subdue the mightiest [[empire]] in the [[Americas]]. In the following years Spain extended its rule over the Empire of the [[Inca civilization]].\n\nThe Spanish took advantage of a recent civil war between the factions of the two brothers Emperor [[Atahualpa]] and [[Hu\u00e1scar]], and the enmity of [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous nations]] the Incas had subjugated, such as the [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s. In the following years the [[conquistador]]s and indigenous allies extended control over Greater Andes Region. The [[Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa]] was established in 1542. The [[Neo-Inca State|last Inca stronghold]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nPeru was the last territory in the continent under Spanish occupation, which ended on 9 December 1824 at the Battle of Ayacucho  (Spanish rule continued until 1898 in Cuba and Puerto Rico).\n\n===R\u00edo de la Plata and Paraguay===\nEuropean explorers arrived in [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1516. Their first Spanish settlement in this zone was the [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Fort of Sancti Spiritu]] established in 1527 next to the [[Paran\u00e1 River]]. [[Buenos Aires]], a permanent colony, was established in 1536 and in 1537 [[Asunci\u00f3n]] was established in the area that is now [[Paraguay]]. Buenos Aires suffered attacks by the indigenous peoples that forced the settlers away, and in 1541 the site was abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who arrived by sailing down the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] from [[Asunci\u00f3n]] (now the capital of [[Paraguay]]). He dubbed the settlement \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda de los Buenos Aires.\" The city came to be the head of the [[Governorate of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and in 1776 elevated to be the capital of the new [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]].\n\n===New Granada===\n{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca}}\n{{see also|Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations}}\nBetween 1537 and 1543, six{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--Federmann from the east, De Belalc\u00e1zar from the south and De Quesada from the north, which others?--> Spanish expeditions entered highland Colombia, conquered the [[Muisca Confederation]], and set up the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] ({{lang-es|Nuevo Reino de Granada}}).

Prominent [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars in Santo Domingo, especially [[Antonio de Montesinos]] and [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] denounced the maltreatment and pressed the crown to act to protect the indigenous populations. The crown enacted [[Laws of Burgos]] (1513) and the [[Spanish Requirement of 1513|Requerimiento]] to curb the power of the Spanish conquerors and give indigenous populations the opportunity to peacefully embrace Spanish authority and Christianity. Neither was effective in its purpose. Las Casas was officially appointed [[Protector of the Indians]] and spent his life arguing forcefully on their behalf.

Viceroyalties were the largest territory unit of administration in the civil and religious spheres and the boundaries of civil and ecclesiastical governance coincided by design, to ensure crown control over both bureaucracies.{{sfn|Mecham|1966|p=26}} Until the eighteenth century, there were just two viceroyalties, with the Viceroyalty of New Spain (founded 1535) administering North America, a portion of the Caribbean, and the Philippines, and the viceroyalty of Peru (founded 1542) having jurisdiction over Spanish South America. Viceroys served as the vice-patron of the Catholic Church, including the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition|Inquisition]], established in the seats of the viceroyalties (Mexico City and Peru). Viceroys were responsible for good governance of their territories, economic development, and humane treatment of the indigenous populations.<ref>Burkholder, Mark A. \"Viceroyalty, Viceroy\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc= vol. 5, p. 408-409}}</ref>\n\nIn the eighteenth-century reforms, the Viceroyalty of Peru was reorganized, splitting off portions to form the Viceroyalty of New Granada (Colombia) (1739) and the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata (Argentina) (1776), leaving Peru with jurisdiction over Peru, Charcas, and Chile.

Judges (''oidores'') held \"formidable power.

During a financial crisis in the late seventeenth century, the crown began selling Audiencia appointments, and American-born Spaniards held 45% of Audiencia appointments. Although there were restrictions of appointees' ties to local elite society and participation in the local economy, they acquired dispensations from the cash-strapped crown. Audiencia judgments and other functions became more tied to the locality and less to the crown and impartial justice.\n\nDuring the [[Bourbon Reforms]] in the mid-eighteenth century, the crown systematically sought to centralize power in its own hands and diminish that of its overseas possessions, appointing peninsular-born Spaniards to Audiencias. American-born elite men complained bitterly about the change, since they lost access to power that they had enjoyed for nearly a century.<ref name=\"burkholder audencia\" />\n\n====Civil administrative districts====\n{{Main|Corregidor (position)|Intendant}}\nDuring the early colonial era and under the Habsburgs, the crown established a regional layer of colonial jurisdiction in the institution of [[Corregimiento]], which was between the [[Audiencia Real|Audiencia]] and [[Cabildo (council)|town councils]]. Corregimiento expanded \"royal authority from the urban centers into the countryside and over the indigenous population.\"<ref name=\"Corregidor\">Burkholder, Mark A. \"Corregidor\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 2, p. 272}}</ref> As with many colonial institutions, corregimiento had its roots in Castile when the [[Catholic Monarchs]] centralize power over municipalities. In the Indies, corregimiento initially functioned to bring control over Spanish settlers who exploited the indigenous populations held in [[encomienda]], in order to protect the shrinking indigenous populations and prevent the formation of an aristocracy of conquerors and powerful settlers. The royal official in charge of a district was the [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]], who was appointed by the viceroy, usually for a five-year term. Corregidores collected the tribute from indigenous communities and regulated forced indigenous labor. [[Alcald\u00eda mayor|Alcald\u00edas mayores]] were larger districts with a royal appointee, the ''Alcalde mayor''.\n\nAs the indigenous populations declined, the need for corregimiento decreased and then suppressed, with the alcald\u00eda mayor remaining an institution until it was replaced in the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon Reforms]] by royal officials, [[Intendant]]s. The salary of officials during the Habsburg era were paltry, but the corregidor or alcalde mayor in densely populated areas of indigenous settlement with a valuable product could use his office for personal enrichment. As with many other royal posts, these positions were sold, starting in 1677.<ref name=Corregidor /> The Bourbon-era intendants were appointed and relatively well paid.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Brungardt |first=Maurice |title=Corregidor/Corregimiento |volume=1 |encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: culture, politics, and history|location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC Clio |year=2006 |pages= 361\u2013363}}</ref>\n\n====Ecclesiastical organization====\n[[File:Vista de la Catedral de Puebla desde la terraza del Museo Amparo..jpg|thumb|left|[[Puebla Cathedral]]]]\n\nDuring the early colonial period, the crown authorized friars of [[Catholic religious order]]s ([[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinians]]) to function as priests during the conversion of indigenous populations. During the early [[Age of Discovery]], the diocesan clergy in Spain was poorly educated and considered of a low moral standing, and the Catholic Monarchs were reluctant to allow them to spearhead evangelization. Each order set up networks of parishes in the various regions (provinces), sited in existing Indian settlements, where Christian churches were built and where evangelization of the indigenous was based.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Robert |title=The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/spiritualconques00rica |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1966}}</ref> However, after the 1550s, the crown increasingly favored the diocesan clergy over the religious orders since the diocesan clergy was under the direct authority of the crown, while religious orders were with their own internal regulations and leadership. The crown had authority to draw the boundaries for dioceses and parishes. The creation of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with priests who not members of religious orders, those known as the diocesan or [[secular clergy]], marked a turning point in the crown's control over the religious sphere. In 1574, Philip II promulgated the Order of Patronage (Ordenaza del Patronato) ordering the religious orders to turn over their parishes to the secular clergy, a policy that secular clerics had long sought for the central areas of empire, with their large indigenous populations. Although implementation was slow and incomplete, it was an assertion of royal power over the clergy and the quality of parish priests improved, since the Ordenanza mandated competitive examination to fill vacant positions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Padden |first=Robert C. |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo of 1574 |journal=The Americas |number=12 |date=1956 |pp=333\u2013354}}\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Schwaller |first=John F |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo in New Spain, 1574\u20131600 |journal=The Americas |number=42 |date=1986 |pp=253\u2013274}}</ref> Religious orders along with the Jesuits embarked on further evangelization in frontier regions of the empire. The Jesuits resisted crown control, refusing to pay the [[tithe]] on their estates that supported the ecclesiastical hierarchy and came into conflict with bishops. The most prominent example is in Puebla, Mexico, when Bishop [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] was driven from his bishopric by the Jesuits. The bishop challenged the Jesuits' continuing to hold Indian parishes and function as priests without the required royal licenses. His fall from power is viewed as an example of the weakening of the crown in the mid-seventeenth century since it failed to protect their duly appointed bishop.{{sfn|Brading|1993|pp=241-247}} The crown [[Suppression of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] from Spain and The Indies in 1767 during the [[Bourbon Reforms]].\n\n==== Cabildos or town councils ====\n{{Main|Cabildo (council)}}\n[[File:Salta-Cabildo1.jpg|thumb|Cabildo in the city of [[Salta]] (Argentina)]]\n\nSpanish settlers sought to live in towns and cities, with governance being accomplished through the town council or ''Cabildo''.

The Americas were invaded and incorporated into the [[Spanish Empire]], with the exception of [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[British Canada|Canada]], the north-eastern [[United States]] and several other small countries in South America and The Caribbean. The crown created civil and religious structures to administer the region. The motivations for colonial expansion were trade and the spread of the [[Catholic]] faith through [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] conversions.\n\nBeginning with the 1492 arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the Caribbean and continuing control of vast territory for over three centuries, the [[Spanish Empire]] would expand across the [[Caribbean]] Islands, half of [[South America]], most of [[Central America]] and much of [[North America]] (including present day [[Mexico]], [[Florida]] and the [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] and [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coastal]] regions of the [[United States]]). It is estimated that during the colonial period (1492\u20131832), a total of 1.86 million Spaniards settled in the Americas and a further 3.5 million immigrated during the post-colonial era (1850\u20131950); the estimate is 250,000 in the 16th century, and most during the 18th century as immigration was encouraged by the new Bourbon Dynasty. In contrast, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#European colonization|the indigenous population plummeted]] by an estimated 80% in the first century and a half following Columbus's voyages, primarily through the spread of [[Old World|Afro-Eurasian]] [[Infection|diseases]].<ref name=\"Histoire\">\"La catastrophe d\u00e9mographique\" (The Demographic Catastrophe) in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' n\u00b0322, July\u2013August 2007, p. 17</ref> This has been argued to be the first large-scale act of [[genocide]] [[Genocides in history#1490 to 1914|in the modern era]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Forsythe|first=David P.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 4|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195334029|p=297|ref= harv}}</ref> although this claim is disputed due to the introduction of disease, which is considered a byproduct of the [[Columbian exchange]]. [[Mestizaje|Racial mixing]] was a central process in the Spanish colonization of the Americas, and ultimately led to the [[Latin Americans|Latin American]] identity, which combines African, [[Hispanic]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.\n\nSpain enjoyed a cultural [[Spanish Golden Age|golden age]] in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when silver and gold from American mines increasingly financed a long series of European and North African wars. In the early 19th century, the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] resulted in the secession and subsequent [[balkanization]] of most Spanish territories in the Americas, except for [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]], which were finally given up in 1898, following the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] in the Pacific. Spain's loss of these last territories politically ended the Spanish rule in the Americas.\n\n==Conquests==\n[[File:Banner of arms crown of Castille Habsbourg style.svg|thumb|upright=0.55|<center><hr />[[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] territory of [[Crown of Castile]].

Even though Castile and Aragon were ruled jointly by their respective monarchs, they remained separate kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs gave official approval for the plans of Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] for a voyage to reach India by sailing West. The funding came from the queen of Castile, so the profits from Spanish expedition flowed to Castile. In the extension of Spanish sovereignty to its overseas territories, authority for expeditions of discovery, conquest, and settlement resided in the monarchy.<ref>Ida Altman, S.L.

He founded [[La Navidad]] on the island later named [[Hispaniola]] (now divided into Haiti and the Dominican Republic), in what is the present-day [[Haiti]] on his first voyage. After its destruction by the indigenous [[Taino]] people, the town of Isabella was begun in 1493, on his second voyage. In 1496 his brother, [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]], founded [[Santo Domingo]]. By 1500, despite a high death rate, there were between 300 and 1000 Spanish settled in the area. The local [[Ta\u00edno]] people continued to resist, refusing to plant crops and abandoning their Spanish-occupied villages. The first mainland explorations were followed by a phase of inland expeditions and conquest. In 1500 the city of [[Nueva C\u00e1diz]] was founded on the island of [[Cubagua]], [[Venezuela]], followed by the founding of [[Aragua (state)|Santa Cruz]] by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in present-day [[Guajira Peninsula|Guajira peninsula]].

Later conquests were protracted campaigns with less spectacular results than the conquest of the Aztecs. The [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]], the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala]], the war of Mexico's west, and the [[Chichimeca War]] in northern Mexico expanded Spanish control over territory and indigenous populations.<ref>Robert S.

The victory over the Aztecs was relatively quick, from 1519 to 1521, and aided by his [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]] and other allies from indigenous city-states or [[altepetl]]. These polities allied against the [[Aztec]] empire, to which they paid tribute following conquest or threat of conquest, leaving the city-states' political hierarchy and social structure in place.\n\nThe [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] was a much longer campaign, from 1551 to 1697, against the [[Maya peoples]] in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] of present-day Mexico and northern [[Central America]]. [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]]' landing ashore at present day [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and founding the Spanish city there on April 22, 1519 marked the beginning of 300 years of Spanish hegemony over the region. The assertion of royal control over the Kingdom of New Spain and the initial Spanish conquerors took over a decade, with importance of the region meriting the creation of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. Established by Charles V in 1535, the first viceroy was Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]].\n\nSpain colonized and exerted control of [[Alta California]] through the [[Spanish missions in California]] until the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833]].\n\n===Peru===\n{{Main|Spanish conquest of Peru}}\n[[File:Balboa s\u00fcdsee.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Balboa]] claiming possession of the South Sea ([[Pacific Ocean]])]]\n[[File:Conquest peru 1531.jpg|thumb|right|Map depicting the route of Pizarro from Panama to Cuzco]]\n\nIn 1532 at the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] a group of Spaniards under [[Francisco Pizarro]] and their [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous Andean]] [[Indian auxiliaries]] native allies ambushed and captured the Emperor [[Atahualpa]] of the [[Inca Empire]]. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting to subdue the mightiest [[empire]] in the [[Americas]]. In the following years Spain extended its rule over the Empire of the [[Inca civilization]].\n\nThe Spanish took advantage of a recent civil war between the factions of the two brothers Emperor [[Atahualpa]] and [[Hu\u00e1scar]], and the enmity of [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas#South America|indigenous nations]] the Incas had subjugated, such as the [[Huanca people|Huancas]], [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s. In the following years the [[conquistador]]s and indigenous allies extended control over Greater Andes Region. The [[Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa]] was established in 1542. The [[Neo-Inca State|last Inca stronghold]] was conquered by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nPeru was the last territory in the continent under Spanish occupation, which ended on 9 December 1824 at the Battle of Ayacucho  (Spanish rule continued until 1898 in Cuba and Puerto Rico).\n\n===R\u00edo de la Plata and Paraguay===\nEuropean explorers arrived in [[R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1516. Their first Spanish settlement in this zone was the [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Fort of Sancti Spiritu]] established in 1527 next to the [[Paran\u00e1 River]]. [[Buenos Aires]], a permanent colony, was established in 1536 and in 1537 [[Asunci\u00f3n]] was established in the area that is now [[Paraguay]]. Buenos Aires suffered attacks by the indigenous peoples that forced the settlers away, and in 1541 the site was abandoned. A second (and permanent) settlement was established in 1580 by [[Juan de Garay]], who arrived by sailing down the [[Paran\u00e1 River]] from [[Asunci\u00f3n]] (now the capital of [[Paraguay]]). He dubbed the settlement \"Sant\u00edsima Trinidad\" and its port became \"Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda de los Buenos Aires.\" The city came to be the head of the [[Governorate of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] and in 1776 elevated to be the capital of the new [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]].\n\n===New Granada===\n{{main|Spanish conquest of the Muisca}}\n{{see also|Spanish conquest of the Chibchan Nations}}\nBetween 1537 and 1543, six{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}<!--Federmann from the east, De Belalc\u00e1zar from the south and De Quesada from the north, which others?--> Spanish expeditions entered highland Colombia, conquered the [[Muisca Confederation]], and set up the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] ({{lang-es|Nuevo Reino de Granada}}).

During a financial crisis in the late seventeenth century, the crown began selling Audiencia appointments, and American-born Spaniards held 45% of Audiencia appointments. Although there were restrictions of appointees' ties to local elite society and participation in the local economy, they acquired dispensations from the cash-strapped crown. Audiencia judgments and other functions became more tied to the locality and less to the crown and impartial justice.\n\nDuring the [[Bourbon Reforms]] in the mid-eighteenth century, the crown systematically sought to centralize power in its own hands and diminish that of its overseas possessions, appointing peninsular-born Spaniards to Audiencias.

In the Indies, corregimiento initially functioned to bring control over Spanish settlers who exploited the indigenous populations held in [[encomienda]], in order to protect the shrinking indigenous populations and prevent the formation of an aristocracy of conquerors and powerful settlers. The royal official in charge of a district was the [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]], who was appointed by the viceroy, usually for a five-year term. Corregidores collected the tribute from indigenous communities and regulated forced indigenous labor. [[Alcald\u00eda mayor|Alcald\u00edas mayores]] were larger districts with a royal appointee, the ''Alcalde mayor''.\n\nAs the indigenous populations declined, the need for corregimiento decreased and then suppressed, with the alcald\u00eda mayor remaining an institution until it was replaced in the eighteenth-century [[Bourbon Reforms]] by royal officials, [[Intendant]]s. The salary of officials during the Habsburg era were paltry, but the corregidor or alcalde mayor in densely populated areas of indigenous settlement with a valuable product could use his office for personal enrichment.

During the early [[Age of Discovery]], the diocesan clergy in Spain was poorly educated and considered of a low moral standing, and the Catholic Monarchs were reluctant to allow them to spearhead evangelization. Each order set up networks of parishes in the various regions (provinces), sited in existing Indian settlements, where Christian churches were built and where evangelization of the indigenous was based.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Robert |title=The Spiritual Conquest of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/spiritualconques00rica |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1966}}</ref> However, after the 1550s, the crown increasingly favored the diocesan clergy over the religious orders since the diocesan clergy was under the direct authority of the crown, while religious orders were with their own internal regulations and leadership. The crown had authority to draw the boundaries for dioceses and parishes. The creation of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with priests who not members of religious orders, those known as the diocesan or [[secular clergy]], marked a turning point in the crown's control over the religious sphere. In 1574, Philip II promulgated the Order of Patronage (Ordenaza del Patronato) ordering the religious orders to turn over their parishes to the secular clergy, a policy that secular clerics had long sought for the central areas of empire, with their large indigenous populations. Although implementation was slow and incomplete, it was an assertion of royal power over the clergy and the quality of parish priests improved, since the Ordenanza mandated competitive examination to fill vacant positions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Padden |first=Robert C. |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo of 1574 |journal=The Americas |number=12 |date=1956 |pp=333\u2013354}}\n\n*{{cite journal |last=Schwaller |first=John F |title=The Ordenanza del Patronazgo in New Spain, 1574\u20131600 |journal=The Americas |number=42 |date=1986 |pp=253\u2013274}}</ref> Religious orders along with the Jesuits embarked on further evangelization in frontier regions of the empire. The Jesuits resisted crown control, refusing to pay the [[tithe]] on their estates that supported the ecclesiastical hierarchy and came into conflict with bishops. The most prominent example is in Puebla, Mexico, when Bishop [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]] was driven from his bishopric by the Jesuits. The bishop challenged the Jesuits' continuing to hold Indian parishes and function as priests without the required royal licenses. His fall from power is viewed as an example of the weakening of the crown in the mid-seventeenth century since it failed to protect their duly appointed bishop.{{sfn|Brading|1993|pp=241-247}} The crown [[Suppression of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] from Spain and The Indies in 1767 during the [[Bourbon Reforms]].\n\n==== Cabildos or town councils ====\n{{Main|Cabildo (council)}}\n[[File:Salta-Cabildo1.jpg|thumb|Cabildo in the city of [[Salta]] (Argentina)]]\n\nSpanish settlers sought to live in towns and cities, with governance being accomplished through the town council or ''Cabildo''.

In Mexico during the sixteenth-century [[Chichimec War]] guarded the transit of silver from the mines of Zacatecas to Mexico City. As many as 60 salaried soldiers were garrisoned in presidios.{{sfn|Gibson|1966|p=191-192}} Presidios had a resident commanders, who set up commercial enterprises of imported merchandise, selling it to soldiers as well as Indian allies.{{sfn|Altman|Cline|Javier Pescador|2003 |pp=321-322}}\n\nThe other frontier institution was the religious [[mission (station)|mission]] to convert the indigenous populations. Missions were established with royal authority through the [[Patronato real]]. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were effective missionaries in frontier areas until their expulsion from Spain and its empire in 1767. The Franciscans took over some former Jesuit missions and continued the expansion of areas incorporated into the empire. Although their primary focus was on religious conversion, missionaries served as \"diplomatic agents, peace emissaries to hostile tribes ... and they were also expected to hold the line against nomadic nonmissionary Indians as well as other European powers.\"<ref>Ram\u00edrez, Susan E. \"Missions: Spanish America\" in {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture|1996|loc=vol. 4, p. 77}}</ref> On the frontier of empire, Indians were seen as ''sin raz\u00f3n'', (\"without reason\"); non-Indian populations were described as ''[[gente de raz\u00f3n]]'' (\"people of reason\"), who could be mixed-race [[casta]]s or black and had greater social mobility in frontier regions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Miranda |first=Gloria E. |title=Racial and Cultural Dimensions of \"Gente de Raz\u00f3n\" Status in Spanish and Mexican California |journal=Southern California Quarterly |volume=70 |number=3 |date=1988 |pages=265\u2013278|doi=10.2307/41171310 |jstor=41171310 }}</ref>\n\nSpain's administration of its colonies in the Americas was divided into the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] 1535 (capital, [[Mexico City]]), and the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] 1542 (capital, [[Lima]]). In the 18th century the additional [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] 1717 (capital, Bogot\u00e1), and [[Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata]] 1776 (capital, Buenos Aires) were established from portions of the Viceroyalty of Peru. The change diminished the political and economic power of the viceroyalty and opened formal connections between the mining district of Upper Peru and the port of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe system of crown rule evolved from the era of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], which established the [[Council of the Indies]], to the establishment of viceroyalties in Mexico and Peru following their conquests in the Habsburg era, and then into an [[Intendant]] system in the eighteenth century as part of the [[Bourbon Reforms]]. The reform was aimed at increasing crown control over its colonies, raising more revenue, and promoting greater efficiency.\n\n===Dominions===\n[[File:RUIDIAZ(1893) 1.083 JUAN PONCE DE LE\u00d3N.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]] ([[Santerv\u00e1s de Campos]], [[Province of Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[Spain]]) led the first European expedition to Florida, which he named.]]\n\n====North America, Central America====\n[[File:Spanish North America.png|thumb|Spanish historical presence, claimed territories, points of interest and expeditions in North America.]]\n*[[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (1535\u20131821)\n**[[Las Californias]]\n**[[New Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Nuevo Reino de Le\u00f3n]]\n**[[Nuevo Santander]]\n**[[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]]\n**[[Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico]]\n**[[Nueva Extremadura]]\n**[[Nueva Galicia]]\n**[[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]\n*[[Captaincy General of the Philippines]] (administered by New Spain from 1565 to 1821, then after Mexican independence transferred to and directly administered by Madrid until 1898)\n*[[Captaincy General of Cuba]] (until 1898) \u2013 Included in this captaincy general until 1819 was [[Spanish Florida|Florida]].\n*[[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico]] (until 1898)\n*[[Santo Domingo]] (last Spanish rule 1861\u20131865)\n\n====South America====\n*[[Viceroyalty of Per\u00fa]] (1542\u20131824)\n*[[Captaincy General of Chile]] (1541\u20131818)\n*[[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (1717\u20131819)\n*[[Captaincy General of Venezuela]]\n*[[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] (1776\u20131814)\n\n==19th century==\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:Spanish America XVIII Century (Most Expansion).png|thumb|Spanish colonialization in the [[Americas]].]]\n\nDuring the Napoleonic [[Peninsular War]] in Europe between France and Spain, assemblies called ''[[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]]'' were established to rule in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]].\nThe [[Libertadores]] (Spanish and Portuguese for \"Liberators\") were the principal leaders of the Spanish American wars of independence. They were predominantly ''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'' (Americas-born people of European ancestry, mostly Spanish or Portuguese), [[bourgeois]] and influenced by [[liberalism]] and in some cases with military training in the [[Homeland|mother country]].\n\nIn 1809 the first declarations of independence from Spanish rule occurred in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. The first two were in the Alto Per\u00fa, present-day [[Bolivia]], at Charcas (present day [[Sucre]], May 25), and [[La Paz]] (July 16); and the third in present-day [[Ecuador]] at [[Quito]] (August 10). In 1810 Mexico declared independence, with the [[Mexican War of Independence]] following for over a decade. In 1821 [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] established Mexican independence from Spain and concluded the War. The [[Plan of Iguala]] was part of the peace treaty to establish a constitutional foundation for an independent Mexico.\n\nThese began a movement for [[Spanish American wars of independence|colonial independence]] that spread to Spain's other colonies in the Americas. The ideas from the [[French Revolution|French]] and the [[American Revolution]] influenced the efforts. All of the colonies, except Cuba and Puerto Rico, attained independence by the 1820s. The [[British Empire]] offered support, wanting to end the Spanish monopoly on trade with its colonies in the Americas.\n[[File:El Correo entrando en el puerto de La Habana.jpg|thumb|Havana, [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Spanish Cuba]] in the 19th century]]\nIn 1898, the [[United States]] achieved victory in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] with Spain, ending the Spanish colonial era.

According to Cook, the indigenous Californian population at first contact, in 1769, was about 310,000 and had dropped to 25,000 by 1910. The vast majority of the decline happened after the Spanish period, during the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[United States|US]] periods of Californian history (1821\u20131910), with the most dramatic collapse (200,000 to 25,000) occurring in the US period (1846\u20131910).<ref>Baumhoff, Martin A. 1963.

The second factor was disease. ...A third factor, which strongly intensified the effect of the other two, was the social and physical disruption visited upon the Indian. He was driven from his home by the thousands, starved, beaten, raped, and murdered with impunity. He was not only given no assistance in the struggle against foreign diseases, but was prevented from adopting even the most elementary measures to secure his food, clothing, and shelter. The utter devastation caused by the white man was literally incredible, and not until the population figures are examined does the extent of the havoc become evident.\"Cook, Sherburne F. 1976b.
