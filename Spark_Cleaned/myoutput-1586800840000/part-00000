''\"Best selling\"'' refers to the estimated number of copies sold of each book, rather than the number of books printed or currently owned. [[Comic book|Comics]] and [[textbook]]s are not included in this list. The books are listed according to the highest sales estimate as reported in reliable, independent sources. This list is incomplete because there are many books, such as ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' by [[Alexandre Dumas]], or ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], that are commonly cited as \"best-selling books\" yet have no reliable sales figures. Similarly, many notable book series that sold very widely are poorly documented ([[Land of Oz]]) or consist of multiple sub-series ([[Tom Swift]]).\n\nAccording to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as of 1995, the [[Bible]] is the best-selling book of all time, with an estimated 5{{nbsp}}billion copies sold and distributed.<ref name=\"guinnessworldrecords\">{{cite web|title=Best selling book of non-fiction|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=15 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315025558/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction|archivedate=15 March 2015}}</ref>  The ''[[Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung]]'', also known as the ''Little Red Book'', has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures \u2014 with estimates ranging from 800{{nbsp}}million<ref name=\"guinnessworldrecords\"/> to over 6.5 billion printed volumes,<ref>Zhengyuan Fu, ''Autocratic Tradition and Chinese Politics'', Cambridge University Press 1994, p. 186.
