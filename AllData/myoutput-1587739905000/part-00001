In 1569 he was sheriff of the [[county palatine of Durham]], and helped his brother, [[George Bowes (soldier)|Sir George Bowes]], to hold [[Barnard Castle]] against the rebel earls. Afterwards he was sent in command of a troop of horse to protect the west marches. In 1571 he was elected M.P. for [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]]. In 1575 he was appointed treasurer of [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]], and in this capacity had many dealings with the Scottish court.\n\n===In Scotland===\nIn 1577 he was appointed ambassador in Scotland, where he had difficult tasks to perform: to counteract the influence of France, retain a hold on [[James VI]], keep together a party that was favourable to England, and promote disunion among the Scottish nobles. In 1578 he managed by his tact to compose a quarrel between [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton]] and the privy council which threatened to plunge Scotland into civil war. In 1581 he was busily employed in endeavouring to counteract the growing influence of [[Esme Stewart, lord of Aubign\u00e9]], over James VI. He witnessed the events which led to the [[raid of Ruthven]] and D'Aubign\u00e9's fall. He tried hard to gain possession of the [[casket letters]], which after Morton's death were said to have come into the hands of [[John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie]], but his attempts failed.\n\nIn April 1583 he gave gold chains as gifts to two secret Scottish contacts of [[Francis Walsingham]]. He thought that James VI was trying to get rid of him by employing [[James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune|Lord Doune]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1581-1583'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), pp. 405-5.</ref> He managed to procure his recall from in 1583, but he still held the post of treasurer of Berwick, and was often employed on diplomatic missions in Scotland. \n\nIn February 1591 a Scottish woman called [[Agnes Sampson]] was accused of witchcraft during the [[North Berwick Witch Trials]]. She said that Bowes was \"a little black and fat man with black hair\", who had given the accused gold in a cellar while James VI was in Denmark to make a charm with a toad to hurt the king and make him infertile. Bowes noted that the personal description was inaccurate. He made arrangements that English border officials including [[John Selby (died 1595)|John Selby]] would send any suspect witches fleeing to England back to Scotland.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1603'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 461.</ref>\n\n===Princess Elizabeth===\nBowes wrote news about the birth of [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]] at [[Dunfermline Palace]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1595-1597'', vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 306.</ref> Her christening was proposed to be held on the birthday of her mother [[Anne of Denmark]] and then changed (back) to 28 November 1596 at [[Holyrood Palace]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1595-1597'', vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 346, 350.</ref> Bowes carried the infant to the chapel as the representative of Queen Elizabeth, who was her godmother.

The baillies and [[Provost of Edinburgh]], [[Alexander Home of North Berwick]] came to the feast and banquet and made a gift of 10,000 [[merk (Coin)|Scottish merks]]. This gift was presented as a grant written with golden letters in a golden coffer given to Anna of Denmark. Bowes noted the princess would be live at [[Linlithgow Palace]] where her keeper [[Helenor Hay, Countess of Linlithgow|Lady Livingstone]] was an \"obstinate papist\".<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1595-1597'', vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 387-8.</ref>\n\n===Death===\nLike his brother, Sir George, he worked at his own cost, and was rewarded by not much more than royal gratitude.
