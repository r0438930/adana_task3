It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 8, 2009. In the episode, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] becomes temporarily gay after participating in a [[Human subject research|medical drug test]].\n\nThe episode was written by [[Richard Appel]] and directed by series regular Brian Iles. [[Seth Rogen]] provided a guest-voice as Peter under the effects of the \"Seth Rogen gene\" and [[Meredith Baxter]] provided a guest voice as herself. It received divided reviews from television sources and critics, in addition to receiving [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]]. \"Family Gay\", along with two other episodes, was nominated in the \"[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]\" category for the 2009 [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile on his way to buy groceries, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] instead buys a brain-damaged horse, which not only disturbs everyone but also causes $100,000 worth of damage when Peter enters it in a race and it goes on a rampage. Though the horse ends up dying of a fatal heart attack and Peter disposes of the body by flinging it into [[Mort Goldman|Mort Goldman's]], the Griffins are in debt for initial damages. In order to pay for the damage, Peter decides to participate in a series of [[Human subject research|medical drug testing]] including one that makes him gay.\n\nLois is initially upset that Peter is now gay, but she warms up to the change when he begins exhibiting stereotypical gay behaviors like shopping for clothes and cooking muffins, only to reconsider her stance when Peter rejects her sexual advances. Upon learning that the effects of the gay gene may be permanent, she decides to make the best of things when Peter suddenly leaves her for a gay man named Scott. Seeing Lois heartbroken and depressed, [[Stewie Griffin]] and [[Brian Griffin]] (who is hesitant due to his support of gay rights) attempt to bring Peter back to his normal self by kidnapping him and sending him to a straight camp for [[conversion therapy]].\n\nWhen Scott comes over looking for Peter, Brian admits his actions. Lois states that she is willing to accept Peter the way he is now and takes him out of the straight camp, telling him to go back to Scott. However, the effects of the experimental gay gene are revealed to be temporary and the effects wear off right when Peter is in the middle of a gay orgy with Scott and nine other men. Peter returns to Lois, and they decide to never speak of the incident again. The episode ends when Mort throws the horse in the window yelling, \"Take back your fucking horse!\"\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Richard Appel by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|240px|alt=A Caucasian male wearing dark glasses, brown hair, and a brown beard.
