After ''[[Hit Parader]]'' editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted [[Danny Fields]], insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced [[Craig Leon]] to produce ''Ramones'', and the band recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president [[Seymour Stein]] to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques{{clarify|date=August 2019}} to those of [[the Beatles]] and used advanced production methods by Leon.\n\nThe album cover, photographed by [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'']] magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in [[New York City]]. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's [[liner notes]]. After its release, ''Ramones'' was promoted with two [[single (music)|singles]], which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.\n\nViolence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and [[Nazism]] were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are [[uptempo]], with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\" is the album's longest track. ''Ramones'' contains a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Chris Montez]] song \"[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]\".\n\n''Ramones'' peaked at number 111 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was unsuccessful commercially, though it received glowing reviews from critics. Many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine's]] list of the \"50 Most Essential Punk Records\". ''Ramones'' is considered an influential punk album in the US and UK, and had a significant impact on other genres of [[rock music]], such as [[grunge]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. The album was ranked at number 33 in ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 2012 list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/ramones-ramones-20120524 |title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Ramones, 'Ramones' |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2014.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum |url= https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ramones&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |website= RIAA.com |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]]| accessdate=2014-06-07| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6QA1g5yY2|archivedate=2014-06-07| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Ramones]] began playing gigs in mid-1974, with their first show at Performance Studios in [[New York City]].<ref name= \"HallofFame\"/> The band, performing in a style similar to the one used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in [[Lower Manhattan|downtown Manhattan]], specifically [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]].<ref>Melnick & Meyer 2003, p. 33.</ref> In early 1975, [[Lisa Robinson]], an editor of ''Hit Parader'' and ''Rock Scene'', saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist [[Joey Ramone]] related that \"Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life; she started writing about us in ''Rock Scene'', and then [[Lenny Kaye]] would write about us and we started getting more press like ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down.\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\"/> Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted [[Danny Fields]], former manager of [[the Stooges]], and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band \"had everything [he] ever liked,\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\">Rombes 2005, p. 65.</ref> and became the manager in November 1975.<ref name=\"ramones 66\">Rombes 2005, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn September 19, 1975, the Ramones recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] at [[914 Sound Studios]], which was produced by [[Marty Thau]].

He risked his career to get us on the label.\"<ref name=\"ramones 66\"/><ref>Rombes 2005, p. 67.</ref> The label offered to release \"You're Gonna Kill That Girl\" as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album.

The band also used a technique known as [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]], where the vocal line used is sung twice.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 73\"/>\n\nRecording for the album was expanded by [[Mickey Leigh]] (Joey's brother) and Leon with percussion effects, which went unmentioned in the liner notes to the album's release.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\"/> Author Nicholas Rombes said that the production's quality sounded like \"the ultimate do-it-yourself, amateur, reckless ethic that is associated with punk,\" but concluded that they approached the recording process with a \"high degree of preparedness and professionalism.\"<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 5.</ref>\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\n[[File:Ramones back cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=An image that is primarily black and white ([[monochrome]]) photo which consists of small writing on the upper side and a bald eagle belt buckle on the bottom side.|The back cover to the Ramones album was designed by artist [[Arturo Vega]], who produced the photo of a belt buckle in a [[photo booth]].<ref name=\"rombes 75\">Rombes 2005, p. 75.</ref>]]\nInitially, the Ramones wanted an album cover similar to ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' (1964) and subsequently had pictures taken in that style by Danny Fields but Sire was dissatisfied with the results. The art direction was by Toni Wadler and, according to cartoonist [[John Holmstrom]], the \"Meet The Beatles\" cover idea came out \"horribly\".<ref name=\"Leigh 138\">Leigh 2009, p. 138.</ref> Wadler later chose a photo by Roberta Bayley, a photographer for [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'' magazine]] for the cover.

Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: \"We didn't want people to get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, you know, and we didn't want people to get confused.\"<ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/>\n\nThe artwork became one of the most imitated album covers in music.

All but one of the band's 1975 gigs were booked for New York City, with [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] as the exception. After the album's recording, the Ramones headlined for very few shows, usually opening for an identified [[cover band]] which played [[Aerosmith]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. When they opened at [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], the audience appeared extremely uninterested in the Ramones so Johnny swore off playing as an introduction for other bands.<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 136.</ref> Following this, Fields booked several headlining shows around the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-state area]], and they began playing frequently at gigs like CBGB and Max's Kansas City.

After ''[[Hit Parader]]'' editor Lisa Robinson saw the band at a gig in New York City, she wrote about them in an article and contacted [[Danny Fields]], insisting that he be their manager. Fields agreed and convinced [[Craig Leon]] to produce ''Ramones'', and the band recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president [[Seymour Stein]] to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques{{clarify|date=August 2019}} to those of [[the Beatles]] and used advanced production methods by Leon.\n\nThe album cover, photographed by [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'']] magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in [[New York City]]. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's [[liner notes]]. After its release, ''Ramones'' was promoted with two [[single (music)|singles]], which failed to chart. The Ramones also began touring to help sell records; these tour dates were mostly based in the United States, though two were booked in Britain.\n\nViolence, drug use, relationship issues, humor, and [[Nazism]] were prominent in the album's lyrics. The album opens with \"[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]\", which is among the band's most recognized songs. Most of the album's tracks are [[uptempo]], with many songs measuring at well over 160 beats per minute. The songs are also rather short; at two-and-a-half minutes, \"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement\" is the album's longest track. ''Ramones'' contains a [[cover version|cover]] of the [[Chris Montez]] song \"[[Let's Dance (Chris Montez song)|Let's Dance]]\".\n\n''Ramones'' peaked at number 111 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was unsuccessful commercially, though it received glowing reviews from critics. Many later deemed it a highly influential record, and it has since received many accolades, such as the top spot on [[Spin (magazine)|''Spin'' magazine's]] list of the \"50 Most Essential Punk Records\". ''Ramones'' is considered an influential punk album in the US and UK, and had a significant impact on other genres of [[rock music]], such as [[grunge]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. The album was ranked at number 33 in ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s 2012 list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/ramones-ramones-20120524 |title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time: Ramones, 'Ramones' |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=28 September 2016}}</ref> and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in 2014.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web|title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum |url= https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=Ramones&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2010&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |website= RIAA.com |publisher= [[Recording Industry Association of America]]| accessdate=2014-06-07| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6QA1g5yY2|archivedate=2014-06-07| url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Ramones]] began playing gigs in mid-1974, with their first show at Performance Studios in [[New York City]].<ref name= \"HallofFame\"/> The band, performing in a style similar to the one used on their debut album, typically performed at clubs in [[Lower Manhattan|downtown Manhattan]], specifically [[CBGB]] and [[Max's Kansas City]].<ref>Melnick & Meyer 2003, p. 33.</ref> In early 1975, [[Lisa Robinson]], an editor of ''Hit Parader'' and ''Rock Scene'', saw the fledgling Ramones performing at CBGB and subsequently wrote about the band in several magazine issues. The group's vocalist [[Joey Ramone]] related that \"Lisa came down to see us, she was blown away by us. She said that we changed her life; she started writing about us in ''Rock Scene'', and then [[Lenny Kaye]] would write about us and we started getting more press like ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Word was getting out, and people starting coming down.\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\"/> Convinced that the band needed a recording contract, Robinson contacted [[Danny Fields]], former manager of [[the Stooges]], and argued that he needed to manage the band. Fields agreed because the band \"had everything [he] ever liked,\"<ref name=\"Rombes 65\">Rombes 2005, p. 65.</ref> and became the manager in November 1975.<ref name=\"ramones 66\">Rombes 2005, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn September 19, 1975, the Ramones recorded a [[Demo (music)|demo]] at [[914 Sound Studios]], which was produced by [[Marty Thau]].

He risked his career to get us on the label.\"<ref name=\"ramones 66\"/><ref>Rombes 2005, p. 67.</ref> The label offered to release \"You're Gonna Kill That Girl\" as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album.

The band also used a technique known as [[Voicing (music)#Doubling|doubling]], where the vocal line used is sung twice.<ref name=\"Rombes 2005 p. 73\"/>\n\nRecording for the album was expanded by [[Mickey Leigh]] (Joey's brother) and Leon with percussion effects, which went unmentioned in the liner notes to the album's release.<ref name=\"Leigh 131\"/> Author Nicholas Rombes said that the production's quality sounded like \"the ultimate do-it-yourself, amateur, reckless ethic that is associated with punk,\" but concluded that they approached the recording process with a \"high degree of preparedness and professionalism.\"<ref>Rombes 2005, p. 5.</ref>\n\n==Artwork and packaging==\n[[File:Ramones back cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|alt=An image that is primarily black and white ([[monochrome]]) photo which consists of small writing on the upper side and a bald eagle belt buckle on the bottom side.|The back cover to the Ramones album was designed by artist [[Arturo Vega]], who produced the photo of a belt buckle in a [[photo booth]].<ref name=\"rombes 75\">Rombes 2005, p. 75.</ref>]]\nInitially, the Ramones wanted an album cover similar to ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'' (1964) and subsequently had pictures taken in that style by Danny Fields but Sire was dissatisfied with the results. The art direction was by Toni Wadler and, according to cartoonist [[John Holmstrom]], the \"Meet The Beatles\" cover idea came out \"horribly\".<ref name=\"Leigh 138\">Leigh 2009, p. 138.</ref> Wadler later chose a photo by Roberta Bayley, a photographer for [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'' magazine]] for the cover.

Leigh, who performed backing vocals on several tracks, asked guitarist Johnny why he was not mentioned on the record's credits. Johnny replied: \"We didn't want people to get confused with who's in the band or who's not. It's our first album, you know, and we didn't want people to get confused.\"<ref name=\"Leigh 138\"/>\n\nThe artwork became one of the most imitated album covers in music.

All but one of the band's 1975 gigs were booked for New York City, with [[Waterbury, Connecticut]] as the exception. After the album's recording, the Ramones headlined for very few shows, usually opening for an identified [[cover band]] which played [[Aerosmith]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. When they opened at [[Brockton, Massachusetts]], the audience appeared extremely uninterested in the Ramones so Johnny swore off playing as an introduction for other bands.<ref>Leigh 2009, p. 136.</ref> Following this, Fields booked several headlining shows around the [[New York metropolitan area|Tri-state area]], and they began playing frequently at gigs like CBGB and Max's Kansas City. After performing with [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] in New Jersey, they continued their tour to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] for three shows.<ref name=\"leigh 137\"/> Leigh later said of the tour:\n\n{{Quote|Travelling was difficult.

I'd play the drums during sound checks, while Tommy went out to the board and mixed the sound\u2014and instructed the soundman not to fuck with the settings.
