This process is known as '''self-maintenance'''.\n\n==Theories and hypotheses==\n\n=== The beginning ===\n[[August Weismann]] was responsible for interpreting and formalizing the mechanisms of [[Darwinian]] evolution in a modern theoretical framework. In 1889, he theorized that ageing was part of life's program to make room for the next generation in order to sustain the turnover that is necessary for evolution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Weismann A.|title=Essays upon heredity and kindred biological problems|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|year=1889}} Work that describes Weismann's theory about making room for the young.</ref>  The idea that the ageing characteristic was selected (an adaptation) because of its deleterious effect was largely discounted for much of the 20th century, but a theoretical model suggests that altruistic ageing could evolve if there is little migration among populations.<ref name=\"Yang_altruistic_aging\">{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Jiang-Nan | name-list-format = vanc |year=2013|title=Viscous populations evolve altruistic programmed ageing in ability conflict in a changing environment |url=http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v15/2825.html |journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research |volume=15 |pages=527\u2013543 }}</ref> Weismann later abandoned his theory and later followed up with his \"programmed death\" theory.\n\n===Mutation accumulation===\nThe first modern theory of [[mammal]] ageing was formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952. This theory formed in the previous decade with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and his [[selection shadow]] concept. The development of human civilization has shifted the selective shadow as the conditions that humans now live in include improved quality of victuals, living conditions, and healthcare. This improved healthcare includes modern medicine such as antibiotics and new medical technology.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\">{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Partridge|first2=Linda|date=2018-08-20|title=Horizons in the evolution of aging|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|journal=BMC Biology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=93|doi=10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|issn=1741-7007|pmc=6100731|pmid=30124168}}</ref> Their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect, as nature is a highly competitive place. Almost all animals die in the wild from predators, disease, or accidents, which lowers the average age of death. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit for the long haul because [[selection pressure]] is low for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would have died anyway. Evolution has not had an opportunity to select against deadly diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Metabolic diseases come along due to the low demand for physical activity in modern civilization compared to times where humans had to forage in the wild for survival.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\"/> With the selective shadow now shifted, humans must deal with these new selective pressures.\n\nMedawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation.'' This theory is based on the idea that random, germline mutations occur that are detrimental to overall health and survival later in life. Overall, senescence would occur through a summation of deleterious mutations, and would explain the overall phenotypic damage we associate with ageing.\n\n===Antagonistic pleiotropy===\n{{main|Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis}}\nMedawar's theory was critiqued and later further developed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957. Williams noted that senescence may be causing many deaths even if animals are not 'dying of old age.'<ref name=\"williams\" /> He began his hypothesis with the idea that ageing can cause earlier senescence due to the competitive nature of life. Even a small amount of ageing can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care and ageing is not cost-free.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter AJ, Nguyen AQ | title = Antagonistic pleiotropy as a widespread mechanism for the maintenance of polymorphic disease alleles | journal = BMC Medical Genetics | volume = 12 | pages = 160 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22151998 | pmc = 3254080 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2350-12-160 }}</ref>\n\nWilliams eventually proposed his own hypothesis called antagonistic ''[[pleiotropy]]''. Pleiotropy, alone, means one mutation that cause multiple effects on [[phenotype]].<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/03374-X |chapter=Senescence: Genetic Theories |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences |pages=13897\u2013902 |year=2001 |last1=Curtsinger |first1=J.W. |isbn=978-0-08-043076-8 }}</ref> Antagonistic pleiotropy on the other hand deals with one gene that creates two traits with one being beneficial and the other being detrimental. In essence, this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but accumulate a cost later on.<ref name=\"williams\" />\n\nAlthough antagonistic pleiotropy is a prevailing theory today, this is largely by default, and has not been well verified. Research has shown that this is not true for all genes and may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but it cuts the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.\n\nIn breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their [[fertility]]. His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artifact.<ref name=\"pmid28564485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leroi AM, Chippindale AK, Rose MR | title = Long-term laboratory evolution of a genetic life-history tradeoff in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. 1.

The body uses resources derived from the environment for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance, and the body must compromise when there is a finite supply of resources. The theory states that this compromise causes the body to reallocate energy to the repair function that causes the body to gradually deteriorate with age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirkwood TB | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = 5635 | pages = 301\u20134 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 593350 | doi = 10.1038/270301a0 | bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }} Origin of the disposable soma theory.</ref>\n\nA caveat to this theory suggests that this reallocation of energy is based on time instead of limiting resources. This concept focuses on the evolutionary pressure to reproduce in a set, optimal time period that is dictated by age and ecological niche. The way that this is successful is through the allocation of time and energy in damage repair at the cellular level resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer [[gestation]]. This concept stems from a comparative analysis of genomic stability in mammalian cells.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lorenzini A, Stamato T, Sell C | title = The disposable soma theory revisited: time as a resource in the theories of aging | journal = Cell Cycle | volume = 10 | issue = 22 | pages = 3853\u20136 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22071624 | doi = 10.4161/cc.10.22.18302 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Heuvel J, English S, Uller T | title = Disposable Soma Theory and the Evolution of Maternal Effects on Ageing | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = e0145544 | date = 2016-01-11 | pmid = 26752635 | pmc = 4709080 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0145544 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1145544V | veditors = Criscuolo F }}</ref>\n\n<!-- This paragraph should just be removed.

One such theory is the free radical or rate of living theory which relies on the assumption that the speed at which an organism is able to metabolize oxygen is directly correlated to the release of destructive atoms which break down the cell.  The destructive atoms, known as free radicals, are released during oxygen basal metabolism and collide with healthy cells material causing breakdown, and eventual cell death.  All organisms have this oxygen basal metabolism, however it is the rate at which oxygen is broken down that determines the rate at which cells die.  For Instance, a fly has an incredible metabolic rate, so because of this they expend oxygen quickly causing cell hastened cell death which can explain their life span of only 2-3 weeks.\n}}<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Lin MT, Beal MF |date=2003-01-01|title=The oxidative damage theory of aging |journal=Clinical Neuroscience Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=5|pages=305\u2013315|doi=10.1016/S1566-2772(03)00007-0 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=McDonald | first = Roger B. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biology of aging|isbn=978-0-8153-4567-1|edition= Second|location=Boca Raton|oclc=1056201427}}</ref>\n\n===Programmed maintenance theories===\nTheories, such as Weismann's \"programmed death\" theory, suggest that deterioration and death due to ageing are a purposeful result of an organism's evolved design, and are referred to as theories of programmed ageing or adaptive ageing.\n\nThe programmed maintenance theory based on [[evolvability]]<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Goldsmith T |year=2009|title=Mammal aging: active and passive mechanisms |journal=Journal of Bioscience Hypotheses|volume=2|issue=2|pages=59\u201364|doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.12.002}} Article compares programmed and non-programmed maintenance theories of ageing in light of empirical evidence.</ref> suggests that the repair mechanisms are controlled by a common control mechanism capable of sensing conditions, such as caloric restriction, and may be responsible for lifespan in particular species.

Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative processes. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, have less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are a wide variety of ageing manifestations that appear to have very different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.\n\n=== Selective Shadowing ===\nSelective Shadowing is ideally one of the evolutionary theories of aging which reveals that selection of an individual generally decreases once they essentially pass the sexual mature phase. As a result, this forms a shadow without the account of sexual fitness, which is no longer considered as an individual ages. Essentially this supports the idea that the force of natural selection declines as a function of age, which was first introduced by Peter B. Medewar and J.B.S Haldane. \"The key conceptual insight that allowed Medawar, Williams, and others, to develop the evolutionary theory of aging is based on the notion that the force of natural selection, a measure of how effectively selection acts on survival rate or [[Fecundity selection|fecundity]] as a function of age, declines with progressive age.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamilton|first=W.D.|date=1966-09|title=The moulding of senescence by natural selection|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-5193(66)90184-6|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=12|issue=1|pages=12\u201345|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(66)90184-6|issn=0022-5193}}</ref>\n\nMedewar developed a model that highlights this, showing the decrease in the survival rate of a population as an individual ages, however the reproduction rate stays constant. The reproduction probability typically peaks during sexual maturity and decreases as an individual ages, while the rest of the population decreases with age as they enter the selection shadow. The model also supports Medewars' theory that due to dangerous and unpredicted conditions in the environment such as diseases, climate changes and predators, many individuals die not too long after sexual maturation. Consequently, the probability of an individual surviving and suffering from age related effects is relatively low. In the same way, many beneficial mutations are selected against if they have a positive effect on an individual later on in life. For instance if a beneficial or deleterious mutation occurs only after an individual's reproductive phase, then it will not affect fitness, which therefore can not be selected against. Subsequently, these later mutations and effects are considered to be in the \"shadow region\" of selection.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Schmidt|first2=Paul S.|date=2009-10|title=Integrating evolutionary and molecular genetics of aging|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects|volume=1790|issue=10|pages=951\u2013962|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2009.07.010|issn=0304-4165}}</ref>\n\n\n== Natural selection ==\n\n===Group selection===\n{{Main|Group selection}}\nGroup selection is based on the idea that all members of a given group will either succeed or fail together depending on the circumstance.

Intrinsic mortality is thought to be a result of ageing from insider factors, whereas extrinsic is a direct result of environmental factors. An example would be that bats have fewer predators, and therefore have a low extrinsic mortality. Birds are warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5\u201310 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals, and have a lower extrinsic mortality.\n\nWhen examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and they would have a lower intrinsic mortality. \n[[File:Bathtub_curve.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bathtub_curve.svg|thumb|244x244px|Constant Failure Rate over Time]]\n\n==Diseases ==\n\n=== Progeroid Syndromes ===\nProgeroid syndromes are genetic diseases that are linked to premature aging.

This theory formed in the previous decade with [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and his [[selection shadow]] concept. The development of human civilization has shifted the selective shadow as the conditions that humans now live in include improved quality of victuals, living conditions, and healthcare. This improved healthcare includes modern medicine such as antibiotics and new medical technology.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\">{{Cite journal|last=Flatt|first=Thomas|last2=Partridge|first2=Linda|date=2018-08-20|title=Horizons in the evolution of aging|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|journal=BMC Biology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=93|doi=10.1186/s12915-018-0562-z|issn=1741-7007|pmc=6100731|pmid=30124168}}</ref> Their idea was that ageing was a matter of neglect, as nature is a highly competitive place. Almost all animals die in the wild from predators, disease, or accidents, which lowers the average age of death. Therefore, there is not much reason why the body should remain fit for the long haul because [[selection pressure]] is low for traits that would maintain viability past the time when most animals would have died anyway. Evolution has not had an opportunity to select against deadly diseases such as cancer and heart disease. Metabolic diseases come along due to the low demand for physical activity in modern civilization compared to times where humans had to forage in the wild for survival.<ref name=\"Flatt 93\"/> With the selective shadow now shifted, humans must deal with these new selective pressures.\n\nMedawar's theory is referred to as ''Mutation Accumulation.'' This theory is based on the idea that random, germline mutations occur that are detrimental to overall health and survival later in life. Overall, senescence would occur through a summation of deleterious mutations, and would explain the overall phenotypic damage we associate with ageing.\n\n===Antagonistic pleiotropy===\n{{main|Antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis}}\nMedawar's theory was critiqued and later further developed by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] in 1957. Williams noted that senescence may be causing many deaths even if animals are not 'dying of old age.'<ref name=\"williams\" /> He began his hypothesis with the idea that ageing can cause earlier senescence due to the competitive nature of life. Even a small amount of ageing can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care and ageing is not cost-free.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter AJ, Nguyen AQ | title = Antagonistic pleiotropy as a widespread mechanism for the maintenance of polymorphic disease alleles | journal = BMC Medical Genetics | volume = 12 | pages = 160 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22151998 | pmc = 3254080 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2350-12-160 }}</ref>\n\nWilliams eventually proposed his own hypothesis called antagonistic ''[[pleiotropy]]''. Pleiotropy, alone, means one mutation that cause multiple effects on [[phenotype]].<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1016/B0-08-043076-7/03374-X |chapter=Senescence: Genetic Theories |title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences |pages=13897\u2013902 |year=2001 |last1=Curtsinger |first1=J.W. |isbn=978-0-08-043076-8 }}</ref> Antagonistic pleiotropy on the other hand deals with one gene that creates two traits with one being beneficial and the other being detrimental. In essence, this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but accumulate a cost later on.<ref name=\"williams\" />\n\nAlthough antagonistic pleiotropy is a prevailing theory today, this is largely by default, and has not been well verified. Research has shown that this is not true for all genes and may be thought of as partial validation of the theory, but it cuts the core premise: that genetic trade-offs are the root cause of ageing.\n\nIn breeding experiments, [[Michael R. Rose]] selected [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] for long lifespan. Based on antagonistic pleiotropy, Rose expected that this would surely reduce their [[fertility]]. His team found that they were able to breed flies that lived more than twice as long as the flies they started with, but to their surprise, the long-lived, inbred flies actually laid more eggs than the short-lived flies. This was another setback for pleiotropy theory, though Rose maintains it may be an experimental artifact.<ref name=\"pmid28564485\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Leroi AM, Chippindale AK, Rose MR | title = Long-term laboratory evolution of a genetic life-history tradeoff in ''Drosophila melanogaster''. 1.

The body uses resources derived from the environment for metabolism, for reproduction, and for repair and maintenance, and the body must compromise when there is a finite supply of resources. The theory states that this compromise causes the body to reallocate energy to the repair function that causes the body to gradually deteriorate with age.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirkwood TB | title = Evolution of ageing | journal = Nature | volume = 270 | issue = 5635 | pages = 301\u20134 | date = November 1977 | pmid = 593350 | doi = 10.1038/270301a0 | bibcode = 1977Natur.270..301K }} Origin of the disposable soma theory.</ref>\n\nA caveat to this theory suggests that this reallocation of energy is based on time instead of limiting resources. This concept focuses on the evolutionary pressure to reproduce in a set, optimal time period that is dictated by age and ecological niche. The way that this is successful is through the allocation of time and energy in damage repair at the cellular level resulting in an accumulation of damage and a decreased lifespan relative to organisms with longer [[gestation]].

One such theory is the free radical or rate of living theory which relies on the assumption that the speed at which an organism is able to metabolize oxygen is directly correlated to the release of destructive atoms which break down the cell.  The destructive atoms, known as free radicals, are released during oxygen basal metabolism and collide with healthy cells material causing breakdown, and eventual cell death.  All organisms have this oxygen basal metabolism, however it is the rate at which oxygen is broken down that determines the rate at which cells die.  For Instance, a fly has an incredible metabolic rate, so because of this they expend oxygen quickly causing cell hastened cell death which can explain their life span of only 2-3 weeks.\n}}<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Lin MT, Beal MF |date=2003-01-01|title=The oxidative damage theory of aging |journal=Clinical Neuroscience Research|language=en|volume=2|issue=5|pages=305\u2013315|doi=10.1016/S1566-2772(03)00007-0 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=McDonald | first = Roger B. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Biology of aging|isbn=978-0-8153-4567-1|edition= Second|location=Boca Raton|oclc=1056201427}}</ref>\n\n===Programmed maintenance theories===\nTheories, such as Weismann's \"programmed death\" theory, suggest that deterioration and death due to ageing are a purposeful result of an organism's evolved design, and are referred to as theories of programmed ageing or adaptive ageing.\n\nThe programmed maintenance theory based on [[evolvability]]<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Goldsmith T |year=2009|title=Mammal aging: active and passive mechanisms |journal=Journal of Bioscience Hypotheses|volume=2|issue=2|pages=59\u201364|doi=10.1016/j.bihy.2008.12.002}} Article compares programmed and non-programmed maintenance theories of ageing in light of empirical evidence.</ref> suggests that the repair mechanisms are controlled by a common control mechanism capable of sensing conditions, such as caloric restriction, and may be responsible for lifespan in particular species.

Longer-lived species possess many mechanisms for offsetting damage due to causes such as oxidation, telomere shortening, and other deteriorative processes. Shorter-lived species, having earlier ages of sexual maturity, have less need for longevity and thus did not evolve or retain the more-effective repair mechanisms. Damage therefore accumulates more rapidly, resulting in earlier manifestations and shorter lifespan. Since there are a wide variety of ageing manifestations that appear to have very different causes, it is likely that there are many different maintenance and repair functions.\n\n== Natural selection ==\n\n===Group selection===\n{{Main|Group selection}}\nGroup selection is based on the idea that all members of a given group will either succeed or fail together depending on the circumstance.

Intrinsic mortality is thought to be a result of ageing from insider factors, whereas extrinsic is a direct result of environmental factors. An example would be that bats have fewer predators, and therefore have a low extrinsic mortality. Birds are warm-blooded and are similar in size to many small mammals, yet often live 5\u201310 times as long. They have less predation pressure than ground-dwelling mammals, and have a lower extrinsic mortality.\n\nWhen examining the body-size vs. lifespan relationship, one also observes that predatory mammals tend to live longer than prey mammals in a controlled environment, such as a zoo or nature reserve. The explanation for the long lifespans of primates (such as humans, monkeys, and apes) relative to body size is that their intelligence, and they would have a lower intrinsic mortality. \n[[File:Bathtub_curve.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bathtub_curve.svg|thumb|244x244px|Constant Failure Rate over Time]]\n\n==Diseases ==\n\n=== Progeroid Syndromes ===\nProgeroid syndromes are genetic diseases that are linked to premature aging.
