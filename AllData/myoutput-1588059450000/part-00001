Introduced as the [[Jedi#Padawan|Padawan]] apprentice of [[Darth Vader|Anakin Skywalker]], she is a [[protagonist]] of the 2008 animated film ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (film)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]'' and the [[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|subsequent television series]]. Ahsoka reappears in ''[[Star Wars Rebels]],'' where she uses the [[codename]] '''Fulcrum''', and as a voiceover cameo in ''[[Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker]]''. [[Ashley Eckstein]] voices Ahsoka in these appearances. Ahsoka is also the main character of the eponymous novel ''[[Star Wars: Ahsoka]]'', which has Eckstein narrating the audiobook version. Ahsoka will reportedly be featured in the second season of ''[[The Mandalorian]]'', portrayed by [[Rosario Dawson]].\n\nAlthough not initially popular, Ahsoka developed into a well-rounded, complex character who received positive popular and critical reaction. Ahsoka serves as an important [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Anakin Skywalker, and she has been highlighted as a strong female character of the franchise.\n\n==Creation and development==\n===Concept===\nAhsoka was developed to illustrate how [[Anakin Skywalker]] develops from the brash, undisciplined Padawan apprentice in ''[[Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) to the more reserved Jedi Knight in ''[[Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005).<ref name=\"TVGuide\">TV Guide Article August 11, 2008</ref> ''Star Wars'' creator [[George Lucas]], who had two daughters, also wanted the character to appeal to girls.<ref name=\"taylor\">{{Cite book|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|last=Taylor|first=Chris|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=2014|pages=377, 380|type=eBook|oclc=889674238|ref=taylor}}</ref> Early in development, Ahsoka's name was \"Ashla\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/tv-shows/star-wars-rebels/legends-of-the-lasat-trivia-gallery|title=Legends of the Lasat Trivia Gallery|website=StarWars.com|publisher=[[Lucasfilm]]|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref>{{efn|According to ''The Clone Wars'' supervising director and writer [[Dave Filoni]], \"I think it was the name given to one of the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[younglings]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> in ''Attack of the Clones''.

However, she is forced to go into hiding after exposing her Force powers while trying to save the life of four-year old Hedala Fardi, the youngest Fardi daughter. Ahsoka settles down on the agrarian moon of Raada, where she finds work as a mechanic and befriends several local farmers, including the teenage sisters Kaeden and Miara Larte, and their guardian Vartan. The [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] subsequently establishes a presence on Raada and forces the farmers to plant new crops, which leach the moon's soils. Ahsoka becomes the leader of a resistance movement. However, the planned uprising goes awry and Ahsoka exposes her Force powers during a skirmish with Imperial forces. In response, the Empire dispatches a Jedi-hunting Inquisitor known as the [[Sixth Brother]] to hunt Ahsoka.\n\nHaving attracted the attention of the Empire, Ahsoka is forced to leave Raada. [[Alderaan]]ian Senator [[Bail Organa]] takes an interest in Imperial reports about Ahsoka and decides to find her. Returning to the Fardis, Ahsoka resumes work as a pilot and mechanic. She learns that a \"shadow\" (who turns out to be the Sixth Brother) has been stalking the Force-sensitive Hedala. With the Empire tightening its grip on Thabeska, the Fardi patriarch advises Ahsoka to leave. Ahsoka's ship is captured by two pilots in the service of Organa. Mistaking the pilots for threats, Ahsoka knocks them unconscious. She encounters [[R2-D2]] and convinces him to smuggle her aboard Organa's corvette. Ahsoka forges an alliance with Organa in return for his help in protecting Force-sensitive children from the Empire. Returning to Raada, she finds Miara and learns that the Sixth Brother captured her older sister Kaeden. Following a lightsaber duel, Ahsoka defeats and kills the Sixth Brother, and takes his [[Kyber crystals]] to forge her new twin lightsabers. After freeing Kaeden, Ahsoka organizes an evacuation of Raada's population with Organa's help. Ahsoka then decides to join Organa's rebellion while the Larte sisters and the other refugees settle down on Alderaan. Meanwhile, the Empire dispatches the [[Grand Inquisitor (Star Wars)|Grand Inquisitor]], a perennial antagonist from ''Star Wars Rebels'', to hunt down Ahsoka.\n\n==Critical response==\n[[File:Ahsoka Tano costume.jpg|thumb|A [[cosplay]]er portraying Ahsoka.]]\nAfter her introduction, some critics called Ahsoka annoying and predicted the character would die before ''The Clone Wars'' series ended because she does not appear in ''Revenge of the Sith''.<ref name=\"io9netflix\">{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-clone-wars-ahsoka-tano-made-the-star-wars-franchis-1537984315|title=Why Ahsoka Tano Is the Best Thing to Happen to Star Wars in 20 Years|last=Davis|first=Lauren|date=December 16, 2015|website=[[io9]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|language=|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"blastr\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2016-3-31/snips-fulcrum-why-ahsoka-tano-one-most-important-characters-ever-created-star-wars|title=From Snips to Fulcrum: Why Ahsoka Tano is one of the most important characters ever created for Star Wars|last=Granshaw|first=Lisa|date=March 31, 2016|website=Blastr|publisher=[[Comcast]]|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Ahsoka a \"carefully calculated-to-be-cute\" character in ''The Clone Wars'' film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=It's a weak Jedi mind trick|last=Ordona|first=Michael|date=August 15, 2008|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=|via=}}</ref> ''Wired'' criticized Ahsoka's \"half-naked\" appearance in ''The Clone Wars''<nowiki/>' first two seasons, calling her third-season costume change \"more appropriate\".<ref name=\"wiredtubetop\" /> ''[[Syfy|Blastr]]'' said Ahsoka's initial immaturity gives the character room to grow, saying she becomes \"a well-rounded and complex character in every sense\".<ref name=\"blastr\" /> Ahsoka's youth aided her in being a point-of-view character for younger viewers.<ref name=\"io9netflix\" /> ''[[io9]]'' called Ahsoka's development arc one of the best aspects of ''The Clone Wars'', highlighting the character's role in exploring the nuances of war and the flaws of the Jedi Order.<ref name=\"io9netflix\" /> According to ''Tech Times'', Ahsoka's maturation and development mirror the show's, and the producers chose wisely in making Ahsoka the audience's \"entry point\" to ''The Clone Wars''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/73204/20150731/why-star-wars-rebels-clone-best-30-years.htm|title=Why 'Rebels' And 'The Clone Wars' Are The Best Star Wars Material In 30 Years|last=Parrish|first=Robin|date=July 31, 2015|website=Tech Times|access-date=May 20, 2016|ref=techtimesbest30}}</ref> [[Chris Taylor (journalist)|Chris Taylor]] called Ahsoka's decision to leave the Jedi Order \"the show's most shocking [[cliffhanger]]\".<ref name=\"taylor\" /> Ashley Eckstein was nominated for the 2012 and 2013 \"Best Female Lead Vocal Performance in a Television Series - Action/Drama\" awards from Behind the Voice Actors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/btva-awards/2012/television/|title=2012 BTVA Voice Acting Awards|website=Behind The Voice Actors|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/btva-awards/2013/television/|title=2013 BTVA Voice Acting Awards|website=Behind The Voice Actors|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n''The Mary Sue'' said Ahsoka's relationship with Anakin is critical in understanding his development between ''Attack of the Clones'' and ''Revenge of the Sith'', and the publication called Ahsoka a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] for Anakin's growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/ahsoka-and-anakin/|title=How Ahsoka Tano Completed the Arc of Anakin Skywalker|last=Chen|first=Mike|date=April 4, 2016|website=The Mary Sue|publisher=[[Dan Abrams]]|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref> ''Blastr'' commented that Anakin's interactions with Ahsoka help show that he is a powerful Jedi and war hero.

The owl, previously a companion to Ahsoka in the show and an avatar of the Daughter of Mortis, then flies back into the temple to witness Ahsoka seemingly walking deeper inside its walls.

Ahsoka is updated on what occurred to the ''Ghost'' crew while convincing Ezra to not prevent Kanan's fate as he would risk losing his own life. [[Palpatine]] then makes his presence known as he attempts to force Ezra into bringing him into the realm. Ahsoka helps Ezra escape while returning (with Morai) to her timeline moments after the Sith temple collapsed, vowing to find Ezra and the crew again.

However, she is forced to go into hiding after exposing her Force powers while trying to save the life of four-year old Hedala Fardi, the youngest Fardi daughter. Ahsoka settles down on the agrarian moon of Raada, where she finds work as a mechanic and befriends several local farmers, including the teenage sisters Kaeden and Miara Larte, and their guardian Vartan. The [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] subsequently establishes a presence on Raada and forces the farmers to plant new crops, which leach the moon's soils. Ahsoka becomes the leader of a resistance movement. However, the planned uprising goes awry and Ahsoka exposes her Force powers during a skirmish with Imperial forces. In response, the Empire dispatches a Jedi-hunting Inquisitor known as the [[Sixth Brother]] to hunt Ahsoka.\n\nHaving attracted the attention of the Empire, Ahsoka is forced to leave Raada. [[Alderaan]]ian Senator [[Bail Organa]] takes an interest in Imperial reports about Ahsoka and decides to find her. Returning to the Fardis, Ahsoka resumes work as a pilot and mechanic. She learns that a \"shadow\" (who turns out to be the Sixth Brother) has been stalking the Force-sensitive Hedala. With the Empire tightening its grip on Thabeska, the Fardi patriarch advises Ahsoka to leave. Ahsoka's ship is captured by two pilots in the service of Organa. Mistaking the pilots for threats, Ahsoka knocks them unconscious. She encounters [[R2-D2]] and convinces him to smuggle her aboard Organa's corvette. Ahsoka forges an alliance with Organa in return for his help in protecting Force-sensitive children from the Empire. Returning to Raada, she finds Miara and learns that the Sixth Brother captured her older sister Kaeden. Following a lightsaber duel, Ahsoka defeats and kills the Sixth Brother, and takes his [[Kyber crystals]] to forge her new twin lightsabers.
