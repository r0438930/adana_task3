The ''kavadi'' is a semicircular, decorated canopy supported by a wooden rod that the pilgrim carries on their shoulders to the temple.

The ''kavadi''-bearer observes celibacy and consumes only certain types of foods known as ''[[Sattva|satvik]]'' food, once a day, while continuously thinking of God. On the day of the festival, devotees shave their heads and undertake a pilgrimage along a set route, while engaging in various acts of devotion, notably carrying the various types of ''kavadi''.
