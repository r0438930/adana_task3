His education and training includes a Fulbright scholarship in the USA in 1967-68, an Msc (1976) and doctors degree at [[Delft University]] of Technology (1984).\n\nHis 1986 PhD on Beach Erosion and Dune Erosion During Storm provided the basis for the coastal safety evaluation (the [[Dutch Delta Plan]]).\n\nIn 1988, in a newly created position, he became advisor to the [[Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment (Netherlands)|Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment]] on the issue of Climate Change and the development of international CO2 policies. In this role he was key negotiator during the Netherlands EU-presidency of 1988. He was also one of the experts of the [[Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases]]. For this advisory body he also chaired with [[Peter Gleick]] the \u201cTargets and Indicators of Climatic Change\u201d working group.\n\nIn 1991 Professor Vellinga published an article<ref>The greenhouse marathon: A proposal for a global strategy [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00142501?LI=true], Climatic Change - January 1991, Volume 18, Issue 1, pp vii-xii</ref> with Robert Swart that became a cornerstone in the definition of the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C target, than adopted by UNFCCC [[COP 15]] in Copenhagen  in 2009.
