Woodhouse played football as a central [[midfielder]], and competed as a [[light-welterweight]] boxer. He is the former British light-welterweight champion. His career in [[the Football League]] spanned across nine seasons, earning four [[cap (football)|caps]] for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 football team]].

in charge of [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]]. Woodhouse played football as a central [[midfielder]], and competed as a [[light-welterweight]] boxer. He is the former British light-welterweight champion. His career in [[the Football League]] spanned across nine seasons, earning four [[cap (football)|caps]] for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 football team]]. Woodhouse's professional boxing record stands at 29 fights 22 wins, 13 of which are by [[knock-out]], and 7 defeats.\n\nHe started his footballing career with [[York City F.C.|York City]]'s centre of excellence before joining [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]. In November 2001, he was transferred to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for a fee of [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1 million, before joining [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in January 2003, on loan for five months. He then joined [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] on a free transfer in October 2003. In May 2005, he joined [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] for \u00a325,000, before joining [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] just eight months later in January 2006. He retired at the end of the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] season.\n\nWoodhouse stated that he had \"fallen out of love\" with football and decided to turn to professional boxing, despite no previous experience. In September 2006, he won his first professional boxing match, defeating Dean Marcantonio, on points, knocking him down twice in the final round.\n\nHe was convicted of assaulting a police officer and of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour in April 2006.
