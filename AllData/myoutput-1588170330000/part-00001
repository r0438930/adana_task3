The album was mostly composed by guitarist [[Pete Townshend]], and is a [[rock opera]] that tells the story of Tommy Walker, a \"deaf, dumb and blind\" boy, including his experiences with life and his relationship with his family.\n\nTownshend came up with the concept of ''Tommy'' after being introduced to the work of [[Meher Baba]], and attempted to translate Baba's teachings into music. Recording on the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete as material needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. ''Tommy'' was acclaimed upon its release by critics, who hailed it as the Who's breakthrough. Its critical standing diminished slightly in later years; nonetheless, several writers view it as an important and influential album in the history of rock music. The Who promoted the album's release with an extensive tour, including a live version of ''Tommy'', which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at [[Woodstock]], the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|1969 Isle of Wight Festival]], the [[University of Leeds]], the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]]. The live performances of ''Tommy'' drew critical praise and rejuvenated the band's career.\n\nSubsequently, the rock opera developed into other media, including a [[Seattle Opera]] production in 1971, an orchestral version by [[Lou Reizner]] in 1972, a [[Tommy (1975 film)|film]] in 1975, and a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[The Who's Tommy|musical]] in 1992. The original album has sold 20 million copies and has been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]]. It has been reissued several times on CD, including a remix by [[Jon Astley]] in 1996, a deluxe [[Super Audio CD]] in 2003, and a super deluxe box set in 2013, including previously unreleased demos and live material.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Tommy'' has never had a definitive plot, but the following synopsis was published following the original album's release.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=121}}\n\nBritish Army Captain Walker goes missing during an expedition and is believed dead (\"Overture\"). His wife, Mrs. Walker, gives birth to their son, Tommy (\"It's a Boy\"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an [[altercation]]. Tommy's mother brainwashes him into believing he didn't see or hear anything, shutting down his senses and making him deaf, dumb and blind to the outside world (\"1921\"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner [[psyche]] (\"[[Amazing Journey]]/Sparks\").{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nA [[quackery|quack]] claims his wife can cure Tommy (\"[[Eyesight to the Blind|The Hawker]]\"), while Tommy's parents are increasingly frustrated that he will never find religion in the midst of his isolation (\"Christmas\"). They begin to neglect him, leaving him to be tortured by his [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] \"Cousin Kevin\" and [[child molestation|molested]] by his uncle Ernie (\"Fiddle About\"). The Hawker's drug addicted wife, \"[[The Acid Queen]]\", gives Tommy a dose of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], causing a [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenic]] experience that is expressed musically (\"Underture\").{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAs Tommy grows older, he discovers that he can feel vibrations sufficiently well to become an expert [[pinball]] player (\"[[Pinball Wizard]]\"). His parents take him to a respected doctor (\"There's a Doctor\"), who determines that the boy's disabilities are [[Psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] rather than physical. Tommy is told by the Doctor to \"[[Go to the Mirror!]]\", and his parents notice he can stare at his reflection. After seeing Tommy spend extended periods staring at a mirror in the house, his mother smashes it out of frustration (\"Smash the Mirror\"). This removes Tommy's [[mental block]], and he recovers his senses, realising he can become a powerful leader (\"Sensation\"). He starts a religious movement (\"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\"), which generates fervor among its adherents (\"Sally Simpson\") and expands into a [[holiday camp]] (\"Welcome\" / \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\"). However, Tommy's followers ultimately reject his teachings and leave the camp (\"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (The Who song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\"). Tommy retreats inward again (\"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\") with his \"continuing statement of wonder at that which encompasses him\".{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n==Background==\nTownshend had been looking at ways of progressing beyond the standard three-minute pop single format since 1966.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=214}} Co-manager [[Kit Lambert]] shared Townshend's views and encouraged him to develop musical ideas,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=215}} coming up with the term \"[[rock opera]]\". The first use of the term was applied to a suite called \"Quads\", set in a future where parents could choose the sex of their children. A couple want four girls but instead receive three girls and a boy, raising him as a girl anyway. The opera was abandoned after writing a single song, the hit single, \"[[I'm a Boy]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=217}} When the Who's second album, ''[[A Quick One]]'' ran short of material during recording, Lambert suggested that Townshend should write a \"mini-opera\" to fill the gap. Townshend initially objected, but eventually agreed to do so, coming up with \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\", which joined short pieces of music together into a continuous narrative.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} During 1967, Townshend learned how to play the [[piano]] and began writing songs on it, taking his work more seriously.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=283}} That year's ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' included a mini-opera in the last track, \"Rael\", which like \"A Quick One...\" was a suite of musical segments joined together.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=282, 283}}\n\n{{quotebox|width=50%|quote=The package I hope is going to be called ''\"Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy.\"'' It's a story about a kid that's born deaf, dumb and blind and what happens to him throughout his life&nbsp;... But what it's really all about is the fact that&nbsp;... he's seeing things basically as vibrations which we translate as music. That's really what we want to do: create this feeling that when you listen to the music you can actually become aware of the boy, and aware of what he is all about, because we are creating him as we play.\"|source=[[Pete Townshend]] talking to [[Jann Wenner]], August 1968{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=313,314}}}}\n\nBy 1968, Townshend was unsure about how the Who should progress musically. The group were no longer teenagers, but he wanted their music to remain relevant.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=293\u2013294}} His friend, ''[[International Times]]'' [[art director]] Mike McInnerney, told him about the Indian spiritual mentor [[Meher Baba]],{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=294}} and Townshend became fascinated with Baba's values of compassion, love and introspection.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=296}} The Who's commercial success was on the wane after the single \"Dogs\" failed to make the top 20, and there was a genuine risk of the band breaking up.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=308}} The group still performed well live and spent most of the spring and summer touring the US and Canada,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=190}} but their stage act relied on Townshend smashing his guitar or [[Keith Moon]] demolishing his drums, which kept the group in debt. Townshend and Kit Lambert realised they needed a larger vehicle for their music than hit singles and a new stage show, and Townshend hoped to incorporate his love of Meher Baba into this concept.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=309}} He decided that the Who should record a series of songs that stood well in isolation, but formed a cohesive whole on the album. He also wanted the material performed in concert, to counteract the trend of bands like [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]], whose studio output was not designed for live performance.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=310}}\n\nIn August 1968, in an interview to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Townshend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of ''Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy'', and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=313\u2013316}} The Who biographer [[Dave Marsh]] subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=316}} Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=191}} The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let him have artistic control over the project.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=192}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe Who started recording the album at [[IBC Studios]] on 19 September 1968.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}} There was no firm title at this point, which was variously referred to as ''Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy'', ''Amazing Journey'', ''Journey into Space'', ''The Brain Opera'' and ''Omnibus''. Townshend eventually settled on ''Tommy'' because it was a common British name, and a nickname for soldiers in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=317}} Kit Lambert took charge of the production, with Damon Lyon-Shaw as engineer. Sessions were block booked from 2pm \u2013 10pm, but recording often spilled over into the early morning. {{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}}\n\nThe album was recorded onto [[8-track tape|eight track tape]], which allowed various instruments to be [[overdubbed]]. Townshend used several guitars in the studio, but made particular use of the [[Gibson J-200]] acoustic and the [[Gibson SG]].<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/pinball-wizard-0305-2012.aspx |work=Gibson Guitars |title=Pinball Wizard: Pete Townshend Finds His Signature Guitar Sound |first=Ted |last=Drozdowski |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419095036/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/pinball-wizard-0305-2012.aspx |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As well as their usual instruments, Townshend played [[piano]] and [[Hammond organ|organ]] and bassist [[John Entwistle]] doubled on [[french horn]]. [[Keith Moon]] used a new double bass drum kit owned by roadie Tony Haslam, after [[Premier Percussion|Premier]] had refused to loan him any more equipment due to continual abuse.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}} Though Townshend wrote the majority of the material, the arrangements came from the entire band. Singer [[Roger Daltrey]] later said that Townshend often came in with a half-finished [[demo recording]], adding \"we probably did as much talking as we did recording, sorting out arrangements and things.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=219}} Townshend asked Entwistle to write two songs (\"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\") that covered the darker themes of bullying and abuse. \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\" was Keith Moon's suggestion of what kind of religious movement Tommy could lead. Moon got the songwriting credit for suggesting the idea, though the music was composed and played by Townshend.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}}  A significant amount of material had a lighter style than earlier recordings, with greater prominence put on the vocals. Moon later said, \"It was, at the time, very un-Wholike. A lot of the songs were soft. We never played like that.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=220}}\n\nSome of the material had already been written for other projects. \"Sensation\" was written about a girl Townshend had met on the Who's tour of Australia in early 1968, \"Welcome\" and \"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" were about peace found through [[Meher Baba]] and \"Sally Simpson\" was based on a gig with [[the Doors]] which was marred by violence.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=316, 318}} Other songs had been previously recorded by the Who and were recycled; \"It's A Boy\" was derived from \"Glow Girl\", an out-take from [[The Who Sell Out|''The Who Sell Out'',]] while \"Sparks\" and \"Underture\" re-used and expanded one of the instrumental themes in \"Rael\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} \"Amazing Journey\" was, according to Townshend, \"the absolute beginning\" of the opera and summarised the entire plot.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} \"The Hawker\" was a cover of [[Sonny Boy Williamson]]'s \"Eyesight to the Blind\". A cover of [[Mercy Dee Walton]]'s \"One Room Country Shack\" was also recorded but was scrapped from the final track listing as Townshend could not figure out a way to incorporate it in the plot.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=114}}\n\nRecording at [[IBC Studios|IBC]] was slow, due to a lack of a full plot and a full selection of songs. The group hoped that the album would be ready by Christmas, but sessions dragged on. ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{'}}s [[Chris Welch]] visited IBC studios in November and while he was impressed with the working environment and the material,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=321}} the project still did not have a title and there was no coherent plotline.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}} The Who's US record company, [[Decca Records]], got so impatient waiting for new product that they released the compilation album ''[[Magic Bus: The Who on Tour]]'' which received a scathing review from Greil Marcus in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' over its poor selection of material and misleading name (as the album contained studio recordings and was not live).{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=319,320}}\n\nThe Who took a break from recording at the end of 1968 to tour, including a well received appearance at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 10 December.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=216}} They resumed sessions at IBC in January 1969, block booking Monday to Thursday, but had to do gigs every weekend to stop going further into debt.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} A major tour was booked for the end of April, and the group's management insisted that the album would have to be finished by then, as it had been well over a year since ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}} Kit Lambert wrote a script, ''Tommy (1914\u20131984)'' which he professionally printed, and gave copies to the band, which helped them focus the storyline, and also decide to make the album a double.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} The group were still coming up with new material; Lambert insisted that the piece should have a proper overture,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}} while Townshend wrote \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" so that [[Nik Cohn]], a pinball fan, would give the album a favourable review in the ''[[New York Times]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=221}} Lambert wanted an orchestra to appear on the album, but Townshend was strongly against the idea, and time and budget constraints meant it could not happen anyway.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}}\n\nBy March 1969, some songs had been recorded several times, yet Townshend still thought there were missing pieces.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=327}} [[John Entwistle]] had become fed up with recording, later saying \"we had to keep going back and rejuvenating the numbers&nbsp;... it just started to drive us mad.\"<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\"/> The final recording session took place on 7 March, the same day that \"Pinball Wizard\" was released as a single.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=227, 228}} The group started tour rehearsals and promotional activities for the single and Lambert went on holiday in [[Cairo]]. The mixing was left to Damon Lyon-Shaw and assistant engineer Ted Sharp, who did not think [[IBC Studios|IBC]] was well suited for the task.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=228}} The album overshot its April deadline, as stereo [[Mastering (audio)|mastering]] continued into the end of the month.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}}\n\n==Release and reception==\nAfter delays surrounding the cover artwork, ''Tommy'' was released on 17 May 1969 in the US by [[Decca Records|Decca]] and 23 May in the UK by [[Track Records]].<ref>{{harvnb|Neill|Kent|2002|p=232}}; {{harvnb|Atkins|2000|p=282}}.</ref> The original double album was configured with sides 1 and 4 on one disc, and sides 2 and 3 on the other, to accommodate [[record changers]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}}\n\nThe album was commercially successful, reaching No. 2 in the UK album charts, and No. 4 in the US.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=232}} It sold 200,000 copies in the first two weeks in the US alone, and was awarded a gold record for sales of 500,000 on August 18.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}}  \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", \"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" and \"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\" were released as singles and received airplay on the radio. \"Pinball Wizard\" reached the top 20 in the US and the top five in the UK. \"See Me, Feel Me\" reached the top 20 in the US and \"I'm Free\" reached the top 40. An [[Extended play|EP]] of selections from the album was planned to be released in the UK in November 1970, but was withdrawn.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=421}} As of 2012, ''Tommy'' has sold 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\"/><ref name=\"Perry\"/>\n\nWhen it was released, critics were split between those who thought the album was a masterpiece, the beginnings of a new genre, and those that felt it was exploitative. The album had a hostile reception with the [[BBC]] and certain US radio stations, with [[Tony Blackburn]] describing \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" as \"distasteful\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}} Nevertheless, [[BBC Radio 1]] received an advance copy of the album at the start of May and gave the material its first airplay on [[Pete Drummond]]'s show on 3 May.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} Townshend promoted the album's release with interviews in which he attempted to explain the plotline. Unfortunately, because it fundamentally dealt with the abstract concept of [[Meher Baba|Maher Baba]]'s spiritual precepts, the interviews often gave confusing and contradictory details.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=330}}\n\nFor ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[Chris Welch]] went to the album's press launch show at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott's]] and although the volume left his ears ringing for 20 hours, he concluded \"we wanted more.\" ''[[Disc and Music Echo]]'' ran a front-page headline saying \"Who's Tommy: A Masterpiece\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}} Critics and fans were confused by the storyline, but [[Kit Lambert]] pointed out this made ''Tommy'' no less confusing than the operas of [[Richard Wagner]] or [[Giacomo Puccini]] a century earlier.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=329}} In a 1969 column for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said that, apart from the Mothers of Invention's ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', ''Tommy'' is the first successful \"extended work\" in [[rock music]], but Townshend's parodic side is more \"profound and equivocal\" than [[Frank Zappa]]. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that he is determined to \"give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=12 June 1969|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/who-69.php|title=Whooopee!|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> [[Albert Goldman]], writing in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, said that the Who play through \"all the kinky complications\" of the narrative in a [[hard rock]] style that is the antithesis of most contemporary \"serious\" rock.

instead was \"dominated by the Who's mature style: ponderous, rhythmically monotonous [[hard rock]]\".<ref name=\"Bayles\">{{cite

\"concoctions\" of the time because of the cultural climate during the late 1960s: \"''Tommy'' was considered more authentic, precisely because it consists of hard rock, rather than doctored-up [[Mussorgsky]]&nbsp;... and avoids the typical pseudoromantic themes of art rock (fairy-tale bliss and apocalyptic angst) in favor of the more up-to-date subject of [[popular culture]] itself.\"<ref name=\"Bayles\"/> ''[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]'' magazine also characterized the Who's album as a \"reasonably hard-rock version\" of the opera.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|High Fidelity]]|page=418|volume=23|title=Tommy|date=June 1973|issue=6}}</ref>\n\n[[Dave Marsh]] thought the problem with the album's narrative is that there isn't enough transitional material provided by the lyrics. There are no stage directions, no cast, and narration is restricted to key phrases (such as \"Tommy can you hear me?\"){{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=330}} Key problems included an unclear explanation of what Tommy didn't hear or see in \"1921\", how or why he plays pinball, why \"Smash the Mirror\" leads into \"I overwhelm as I approach you\" (the opening line in \"Sensation\"), why Tommy tells his followers in \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" they cannot drink or smoke but can play pinball, and what the \"you\" is in \"Listening to you, I get the music\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=332}}\n\n==Editions and cover art==\n\n===Original edition===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = I liked the \u2018idea\u2019 of the Tommy character.

As recording was near completion, McInnerney received a number of cassettes with completed songs and a brief outline for the story, which he immediately recognised as being based on Baba's teachings.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=336}} He wanted to try and convey the world of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and decided to \"depict a kind of breaking out of a certain restricted plane into freedom.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=337}} The finished cover contained a blue and white web of clouds, a fist punching into the black void to the left of it.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The inside cover depicts a wall with wall lights as a symbol of domestic space.

The final step was for record company approval from Polydor, making one concession that pictures of the band should appear on the cover.

The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the [[Hanwell Community Centre]] in [[Ealing]] including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}} The running order was changed, and four songs (\"Cousin Kevin\", \"Underture\", \"Sensation\" and \"Welcome\") were dropped entirely.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} Townshend later said the group \"did the whole thing from start to finish and ''that'' was when we first realized we had something cohesive and playable.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=339}} Roger Daltrey's voice had improved substantially since the group's early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}}\n\nAfter a few warm up gigs towards the end of April,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} the group gave a preview concert to the press at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]], London on 1 May. Realising the opera's narrative was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played ''Tommy'' all the way through at full stage volume.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}} The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the [[Grande Ballroom]], [[Detroit]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} At the end of May, the group played four nights at the [[Kinetic Playground]], [[Chicago]], and they noticed the audience would all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of ''Tommy'' had a significant positive response.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=343}}\n\nThe group continued to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter [[Frank Barsalona]], and generally avoided festivals,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=346}} but made an important exception with the [[Woodstock]] festival on 16 August. After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=348}} The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", [[Abbie Hoffman]] took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]] before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during \"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\", the sun rose, almost as if on cue.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=350}} Two weeks later, the group played the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|second Isle of Wight Festival]], using one of the largest live [[Public address system|PAs]] available.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=239}} Though media attention was on [[Bob Dylan]] playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show. Townshend later said, \"We know that the stage act we had, with ''Tommy'' in it, would work under any circumstances, because it had worked many times on tour.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=240}}\n\n[[File:Metropolitan Opera 2.jpg|thumb|By 1970, ''Tommy'' had achieved sufficient critical acclaim to be performed live in the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]].]]\n''Tommy'' remained in the Who's live set through the rest of the year and into 1970. In October 1969, the Who played six shows at the [[Fillmore East]], where [[Leonard Bernstein]] praised them for their new music.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=241\u2013242}} The group's show on 14 December at the [[London Coliseum]] was filmed for a possible future ''Tommy'' feature.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=243}} Lambert was keen for ''Tommy'' to be taken seriously and wanted the Who to perform at [[opera house]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bill Graham Presents: My Life Inside Rock and Out|first=Bill|last=Graham|first2=Robert|last2=greenfield|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=1922|p=321|isbn=978-0-306-81349-8}}</ref> In June 1970, the group performed two shows at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], which was the first time Townshend announced the show as being the \"last ''Tommy'' ever\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=353}} The group made a second trip to the Isle of Wight, appearing at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 festival]] on 29 August, before an audience of 600,000.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} The last live performance for 1970 was at [[The Roundhouse]], London on 20 December. Townshend said \"This is the very last time we'll play ''Tommy'' on stage\", to which Keith Moon promptly cried, \"Thank Christ for that!\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=271}}\n\nPublic reaction to the Who's concerts that included ''Tommy'' was overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album in the public eye, and cleared the band's debts.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=137}} Several live recordings of ''Tommy'' from the Who's 1969\u201370 tours have been released. A complete performance is available on the 2002 ''Deluxe Edition'' of the live album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'', recorded on 14 February 1970. The second Isle of Wight performance is available on ''Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970'', released in 1996.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} The Coliseum Theatre gig is available on the 2007 video release ''[[At Kilburn 1977 + Live at the Coliseum]]''. Portions of the Woodstock performance of ''Tommy'' were released on the documentaries ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' and ''[[The Kids Are Alright (film)|The Kids Are Alright]]''.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=127\u2013128}} The complete show was recorded, but has never been officially released.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=128}}\n \nThe Who continued to play a smaller selection of ''Tommy'' live in subsequent tours throughout the 1970s.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=391}} They revived ''Tommy'' as a whole for its twentieth anniversary during their 1989 reunion tour, reinstating the previously overlooked \"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Sensation\", but still omitting \"Underture\" and \"Welcome\". Recordings from this tour can be found on the ''[[Join Together (1990 album)|Join Together]]'' live album and the ''[[Tommy and Quadrophenia Live]]'' [[DVD]]. The Los Angeles version of this show featured [[Phil Collins]] as Uncle Ernie, [[Patti LaBelle]] as the Acid Queen, [[Steve Winwood]] as the Hawker, [[Elton John]] as the Pinball Wizard, and [[Billy Idol]] as Cousin Kevin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-featuring-rock-opera-tommy-mw0000267855|title=Live:Featuring Rock Opera Tommy|website=AllMusic|accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"jointogether\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/join-together-mw0000206482|title=''Join Together''&nbsp;\u2013 The Who|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|website=AllMusic|accessdate=27 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Other incarnations==\n\n===1970 Les Grands Ballets Canadiens ===\nIn 1970 Ferdinand Nault of the Montreal [[ballet]] group [[Les Grands Ballets Canadiens]] created the first dance-based adaptation of ''Tommy''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/les-grands-ballets-canadiens-de-montreal/|title=Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> The ballet performance toured New York in April 1971, which included a light show and accompanying films by the Quebec Film Bureau.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=199}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/09/arts/dance-ballets-canadiens.html|title=Fance: Ballets Canadiens|first=Anna|last=Kisselgoff|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 February 1981|accessdate=16 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1971 Seattle Opera production===\nIn 1971, the [[Seattle Opera]] under director [[Richard Pearlman]] produced the first ever fully staged professional production of ''Tommy'' at [[Seattle]]'s [[Moore Theatre]].

Russell insisted on having a known cast, though Townshend wanted people who could sing the material, and was particularly disappointed at not being allowed to cast [[Stevie Wonder]] as the Pinball Wizard.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=440}} In several cinemas, the film supported a [[multitrack recording|multi-track]] soundtrack billed as [[Tommy (1975 film)#Quintaphonic Sound|quintaphonic sound]], which placed speaker banks in the four quadrants of the house and directly behind the centre of the screen.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=369}}\n\nTownshend also oversaw the production of a [[Tommy (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], on which the unrecorded orchestral arrangements Kit Lambert had envisaged for the original ''Tommy'' LP were realised by the extensive use of [[synthesizer]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=442}} He started work on the soundtrack album immediately after the Who's 1973 US tour in December, and worked on it almost continuously for the next four months.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=440}} As well as the Who, the film's music track and the original soundtrack LP also employed several session musicians including [[Caleb Quaye]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Nicky Hopkins]], [[Chris Stainton]], and longtime Who associate [[John Bundrick|John \"Rabbit\" Bundrick]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=441}} Due to Keith Moon's commitments with the filming of ''[[Stardust (1974 film)|Stardust]]'', [[Kenney Jones]] (who would take over as the Who's drummer after Moon's death in 1978) played drums on much of the soundtrack album.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=344}}\n\n\"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" was a major hit when released as a single. This sequence in the film depicts [[Elton John]] being backed by the Who (dressed in pound-note suits); the band portrayed the Pinball Wizard's band for filming,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=350}} but on the music track and soundtrack album, the music was performed entirely by him and his regular touring band.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=441}} Most of the extras were students at [[University of Portsmouth|Portsmouth Polytechnic]] and were paid with tickets to a Who concert after filming wrapped.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=353}}\n\nThe film and its soundtrack album featured six new songs, all written by Townshend, and an alteration to the running order compared to the original album.

The album was mostly composed by guitarist [[Pete Townshend]], and is a [[rock opera]] that tells the story of Tommy Walker, a \"deaf, dumb and blind\" boy, including his experiences with life and his relationship with his family.\n\nTownshend came up with the concept of ''Tommy'' after being introduced to the work of [[Meher Baba]], and attempted to translate Baba's teachings into music. Recording on the album began in September 1968, but took six months to complete as material needed to be arranged and re-recorded in the studio. ''Tommy'' was acclaimed upon its release by critics, who hailed it as the Who's breakthrough. Its critical standing diminished slightly in later years; nonetheless, several writers view it as an important and influential album in the history of rock music. The Who promoted the album's release with an extensive tour, including a live version of ''Tommy'', which lasted throughout 1969 and 1970. Key gigs from the tour included appearances at [[Woodstock]], the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|1969 Isle of Wight Festival]], the [[University of Leeds]], the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]], and the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]]. The live performances of ''Tommy'' drew critical praise and rejuvenated the band's career.\n\nSubsequently, the rock opera developed into other media, including a [[Seattle Opera]] production in 1971, an orchestral version by [[Lou Reizner]] in 1972, a [[Tommy (1975 film)|film]] in 1975, and a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[The Who's Tommy|musical]] in 1992. The original album has sold 20 million copies and has been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]]. It has been reissued several times on CD, including a remix by [[Jon Astley]] in 1996, a deluxe [[Super Audio CD]] in 2003, and a super deluxe box set in 2013, including previously unreleased demos and live material.\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Tommy'' has never had a definitive plot, but the following synopsis was published following the original album's release.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=121}}\n\nBritish Army Captain Walker goes missing during an expedition and is believed dead (\"Overture\"). His wife, Mrs. Walker, gives birth to their son, Tommy (\"It's a Boy\"). Years later, Captain Walker returns home and discovers that his wife has found a new lover. The Captain murders this man in an [[altercation]]. Tommy's mother brainwashes him into believing he didn't see or hear anything, shutting down his senses and making him deaf, dumb and blind to the outside world (\"1921\"). Tommy now relies on his sense of touch and imagination, developing a fascinating inner [[psyche]] (\"[[Amazing Journey]]/Sparks\").{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nA [[quackery|quack]] claims his wife can cure Tommy (\"[[Eyesight to the Blind|The Hawker]]\"), while Tommy's parents are increasingly frustrated that he will never find religion in the midst of his isolation (\"Christmas\"). They begin to neglect him, leaving him to be tortured by his [[sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] \"Cousin Kevin\" and [[child molestation|molested]] by his uncle Ernie (\"Fiddle About\"). The Hawker's drug addicted wife, \"[[The Acid Queen]]\", gives Tommy a dose of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], causing a [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogenic]] experience that is expressed musically (\"Underture\").{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAs Tommy grows older, he discovers that he can feel vibrations sufficiently well to become an expert [[pinball]] player (\"[[Pinball Wizard]]\"). His parents take him to a respected doctor (\"There's a Doctor\"), who determines that the boy's disabilities are [[Psychosomatic Illness|psychosomatic]] rather than physical. Tommy is told by the Doctor to \"[[Go to the Mirror!]]\", and his parents notice he can stare at his reflection. After seeing Tommy spend extended periods staring at a mirror in the house, his mother smashes it out of frustration (\"Smash the Mirror\"). This removes Tommy's [[mental block]], and he recovers his senses, realising he can become a powerful leader (\"Sensation\"). He starts a religious movement (\"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\"), which generates fervor among its adherents (\"Sally Simpson\") and expands into a [[holiday camp]] (\"Welcome\" / \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\"). However, Tommy's followers ultimately reject his teachings and leave the camp (\"[[We're Not Gonna Take It (The Who song)|We're Not Gonna Take It]]\"). Tommy retreats inward again (\"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\") with his \"continuing statement of wonder at that which encompasses him\".{{sfn|Atkins|2000|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n==Background==\nTownshend had been looking at ways of progressing beyond the standard three-minute pop single format since 1966.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=214}} Co-manager [[Kit Lambert]] shared Townshend's views and encouraged him to develop musical ideas,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=215}} coming up with the term \"[[rock opera]]\". The first use of the term was applied to a suite called \"Quads\", set in a future where parents could choose the sex of their children. A couple want four girls but instead receive three girls and a boy, raising him as a girl anyway. The opera was abandoned after writing a single song, the hit single, \"[[I'm a Boy]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=217}} When the Who's second album, ''[[A Quick One]]'' ran short of material during recording, Lambert suggested that Townshend should write a \"mini-opera\" to fill the gap. Townshend initially objected, but eventually agreed to do so, coming up with \"[[A Quick One, While He's Away]]\", which joined short pieces of music together into a continuous narrative.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=227}} During 1967, Townshend learned how to play the [[piano]] and began writing songs on it, taking his work more seriously.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=283}} That year's ''[[The Who Sell Out]]'' included a mini-opera in the last track, \"Rael\", which like \"A Quick One...\" was a suite of musical segments joined together.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=282, 283}}\n\n{{quotebox|width=50%|quote=The package I hope is going to be called ''\"Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy.\"'' It's a story about a kid that's born deaf, dumb and blind and what happens to him throughout his life&nbsp;... But what it's really all about is the fact that&nbsp;... he's seeing things basically as vibrations which we translate as music. That's really what we want to do: create this feeling that when you listen to the music you can actually become aware of the boy, and aware of what he is all about, because we are creating him as we play.\"|source=[[Pete Townshend]] talking to [[Jann Wenner]], August 1968{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=313,314}}}}\n\nBy 1968, Townshend was unsure about how the Who should progress musically. The group were no longer teenagers, but he wanted their music to remain relevant.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=293\u2013294}} His friend, ''[[International Times]]'' [[art director]] Mike McInnerney, told him about the Indian spiritual mentor [[Meher Baba]],{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=294}} and Townshend became fascinated with Baba's values of compassion, love and introspection.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=296}} The Who's commercial success was on the wane after the single \"Dogs\" failed to make the top 20, and there was a genuine risk of the band breaking up.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=308}} The group still performed well live and spent most of the spring and summer touring the US and Canada,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=190}} but their stage act relied on Townshend smashing his guitar or [[Keith Moon]] demolishing his drums, which kept the group in debt. Townshend and Kit Lambert realised they needed a larger vehicle for their music than hit singles and a new stage show, and Townshend hoped to incorporate his love of Meher Baba into this concept.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=309}} He decided that the Who should record a series of songs that stood well in isolation, but formed a cohesive whole on the album. He also wanted the material performed in concert, to counteract the trend of bands like [[The Beatles]] and [[The Beach Boys]], whose studio output was not designed for live performance.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=310}}\n\nIn August 1968, in an interview to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Townshend talked about a new rock opera, which had the working title of ''Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy'', and described the entire plot in great detail, which ran to 11 pages.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=313\u2013316}} The Who biographer [[Dave Marsh]] subsequently said the interview described the narrative better than the finished album.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=316}} Townshend later regretted publishing so much detail, as he felt it forced him to write the album according to that blueprint.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=191}} The rest of the Who, however, were enthusiastic about the idea, and let him have artistic control over the project.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=192}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe Who started recording the album at [[IBC Studios]] on 19 September 1968.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}} There was no firm title at this point, which was variously referred to as ''Deaf, Dumb and Blind Boy'', ''Amazing Journey'', ''Journey into Space'', ''The Brain Opera'' and ''Omnibus''. Townshend eventually settled on ''Tommy'' because it was a common British name, and a nickname for soldiers in [[World War I]].{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=317}} Kit Lambert took charge of the production, with Damon Lyon-Shaw as engineer. Sessions were block booked from 2pm \u2013 10pm, but recording often spilled over into the early morning. {{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}}\n\nThe album was recorded onto [[8-track tape|eight track tape]], which allowed various instruments to be [[overdubbed]]. Townshend used several guitars in the studio, but made particular use of the [[Gibson J-200]] acoustic and the [[Gibson SG]].<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\">{{cite news |url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/pinball-wizard-0305-2012.aspx |work=Gibson Guitars |title=Pinball Wizard: Pete Townshend Finds His Signature Guitar Sound |first=Ted |last=Drozdowski |date=3 May 2012 |accessdate=9 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419095036/http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Features/en-us/pinball-wizard-0305-2012.aspx |archive-date=19 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As well as their usual instruments, Townshend played [[piano]] and [[Hammond organ|organ]] and bassist [[John Entwistle]] doubled on [[french horn]]. [[Keith Moon]] used a new double bass drum kit owned by roadie Tony Haslam, after [[Premier Percussion|Premier]] had refused to loan him any more equipment due to continual abuse.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=210}} Though Townshend wrote the majority of the material, the arrangements came from the entire band. Singer [[Roger Daltrey]] later said that Townshend often came in with a half-finished [[demo recording]], adding \"we probably did as much talking as we did recording, sorting out arrangements and things.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=219}} Townshend asked Entwistle to write two songs (\"Cousin Kevin\" and \"Fiddle About\") that covered the darker themes of bullying and abuse. \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\" was Keith Moon's suggestion of what kind of religious movement Tommy could lead. Moon got the songwriting credit for suggesting the idea, though the music was composed and played by Townshend.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}}  A significant amount of material had a lighter style than earlier recordings, with greater prominence put on the vocals. Moon later said, \"It was, at the time, very un-Wholike. A lot of the songs were soft. We never played like that.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=220}}\n\nSome of the material had already been written for other projects. \"Sensation\" was written about a girl Townshend had met on the Who's tour of Australia in early 1968, \"Welcome\" and \"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" were about peace found through [[Meher Baba]] and \"Sally Simpson\" was based on a gig with [[the Doors]] which was marred by violence.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|pp=316, 318}} Other songs had been previously recorded by the Who and were recycled; \"It's A Boy\" was derived from \"Glow Girl\", an out-take from [[The Who Sell Out|''The Who Sell Out'',]] while \"Sparks\" and \"Underture\" re-used and expanded one of the instrumental themes in \"Rael\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} \"Amazing Journey\" was, according to Townshend, \"the absolute beginning\" of the opera and summarised the entire plot.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=318}} \"The Hawker\" was a cover of [[Sonny Boy Williamson]]'s \"Eyesight to the Blind\". A cover of [[Mercy Dee Walton]]'s \"One Room Country Shack\" was also recorded but was scrapped from the final track listing as Townshend could not figure out a way to incorporate it in the plot.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=114}}\n\nRecording at [[IBC Studios|IBC]] was slow, due to a lack of a full plot and a full selection of songs. The group hoped that the album would be ready by Christmas, but sessions dragged on. ''[[Melody Maker]]''{{'}}s [[Chris Welch]] visited IBC studios in November and while he was impressed with the working environment and the material,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=321}} the project still did not have a title and there was no coherent plotline.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=323}} The Who's US record company, [[Decca Records]], got so impatient waiting for new product that they released the compilation album ''[[Magic Bus: The Who on Tour]]'' which received a scathing review from Greil Marcus in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' over its poor selection of material and misleading name (as the album contained studio recordings and was not live).{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=319,320}}\n\nThe Who took a break from recording at the end of 1968 to tour, including a well received appearance at ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 10 December.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=216}} They resumed sessions at IBC in January 1969, block booking Monday to Thursday, but had to do gigs every weekend to stop going further into debt.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} A major tour was booked for the end of April, and the group's management insisted that the album would have to be finished by then, as it had been well over a year since ''[[The Who Sell Out]]''.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}} Kit Lambert wrote a script, ''Tommy (1914\u20131984)'' which he professionally printed, and gave copies to the band, which helped them focus the storyline, and also decide to make the album a double.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=324}} The group were still coming up with new material; Lambert insisted that the piece should have a proper overture,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}} while Townshend wrote \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" so that [[Nik Cohn]], a pinball fan, would give the album a favourable review in the ''[[New York Times]]''.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=221}} Lambert wanted an orchestra to appear on the album, but Townshend was strongly against the idea, and time and budget constraints meant it could not happen anyway.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=325}}\n\nBy March 1969, some songs had been recorded several times, yet Townshend still thought there were missing pieces.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=327}} [[John Entwistle]] had become fed up with recording, later saying \"we had to keep going back and rejuvenating the numbers&nbsp;... it just started to drive us mad.\"<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\"/> The final recording session took place on 7 March, the same day that \"Pinball Wizard\" was released as a single.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=227, 228}} The group started tour rehearsals and promotional activities for the single and Lambert went on holiday in [[Cairo]]. The mixing was left to Damon Lyon-Shaw and assistant engineer Ted Sharp, who did not think [[IBC Studios|IBC]] was well suited for the task.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=228}} The album overshot its April deadline, as stereo [[Mastering (audio)|mastering]] continued into the end of the month.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}}\n\n==Release and reception==\nAfter delays surrounding the cover artwork, ''Tommy'' was released on 17 May 1969 in the US by [[Decca Records|Decca]] and 23 May in the UK by [[Track Records]].<ref>{{harvnb|Neill|Kent|2002|p=232}}; {{harvnb|Atkins|2000|p=282}}.</ref> The original double album was configured with sides 1 and 4 on one disc, and sides 2 and 3 on the other, to accommodate [[record changers]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}}\n\nThe album was commercially successful, reaching No. 2 in the UK album charts, and No. 4 in the US.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=232}} It sold 200,000 copies in the first two weeks in the US alone, and was awarded a gold record for sales of 500,000 on August 18.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}}  \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", \"[[I'm Free (The Who song)|I'm Free]]\" and \"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\" were released as singles and received airplay on the radio. \"Pinball Wizard\" reached the top 20 in the US and the top five in the UK. \"See Me, Feel Me\" reached the top 20 in the US and \"I'm Free\" reached the top 40. An [[Extended play|EP]] of selections from the album was planned to be released in the UK in November 1970, but was withdrawn.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=421}} As of 2012, ''Tommy'' has sold 20 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"www2.gibson.com\"/><ref name=\"Perry\"/>\n\nWhen it was released, critics were split between those who thought the album was a masterpiece, the beginnings of a new genre, and those that felt it was exploitative. The album had a hostile reception with the [[BBC]] and certain US radio stations, with [[Tony Blackburn]] describing \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\" as \"distasteful\".{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}} Nevertheless, [[BBC Radio 1]] received an advance copy of the album at the start of May and gave the material its first airplay on [[Pete Drummond]]'s show on 3 May.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} Townshend promoted the album's release with interviews in which he attempted to explain the plotline. Unfortunately, because it fundamentally dealt with the abstract concept of [[Meher Baba|Maher Baba]]'s spiritual precepts, the interviews often gave confusing and contradictory details.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=330}}\n\nFor ''[[Melody Maker]]'', [[Chris Welch]] went to the album's press launch show at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott's]] and although the volume left his ears ringing for 20 hours, he concluded \"we wanted more.\" ''[[Disc and Music Echo]]'' ran a front-page headline saying \"Who's Tommy: A Masterpiece\".{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}} Critics and fans were confused by the storyline, but [[Kit Lambert]] pointed out this made ''Tommy'' no less confusing than the operas of [[Richard Wagner]] or [[Giacomo Puccini]] a century earlier.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=329}} In a 1969 column for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', music critic [[Robert Christgau]] said that, apart from the Mothers of Invention's ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', ''Tommy'' is the first successful \"extended work\" in [[rock music]], but Townshend's parodic side is more \"profound and equivocal\" than [[Frank Zappa]]. He praised Townshend for deliberately constructing the album so that each song can be enjoyed individually and felt that he is determined to \"give his audience what it wants without burying his own peculiarity\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=12 June 1969|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/who-69.php|title=Whooopee!|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=3 July 2013}}</ref> [[Albert Goldman]], writing in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, said that the Who play through \"all the kinky complications\" of the narrative in a [[hard rock]] style that is the antithesis of most contemporary \"serious\" rock.

\"concoctions\" of the time because of the cultural climate during the late 1960s: \"''Tommy'' was considered more authentic, precisely because it consists of hard rock, rather than doctored-up

As recording was near completion, McInnerney received a number of cassettes with completed songs and a brief outline for the story, which he immediately recognised as being based on Baba's teachings.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=336}} He wanted to try and convey the world of a deaf, dumb and blind boy, and decided to \"depict a kind of breaking out of a certain restricted plane into freedom.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=337}} The finished cover contained a blue and white web of clouds, a fist punching into the black void to the left of it.\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The inside cover depicts a wall with wall lights as a symbol of domestic space.

The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the [[Hanwell Community Centre]] in [[Ealing]] including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}} The running order was changed, and four songs (\"Cousin Kevin\", \"Underture\", \"Sensation\" and \"Welcome\") were dropped entirely.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} Townshend later said the group \"did the whole thing from start to finish and ''that'' was when we first realized we had something cohesive and playable.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=339}} Roger Daltrey's voice had improved substantially since the group's early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=230}}\n\nAfter a few warm up gigs towards the end of April,{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} the group gave a preview concert to the press at [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club]], London on 1 May. Realising the opera's narrative was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played ''Tommy'' all the way through at full stage volume.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=340}} The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the [[Grande Ballroom]], [[Detroit]].{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=231}} At the end of May, the group played four nights at the [[Kinetic Playground]], [[Chicago]], and they noticed the audience would all stand up at the same time, and stay standing. This indicated that live performances of ''Tommy'' had a significant positive response.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=343}}\n\nThe group continued to play large halls in the US, organised by tour promoter [[Frank Barsalona]], and generally avoided festivals,{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=346}} but made an important exception with the [[Woodstock]] festival on 16 August. After spending all night arguing with Barsalona, the band agreed to perform at Woodstock for $12,500.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=348}} The festival ran late and the Who did not take to the stage until the early morning of 17 August. During \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\", [[Abbie Hoffman]] took to the stage to protest about the imprisonment of [[John Sinclair (poet)|John Sinclair]] before being kicked offstage by Townshend, while during \"[[See Me, Feel Me]]\", the sun rose, almost as if on cue.{{sfn|Marsh|1983|p=350}} Two weeks later, the group played the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1969|second Isle of Wight Festival]], using one of the largest live [[Public address system|PAs]] available.{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|pp=239}} Though media attention was on [[Bob Dylan]] playing his first major live concert since 1966, the Who stole the show. Townshend later said, \"We know that the stage act we had, with ''Tommy'' in it, would work under any circumstances, because it had worked many times on tour.\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=240}}\n\n[[File:Metropolitan Opera 2.jpg|thumb|By 1970, ''Tommy'' had achieved sufficient critical acclaim to be performed live in the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]].]]\n''Tommy'' remained in the Who's live set through the rest of the year and into 1970.

Townshend said \"This is the very last time we'll play ''Tommy'' on stage\", to which Keith Moon promptly cried, \"Thank Christ for that!\"{{sfn|Neill|Kent|2002|p=271}}\n\nPublic reaction to the Who's concerts that included ''Tommy'' was overwhelmingly positive. The touring helped keep the album in the public eye, and cleared the band's debts.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=137}} Several live recordings of ''Tommy'' from the Who's 1969\u201370 tours have been released. A complete performance is available on the 2002 ''Deluxe Edition'' of the live album ''[[Live at Leeds]]'', recorded on 14 February 1970. The second Isle of Wight performance is available on ''Live at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970'', released in 1996.{{sfn|Atkins|2000|p=136}} The Coliseum Theatre gig is available on the 2007 video release ''[[At Kilburn 1977 + Live at the Coliseum]]''.

Recordings from this tour can be found on the ''[[Join Together (1990 album)|Join Together]]'' live album and the ''[[Tommy and Quadrophenia Live]]'' [[DVD]].
