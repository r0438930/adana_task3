It is unknown whether any previous inhabitants of the area were aware of the natural cave opening, which was not large enough for a person to enter.<ref name=\"brochure\">Jewel Cave brochure; National Park Service; GPO, WDC</ref>\n\nAfter enlarging the cave entrance with dynamite, the Michaud brothers found a cavern lined with [[calcite]] crystals, which led them to name it \"Jewel Cave\".  The brothers tried to capitalize on the discovery, widening the opening, building walkways inside, and opening it to tourists. Although their venture was unsuccessful, news of the discovery eventually reached Washington. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] proclaimed Jewel Cave a National Monument on February&nbsp;7, 1908. The area around the natural entrance to the cave was further developed by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] in the 1930s. The [[National Park Service]] assumed management of the monument in 1933 and began offering tours in 1939.<ref name=\"brochure\" />\n\n[[File:Herb and Jan Conn.jpg|thumb|right|Jan and Herb Conn]]\nAs recently as 1959, less than {{convert|2|mi|km|sp=us}} of passageway had been discovered. That year, however, [[Herb and Jan Conn]], local rock climbers, began exploring, and within two years had mapped {{convert|15|mi|km|sp=us}}. Much of the new discoveries lay outside the boundaries of the monument, under land managed by the [[United States Forest Service]]. The two agencies performed a land swap in 1965, establishing the present boundaries of the park, and enabling the development of a new part of the cave. The Park Service sunk a {{convert|300|ft|m|sp=us}} elevator shaft to a previously remote cave area, and built concrete walks and metal stairs and platforms along a one-half-mile loop. The \"Scenic Tour\" was opened in 1972. Most modern-day visitors tour that part of the cave.  \nIn August 2000, an {{convert|83000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} [[forest fire]] burned 90% of the monument and the surrounding area. The [[visitor center]] and historic buildings were spared.\n\n==Exploration==\n[[File:US National Park marker for the Black Hills geology.jpg|thumb|Location of the cave with respect to regional Black Hills geology]]\nBy 1979, [[Herb and Jan Conn]] had discovered, named, and mapped more than  {{convert|64|mi|km|sp=us}} of passages. Although they largely retired from caving by the early 1980s, exploration has continued unabated. Because the areas being explored take many hours to reach, explorers now sometimes camp in the cave during expeditions of as long as four days. The cave is mapped by traditional survey techniques, using [[compass]], [[clinometer]] and today with lasers instead of tape measures.<ref name=\"brochure\" />\n\nIts {{convert|198.00|mi|km|abbr=on}} of mapped passageway make Jewel Cave the third longest cave in the world, after [[Mammoth Cave]] System in Kentucky and [[Sistema Sac Actun]] at the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] ([[Mexico]]), at {{convert|198|mi|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"JECA\" />\n\nThe discovered areas in the cave account for only about 3 to 5% of the estimated total air volume of the cave.
