CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music or [[audiobook]]s. CD players may be part of home [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] systems, [[car audio]] systems, [[personal computer]]s, or [[portable CD player]]s such as CD [[boombox]]es. Most CD players produce an output signal via a [[headphone]] jack or [[RCA jack]]s. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable from the RCA jacks to a [[hi-fi]] (or other [[power amplifier|amplifier]]) and [[loudspeaker]]s for listening to music.  To listen to music using a CD player with a headphone output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack. \n\nModern units can play audio formats other than the original CD [[Pulse Code Modulation|PCM]] audio coding, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. [[DJ]]s playing [[dance music]] at clubs often use specialized players with an adjustable playback speed to alter the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of the music. [[Audio engineer]]s using CD players to play music for an event through a [[sound reinforcement system]] use professional audio-grade CD players. CD playback functionality is also available on CD-ROM/DVD-ROM drive equipped computers as well as on [[DVD player]]s and most optical disc-based [[game console]]s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:CDP101a.jpg|thumb|[[Sony CDP-101]], from 1982, the first commercially released [[CD]] player for [[consumer]]s]]\n[[File:JVC CD player.JPG|thumb|right|A [[JVC]] FS-SD5R CD player from the 1990s with a transparent plastic cover]]\nAmerican inventor [[James Russell (inventor)|James T.

Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.\n\nBy the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player.<ref name=nyt20120718>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/automobiles/06AUDIO.html|title=For Car Cassette Decks, Play Time Is Over|last=Williams|first=Stephen|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012 }}</ref> Currently, with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nSome CD players incorporate disc changers.

As of 2020, compact cassettes, vinyl records, and CDs are still being released by some musicians, primarily as merchandise, to allow fans to provide financial support while receiving something tangible in return.\n\n==Inner workings==\nThe process of playing an audio CD, touted as a digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc, a medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray which either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a [[laser]] beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The tracking control is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.<ref>ISO/IEC Standard 60908</ref>\n\n===Analogue signal recovery from the disc===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Philips RAFOC CD Optical tracking device..png|thumb|Photodiode array on the Philips RAFOC single-beam tracking optical device used in many CDM optical assemblies]]\nTo read the data from the disc, a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc. Surface differences between discs being played, and tiny position differences once loaded, are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc. A low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] wide data track.\n\nWhen the player tries to read from a stop, it first does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down from the surface of the disc until a reflection is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.\n\nDifferent brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north-south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.<ref>Egon Strauss - Compact Disc, Digital storage medium, Ed. Quark 1998</ref>\n\nAnother servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.\n\nTwo optical pick-up designs exists, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre.\n\nThe other design by Sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams. When focused, the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four. The servo detects the RF signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track. The tracking signal is fed to two systems, one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps.\n\nThe sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the RF or high frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc. The RF signal, when observed on an oscilloscope, has a characteristic \"fish-eye\" pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems, and calibrating CD players for operation.\n\n===Digital signal processing===\nThe first stage in the processing chain for the analog RF signal (from the photoreceptor device) is digitizing it. Using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer, the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values, 1 and 0. This signal carries all the information in a CD and is modulated using a system called [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFM]] (Eight-to-fourteen modulation). The second stage is demodulating the EFM signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples, error correction parity bits, according with the [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|CIRC]] error correction code, and control data for the player display and micro-computer.\nThe EFM demodulator also decodes part of the CD signal and routes it to the proper circuits, separating audio, parity and control (subcode) data.\n\nAfter demodulating, a CIRC error corrector takes each audio data frame, stores it in a [[Shadow Random Access Memory|SRAM]] memory and verifies that it has been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability. If too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable, the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation, so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.\n\nThe Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.\n\n===Player control===\nThe Audio CD format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the CD data; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs do not work by themselves, however; they require a main microcomputer or [[microcontroller]] to orchestrate the entire machine.\n\n==Tray design types==\n\n===Tray loading===\n[[File:Vintagedenon.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1980s-era [[Denon]] CD player with the chassis cover removed to show the electronic and mechanical components.]]\n\n[[Sony]] released its [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]] CD player<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/history/sony-dp-101.html | title = CDP-101 The first Compact Disc Audio CD Player from 1982 | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the CD.

Although the Sony prototype design was never put into volume production, the concept was for a time adopted for production by a number of early Japanese CD player manufacturers, including [[Luxman|Alpine/Luxman]], [[Panasonic Corporation|Matsushita]] under the [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] brand, [[Kenwood Corporation|Kenwood]] and [[Toshiba|Toshiba/Aurex]]. For the early vertical loading players, Alpine sourced their AD-7100 player designs for Luxman,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thevintageknob.org/DAD/DX104/DX104.html | title = Luxman DX-104 CD Player | language = | accessdate = 2007-02-17 | year = 2007}}</ref> Kenwood and Toshiba (using their Aurex brand).

The holder is closed manually by hand, by motor after pressing a button, or completely automatically. Some CD players combine vertical loading with slot loading due the disc being drawn further into the disc holder as it closes.\n\n===Top loading===\n[[File:Philips CD 100.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Philips CD100 Player]]\n\nIn 1983 [[Philips]], at the US and European launch of the CD format, showcased the first top loading CD tray designs with their CD100 CD player.<ref>[http://www.marantzphilips.nl/philips_cd100_first_cdplayer/ Philips CD100 Player\"] - Marantz-Philips Nederlands website</ref><ref>[http://www.research.philips.com/technologies/projects/cd/introduction.html \"The history of the CD - The introduction\"], Philips Research.</ref> (Philips audio products were sold as [[Magnavox]] in the US at the time.) The design had a clamp on the lid which meant the user had to close this over the CD when it was placed inside the machine. Later, [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]] introduced their MCD \"high end\" CD player,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |title=Meridian CD History |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204043147/http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |archivedate=2007-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Meridian electronics in the Philips CD100 chassis.\n\nTop-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable CD players, but among stereo component CD players, only a handful of top-loading models have been made.

They more closely mimic the physical arrangement and ergonomics of record turntables used in those applications.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Tray loading with sliding mechanism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe Philips CD303 of 1983-1984 was the first player to adopt tray loading with a sliding play mechanism. Basically as the tray came out to collect the CD, the entire player's transport system also came out as one unit. The [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]]s 200 and 203 players were of this type. They were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the CD drive and pickup mechanism. A similar mechanism is used in slim optical disc drives (also known as slim internal DVD drive, optical drive or DVD burner),  which were once commonly used in laptop computers.\n\n===Slot loading===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nSlot loading is the preferred loading mechanism for car audio players. There is no tray that pops out, and a motor is used to assist disc insertion and removal. Some slot-loading mechanisms and changers can load and play back [[Mini CD|Mini-CDs]] without the need of an adapter but they may work with limited functionality (A disc changer will refuse to operate the changer until the Mini CD is removed for example).\n[[Shaped Compact Disc|Non-circular CDs]] cannot be used on such loaders because they cannot handle non-circular discs. When inserted, such discs may become stuck and damage the mechanism. It is also used on some laptop computers, the [[PlayStation 3 models|Playstation 3 original and Playstation 3 Slim]], all variants of the [[PlayStation 4]], in the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]], and in the [[Xbox One]].\n\n==Pickup mechanisms==\n[[File:Optical Deck Bottom.jpg|thumb|left|Underside view showing a radial-type tracking mechanism with screw drive]]\n[[File:Philips CDM4 Swing Arm CD mechanism.jpg|thumb|Philips swing arm optical mechanism]]\n[[File:cdchip.jpg|thumb|The optical chip extracted from a CD player. The three dark rectangles are photosensitive, read the data from the disk and keep the beam focused. Electronic tracking, aided with the two photodiodes at the sides, keeps the laser beam centered on the middle of the data track.]]\nTwo types of optical tracking mechanisms exist:\n* The '''swing-arm mechanism''', originally designed by Philips<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siber-sonic.com/audio/swingarm.html |title=Swing-arm mechanism description |publisher=Siber-sonic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 the lens moves at the end of an arm, in a manner similar to the tone arm assembly of a [[Phonograph|record player]]. Used in earliest Philips CD players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms.\n* The '''radial mechanism''', designed by Sony, which is the one used in most CD players in the 2000s \u2013 the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly. The motor or linear magnetic assembly consists of a solenoid mounted to the moving laser assembly, wound over a permanent magnetic field attached to the base of the mechanism. It is also known as three-beam linear tracking.\n[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Philips one-beam laser assembly]]\nThe swing-arm mechanism has a distinctive advantage over the other in that it does not \"skip\" when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a [[hard drive]] moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.\nThis mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.<ref>Philips CD100 Service Manual</ref>\n\n[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp laser optical assembly. All six focusing and tracking coils can be seen.]]\nThe linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer tracking motion. This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more \"helper\" [[photodiode]]s.<ref>Sony CDP-101 Service Manual</ref>\n\n==Mechanical components==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Dismantled Philips EXP2582 portable CD player.jpg|thumb|[[Philips]] Portable CD player disassembled]]\nA CD player has three major mechanical components : a '''drive motor''', a '''[[lens (optics)|lens]] system''' or pickup head, and a '''tracking mechanism'''.\nThe drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2\u20131.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]]) \u2013 equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a [[laser beam]], typically produced by a [[laser diode]]. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc's mirrored surface back to a [[photodiode]] array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed, and eventually converted to [[sound]] using a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).\n\nA TOC or Table of Contents is located after the \"lead-in\" area of the disc, which is located in an inner ring of the disc, and contains roughly five kilobytes of available space. It is the first information that the player reads when the disc is loaded in the player and contains information on the total number of audio tracks, the running time on the CD, the running time of each track, and other information such as ISRC and the format structure of the disc. The TOC is of such vital importance for the disc that if it is not read correctly by the player, the CD could not be played back. That is why it is repeated 3 times before the first music program starts. The \"lead out\" area in the end (the outer peripheral) of the disc tells the player that disc has come to an end.\n\n==CD player features==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nCD players can employ a number of ways to improve performance, or reduce component count or price. Features such as oversampling, one-bit DACs, dual DACs, interpolation (error correction), anti-skip buffering, digital and optical outputs are, or were, likely to be found. Other features improve functionality, such as track programming, random play and repeat, or direct track access. Yet others are related to the CD player's intended target, such as anti-skip for car and portable CD players, pitch control and queuing for a DJ's CD player, remote and system integration for household players. Description of some features follows:\n\n*''[[Oversampling]]'' is a way to improve the performance of the low pass filter present at the output of most CD players. By using a higher sampling frequency, a multiple of the 44.1&nbsp;kHz used by CD encoding, it can employ a filter with much lower requirements.\n*''[[Delta-sigma modulation#Digital to analog conversion|One-bit DACs]]'' were less expensive than other types of DACs, while providing similar performance.\n*''Dual DACs'' were sometimes advertised as a feature because some of the early CD players used a single DAC, and switched it between channels. This required additional supporting circuits, possibly degrading sound quality.\n*''Anti-skip or Antishock'', is a way for the CD player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism. It consists of an additional data processor and a [[RAM chip]] installed on the player that reads the disc at double speed and stores various frames of audio data in a RAM [[memory buffer]] for later decoding. Some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use lower capacity (and less expensive) RAM chips. Typical players can store about 44 seconds of audio data on a 16 mbit RAM chip.\n\n==Portable CD players==\n\n===Small portable players===\n[[File:Discman D121.jpg|thumb|upright|An early portable player, a [[Sony]] [[Discman]] model D-121]]\nA [[portable CD player]] is a [[portable audio player]] used to play [[compact disc]]s.

Beginning in the 1990s, boomboxes typically included a CD player. The boombox CD player is the only type of CD player which produces sound audible by the listener independently, without the need for [[headphones]] or an additional amplifier or speaker system. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the mid-1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a [[suitcase]]. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.<ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2009/04/22/103363836/a-eulogy-for-the-boombox|title=A Eulogy For The Boombox|date=22 April 2009|work=NPR.org|first=Frannie|last=Kelly|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a CD player compatible with [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]], which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium.

CD players were first sold to consumers in 1982. CDs typically contain recordings of audio material such as music or [[audiobook]]s. CD players may be part of home [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] systems, [[car audio]] systems, [[personal computer]]s, or [[portable CD player]]s such as CD [[boombox]]es. Most CD players produce an output signal via a [[headphone]] jack or [[RCA jack]]s. To use a CD player in a home stereo system, the user connects an RCA cable from the RCA jacks to a [[hi-fi]] (or other [[power amplifier|amplifier]]) and [[loudspeaker]]s for listening to music.  To listen to music using a CD player with a headphone output jack, the user plugs headphones or earphones into the headphone jack. \n\nModern units can play audio formats other than the original CD [[Pulse Code Modulation|PCM]] audio coding, such as [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. [[DJ]]s playing [[dance music]] at clubs often use specialized players with an adjustable playback speed to alter the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and tempo of the music. [[Audio engineer]]s using CD players to play music for an event through a [[sound reinforcement system]] use professional audio-grade CD players.

Other newer video formats such as [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] use the same physical geometry as CD, and most DVD and Blu-ray players are [[backward compatible]] with audio CD.\n\nBy the early 2000s, the CD player had largely replaced the [[Compact Cassette|audio cassette]] player as standard equipment in new automobiles, with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the US to have a factory-equipped cassette player.<ref name=nyt20120718>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/automobiles/06AUDIO.html|title=For Car Cassette Decks, Play Time Is Over|last=Williams|first=Stephen|newspaper=New York Times|date=4 February 2011|accessdate=18 July 2012 }}</ref> Currently, with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players, such as mobile phones, and solid state music storage, CD players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to USB devices.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nSome CD players incorporate disc changers.

As of 2020, compact cassettes, vinyl records, and CDs are still being released by some musicians, primarily as merchandise, to allow fans to provide financial support while receiving something tangible in return.\n\n==Inner workings==\nThe process of playing an audio CD, touted as a digital audio storage medium, starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc, a medium that contains the digitally encoded data. The disc is placed in a tray which either opens up (as with portable CD players) or slides out (the norm with in-home CD players, computer disc drives and game consoles). In some systems, the user slides the disc into a slot (e.g., car stereo CD players). Once the disc is loaded into the tray, the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a [[laser]] beam. An electric motor spins the disc. The tracking control is done by analogue servoamplifiers and then the high frequency analogue signal read from the disc is digitized, processed and decoded into analogue audio and digital control data which is used by the player to position the playback mechanism on the correct track, do the skip and seek functions and display track, time, index and, on newer players in the 2010s, display title and artist information on a display placed in the front panel.<ref>ISO/IEC Standard 60908</ref>\n\n===Analogue signal recovery from the disc===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Philips RAFOC CD Optical tracking device..png|thumb|Photodiode array on the Philips RAFOC single-beam tracking optical device used in many CDM optical assemblies]]\nTo read the data from the disc, a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc. Surface differences between discs being played, and tiny position differences once loaded, are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc. A low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600&nbsp;[[nanometer|nm]] wide data track.\n\nWhen the player tries to read from a stop, it first does a focus seek program that moves the lens up and down from the surface of the disc until a reflection is detected; when there is a reflection, the servo electronics lock in place keeping the lens in perfect focus while the disc rotates and changes its relative height from the optical block.\n\nDifferent brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection. On most players, the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes. The photodiode block and the optics are arranged in such a way that a perfect focus projects a circular pattern on the block while a far or near focus projects an ellipse differing in the position of the long edge in north-south or west-southwest. That difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation, even if the disc is warped.<ref>Egon Strauss - Compact Disc, Digital storage medium, Ed. Quark 1998</ref>\n\nAnother servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track.\n\nTwo optical pick-up designs exists, the original CDM series from Philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking. Using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block, the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre.\n\nThe other design by Sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams. When focused, the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few [[micrometre|micrometer]]s apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four. The servo detects the RF signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track. The tracking signal is fed to two systems, one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps.\n\nThe sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the RF or high frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc. The RF signal, when observed on an oscilloscope, has a characteristic \"fish-eye\" pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems, and calibrating CD players for operation.\n\n===Digital signal processing===\nThe first stage in the processing chain for the analog RF signal (from the photoreceptor device) is digitizing it. Using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer, the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values, 1 and 0. This signal carries all the information in a CD and is modulated using a system called [[Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation|EFM]] (Eight-to-fourteen modulation). The second stage is demodulating the EFM signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples, error correction parity bits, according with the [[Cross-interleaved Reed-Solomon coding|CIRC]] error correction code, and control data for the player display and micro-computer.\nThe EFM demodulator also decodes part of the CD signal and routes it to the proper circuits, separating audio, parity and control (subcode) data.\n\nAfter demodulating, a CIRC error corrector takes each audio data frame, stores it in a [[Shadow Random Access Memory|SRAM]] memory and verifies that it has been read correctly, if it is not, it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data, then it moves it out to a [[Digital-to-analog converter|DAC]] to be converted to an analog audio signal. If the data missing is enough to make recovery impossible, the correction is made by interpolating the data from subsequent frames so the missing part is not noticed. Each player has a different interpolation ability. If too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable, the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation, so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the DAC to avoid invalid data to be played back.\n\nThe Redbook standard dictates that, if there is invalid, erroneous or missing audio data, it cannot be output to the speakers as digital noise, it has to be muted.\n\n===Player control===\nThe Audio CD format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the CD data; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICs do not work by themselves, however; they require a main microcomputer or [[microcontroller]] to orchestrate the entire machine.\n\n==Tray design types==\n\n===Tray loading===\n[[File:Vintagedenon.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1980s-era [[Denon]] CD player with the chassis cover removed to show the electronic and mechanical components.]]\n\n[[Sony]] released its [[Sony CDP-101|CDP-101]] CD player<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cedmagic.com/history/sony-dp-101.html | title = CDP-101 The first Compact Disc Audio CD Player from 1982 | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the CD.

Later, [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]] introduced their MCD \"high end\" CD player,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |title=Meridian CD History |accessdate=2007-02-05 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204043147/http://www.meridian-audio.com/p_cd_history.htm |archivedate=2007-02-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with Meridian electronics in the Philips CD100 chassis.\n\nTop-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable CD players, but among stereo component CD players, only a handful of top-loading models have been made. Examples include [[Luxman]]'s D-500 and D-500X series<ref>{{cite web | url = http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | title = Luxman D-500X (in Japanese) | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070717004455/http://k-nisi.hp.infoseek.co.jp/d-500-xs.html | archive-date = 2007-07-17 | url-status = dead }}</ref> players and [[Denon]]'s DP-S1,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html | title = Denon Museum - Model History - 1993 - DP-S1 (in Japanese) | accessdate = 2007-02-05 | year = 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070204103139/http://denon.jp/museum/products/dps1.html | archive-date = 2007-02-04 | url-status = dead }}</ref> both launched in 1993.\nTop-loading is also common in players intended for broadcast and live sound \"DJ\" use, such as Technics' SL-P50 (1984\u20131985) and Technics SL-P1200 (1986\u20131992). They more closely mimic the physical arrangement and ergonomics of record turntables used in those applications.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Tray loading with sliding mechanism===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nThe Philips CD303 of 1983-1984 was the first player to adopt tray loading with a sliding play mechanism. Basically as the tray came out to collect the CD, the entire player's transport system also came out as one unit. The [[Meridian Audio, Ltd.|Meridian]]s 200 and 203 players were of this type. They were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the CD drive and pickup mechanism. A similar mechanism is used in slim optical disc drives (also known as slim internal DVD drive, optical drive or DVD burner),  which were once commonly used in laptop computers.\n\n===Slot loading===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nSlot loading is the preferred loading mechanism for car audio players. There is no tray that pops out, and a motor is used to assist disc insertion and removal. Some slot-loading mechanisms and changers can load and play back [[Mini CD|Mini-CDs]] without the need of an adapter but they may work with limited functionality (A disc changer will refuse to operate the changer until the Mini CD is removed for example).\n[[Shaped Compact Disc|Non-circular CDs]] cannot be used on such loaders because they cannot handle non-circular discs. When inserted, such discs may become stuck and damage the mechanism. It is also used on some laptop computers, the [[PlayStation 3 models|Playstation 3 original and Playstation 3 Slim]], all variants of the [[Playstation 4]], in the [[Wii]] and [[Wii U]], and in the [[Xbox One]].\n\n==Pickup mechanisms==\n[[File:Optical Deck Bottom.jpg|thumb|left|Underside view showing a radial-type tracking mechanism with screw drive]]\n[[File:Philips CDM4 Swing Arm CD mechanism.jpg|thumb|Philips swing arm optical mechanism]]\n[[File:cdchip.jpg|thumb|The optical chip extracted from a CD player. The three dark rectangles are photosensitive, read the data from the disk and keep the beam focused. Electronic tracking, aided with the two photodiodes at the sides, keeps the laser beam centered on the middle of the data track.]]\nTwo types of optical tracking mechanisms exist:\n* The '''swing-arm mechanism''', originally designed by Philips<ref>{{cite web|url=http://siber-sonic.com/audio/swingarm.html |title=Swing-arm mechanism description |publisher=Siber-sonic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 the lens moves at the end of an arm, in a manner similar to the tone arm assembly of a [[Phonograph|record player]]. Used in earliest Philips CD players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms.\n* The '''radial mechanism''', designed by Sony, which is the one used in most CD players in the 2000s \u2013 the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly. The motor or linear magnetic assembly consists of a solenoid mounted to the moving laser assembly, wound over a permanent magnetic field attached to the base of the mechanism. It is also known as three-beam linear tracking.\n[[File:Philips 1 beam tracking Laser Optical Assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Philips one-beam laser assembly]]\nThe swing-arm mechanism has a distinctive advantage over the other in that it does not \"skip\" when the rail becomes dirty. The swing arm mechanisms tend to have a much longer life than their radial counterparts.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The main difference between the two mechanisms is the way they read the data from the disc. The swing-arm mechanism uses a magnetic coil wound over a permanent magnet to provide the tracking movement to the laser assembly in a similar way a [[hard drive]] moves its head across the data tracks. It also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface. By operating the tracking or the focus actuators, the laser beam can be positioned on any part of the disc.\nThis mechanism employs a single laser beam and a set of four photodiodes to read, focus and keep track of the data coming from the disc.<ref>Philips CD100 Service Manual</ref>\n\n[[File:CD Player focusing lens assembly.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp laser optical assembly. All six focusing and tracking coils can be seen.]]\nThe linear tracking mechanism uses a motor and reduction gears to move the laser assembly radially across the tracks of the disc and it also has a set of six coils mounted in the focusing lens over a permanent magnetic field. One set of two coils moves the lens closer to the disc surface, providing the focusing motion, and the other set of coils moves the lens radially, providing a finer tracking motion. This mechanism uses the three-beam tracking method in which a main laser beam is used to read and focus the data track of the disc using three or four photodiodes, depending on the focus method, and two smaller beams read the adjacent tracks at each side to help the servo keep the tracking using two more \"helper\" [[photodiode]]s.<ref>Sony CDP-101 Service Manual</ref>\n\n==Mechanical components==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\n[[File:Dismantled Philips EXP2582 portable CD player.jpg|thumb|[[Philips]] Portable CD player disassembled]]\nA CD player has three major mechanical components : a '''drive motor''', a '''[[lens (optics)|lens]] system''' or pickup head, and a '''tracking mechanism'''.\nThe drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2\u20131.4&nbsp;m/s ([[constant linear velocity]]) \u2013 equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at the inside of the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during playback.) The tracking mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a [[laser beam]], typically produced by a [[laser diode]]. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc's mirrored surface back to a [[photodiode]] array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed, and eventually converted to [[sound]] using a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC).\n\nA TOC or Table of Contents is located after the \"lead-in\" area of the disc, which is located in an inner ring of the disc, and contains roughly five kilobytes of available space. It is the first information that the player reads when the disc is loaded in the player and contains information on the total number of audio tracks, the running time on the CD, the running time of each track, and other information such as ISRC and the format structure of the disc. The TOC is of such vital importance for the disc that if it is not read correctly by the player, the CD could not be played back. That is why it is repeated 3 times before the first music program starts. The \"lead out\" area in the end (the outer peripheral) of the disc tells the player that disc has come to an end.\n\n==CD player features==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nCD players can employ a number of ways to improve performance, or reduce component count or price. Features such as oversampling, one-bit DACs, dual DACs, interpolation (error correction), anti-skip buffering, digital and optical outputs are, or were, likely to be found. Other features improve functionality, such as track programming, random play and repeat, or direct track access. Yet others are related to the CD player's intended target, such as anti-skip for car and portable CD players, pitch control and queuing for a DJ's CD player, remote and system integration for household players. Description of some features follows:\n\n*''[[Oversampling]]'' is a way to improve the performance of the low pass filter present at the output of most CD players. By using a higher sampling frequency, a multiple of the 44.1&nbsp;kHz used by CD encoding, it can employ a filter with much lower requirements.\n*''[[Delta-sigma modulation#Digital to analog conversion|One-bit DACs]]'' were less expensive than other types of DACs, while providing similar performance.\n*''Dual DACs'' were sometimes advertised as a feature because some of the early CD players used a single DAC, and switched it between channels. This required additional supporting circuits, possibly degrading sound quality.\n*''Anti-skip or Antishock'', is a way for the CD player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism. It consists of an additional data processor and a [[RAM chip]] installed on the player that reads the disc at double speed and stores various frames of audio data in a RAM [[memory buffer]] for later decoding. Some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use lower capacity (and less expensive) RAM chips. Typical players can store about 44 seconds of audio data on a 16 mbit RAM chip.\n\n==Portable CD players==\n\n===Small portable players===\n[[File:Discman D121.jpg|thumb|upright|An early portable player, a [[Sony]] [[Discman]] model D-121]]\nA [[portable CD player]] is a [[portable audio player]] used to play [[compact disc]]s.

Beginning in the 1990s, boomboxes typically included a CD player. The boombox CD player is the only type of CD player which produces sound audible by the listener independently, without the need for [[headphones]] or an additional amplifier or speaker system. Designed for portability, boomboxes can be powered by [[battery (electricity)|batteries]] as well as by line current. The boombox was introduced to the American market during the mid-1970s. The desire for louder and heavier bass led to bigger and heavier boxes; by the 1980s, some boomboxes had reached the size of a [[suitcase]]. Most boomboxes were battery-operated, leading to extremely heavy, bulky boxes.<ref name=npr>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2009/04/22/103363836/a-eulogy-for-the-boombox|title=A Eulogy For The Boombox|date=22 April 2009|work=NPR.org|first=Frannie|last=Kelly|accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nMost boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a CD player compatible with [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]], which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium. Many also permit iPod and similar devices to be plugged into them through one or more auxiliary ports. Some also support formats such as [[MP3]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]].
