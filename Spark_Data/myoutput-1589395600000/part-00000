On the Los Angeles area's rap scene, led by party themes and electro-funk sounds, the single drew a following. As 1987 closed, the song was reissued on N.W.A's EP titled ''N.W.A.'' and on the unauthorized compilation album ''[[N.W.A. and the Posse]]''.\n\nEarlier in 1987, Ruthless Records' recent founder, Eric Wright, had commissioned this song's ghostwriting by rapper Ice Cube and its record production by Dr. Dre, assisted by DJ Yella and Arabian Prince. But once a rap group signed from New York City rejected the song, Dre and Yella encouraged Wright to rap it himself, newly dubbed [[Eazy-E]]. Upon Wright's modest distribution, it sold about 200 000 copies.\n\nIn 1988, N.W.A released its official debut album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', which sparked the Los Angeles area's rap scene to rapidly go hardcore, that news media soon called \"gangsta rap,\" but the rappers themselves still called \"reality rap.\" Also in 1988, a \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\" remix arrived on Eazy's debut album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]''. And in 1993, after N.W.A's 1991 disbanding, Eazy's EP titled ''[[It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa|It's On (<s>Dr. Dre</s>) 187<sup>um</sup> Killa]]'', brings another remix, \"Boyz N Tha Hood (G-Mix).\"\n\nYet the title became iconic instead through filmmaker [[John Singleton]]'s 1991 debut, borrowing this song's title, the film [[Boyz n the Hood|''Boyz n the Hood'']].
