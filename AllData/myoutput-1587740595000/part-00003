Written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], and directed by [[Charles McDougall]], the episode first aired in the United States on March 2, 2006 on [[NBC]].\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) helps [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) with an important speech that he is going to give. Meanwhile, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) plans a vacation to avoid [[Pam Beesly]]'s ([[Jenna Fischer]]) wedding.\n\nThe speech scene employed over 500 extras, an unusual occurrence for the series. Much of Dwight's speech is based upon a real speech by [[Italy|Italian]] leader [[Benito Mussolini]]. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. In its original broadcast, \"Dwight's Speech\" earned a Nielsen rating of 4.4 in the 18\u201349 demographic, being viewed by 8.4 million viewers.\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) is named [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]] Salesman of the Year and must make a speech at an association meeting at the [[Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel]], getting some assistance from [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]). Before he leaves, [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him tips on how to give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], the [[fascism|fascist]] dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works up the nerve to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the office, [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) begins to write invitations for her approaching wedding with help from [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) and [[Kelly Kapoor]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]). Kelly talks about her dreams of getting married someday and is visibly hurt when Ryan responds to her flirtatious question about future weddings by saying he doesn't think he'll ever tie the knot; when Kelly leaves the room, Pam advises Ryan to be considerate of Kelly's feelings but Ryan curtly notes \"I know what I said.\" Jim makes plans for a vacation anywhere away from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]]. While that is going on, the other employees subtly duel over the thermostat. At the end of the episode, Jim tells Pam that he will be going to Australia and unfortunately, he will be missing her wedding because of it.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Benito mussolini28.jpg|Parts of Dwight's speech were taken from a speech given by [[Benito Mussolini]].|200px|thumb|right]]\n\"Dwight's Speech\" was directed by [[Charles McDougall]], making it his second directing credit after the earlier [[The Office (U.S. season 2)|second season]] episode \"[[Christmas Party (The Office)|Christmas Party]]\".<ref name=\"episode\">{{cite episode| title=Dwight's Speech | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Charles McDougall]] (director); [[Paul Lieberstein]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=March 2, 2006 | season = 2 | number = 17}}</ref><ref name=\"episode2\">{{cite episode| title=Christmas Party | series=The Office| serieslink=The Office |credits = [[Charles McDougall]] (director); [[Michael Schur]] (writer) | network = [[NBC]] |airdate=December 6, 2005 | season = 2 | number = 10}}</ref> \"Dwight's Speech\" was written by [[Paul Lieberstein]], who plays human resources director [[Toby Flenderson]].<ref name=\"Fischer\" /> Lieberstein later revealed that Jim never went on his trip to Australia, noting \"The whole Pam thing took him by surprise, he transferred and then wasn\u2019t really up for vacation.
