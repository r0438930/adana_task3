This title was awarded by a proclamation from the [[King of Travancore]] and the [[Kingdom of Cochin|King of Cochin]]. The Prime jurisdiction regarding the temporal, ecclesiastical and spiritual \nadministration of the [[Malankara Church]] is vested in the Malankara Metropolitan. Malankara Metropolitan is believed to reign it faithful from the Apostolic See of Saint Thomas.His Holiness Moran Mor Baselios Marthoma Paulose II (Indian Orthodox Church) Catholicos is the Present Malankara Metropolitan on the apostlic Throne of st Thomas in Malankara.\n\n\n==History==\nIt was when Col. Munroe the resident of Travancore, Pulikkottil Joseph Ittoop Ramban was ordained as a bishop by Geevarghese Philexenos (Kidangan) (1811\u201329) of [[Malabar Independent Syrian Church]] (Thozhyoor Church) on 22 March 1815. He was given the episcopal title Dionysius, the second bishop in the Malankara Church to get this title. After the death of Thoma VIII, he was made the head of the Malankara Church by a Royal proclamation issued by the King of Travancore and later by the King of Cochin. The proclamation insisted every Syrian Christian of Travancore-Cochin obey the Malankara Metropolitan. From then onwards the head of the [[Malankara Syrian Church]] legally came to be known as Malankara Metropolitan. The position of the Malankara Metropolitan in the 19th century is an upgrowth from the position of the previous Thomas and Archdeacons.  The power and authority of the Malankara Metropolitan got more recognition than the power and authority of the previous Archdeacons' and Marthomas' because of some political changes in the country through the establishment of British rule.\n\nFrom 1816, Dionysius II, Dionysius III, Dionysius IV, Mathews Athanasius, Thomas Athanasius and Pulikkottil 1st were the Malankara Metropolitans in the 19th century. Among these Mathews Athanasius of Palakkunnathu exercised enormous spiritual as well as temporal powers inside and outside the community. He was the Malankara Metropolitan at the time of '''Mulanthuruthy Padiyola''' in (1876). However inspired by the western missionaries cooperated in the old seminary at Kottayam, he wanted to inculcate reformist ideas in the traditional Syrian church. A parallel group under Dionysius V was working against the ruling Malankara Metropolitan's reformist ideas. During the latter half of the 19th century there occurred two factions in the community; the minority faction that favored reformation and supported the Reformists and the majority faction who were against the introduction of new changes which was against the Syrian tradition of the church got stood with the Pulikkotil Joseph Dionysius 2 (Syrian traditionalists). This also invited a closer interference of the Patriarch of Antioch in Malankara Church. Dionysius V stood with the Patriarch of Antioch against the ruling metropolitan, Mathews Athanasius of Palakkunnathu. A series of court cases followed thereafter. The Travancore Royal court on 14 July 1889 declared that Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius and the Reformist faction has no rights in the physical properties of Malankara Church . Later the Reformist faction renamed themselves as[[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]. \n\nThe practice of issuing Royal proclamation ceased after the time of Palakkunnathu [[Mathews Mar Athanasius|Mathews Athanasius]]. Dionysius V of the (Syrian traditionalists) invited and brought Patriarch Peter III of Antioch to Malankara in 1875. The Patriarch divided the Malankara church into seven dioceses; Dionysius V was declared as the Malankara Metropolitan and was given charge of Quilon Diocese in the '''Synod of Mulanthuruthy'''(27 to 30 June 1876). Neither the reigning Malankara Metropolitan, Palakkunathu Mathews Athanasius nor the Churches favoring him participated in the synod.\n\nLater on, a series of court cases and stronger rift occurred in the church. The head of Malankara Church, Malankara Metropolitan Dionysius V approached the Royal Court of Travancore against Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius reigning as Malankara Metropolitan and against occupying assets of church and seminary. Appellant Dionysius V won the case in 1889 and Palakkunnathu Thomas Athanasius was deprived of the title of Malankara Metropolitan and evicted from Syrian Seminary.\n\nMeanwhile, the defeated reformist faction organized themselves under reigning Malankara Metropolitan who was evicted from the position after Royal court verdict .Reformist faction renamed themselves as  [[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]  \n*[[Malankara Marthoma Syrian Church]]: Independent Oriental Orthodox Church under the jurisdiction of  Marthoma Metropolitan Throne of Malankara See\n*[[Malankara Syrian Church]]: following Oriental Orthodox beliefs under the jurisdiction of Malankara Metropolitan with the spiritual guidance of Patriarch of Antioch\n\nHowever, later after the establishment of Catholicate in Malankara in 1912, again a rift occurred among Malankara Syrian Church over the spiritual authority of Patriarch of Antioch. There were several years of litigation between the two factions, the Metran faction, and the Bava faction.The [[Supreme court of India]] declared that the Patriarch has no power in Malankara Church and spiritual power had also come to vanishing point since the establishment of Catholicate.\n\n*[[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]]: '''Malankara Metropolitan and Catholicos of the East enthroned on the Apostolic Throne of [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]]''' is the primate of the church.\n*[[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobite Syrian Church]] : under the local jurisdiction of '''Maphrian''' of [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch, later in 2002 established '''[[Catholicos of India]]'''.\n\nThe Primate of Malankara Church (Orthodox Syrian Church of the East) is Catholicos ( [[Catholicos of the East]]). He enjoys spiritual powers as well, as the Malankara Metropolitan. Malankara Metropolitan has the prime jurisdiction regarding temporal, ecclesiastical and spiritual administration of Malankara Church subject to the riders provided in the 1934 Constitution. In the temporal matters, Patriarch has no  power and the spiritual power had also come to the 'vanishing point' by his own acts as noticed by the Supreme  Court of India in the 1995 and other judgments. The legitimate Malankara church is the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]].\n\n==Lineage==\nHistorically the primate or the leader of St Thomas Christians were known as Jathikku Karthavyan (leader of Community), Malankara Moopen (Elder of the Community), [[Archdeacon]] or Arkadyokon (High Priest). In the 16th century to resist the Latinization attempts of the Jesuits, it became necessary to elevate the Archdeacon to a position of 'Metropolitan Bishop' named as Mar Thoma.  In 1653 the Archdeacon position was elevated to Bishopric by laying hands of twelve priests in the absence of a valid Bishop. This was an emergency step. Then onwards the Metropolitan Bishop assumed the honorific ecclesiastical title '''Marthoma'''. This title was used from 1653 to 1815. Later a regular 'Bishopric' was established in Malankara with the help of [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]]. Until a few hundred years back, the leadership of St Thomas Christian Community was dynastically held by members of the Pakalomattom family.\n\n===Mar Thoma (title)===\n*[[Mar Thoma I]] \u2013 In 1653, Thomas of Palamattam Thravadu was consecrated with the title Marthoma I by 12 priests in 1653 after Coonan cross oath.\nMarthoma I had survived a number of assassination attempts.
