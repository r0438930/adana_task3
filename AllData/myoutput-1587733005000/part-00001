He was educated at [[Marlborough College]] in Wiltshire, then briefly flirted with medicine and architecture at [[Liverpool University]] before pursuing an artistic career.<ref name=\"Broad\">Broad Chalke, A History of a South Wiltshire Village, its Land & People Over 2,000 years. By 'The People of the Village', 1999</ref>\n\n=== Artistic career ===\nAt Liverpool University, Wood met [[Augustus John]], who encouraged him to be a painter. The French collector [[Alphonse Kahn]] invited him to Paris in 1920.<ref name=\"Tate\">[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&artistid=2167&tabview=bio Kit Wood Biography at Tate Gallery]</ref> From 1921 he trained as a painter at the [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in Paris, where he met [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Georges Auric]] and [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]].<ref name=\"Broad\"/><ref name=\"Tate\"/> He travelled around Europe and north Africa between 1922 and 1924.\n\nBy the 1920s his father was running a general practice in [[Broad Chalke]], Wiltshire, and Wood painted a series of canvases there including ''Cottage in Broadchalke'', ''Anemones in a Window, Broadchalke'', and ''The Red Cottage, Broadchalke''.<ref name=\"Broad\"/>\n\nIn 1926 Wood created designs for Constant Lambert's 1925 ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' for Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]], although they were never used. The same year he became a member of both the [[London Group]] and the [[Seven and Five Society]] plus meeting and befriending [[Ben Nicholson|Ben]] and [[Winifred Nicholson]]. The Nicholsons' dedication to his work had a great influence and exhibited together at the [[Beaux Arts Gallery]] in April\u2013May 1927 and subsequently painted together in [[Cumberland]] and [[Cornwall]] in 1928.<ref name=\"Tate\"/> Like Nicholson, Wood admired [[Alfred Wallis]] whom they met on a trip to [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]], and whose [[primitivism]] influenced Woods' stylistic development.<ref name=\"Tate\"/> He painted coastal scenes, and his finest works are considered to be those painted in [[Brittany]] in 1929 and during his second trip to Brittany in 1930 when he painted fewer marine pictures and more churches. He claimed that his \"mother's people were [[Cornish people|Cornish]] and that he got his love of the sea and for boats from his Cornish ancestry\".<ref>Wertheim, Lucy [1947]. Adventure in Art, Nicholson and Watson, London, p. 9</ref>\n\nIn April 1929 Wood held a solo exhibition at [[Tooth's Gallery]] in [[Bond Street]], London where he met [[Lucy Wertheim]] at a [[private view]]. She purchased a picture and soon became one of his biggest supporters, buying up his work.<ref name=\"Tate\"/> For his part Wood apparently appreciated the support, telling Wertheim at her birthday party that:\n{{quote|I know that my future as a painter from now on will be bound up with your own, and ''I shall become great through you!''<ref>Wertheim, Lucy [1947]. ''Adventure in Art'', Nicholson and Watson, London, p. 11</ref>}}\n\nIn May 1930 he had a largely unsuccessful exhibition with Nicholson at the [[Georges Bernheim Gallery]] in Paris. In June and July he made a second sojourn to Brittany to create new work. Later in July Wertheim travelled to meet Wood in Paris, to choose the paintings for a one-man show that would be the opening exhibition at her new Wertheim Gallery in October.<ref name=\"Tate\"/>  While discussing the exhibition over lunch the  day after her arrival, Wood issued her with an ultimatum: \"I want you to promise to guarantee me twelve hundred pounds a year from the time of my exhibition, one hundred pounds a month being the least I can live on. If I can't have this sum I've made up my mind to shoot myself\". When she complained, he begged her forgiveness, and they went to review the paintings again. Following his death in August the show was cancelled; it was eventually staged as a memorial show at another gallery.<ref>Wertheim, Lucy [1947]. ''Adventure in Art'', Nicholson and Watson, London, pp. 12\u201319</ref>\n\n=== Personal life ===\nWood was [[bisexual]].<ref>{{citation |title=Noel Coward: A Biography |first=Philip |last=Hoare |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-226-34512-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/noelcowardbiogra00hoar/page/73 73] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/noelcowardbiogra00hoar/page/73 }}</ref> In the early summer of 1921, Wood met [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Gandarillas Huici]] (1887\u20131970), a [[Chile]]an diplomat. Gandarillas, a married homosexual fourteen years older than Wood, lived a glamorous life partly financed by gambling. Their relationship lasted through Wood's life, surviving his affair with [[Jeanne Bourgoint]]. In 1927 his plans to elope and marry heiress [[Meraud Guinness]] were frustrated by her parents whereupon he required emotional support from Winifred Nicholson. (Meraud went on to marry Chilean painter [[\u00c1lvaro Guevara]] in 1929.)<ref name=\"Tate\"/> Wood also had a liaison with a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9e, [[Frosca Munster]], whom he met in 1928.<ref name=\"Tate\"/><ref>Margaret Garlake, \u2018Wood, (John) Christopher [Kit] (1901\u20131930)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref>\n\n===Death and commemoration===\nBy 1930, painting frenetically in preparation for his Wertheim exhibition in London, Wood became psychotic and began carrying a revolver. On 21 August he travelled to meet his mother and sister for lunch at 'The County Hotel' in [[Salisbury]] and to show them a selection of his latest paintings. After saying goodbye he jumped under a train at [[Salisbury railway station]], although in deference to his mother's wishes it was reported as an accident.<ref name=\"Broad\"/><ref name=\"Tate\"/>\n\nChristopher Wood is buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church in Broad Chalke.  His gravestone was carved by fellow artist and sculptor [[Eric Gill]].<ref name=\"Broad\"/>\n\nAlthough his planned exhibition at the Wertheim gallery was cancelled on his death, a posthumous exhibition was held in February 1931. This was followed by an exhibition at the [[Lefevre Gallery]] in 1932.\n\nThe 1938 [[Venice Biennale]] included some of his paintings, and later the [[Redfern Gallery]] (part of the New Burlington Galleries) compiled a major retrospective.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* ''Alfred Wallis, Christopher Wood, Ben Nicholson.''
