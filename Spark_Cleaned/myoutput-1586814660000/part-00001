To the immediate north-east is the [[University of Nottingham]]'s main campus, [[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park]]. The [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical]] and retail chemist group [[Boots UK|Boots]] has its headquarters {{convert|1|km|mi|1|order=flip}} east of the centre of Beeston, on the border with [[Borough of Broxtowe|Broxtowe]] and the City of Nottingham. To the south lies the [[River Trent]] and the village of [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], with extensive wetlands.<ref>[http://www.attenboroughnaturecentre.co.uk/docs/anr-map.pdf Attenborough Nature Centre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704165209/http://www.attenboroughnaturecentre.co.uk/docs/anr-map.pdf |date=4 July 2010}} Map of Attenborough wetlands</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nSuburban development in the mid-20th century has extended the built-up area of Beeston to the former villages of [[Chilwell]] to the west, and [[Wollaton]] and [[Lenton Abbey]] to the north. It is separated from [[Bramcote]] to the north-west by the Beeston Fields Golf Course. The Broxtowe-City of Nottingham border essentially forms the town's eastern edge. The main area and shopping district lies to the north of the [[Midland Main Line|railway line]], and the mixed residential and industrial area of Beeston Rylands to the south.\n\n===Beeston Rylands===\n[[File:Beeston Canal - geograph.org.uk - 53033.jpg|thumb|right|The Beeston Canal passing through Rylands]]\nRylands was originally a small settlement around Beeston Lock, comprising some tens of houses and two pubs, although the name now refers to all of the area south of the railway line. The ''Jolly Angler'' was originally on the river side of the canal, but has since moved.<ref>[http://www.beeston-notts.co.uk/landmark_pubs3.shtml Beeston history website] ''Jolly Angler''</ref> Beeston began to spread south of the railway line in the late 19th century, when a few Victorian villas were built near the level crossing by the station.\n\nOver the first few decades of the 20th century, several estates were built to house workers at [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|Ericssons]] and Boots, both of which had large factories south of the railway line. These estates joined Beeston and Rylands. Further development after the Second World War filled gaps, initially with an estate of council houses and flats, and latterly with private houses and bungalows. The last significant development, in 1970, was Meadow Farm, now the four roads of timber-framed semi-detached houses between Beech Avenue and the canal.  Since then Beeston Rylands has had a small amount of infill development.\n\nBeeston Rylands was historically at risk of flooding from the [[River Trent]] to the south. This reduced property values and the size of houses built there, predominantly for the rental market. The last serious flood, in 1947, reached beyond the railway line: most of Queens Road was flooded, as was Nether Street. Strengthened flood defences have reduced the risk of flooding to a probability of once every fifty years. A series of flood-defence improvements, costing \u00a351 million and designed to decrease the expected flood incidence to once in a hundred years, began in 2009 along a {{convert|27|km|mi|order=flip}} stretch of the Trent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8602573.stm BBC News] Attenborough flood defence plans submitted</ref>\n\n===University of Nottingham===\nThe eastern edge of Beeston abuts the [[University of Nottingham]]'s University Park campus, through which runs Beeston Lane.\n\nAlthough most of the University is within the City of Nottingham, around half the self-catering flats in the [[Broadgate Park]] hall of residence fall within Beeston. Nearer still is Albion House, which is associated with the main Broadgate Park site.\n\nBeeston has a large population of postgraduate students, who supposedly prefer the quieter atmosphere compared to [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]] and [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]], where many undergraduates live.\n\n===Wards===\n{{see also|Borough of Broxtowe#Wards}}\nBeeston divides into four [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] for local electoral purposes within the borough of Broxtowe: Beeston North, Beeston Central, Beeston Rylands and Beeston West.<ref name=\"Wards\">[http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe Boundary Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509213923/http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe |date=9 May 2011}} \u2013 Broxtowe</ref>\n\nBeeston's town centre is largely within the West and Central wards. The North ward includes some residential estates north of the A52 (Derby Road), including a small part of the Wollaton urban area that falls within Broxtowe. To the west lie [[Bramcote Hills]] and the Bramcote ward. The original Beeston/Bramcote boundary is still marked on the A52.\n\nThe Beeston Rylands ward has a larger area than the other three wards as it includes unpopulated [[floodplain]]s of the River Trent and industrial areas, including the part of the Boots campus. The Rylands ward also extends north of the railway line to Queens Road and includes the former site of Nottingham Rugby Club.\n\nTo the west of Beeston Rylands lies the [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]] ward; while the Chilwell East ward lies to the west of Beeston West.  \n[[File:Beeston wards map.png|thumb|right|The historic area of the town (the 1933 civil parish area) in blue, and the present-day ward boundaries within the borough of Broxtowe]]\nA review of ward boundaries in 2000 brought changes to Beeston's western boundary. In the north-west, Beeston Cemetery and the residential streets surrounding it (to the south of Derby Road) such as Coniston Road and Windermere Road, as well as the ''Nuseryman'' pub and the eastern part of Beeston Fields Golf Course, were transferred to Bramcote ward. Beeston gained some territory from Chilwell in residential streets such as Park Road, Grove Avenue and Cumberland Avenue, and in Nottingham College and the industrial patch between Holly Lane and Wilmot Lane.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original boundary between the old Beeston and Chilwell parishes can still be identified by a road-name change on the site of the ''Hop Pole'' pub, from [[Chilwell Road, Beeston|Chilwell Road]] on the Beeston side to High Road on the Chilwell side.\n\n====Elections====\n{{see also|Broxtowe local elections}}\nBeeston's four wards each return two councillors to Broxtowe Borough Council. For Nottinghamshire County Council the town is covered by two [[electoral division]]s, each with a county councillor: Beeston North (North and West wards) and Beeston South & Attenborough (Central, Rylands and Attenborough wards).<ref>[http://www.nottinghamshire.gov.uk/home/your_council/councilelections/electionresultsbydivision09.htm?division=19#84 Nottinghamshire County Council]</ref>\n\nFor elections to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] the town is part of the [[Broxtowe (UK Parliament constituency)|Broxtowe constituency]]. From 1974 to 1983 a [[Beeston (UK Parliament constituency)|Beeston constituency]] existed. The present Member of Parliament is [[Darren Henry]], of the [[Conservative party (UK)|Conservative party]].\n\n===History of local government===\nBeeston is an [[unparished area]] and has no town council, but it was a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] until 1935.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120917204026/http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10256665 Vision of Britain] Beeston (ancient/civil parish)</ref> The parish area was reduced in 1933, with some lands in the east transferred to the City of Nottingham; boundary posts were erected on the new Beeston-Nottingham boundary and many are still in place today, with \"1933\" marked on them. The present four wards cover the same post-1933 area of the old parish, with the two recent alterations made to the western boundary, as described in the \"Wards\" section above.\n\nFrom 1935 until 1974 (when the borough of Broxtowe was formed) Beeston was paired with the town of [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]] (2&nbsp;km to the west) in the [[Beeston and Stapleford]] [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. Previously a [[Beeston Urban District]] existed, covering Beeston parish. The town was the administrative centre of Beeston and Stapleford Urban District Council and is the administrative centre for Broxtowe Borough Council, which has its head offices in Foster Avenue at Beeston Town Hall and the other council buildings there.\n\n===Geographic locale===\n{{Geographic Location\n|title = '''Destinations from Beeston'''\n|Northwest = [[Ilkeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]], [[Bramcote]]\n|North     = [[Wollaton]], [[Bilborough]]\n|Northeast = ''[[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park]]'', [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]], [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]]<br/>'''[[Nottingham]]'''\n|West      = [[Ockbrook]], [[Sandiacre]]<br/>'''[[Derby]]'''\n|Centre    = Beeston\n|East      = ''[[The Boots Estate|Boots Estate]]'', [[West Bridgford]]\n|Southwest = [[Sawley, Derbyshire|Sawley]], [[Long Eaton]], [[Toton]]<br/>''[[East Midlands Airport]]''\n|South     = [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], [[Barton in Fabis]], [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire|Gotham]]  \n|Southeast = [[Clifton, Nottinghamshire|Clifton]], [[Ruddington]]\n}}\n\n==Origins of the name==\nThe earliest name of the settlement was ''Bestune'', recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=The Place-Names of Nottinghamshire |last=Gover |first=J.

There is a sculpture in the High Road of a man sitting next to a beehive, popularly known as the \"Bee-man\", \"the man of Beeston\", etc., though officially called \"The Beeston Seat\". The sculptor was Sioban Coppinger in 1987, modelling a friend, Stephen Hodges, for his \"timeless ability to exude calm when all else are succumbing to stress.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.siobancoppinger.co.uk/work/64d87/ |title=BEESTON SEAT \u2013 Sioban Coppinger |first=Designed by Brown & |last=Brown |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Domesday===\nIn Bestune at the Conquest, the Saxons Alfag, Alwine and UIchel had three manors consisting of three [[carucate]]s of land assessed. These were taken from them and given to William Peverel, lord of Nottingham Castle, who had in his [[demesne]] two plough teams, 17 bond tenants called [[villeins]], unable to leave the estate without the lord's consent, each farming some {{convert|15|acre|ha}} of arable, and one ordinary tenant or sochman. Together they had nine plough teams. There were {{convert|24|acre|ha}} of meadow. The annual yield of the estate was 30 shillings.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Walskipper-Beeston Boiler-001.jpg|thumb|A Beeston Boiler still in use in South Africa, 2008]]\nBeeston outgrew its village status as a silk weaving centre in the early 19th century. The first silk mill was burnt down (along with [[Nottingham Castle]]) in the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] riots of 1831. With the decline of the silk industry, many former mills gained light industrial uses in the early 20th century. Equipment made by the [[Beeston Boiler Company]] is still found all over the former [[British Empire]].\n\nBetween 1880 and the turn of the century, [[Thomas Humber]] and partners made bicycles and eventually motor-cycles and cars at a factory at the junction of what are now Queens Road and Humber Road. At its height it employed 2000, although this ended abruptly in 1907 when the firm moved to Coventry.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Population of Beeston, Nottinghamshire.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Population of Beeston, now just over 21,000 inhabitants]]<!-- Calculated from four Beeston wards. This is NOT the population of the Beeston-Stapleford urban district-->\nIn 1901 the [[National Telephone Company]] built a factory in Beeston for telephone materials. This was taken over by the British [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|L.M. Ericsson Manufacturing Co. Ltd.]] in 1903. Shortly before the transfer, most of the old factory was destroyed by fire, and in the rebuilding it was extended. A new power station was built. In 1906 and 1907 a large building was erected, chiefly devoted to cabinet work. The old factory building covered an area of {{convert|63000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, the cabinet factory {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, and the power station {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, making a total of {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Although most of the factory buildings were low rise, a [[paternoster lift]] survived in E-block at the site until it was demolished in 2016.\n\nUnder the [[Plessey]] name these large premises continued as a major source of employment through the 1980s. Plessey became [[GEC-Plessey Telecommunications|GPT]] with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]'s involvement. With the various restructurings of the [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] group and its rebranding as [[Marconi Electronic Systems|Marconi]], much of the site was sold to [[Siemens]] along with the private telephone-network side of the business. Siemens sublet much of the site as a \"technology park\" when it moved most manufacturing overseas.\n\nSMS Electronics was formed from a [[management buyout]] of the manufacturing facility of Siemens in 2003. It won the [[Queens Award for Export]] in 2012 and employs over 200. The whole site was acquired by [[HSBC]] in 2006 for a mixed-use \"employment-led\" redevelopment. In 2007 a building was constructed for [[Atos|Atos Origin]] which at the time was the largest pre-let buildings in the Midlands.\n\nThe Boots campus includes three [[listed building|listed]] modernist buildings designed by engineer [[Owen Williams (engineer)|Owen Williams]] (two Grade I, one Grade II), though they are difficult to see from outside.

The church was first lit with gas in 1857. A Public Lighting Act was adopted at a vestry meeting on 13 November 1862. Opposition to the street lamps was strong, and the effigy of an active promoter of it was carried on an ass round the village and hung on a lamp-post, and but for police interference would have been burned. In 1861 gas was supplied from Nottingham by the [[Nottingham Corporation Gas Department#Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company|Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company]] and for street lamps in 1872. Beeston was connected to the mains water supply in 1876.\n\n[[File:AngloScotianMills.JPG|thumb|left|[[Anglo Scotian Mills]] on Wollaton Road by [[James Huckerby]] 1892]]\n\nThe [[crenellation|crenellated]] [[listed building]] of the [[Anglo Scotian Mills]]<ref name=\"listed\"/> remains on Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre. It is a solitary reminder of the former dominance of silk and lace mills on the skyline. The buildings have been converted into apartments by a developer. A cottage on the north side of Anglo Scotian Mills was reputed to have the tallest domestic chimney in England.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its length was necessary to reach over the roof of the Mill. Although the cottage has been demolished for several years, the chimney can still be seen attached to the Mill wall.\n\nA rare survival is the G H Hurt & Son Shawl Factory, which is occasionally open to the public. Shawls are produced on knitting machines and hand finished in much the same way as they have been for centuries. The factory contains examples of knitting frames from the 17th century.\n\nLost industrial buildings include the rebuilt silk mill and the looming bulk of the Neville Works mill on the boundary with Chilwell (later occupied by the Myford lathe factory).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===The Land Societies===\n====St John's Grove Estate====\nAfter the enclosure of the land surrounding Beeston in 1809, the area of [[St John's Grove, Beeston|St John's Grove]] was allotted to the vicar of the parish church. In 1878 the land was acquired from the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] by the Beeston Land Society, a group of citizens, who divided it into 28 plots of between three-quarters and {{convert|1|acre|ha|adj=on}} and laid out wide, straight streets. Most of the houses date from Edwardian and late Victorian times. The Land Society set conditions for developers. There were to be no public houses, and strict building lines would ensure that properties were set back a consistent distance from the road. The St John's Grove Estate is now a conservation area.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 St John's Conservation Area description \u2013 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002310/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 |date=18 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\n====Imperial Park Estate====\nShortly after 1878, the Imperial Park Land Society and its sister the Beeston Building Society were founded. They aimed to assist the development and financing of superior housing around what is now Imperial Road, north of Newton Street, adjacent to the St John's Grove development and bounded on the north by North Street. The early model was to have savings made by a group of subscribers and funds allocated by the drawing of lots, in turn for each of them to build a house.\n\n====Bellevue Park Estate====\nThis initial success was repeated when, in 1881, a syndicate acquired land from George Fellows, of the banking family that had its home at Belle Vue, now Beeston Fields Golf Club. The Belle Vue Land Society was formed to develop this land using similar methods to Imperial Park. The development lay to the north as a continuation to Imperial Park. Denison Street formed its northern extreme and Montague Street defined its eastern limit.\n\n====Cottage Grove====\nCottage Grove, historically was just outside Beeston parish and part of [[Chilwell]], was promoted by the [[Labourer's Friend Society]] in the 1840s as plots for cottages with allotments for the labouring poor. The scheme failed and the area now consists mostly of Victorian and Edwardian houses laid out along the parallel Park Road and Grove Avenue and the two short cross streets Cedar Road and North Drive. The area retains a leafy character and the roads remain unkerbed. It has been a conservation area since 2008.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236  Cottage Grove Conservation Area description \u2013 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918015056/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236 |date=18 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====The Estates today====\nSome areas originally developed by the Land Societies have been spoiled where original plots have been subdivided and more modern properties built in styles not in keeping with the original buildings. Many properties in the Imperial Park and Bellvue Estates have lost their original elegance with the lowering of chimney stacks, inappropriate replacement of windows and doors with modern PVC, the loss of hedged fronts to brick walls or fencing, and paving over front gardens for parking.\n\n===Other development===\n[[File:ChilwellRoadMethodistChurch.JPG|thumb|Methodist Church on Chilwell Road]]\n[[File:BeestonBaptistChurch.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church on Dovecote Lane, formerly known as John Clifford Baptist Church]]\nA [[Chilwell Road Methodist Church|particularly fine Methodist Church]] was built by the architect W.

Further east Broadgate saw improvements, with a new space at the top entrance to Broadgate Recreation Ground. The works were completed in late 2006.\n\nThe shopping centre is traversed by Wollaton Road. An area south-east of the shopping centre has made room for a [[Tesco]] superstore, which opened 1 November 2010, rivalling the [[Sainsbury's]] store in the town centre and the recent [[Lidl]] store in Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre.

It is separated from [[Bramcote]] to the north-west by the Beeston Fields Golf Course. The Broxtowe-City of Nottingham border essentially forms the town's eastern edge. The main area and shopping district lies to the north of the [[Midland Main Line|railway line]], and the mixed residential and industrial area of Beeston Rylands to the south.\n\n===Beeston Rylands===\n[[File:Beeston Canal - geograph.org.uk - 53033.jpg|thumb|right|The Beeston Canal passing through Rylands]]\nRylands was originally a small settlement around Beeston Lock, comprising some tens of houses and two pubs, although the name now refers to all of the area south of the railway line. The ''Jolly Angler'' was originally on the river side of the canal, but has since moved.<ref>[http://www.beeston-notts.co.uk/landmark_pubs3.shtml Beeston history website] ''Jolly Angler''</ref> Beeston began to spread south of the railway line in the late 19th century, when a few Victorian villas were built near the level crossing by the station.\n\nOver the first few decades of the 20th century, several estates were built to house workers at [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|Ericssons]] and Boots, both of which had large factories south of the railway line. These estates joined Beeston and Rylands. Further development after the Second World War filled gaps, initially with an estate of council houses and flats, and latterly with private houses and bungalows. The last significant development, in 1970, was Meadow Farm, now the four roads of timber-framed semi-detached houses between Beech Avenue and the canal.  Since then Beeston Rylands has had a small amount of infill development.\n\nBeeston Rylands was historically at risk of flooding from the [[River Trent]] to the south. This reduced property values and the size of houses built there, predominantly for the rental market. The last serious flood, in 1947, reached beyond the railway line: most of Queens Road was flooded, as was Nether Street. Strengthened flood defences have reduced the risk of flooding to a probability of once every fifty years. A series of flood-defence improvements, costing \u00a351 million and designed to decrease the expected flood incidence to once in a hundred years, began in 2009 along a {{convert|27|km|mi|order=flip}} stretch of the Trent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/nottinghamshire/8602573.stm BBC News] Attenborough flood defence plans submitted</ref>\n\n===University of Nottingham===\nThe eastern edge of Beeston abuts the [[University of Nottingham]]'s University Park campus, through which runs Beeston Lane.\n\nAlthough most of the University is within the City of Nottingham, around half the self-catering flats in the [[Broadgate Park]] hall of residence fall within Beeston. Nearer still is Albion House, which is associated with the main Broadgate Park site.\n\nBeeston has a large population of postgraduate students, who supposedly prefer the quieter atmosphere compared to [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]] and [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]], where many undergraduates live.\n\n===Wards===\n{{see also|Borough of Broxtowe#Wards}}\nBeeston divides into four [[Wards of the United Kingdom|wards]] for local electoral purposes within the borough of Broxtowe: Beeston North, Beeston Central, Beeston Rylands and Beeston West.<ref name=\"Wards\">[http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe Boundary Commission] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509213923/http://www.lgbce.org.uk/all-reviews/east-midlands/nottinghamshire/broxtowe |date=9 May 2011}} \u2013 Broxtowe</ref>\n\nBeeston's town centre is largely within the West and Central wards. The North ward includes some residential estates north of the A52 (Derby Road), including a small part of the Wollaton urban area that falls within Broxtowe. To the west lie [[Bramcote Hills]] and the Bramcote ward. The original Beeston/Bramcote boundary is still marked on the A52.\n\nThe Beeston Rylands ward has a larger area than the other three wards as it includes unpopulated [[floodplain]]s of the River Trent and industrial areas, including the part of the Boots campus. The Rylands ward also extends north of the railway line to Queens Road and includes the former site of Nottingham Rugby Club.\n\nTo the west of Beeston Rylands lies the [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]] ward; while the Chilwell East ward lies to the west of Beeston West.  \n[[File:Beeston wards map.png|thumb|right|The historic area of the town (the 1933 civil parish area) in blue, and the present-day ward boundaries within the borough of Broxtowe]]\nA review of ward boundaries in 2000 brought changes to Beeston's western boundary. In the north-west, Beeston Cemetery and the residential streets surrounding it (to the south of Derby Road) such as Coniston Road and Windermere Road, as well as the ''Nuseryman'' pub and the eastern part of Beeston Fields Golf Course, were transferred to Bramcote ward. Beeston gained some territory from Chilwell in residential streets such as Park Road, Grove Avenue and Cumberland Avenue, and in Nottingham College and the industrial patch between Holly Lane and Wilmot Lane.<ref name=\"Wards\"/> The original boundary between the old Beeston and Chilwell parishes can still be identified by a road-name change on the site of the ''Hop Pole'' pub, from [[Chilwell Road, Beeston|Chilwell Road]] on the Beeston side to High Road on the Chilwell side.\n\n====Elections====\n{{see also|Broxtowe local elections}}\nBeeston's four wards each return two councillors to Broxtowe Borough Council.

Previously a [[Beeston Urban District]] existed, covering Beeston parish. The town was the administrative centre of Beeston and Stapleford Urban District Council and is the administrative centre for Broxtowe Borough Council, which has its head offices in Foster Avenue at Beeston Town Hall and the other council buildings there.\n\n===Geographic locale===\n{{Geographic Location\n|title = '''Destinations from Beeston'''\n|Northwest = [[Ilkeston]], [[Stapleford, Nottinghamshire|Stapleford]], [[Bramcote]]\n|North     = [[Wollaton]], [[Bilborough]]\n|Northeast = ''[[Campuses of the University of Nottingham#University Park Campus|University Park]]'', [[Dunkirk, Nottingham|Dunkirk]], [[Lenton, Nottingham|Lenton]]<br/>'''[[Nottingham]]'''\n|West      = [[Ockbrook]], [[Sandiacre]]<br/>'''[[Derby]]'''\n|Centre    = Beeston\n|East      = ''[[The Boots Estate|Boots Estate]]'', [[West Bridgford]]\n|Southwest = [[Sawley, Derbyshire|Sawley]], [[Long Eaton]], [[Toton]]<br/>''[[East Midlands Airport]]''\n|South     = [[Attenborough, Nottinghamshire|Attenborough]], [[Barton in Fabis]], [[Gotham, Nottinghamshire|Gotham]]  \n|Southeast = [[Clifton, Nottinghamshire|Clifton]], [[Ruddington]]\n}}\n\n==Origins of the name==\nThe earliest name of the settlement was ''Bestune'', recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=The Place-Names of Nottinghamshire |last=Gover |first=J.

These were taken from them and given to William Peverel, lord of Nottingham Castle, who had in his [[demesne]] two plough teams, 17 bond tenants called [[villeins]], unable to leave the estate without the lord's consent, each farming some {{convert|15|acre|ha}} of arable, and one ordinary tenant or sochman. Together they had nine plough teams. There were {{convert|24|acre|ha}} of meadow. The annual yield of the estate was 30 shillings.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Walskipper-Beeston Boiler-001.jpg|thumb|A Beeston Boiler still in use in South Africa, 2008]]\nBeeston outgrew its village status as a silk weaving centre in the early 19th century. The first silk mill was burnt down (along with [[Nottingham Castle]]) in the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill]] riots of 1831. With the decline of the silk industry, many former mills gained light industrial uses in the early 20th century. Equipment made by the [[Beeston Boiler Company]] is still found all over the former [[British Empire]].\n\nBetween 1880 and the turn of the century, [[Thomas Humber]] and partners made bicycles and eventually motor-cycles and cars at a factory at the junction of what are now Queens Road and Humber Road. At its height it employed 2000, although this ended abruptly in 1907 when the firm moved to Coventry.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Population of Beeston, Nottinghamshire.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Population of Beeston, now just over 21,000 inhabitants]]<!-- Calculated from four Beeston wards. This is NOT the population of the Beeston-Stapleford urban district-->\nIn 1901 the [[National Telephone Company]] built a factory in Beeston for telephone materials. This was taken over by the British [[Ericsson Telephones Limited|L.M. Ericsson Manufacturing Co. Ltd.]] in 1903. Shortly before the transfer, most of the old factory was destroyed by fire, and in the rebuilding it was extended. A new power station was built. In 1906 and 1907 a large building was erected, chiefly devoted to cabinet work. The old factory building covered an area of {{convert|63000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, the cabinet factory {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, and the power station {{convert|7000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}, making a total of {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Although most of the factory buildings were low rise, a [[paternoster lift]] survived in E-block at the site until it was demolished in 2016.\n\nUnder the [[Plessey]] name these large premises continued as a major source of employment through the 1980s. Plessey became [[GEC-Plessey Telecommunications|GPT]] with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]'s involvement. With the various restructurings of the [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] group and its rebranding as [[Marconi Electronic Systems|Marconi]], much of the site was sold to [[Siemens]] along with the private telephone-network side of the business. Siemens sublet much of the site as a \"technology park\" when it moved most manufacturing overseas.\n\nSMS Electronics was formed from a [[management buyout]] of the manufacturing facility of Siemens in 2003. It won the [[Queens Award for Export]] in 2012 and employs over 200. The whole site was acquired by [[HSBC]] in 2006 for a mixed-use \"employment-led\" redevelopment. In 2007 a building was constructed for [[Atos|Atos Origin]] which at the time was the largest pre-let buildings in the Midlands.\n\nThe Boots campus includes three [[listed building|listed]] modernist buildings designed by engineer [[Owen Williams (engineer)|Owen Williams]] (two Grade I, one Grade II), though they are difficult to see from outside.

It allowed goods traffic from the Erewash valley to bypass the [[River Erewash]] and [[River Trent]]. In response, a Beeston Canal was promoted by the [[Trent Navigation Company]] in 1794. This stretched from Beeston Cut to Lenton, over a weir at Beeston Rylands.

Both are included in the West End [[Conservation Area (United Kingdom)|conservation area]], which covers several buildings, many historical or of character, along Dovecote Lane, Grange Avenue, West End, and Church Street. Included in the area is the historic Village Cross.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4232 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609154002/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4232 |date=9 June 2011 }} \u2013 Beeston West End conservation area</ref>\n\nAn [[Inclosure acts|enclosure act]] was passed for the parish of Beeston, and in 1809 the Commissioners stated that the lands amounted to {{convert|822|acre|km2}}, to be made tithe free, and the ancient enclosed lands and homesteads liable to tithe was \u00a3687 2s 29d. They then proceeded to fix the width of the roads. The Nottingham and Derby turnpike road was fixed at {{convert|50|foot|m}}. Wollaton Road, then called Cowgate, was {{convert|30|foot|m}}. The enclosures altered the appearance of part of the parish from a moor growing poor grass to cultivated fields with hedges, and so increased the food supply. It relieved farmers of their duty to pay a tenth of their product in kind.\n\nSome lands on or near [[Bramcote Moor]], but in Beeston parish, were enclosed in 1847, by provisional order of the Inclosure Commissioners.\n\nBefore the general introduction of gas in the parish, there was a limited supply from the Mill to separate houses. The church was first lit with gas in 1857. A Public Lighting Act was adopted at a vestry meeting on 13 November 1862. Opposition to the street lamps was strong, and the effigy of an active promoter of it was carried on an ass round the village and hung on a lamp-post, and but for police interference would have been burned. In 1861 gas was supplied from Nottingham by the [[Nottingham Corporation Gas Department#Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company|Nottingham Gas Light and Coke Company]] and for street lamps in 1872. Beeston was connected to the mains water supply in 1876.\n\n[[File:AngloScotianMills.JPG|thumb|left|[[Anglo Scotian Mills]] on Wollaton Road by [[James Huckerby]] 1892]]\n\nThe [[crenellation|crenellated]] [[listed building]] of the [[Anglo Scotian Mills]]<ref name=\"listed\"/> remains on Wollaton Road to the north of the town centre. It is a solitary reminder of the former dominance of silk and lace mills on the skyline. The buildings have been converted into apartments by a developer. A cottage on the north side of Anglo Scotian Mills was reputed to have the tallest domestic chimney in England.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its length was necessary to reach over the roof of the Mill. Although the cottage has been demolished for several years, the chimney can still be seen attached to the Mill wall.\n\nA rare survival is the G H Hurt & Son Shawl Factory, which is occasionally open to the public. Shawls are produced on knitting machines and hand finished in much the same way as they have been for centuries. The factory contains examples of knitting frames from the 17th century.\n\nLost industrial buildings include the rebuilt silk mill and the looming bulk of the Neville Works mill on the boundary with Chilwell (later occupied by the Myford lathe factory).{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===The Land Societies===\n====St John's Grove Estate====\nAfter the enclosure of the land surrounding Beeston in 1809, the area of [[St John's Grove, Beeston|St John's Grove]] was allotted to the vicar of the parish church. In 1878 the land was acquired from the [[Ecclesiastical Commissioners]] by the Beeston Land Society, a group of citizens, who divided it into 28 plots of between three-quarters and {{convert|1|acre|ha|adj=on}} and laid out wide, straight streets. Most of the houses date from Edwardian and late Victorian times. The Land Society set conditions for developers. There were to be no public houses, and strict building lines would ensure that properties were set back a consistent distance from the road. The St John's Grove Estate is now a conservation area.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 St John's Conservation Area description \u2013 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002310/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4243 |date=18 September 2009 }}</ref>\n\n====Imperial Park Estate====\nShortly after 1878, the Imperial Park Land Society and its sister the Beeston Building Society were founded. They aimed to assist the development and financing of superior housing around what is now Imperial Road, north of Newton Street, adjacent to the St John's Grove development and bounded on the north by North Street. The early model was to have savings made by a group of subscribers and funds allocated by the drawing of lots, in turn for each of them to build a house.\n\n====Bellevue Park Estate====\nThis initial success was repeated when, in 1881, a syndicate acquired land from George Fellows, of the banking family that had its home at Belle Vue, now Beeston Fields Golf Club. The Belle Vue Land Society was formed to develop this land using similar methods to Imperial Park. The development lay to the north as a continuation to Imperial Park. Denison Street formed its northern extreme and Montague Street defined its eastern limit.\n\n====Cottage Grove====\nCottage Grove, historically was just outside Beeston parish and part of [[Chilwell]], was promoted by the [[Labourer's Friend Society]] in the 1840s as plots for cottages with allotments for the labouring poor. The scheme failed and the area now consists mostly of Victorian and Edwardian houses laid out along the parallel Park Road and Grove Avenue and the two short cross streets Cedar Road and North Drive. The area retains a leafy character and the roads remain unkerbed. It has been a conservation area since 2008.<ref>[http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236  Cottage Grove Conservation Area description \u2013 Broxtowe Borough Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918015056/http://www.broxtowe.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4236 |date=18 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n====The Estates today====\nSome areas originally developed by the Land Societies have been spoiled where original plots have been subdivided and more modern properties built in styles not in keeping with the original buildings. Many properties in the Imperial Park and Bellvue Estates have lost their original elegance with the lowering of chimney stacks, inappropriate replacement of windows and doors with modern PVC, the loss of hedged fronts to brick walls or fencing, and paving over front gardens for parking.\n\n===Other development===\n[[File:ChilwellRoadMethodistChurch.JPG|thumb|Methodist Church on Chilwell Road]]\n[[File:BeestonBaptistChurch.jpg|thumb|left|Baptist Church on Dovecote Lane, formerly known as John Clifford Baptist Church]]\nA [[Chilwell Road Methodist Church|particularly fine Methodist Church]] was built by the architect W.
