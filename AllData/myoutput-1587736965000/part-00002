Started in 1990 as the output of a research project, the charity soon grew in response to the demand from schools and funders.\n\nLtL was a founding partner of  the Scottish 'Grounds for Learning Project' funded by [[Scottish Natural Heritage]]. Scottish Natural Heritage has remained a main partner of LtL in Scotland for 25 years. Grounds for Learning was re-named 'LtL Scotland' in 2019 and maintains an office in [[Stirling]].\n\nLearning through Landscapes has been involved with a number of projects including: Local School Nature Grants (in partnership with Peoples Postcode Lottery)ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ltl.org.uk/projects/local-school-nature-grants/ |title=Local School Nature Grants |publisher=LtL |date= |accessdate=2017-03-07}}</ref>, Outdoor Classroom Day (UK & Ireland) {{url|https://www.ltl.org.uk/projects/outdoor-classroom-day/}}, Living through Landscapes (dementia friendly gardens) {{url|https://www.ltl.org.uk/projects/living-through-landscapes/}}, Woodland Play {{url|https://www.ltl.org.uk/projects/woodland-play/}}  The Scottish Natural Play project, Fruitfull Schools {{url|https://www.ltl.org.uk/projects/fruit-full-schools/}}, Fruitful Communities {{url|https://www.ltl.org.uk/projects/fruit-full-communities/}} and Polli:Nation {{url|https://www.ltl.org.uk/projects/pollination/}}. \n\nLtL offers many free outdoor lesson ideas {{url|https://www.ltl.org.uk/free-resources/}}, outdoor learning training and advice.
