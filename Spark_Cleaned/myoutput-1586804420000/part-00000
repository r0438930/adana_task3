Allen was influenced by music his father listened to [[J\u00f9j\u00fa music|J\u00f9j\u00fa]], a popular [[Yoruba music|Yoruba]] music from the 1940s, but also American jazz, and the growing [[highlife]] scene in Nigeria and Ghana. Allen worked hard to develop a unique voice on the drums, feverishly studying LPs and magazine articles by [[Max Roach]] and [[Art Blakey]], but also revolutionary Ghanaian drummer [[Guy Warren]] (later known as [[Kofi Ghanaba]] \u2013 who developed a highly sought-after sound that mixed tribal Ghanaian drumming with bop \u2013 working with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Thelonious Monk]], and [[Max Roach]]).\n\nAllen was hired by [[Victor Olaiya|\"Sir\" Victor Olaiya]] to play [[claves]] with his highlife band, the Cool Cats. Allen was able to fill the drum set chair when the former Cool Cats drummer left the band. Allen later played with Agu Norris and the Heatwaves, the Nigerian Messengers, and the Melody Makers.\n\n==Fela and Africa '70==\nIn 1964, [[Fela Kuti]] invited Allen to audition for a jazz-highlife band he was forming. Kuti and Allen had played together as sidemen in the Lagos circuit. Fela complimented Allen's unique sound: \"How come you are the only guy in Nigeria who plays like this \u2013 jazz and highlife?\" Thus Allen became an original member of Kuti's \"Koola Lobitos\" highlife-jazz band.\n\nIn 1969, following a turbulent and educational trip to the United States, Fela and the newly renamed Africa '70 band developed a new militant African sound, mixing the heavy groove and universal appeal of soul with jazz, highlife, and the [[polyrhythm]]ic template of Yoruba conventions. Allen developed a novel style to complement Fela's new African groove that blended these disparate genres.\n\nAllen recounts how he and Fela wrote in 1970: \"Fela used to write out the parts for all the musicians in the band (Africa '70). I was the only one who originated the music I played. Fela would ask what type of rhythm I wanted to play.\u2026 You can tell a good drummer because we\u2026 have four limbs\u2026 and they are\u2026 playing different things\u2026 the patterns don't just come from Yoruba\u2026 [but] other parts of Nigeria and Africa.\"<ref>Graeme Ewens, ''Africa O-Ye!'', 1991.</ref>\n\nAllen recorded more than 30 albums with Fela and Africa '70. But by the late 1970s, dissension was growing in the ranks of Africa '70. Arguments over royalties/pay and recognition grew in intensity. As inventor of the rhythms that underpinned Afrobeat and musical director, Allen felt especially slighted. Fela stood his ground, stating that he would get the royalties for his songs. Fela did support Allen's three solo recordings: ''Jealousy'' ('75), ''Progress'' ('77), ''No Accommodation For Lagos'' ('79), but by 1979, Allen chose to leave Africa '70, taking many members with him. \"'What makes me decide it's time to go? It's \u2026 everything...and (his) carelessness...like he doesn't care, like he doesn't know ...he doesn't feel he's done anything (wrong). And with all the parasites around too.... there were 71 people on tour by now and only 30 working in the band....you got to ask why. Those guys were sapping Fela of his Force, of his Music.' So Tony moved on, once again in search of his own sound.\"\n\n==Afrobeat to Afrofunk==\nAllen formed his own group, recording ''No Discrimination'' in 1980, and performing in Lagos until emigrating to London in 1984. Later moving to Paris, Allen recorded with [[King Sunny Ad\u00e9]], [[Ray Lema]] and [[Manu Dibango]]. Allen recorded ''N.E.P.A.'' in 1985.\n\nPost-Fela, Allen developed a hybrid sound, deconstructing and fusing Afrobeat with [[electronica]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[R&B]], and [[Hip hop music|rap]]. Allen refers to this synthesis as ''afrofunk''.\n\nAllen returned with a much anticipated new project for his 13th release. Recorded live in Lagos, with a full-sized Afrobeat band, ''Lagos No Shaking'' (Lagos is OK) signified Allen's return to roots Afrobeat after forays into avant-garde electronica hybrids. ''Lagos No Shaking'' was released on 13 June 2006.\n\n==Current work==\nIn 2002, Allen appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Red Hot and Riot]]'' in tribute to [[Fela Kuti]]. Allen appeared alongside [[Res (singer)|Res]], [[Ray Lema]], [[Baaba Maal]], [[Positive Black Soul]] and [[Archie Shepp]] on a track entitled \"No Agreement.\"\n\nAllen played drums throughout the 2003 album ''Love Trap'' by [[Susheela Raman]] and has also performed with her live.\n\nIn 2004 Allen recorded with French electronic artist [[S\u00e9bastien Tellier]] on the album ''[[Politics (S\u00e9bastien Tellier album)|Politics]]'' including the hit song \"[[La Ritournelle]]\".\n\nIn 2006, Allen joined with [[Damon Albarn]], [[Paul Simonon]], and [[Simon Tong]] as drummer for [[The Good, the Bad & the Queen]].\n\nAllen plays drums on two tracks on the 2007 album ''5:55'' by [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]: \"5:55\" and \"Night-Time Intermission\", backed by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] and [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].\n\nHe also made an appearance playing the drums in the video for \"[[Once Upon a Time (Air song)|Once Upon a Time]]\" by French duo [[Air (French band)|Air]] in late 2007.\n\nHe has been a featured artist on [[Zap Mama]]'s albums ''Supermoon'' (2007) and ''ReCreation'' (2009), adding his voice to the tracks \"1000 Ways\" and \"African Diamond.\"\nAllen also contributed drums on \"People Dansa\", an afrobeat rhythm-fuelled track on the second album of the Brazilian singer Flavia Coelho, released in 2014.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNHZTAXLp5U \"FLAVIA COELHO - Les Musiciens du 2e Album 'Mundo Meu'\".]</ref>\n\nHis album entitled ''Secret Agent'' was released in June 2009 by [[World Circuit (record label)|World Circuit]].<ref>[http://musicfeeds.com.au/music/tony-allen/ Tony Allen \u2013 Feature \u2013 Musicfeeds.com.au].
