It has a total land area of 15.96 square kilometers.\n\nMalabon is part of the sub-region of Metro Manila informally called CAMANAVA, which consists of [[Caloocan|'''CA'''loocan]], '''MA'''labon, [[Navotas|'''NA'''votas]], and [[Valenzuela, Philippines|'''VA'''lenzuela]] cities. Caloocan lies to the south and east, Navotas to the west, and Valenzuela to the north. Malabon also borders the town of [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]] in the province of [[Bulacan]] to the northwest.\n\n==History==\nLegend considers the city's name to be a contraction of the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] phrase ''maraming lab\u00f3ng'' (\"plenty of [[bamboo shoot]]s\"), as the place once abounded in this edible root. Originally called '''Tambobong''' (an early Tagalog word for barn made of bamboo<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hispanicindio.wordpress.com/2020/01/12/when-malabon-was-the-half-mestizo-tambobong/|title=When Malabon was the Half-Mestizo Tambobong|last=Filipina|first=Hispanidad|date=2020-01-12|website=The Hispanic Indio|language=en|access-date=2020-01-19}}</ref>), Malabon was founded as a ''visita'' (hamlet) of Tondo by the [[Order of Saint Augustine|Augustinian]]s on May 21, 1599. It remained under the administrative jurisdiction of the [[Manila (province)|Province of Tondo]] from 1627 to 1688.\n\nMalabon played an important economic role in the late 19th century with the founding of [[La Princesa Tabacalera]] tobacco company in 1851 and the [[Malabon Sugar Company]] in 1878. La Princesa was under the corporate umbrella of [[Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas]] (owned by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]]), while the latter pioneered the [[refined sugar]] industry in the Philippines.\n\nThe newspaper ''La Independencia'' was first printed in Malabon's ''Asilo de Hu\u00e9rfanos'' (Orphanage), where children orphaned by the Plague of 1882 were housed.<ref>[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police03_april01_2006 manilastandardtoday.com, Malabon City: A sight of progress]</ref><ref>[http://wikimapia.org/576454/Malabon-City-Hall wikimapia.org, Malabon City Hall]</ref>\n\nMalabon was officially made a municipality of the newly created [[Province of Rizal]] on June 11, 1901 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 137.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/act137.html|title=An Act Extending the Provisions of the Provincial Government Act to the Province of Rizal|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> When Act No. 942 was promulgated, Malabon was united with [[Navotas]] under a new government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/act942.html|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> On January 16, 1906, Act No. 1441 partitioned Malabon from Navotas into two separate municipalities of Rizal. The first Mayor of Malabon was ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' Agust\u00edn Salamante, a Spanish ''[[Filipino mestizo|mestizo]]'' originally from [[Cavite]]. The first Filipino Mayor of Malabon was Don Vicente P. Villongco. This was in 1899 at the onset of the American regime.\n\nMalabon remained a municipality of [[Rizal]] until November 7, 1975, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824, when Malabon became a part of Metropolitan Manila or the [[National Capital Region]]. Malabon became a highly urbanized city on April 21, 2001, under Republic Act No. 9019, 407 years after its founding.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Geography==\nMalabon is one of the most densely populated cities in the Philippines and its low-lying, flat terrain makes it prone to frequent flooding, especially during high tides, heavy rains and when river and dams overflow. The four cities in CAMANAVA are commonly affected by interconnected rivers, one of which is the Tullahan River.\n\nThe river system used to be navigable and fishing was the major livelihood activity in the area. The river used to be wider and deeper with better quality water, and was a regular source of different species of fish, an important food source for local residents. Also, trees and crops like palay (rice) and vegetables used to be grown along the riverbanks. However, these agricultural plots have been replaced by industrial yards, which also became home to thousands of informal settlers who built makeshift dwellings without legal claim to the land.\n\nFloods have worsened in recent years, occurring more frequently and reaching depths of several feet. Most affected are families in the communities that are along or near the riverbanks. The river has become narrower and shallower over the years, and its capacity to hold water has decreased. With more frequent intense rains, the riverbanks flood regularly and flooding reaches farther into low-lying and densely populated areas of the city<ref>[http://cdkn.org/resource/understanding-risk-flooding-barangay-potrero-metro-manila/?loclang=en_gb CDKN INSIDE STORY: Understanding the risk of flooding in the city: The case of Barangay Potrero, Metro Manila]</ref>\n\n===Barangays===\n[[File:Ph fil malabon barangays.png|thumb|right|250px|Political map of Malabon]]\nBefore the present-day Malabon, the town was originally composed of [[sitios]] (barangay) and others were further divided into two or more [[purok]] (zone).\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=28em|\n*Baritan\n*Bayan-bayanan\n*Concepcion\n*Dampalit\n*Hulong Duhat\n*Flores\n*Ibaba\n*Maysilo\n*Panghulo\n*Santulan\n*San Agustin\n*Ta\u00f1ong\n*Tonsuya\n*Niugan\n*Longos\n*Tinajeros\n*Catmon\n*Potrero\n}}\n\nMalabon City is now divided into 21 barangays.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n![[Barangay]]s\n![[District#Philippines|District]]\n![[List of Philippine provinces by population|Population]]<ref>[https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/hsd/pressrelease/National%20Capital%20Region.pdf]</ref>\n![[Area]] ([[Square kilometre|km\u00b2]])<ref>http://malabon.gov.ph/transparency-seal/cdp%202012-2014.pdf</ref>\n![[Population density|Density]] (/km\u00b2)\n![[List of ZIP codes in the Philippines|Zip Code]]\n|-\n|Baritan\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,476\n|align=right|33.01\n|align=right|347.65\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Bayan-bayanan\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|7,326\n|align=right|8.46\n|align=right|865.96\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Catmon\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|36,450\n|align=right|97.77\n|align=right|372.81\n|align=right|1470\n|-\n|Concepcion\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,806\n|align=right|33.97\n|align=right|347.54\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Dampalit\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,245\n|align=right|261.90\n|align=right|42.94\n|align=right|1480\n|-\n|Flores\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|4,282\n|align=right|9.00\n|align=right|475.78\n|align=right|1471\n|-\n|Hulong Duhat\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|10,466\n|align=right|56.61\n|align=right|184.88\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Ibaba\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|7,630\n|align=right|16.56\n|align=right|460.75\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Maysilo\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,213\n|align=right|126.53\n|align=right|88.62\n|align=right|1477\n|-\n|Muzon\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|5,689\n|align=right|49.71\n|align=right|114.44\n|align=right|1479\n|-\n|Niugan\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|5,936\n|align=right|31.38\n|align=right|189.17\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Panghulo\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|12,772\n|align=right|121.53\n|align=right|105.09\n|align=right|\n|-\n|San Agustin\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,156\n|align=right|31.59\n|align=right|353.14\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Santolan\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|15,872\n|align=right|46.85\n|align=right|338.78\n|align=right|1478\n|-\n|Ta\u00f1ong ([[Poblacion]])\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|14,620\n|align=right|33.83\n|align=right|432.16\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Acacia\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|5,735\n|align=right|19.54\n|align=right|293.50\n|align=right|1474\n|-\n|Longos\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|48,039\n|align=right|89.99\n|align=right|533.83\n|align=right|1472\n|-\n|Potrero\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|41,407\n|align=right|302.71\n|align=right|136.79\n|align=right|1475\n|-\n|Tinajeros\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|17,901\n|align=right|84.78\n|align=right|211.15\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Tonsuya\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|39,354\n|align=right|59.40\n|align=right|662.53\n|align=right|1473\n|-\n|Tugatog\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|22,960\n|align=right|55.40\n|align=right|414.44\n|align=right|\n|}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Malabon\n| 1903 = 20136\n| 1918 = 21695\n| 1939 = 33285\n| 1948 = 46455\n| 1960 = 76438\n| 1970 = 141514\n| 1975 = 174878\n| 1980 = 191001\n| 1990 = 280027\n| 1995 = 347484\n| 2000 = 338855\n| 2007 = 363681\n| 2010 = 353337\n| 2015 = 365525\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Immaculate Concepcion Parish Malabon.JPG|thumb|160x160px|La Inmaculada Concepcion de Malabon Parish]]\n{{See also|Religion in the Philippines|List of Roman Catholic churches in Metro Manila}}\nMalabon belongs to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Diocese of Kalookan under the episcopal seat of Bishop Pablo Virgilo David.

La Princesa was under the corporate umbrella of [[Compa\u00f1ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas]] (owned by the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish Crown]]), while the latter pioneered the [[refined sugar]] industry in the Philippines.\n\nThe newspaper ''La Independencia'' was first printed in Malabon's ''Asilo de Hu\u00e9rfanos'' (Orphanage), where children orphaned by the Plague of 1882 were housed.<ref>[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=police03_april01_2006 manilastandardtoday.com, Malabon City: A sight of progress]</ref><ref>[http://wikimapia.org/576454/Malabon-City-Hall wikimapia.org, Malabon City Hall]</ref>\n\nMalabon was officially made a municipality of the newly created [[Province of Rizal]] on June 11, 1901 by virtue of Philippine Commission Act No. 137.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/act137.html|title=An Act Extending the Provisions of the Provincial Government Act to the Province of Rizal|publisher=LawPH.com|accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> When Act No. 942 was promulgated, Malabon was united with [[Navotas]] under a new government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/act942.html|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-12}}</ref> On January 16, 1906, Act No. 1441 partitioned Malabon from Navotas into two separate municipalities of Rizal. The first Mayor of Malabon was ''[[Don (honorific)|Don]]'' Agust\u00edn Salamante, a Spanish ''[[Filipino mestizo|mestizo]]'' originally from [[Cavite]]. The first Filipino Mayor of Malabon was Don Vicente P. Villongco. This was in 1899 at the onset of the American regime.\n\nMalabon remained a municipality of [[Rizal]] until November 7, 1975, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824, when Malabon became a part of Metropolitan Manila or the [[National Capital Region]]. Malabon became a highly urbanized city on April 21, 2001, under Republic Act No. 9019, 407 years after its founding.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Geography==\nMalabon is one of the most densely populated cities in the Philippines and its low-lying, flat terrain makes it prone to frequent flooding, especially during high tides, heavy rains and when river and dams overflow. The four cities in CAMANAVA are commonly affected by interconnected rivers, one of which is the Tullahan River.\n\nThe river system used to be navigable and fishing was the major livelihood activity in the area. The river used to be wider and deeper with better quality water, and was a regular source of different species of fish, an important food source for local residents. Also, trees and crops like palay (rice) and vegetables used to be grown along the riverbanks. However, these agricultural plots have been replaced by industrial yards, which also became home to thousands of informal settlers who built makeshift dwellings without legal claim to the land.\n\nFloods have worsened in recent years, occurring more frequently and reaching depths of several feet. Most affected are families in the communities that are along or near the riverbanks. The river has become narrower and shallower over the years, and its capacity to hold water has decreased. With more frequent intense rains, the riverbanks flood regularly and flooding reaches farther into low-lying and densely populated areas of the city<ref>[http://cdkn.org/resource/understanding-risk-flooding-barangay-potrero-metro-manila/?loclang=en_gb CDKN INSIDE STORY: Understanding the risk of flooding in the city: The case of Barangay Potrero, Metro Manila]</ref>\n\n===Barangays===\n[[File:Ph fil malabon barangays.png|thumb|right|250px|Political map of Malabon]]\nBefore the present-day Malabon, the town was originally composed of [[sitios]] (barangay) and others were further divided into two or more [[purok]] (zone).\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=28em|\n*Baritan\n*Bayan-bayanan\n*Concepcion\n*Dampalit\n*Hulong Duhat\n*Flores\n*Ibaba\n*Maysilo\n*Panghulo\n*Santulan\n*San Agustin\n*Ta\u00f1ong\n*Tonsuya\n*Niugan\n*Longos\n*Tinajeros\n*Catmon\n*Potrero\n}}\n\nMalabon City is now divided into 21 barangays.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:90%\"\n|- style=\"font-size:100%;\"\n![[Barangay]]s\n![[District#Philippines|District]]\n![[List of Philippine provinces by population|Population]]<ref>[https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/hsd/pressrelease/National%20Capital%20Region.pdf]</ref>\n![[Area]] ([[Square kilometre|km\u00b2]])<ref>http://malabon.gov.ph/transparency-seal/cdp%202012-2014.pdf</ref>\n![[Population density|Density]] (/km\u00b2)\n![[List of ZIP codes in the Philippines|Zip Code]]\n|-\n|Baritan\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,476\n|align=right|33.01\n|align=right|347.65\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Bayan-bayanan\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|7,326\n|align=right|8.46\n|align=right|865.96\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Catmon\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|36,450\n|align=right|97.77\n|align=right|372.81\n|align=right|1470\n|-\n|Concepcion\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,806\n|align=right|33.97\n|align=right|347.54\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Dampalit\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,245\n|align=right|261.90\n|align=right|42.94\n|align=right|1480\n|-\n|Flores\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|4,282\n|align=right|9.00\n|align=right|475.78\n|align=right|1471\n|-\n|Hulong Duhat\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|10,466\n|align=right|56.61\n|align=right|184.88\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Ibaba\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|7,630\n|align=right|16.56\n|align=right|460.75\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Maysilo\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,213\n|align=right|126.53\n|align=right|88.62\n|align=right|1477\n|-\n|Muzon\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|5,689\n|align=right|49.71\n|align=right|114.44\n|align=right|1479\n|-\n|Niugan\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|5,936\n|align=right|31.38\n|align=right|189.17\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Panghulo\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|12,772\n|align=right|121.53\n|align=right|105.09\n|align=right|\n|-\n|San Agustin\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|11,156\n|align=right|31.59\n|align=right|353.14\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Santolan\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|15,872\n|align=right|46.85\n|align=right|338.78\n|align=right|1478\n|-\n|Ta\u00f1ong ([[Poblacion]])\n|align=center|1st\n|align=right|14,620\n|align=right|33.83\n|align=right|432.16\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Acacia\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|5,735\n|align=right|19.54\n|align=right|293.50\n|align=right|1474\n|-\n|Longos\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|48,039\n|align=right|89.99\n|align=right|533.83\n|align=right|1472\n|-\n|Potrero\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|41,407\n|align=right|302.71\n|align=right|136.79\n|align=right|1475\n|-\n|Tinajeros\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|17,901\n|align=right|84.78\n|align=right|211.15\n|align=right|\n|-\n|Tonsuya\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|39,354\n|align=right|59.40\n|align=right|662.53\n|align=right|1473\n|-\n|Tugatog\n|align=center|2nd\n|align=right|22,960\n|align=right|55.40\n|align=right|414.44\n|align=right|\n|}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Malabon\n| 1903 = 20136\n| 1918 = 21695\n| 1939 = 33285\n| 1948 = 46455\n| 1960 = 76438\n| 1970 = 141514\n| 1975 = 174878\n| 1980 = 191001\n| 1990 = 280027\n| 1995 = 347484\n| 2000 = 338855\n| 2007 = 363681\n| 2010 = 353337\n| 2015 = 365525\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Immaculate Concepcion Parish Malabon.JPG|thumb|160x160px|La Inmaculada Concepcion de Malabon Parish]]\n{{See also|Religion in the Philippines|List of Roman Catholic churches in Metro Manila}}\nMalabon belongs to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Diocese of Kalookan under the episcopal seat of Bishop Pablo Virgilo David.
