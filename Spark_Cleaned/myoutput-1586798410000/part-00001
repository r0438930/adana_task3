On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei.

In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\n\nBefore construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan. \n\nThe project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway]] with the [[Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway]] into the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway]], making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862}}}}) in name and in fact.\n\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Li Rui wen ji.|last=1917-|first=Li, Rui|last2=1917-|first2=\u674e\u9510|date=2007|publisher=Xianggang she hui ke xue jiao yu chu ban you xian gong si|isbn=9789889958114|location=[Xianggang]|pages=|oclc=688480117}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the [[Wuhan Incident]] (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas W.

In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river.

Also during this period foreign powers extracted mercantile concessions, with the riverfront of Hankou being divided up into foreign-controlled merchant districts. These districts contained trading firm offices, warehouses, and docking facilities.

During the [[Second Opium War]] (known in the West as the Arrow War, 1856\u20131860), the government of the Qing dynasty was defeated by the western powers and signed the [[Treaties of Tianjin]] and the [[Convention of Peking]], which stipulated eleven cities or regions (including Hankou) as trading ports. In December 1858, [[James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin]], High Commissioner to China, led four warships up the Yangtze River in Wuhan to collect the information needed for opening the trading port in Wuhan.\n\nIn the spring of 1861, Counselor Harry Parkes and Admiral Herbert were sent to Wuhan to open a trading port. On the basis of the Convention of Peking, Harry Parkes concluded the Hankou Lend-Lease Treaty with Guan Wen, the governor-general of Hunan and Hubei.

He governed the province for 18 years, until 1907. During this period, he elucidated the theory of \"Chinese learning as the basis, Western learning for application,\" known as the ti-yong ideal. He set up many heavy industries, founded Hanyang Steel Plant, [[Huangshi|Daye]] Iron Mine, Pingxiang Coal Mine and Hubei Arsenal and set up local textile industries, boosting the flourishing modern industry in Wuhan. Meanwhile, he initiated education reform, opened dozens of modern educational organizations successively, such as Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) Academy of Classical Learning, Civil General Institute, Military General Institute, Foreign Languages Institute and Lianghu (Hunan and Hubei) General Normal School, and selected a great many students for study overseas, which well promoted the development of China's modern education.

On October 24, while overseeing the waters of the Yangtze River near the town of Jinkou (Jiangxia District in Wuhan) in Wuchang, the KMT [[gunboat]] ''[[Chinese gunboat Chung Shan|Zhongshan]]'' came up against six Japanese aircraft. Though two were eventually shot down, the ''Zhongshan'' sank with 25 casualties. Raised from the bottom of the Yangtze River in 1997, and restored at a local shipyard, the ''Zhongshan'' has been moved to a purpose-built museum in Wuhan's suburban [[Jiangxia District]], which opened on September 26, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newscontent.cctv.com/news.jsp?fileId=117667|title=HOME-CCTVPLUS|website=newscontent.cctv.com}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAs a key center on the Yangtze, Wuhan was an important base for Japanese operations in China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 18, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218210230/http://www.chinaww2.com/2015/09/12/the-us-firebombing-of-wuhan-part-1/ |archive-date=February 18, 2018 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 18 December 1944, Wuhan was bombed by 77 American bombers that set off a firestorm that destroyed much of the city.<ref name=\"Fenby, Jonathan page 447\">Fenby, Jonathan ''Chiang Kai-Shek China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost'', New York: Carroll & Graf, 2004 page 447.</ref> For the next three days, Wuhan was bombed by the Americans, destroying all of the docks and warehouses of Wuhan, as well as the Japanese air bases in the city.

From June to September 1954, the [[1954 Yangtze River floods|Yangtze River Floods]] were a series of catastrophic floodings that occurred mostly in Hubei Province. Due to an unusually high volume of precipitation as well as an extraordinarily long rainy season in the middle stretch of the Yangtze River late in the spring of 1954, the river started to rise above its usual level in around late June. In 1969, a large stone monument was erected in the riverside park in Hankou honoring the heroic deeds in fighting the 1954 Yangtze River floods.\n\nBefore construction of the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], [[Hunslet Engine Company]] built two extra heavy [[0-8-0]] locomotives for loading the [[Train ferry|train ferries]] for crossing the Yangtze River in Wuhan. \n\nThe project of building the [[Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge]], also known as the First Yangtze River Bridge, was regarded as one of the key projects during the first five-year plan. On October 25, 1955, construction began on the bridge proper. The same day in 1957, the whole project was completed and an opening-to-traffic ceremony was held on October 15. The First Yangtze River Bridge united the [[Beijing\u2013Hankou Railway]] with the [[Guangdong\u2013Hankou Railway]] into the [[Beijing\u2013Guangzhou Railway]], making Wuhan a 'thoroughfare to nine provinces' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|\u4e5d\u7701\u901a\u8862}}}}) in name and in fact.\n\nAfter Chengdu Conference, Mao went to Chongqing and Wuhan in April to inspect the countryside and factories. In Wuhan, he called all the leaders of provinces and municipalities who had not attended Chengdu Conference to report their work. Tian Jiaying, the secretary of Mao, said that Wuhan Conference was a supplement to Chengdu Conference.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|title=Li Rui wen ji.|last=1917-|first=Li, Rui|last2=1917-|first2=\u674e\u9510|date=2007|publisher=Xianggang she hui ke xue jiao yu chu ban you xian gong si|isbn=9789889958114|location=[Xianggang]|pages=|oclc=688480117}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1967, civil strife struck the city in the [[Wuhan Incident]] (\"July 20th Incident\"), an armed conflict between two hostile groups who were fighting for control over the city at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Thomas W.

In one legend, the Baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war. During his duty, the daughter ran away. Later, the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general, and when he realized that she was his daughter, he threw himself into the river out of shame. The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river.
