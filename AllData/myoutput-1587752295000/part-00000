{"title_page": "Cordilleran ice sheet", "text_new": "[[File:Map missoula floods.gif|thumb|right|350 px|Southern edge of the ice sheet. It extended north along the Pacific coast and covered the Alaska Peninsula.]]\n\nThe '''Cordilleran ice sheet''' was a major [[ice sheet]] that periodically covered large parts of [[North America]] during glacial periods over the last ~2.6 million years. This included the following areas:\n\n*[[Western Montana]]\n*The [[Idaho Panhandle]]\n*Northern [[Washington (state)|Washington state]] down to about [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]\n*All of [[British Columbia]]\n*The southwestern third or so of [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]\n*All of the [[Southeast Alaska|Alaska Panhandle]]\n*[[South Central Alaska]]\n*The [[Alaska Peninsula]]\n*Almost all of the [[continental shelf]] north of the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]\n\nThe ice sheet covered up to 2.5 million square kilometres at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] and probably more than that in some previous periods, when it may have extended into the northeast extremity of [[Oregon]] and the Salmon River Mountains in Idaho. It is probable, though, that its northern margin also migrated south due to the influence of [[starvation (glaciology)|starvation]] caused by very low levels of precipitation.\n\nAt its eastern end the Cordilleran ice sheet merged with the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] at the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]], forming an area of ice that contained one and a half times as much water as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]] does today. At its western end it is currently understood that several small glacial [[Last Glacial Maximum refugia|refugia]] existed during the last glacial maximum below present [[sea level]] in the now-submerged [[Hecate Strait]] and on the [[Brooks Peninsula]] in northern [[Vancouver Island]]. However, evidence of ice-free refugia above present sea level north of the [[Olympic Peninsula]] has been refuted by genetic and geological studies since the middle 1990s. The ice sheet faded north of the [[Alaska Range]] because the climate was too dry to form [[glaciers]].\n\nUnlike the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which is believed to have taken as much as eleven thousand years to fully melt, it is believed the Cordilleran ice sheet, except for areas that remain glaciated today, melted very quickly, probably in four thousand years or less. This rapid melting caused such [[floods]] as the overflow of [[Lake Missoula]] and shaped the topography of the extremely fertile [[Inland Empire (Pacific Northwest)|Inland Empire]] of [[Eastern Washington]].\n\n==Sea levels during glaciation==\n\nBecause of the weight of the ice, the mainland of northwest North America was so depressed that sea levels at the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] were over a hundred metres higher than they are today (measured by the level of [[bedrock]]).\n\nHowever, on the western edge at the [[Haida Gwaii]] (formerly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands), the lower thickness of the ice sheet meant that sea levels were as much as 170 metres lower than they are today, forming a  [[lake]] in the deepest parts of the strait. This was because the much greater thickness of the center of the ice sheet served to push upwards areas at the edge of the continental shelf in a glacial [[forebulge]]. The effect of this during [[deglaciation]] was that sea levels on the edge of the ice sheet, which naturally deglaciated first, initially rose due to an increase in the volume of water, but later fell due to rebound after deglaciation. Some underwater features along the [[Pacific Northwest]] were exposed because of the lower sea levels, including [[Bowie Seamount]] west of Haida Gwaii which has been interpreted as an active volcanic island throughout the last ice age.\n\nThese effects are important because they have been used to explain how migrants to North America from [[Beringia]] were able to travel southward during the deglaciation process due purely to the exposure of submerged land between the mainland and numerous continental islands. They are also important for understanding the direction [[evolution]] has taken since the ice retreated.\n\nEven today, the region is notable for its rapid changes in sea level, which, however, have little effect on most of the coast due to the numerous [[fjords]].\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Geography of Canada]]\n* [[Ice sheet]]\n\n==References==\n* Hidy, A.
