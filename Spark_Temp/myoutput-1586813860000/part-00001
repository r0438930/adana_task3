Both newspapers published articles and a pixelated image between 12 and 19 February 2006 of what they claimed were a [[Premier League|Premiership]] [[Association football|footballer]] and a famous [[DJ]] engaging in a sex act with a [[mobile phone]] at a \"gay orgy\" with one using the headline \"Gay as You Go\". A week later ''PinkNews'' published what was claimed to be the [[Pixelation|unpixelated]] image from the [[Choice FM]] website superimposed on one from the printed articles in the newspapers, allegedly revealing the footballer as [[Ashley Cole]] and the DJ as Choice FM's Ian Thompson (DJ Masterstepz). Cole began legal action against both newspapers for libel, harassment and \"false privacy\" but not against ''PinkNews'', who had never made claims that either were gay. ''PinkNews'' claimed they were trying to expose the tactics of the ''NotW'' rather than \"[[Outing|out]]\" anyone but this backfired as both newspapers threatened to sue under the [[Theft Act 1978|Civil Liability Act]].\nCole's solicitors set up an online survey to investigate the impact, questioning respondents as to where they heard the story and if they discussed it in any forums. ''[[RWD Magazine]]'' allegedly had their forums shut down because of this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMonths later the ''NotW'' and ''The Sun'' agreed to pay damages of \u00a3100,000, which would have closed ''PinkNews'', had they been [[Indictment|indicted]], and an apology was printed in the ''NotW'' stating: \"Although the photograph was pixelated some readers have understood Mr Cole to be one of the footballers and Masterstepz to be the DJ concerned. We are happy to make clear that Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities. We apologise to them for any distress caused and we will be paying them each a sum in the way of damages.\" News International confirmed afterwards they would not be seeking damages from ''PinkNews''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Park |first=James |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/07/09/how-the-news-of-the-world-threatened-pinknews-after-ashley-cole-expose/ |title=How the News of the World threatened PinkNews after Ashley Cole expose |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=33515 |title=News of the World could sue website over Cole \"gay orgy\" story |publisher=Press Gazette |date=17 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/gay-news-site-threatened-if-ashley-cole-suit-succeeds/s2/a51765/ |title=Gay news site threatened if Ashley Cole suit succeeds &#124; Media news |publisher=Journalism.co.uk |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Stonewall==\n''PinkNews'' reported heavily on the refusal of [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], an LGBT rights group, to actively campaign for marriage equality.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall's Chief Executive [[Ben Summerskill]] suggested \"it would cost a staggering \u00a35 billion to implement\", a figure later seized upon by opponents of equality despite its lack of factual basis. The rift came to a head at Liberal Democrats conference in 2010, where Summerskill argued that \"there are lots of lesbians who actually don't want marriage\". The event was attended by [[Lynne Featherstone]], the minister for equality; [[Evan Harris]], president of Liberal Democrat LGBT group [[LGBT+ Liberal Democrats|DELGA]]; and [[Steve Gilbert]], the Lib Dem MP, all of which said they support same-sex marriage. A poll commissioned by ''PinkNews'' and answered by more than 800 of their readership found 98% in support of marriage equality, with many comments calling for Summerskill's resignation.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall was also criticised by a former founder, [[Michael Cashman|Michael Cashman, MEP]], over its policy.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Andrew|title=What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/stonewall-gay-marriage-21378.html|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=LibDemVoice.org|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nSummerskill later accused ''PinkNews'' of running an \"unethical campaign\u201d against Stonewall after asking every LGBT organisation and political group to outline their stance on the issue, with only Stonewall refusing to comment. In October 2010, Stonewall revised its policy and agreed to support same-sex marriage, stating \"Stonewall is pleased to be widening its campaigning objectives to include extending the legal form of marriage to gay people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20101204165931/http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2010 |title=Stonewall undermines campaign for gay marriage |publisher=Peter Tatchell |accessdate=22 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Geen |first=Jessica |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/10/27/stonewall-says-it-will-campaign-for-gay-marriage/ |title=Stonewall says it will campaign for gay marriage |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n''PinkNews'' also regularly reported on criticism of Stonewall for its refusal to campaign on transgender issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/11/07/celebs-split-over-trans-protests-at-stonewall-awards/|title=Celebs split over trans protest at Stonewall Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> PinkNews has collaborated closely with Stonewall following the departure of Summerskill in 2014.

Both newspapers published articles and a pixelated image between 12 and 19 February 2006 of what they claimed were a [[Premier League|Premiership]] [[Association football|footballer]] and a famous [[DJ]] engaging in a sex act with a [[mobile phone]] at a \"gay orgy\" with one using the headline \"Gay as You Go\". A week later ''PinkNews'' published what was claimed to be the [[Pixelation|unpixelated]] image from the [[Choice FM]] website superimposed on one from the printed articles in the newspapers, allegedly revealing the footballer as [[Ashley Cole]] and the DJ as Choice FM's Ian Thompson (DJ Masterstepz). Cole began legal action against both newspapers for libel, harassment and \"false privacy\" but not against ''PinkNews'', who had never made claims that either were gay. ''PinkNews'' claimed they were trying to expose the tactics of the ''NotW'' rather than \"[[Outing|out]]\" anyone but this backfired as both newspapers threatened to sue under the [[Theft Act 1978|Civil Liability Act]].\nCole's solicitors set up an online survey to investigate the impact, questioning respondents as to where they heard the story and if they discussed it in any forums. ''[[RWD Magazine]]'' allegedly had their forums shut down because of this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMonths later the ''NotW'' and ''The Sun'' agreed to pay damages of \u00a3100,000, which would have closed ''PinkNews'', had they been [[Indictment|indicted]], and an apology was printed in the ''NotW'' stating: \"Although the photograph was pixelated some readers have understood Mr Cole to be one of the footballers and Masterstepz to be the DJ concerned. We are happy to make clear that Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities. We apologise to them for any distress caused and we will be paying them each a sum in the way of damages.\" News International confirmed afterwards they would not be seeking damages from ''PinkNews''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Park |first=James |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/07/09/how-the-news-of-the-world-threatened-pinknews-after-ashley-cole-expose/ |title=How the News of the World threatened PinkNews after Ashley Cole expose |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=33515 |title=News of the World could sue website over Cole \"gay orgy\" story |publisher=Press Gazette |date=17 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/gay-news-site-threatened-if-ashley-cole-suit-succeeds/s2/a51765/ |title=Gay news site threatened if Ashley Cole suit succeeds &#124; Media news |publisher=Journalism.co.uk |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Stonewall==\n''PinkNews'' reported heavily on the refusal of [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], an LGBT rights group, to actively campaign for marriage equality.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall's Chief Executive [[Ben Summerskill]] suggested \"it would cost a staggering \u00a35 billion to implement\", a figure later seized upon by opponents of equality despite its lack of factual basis. The rift came to a head at Liberal Democrats conference in 2010, where Summerskill argued that \"there are lots of lesbians who actually don't want marriage\". The event was attended by [[Lynne Featherstone]], the minister for equality; [[Evan Harris]], president of Liberal Democrat LGBT group [[LGBT+ Liberal Democrats|DELGA]]; and [[Steve Gilbert]], the Lib Dem MP, all of which said they support same-sex marriage. A poll commissioned by ''PinkNews'' and answered by more than 800 of their readership found 98% in support of marriage equality, with many comments calling for Summerskill's resignation.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall was also criticised by a former founder, [[Michael Cashman|Michael Cashman, MEP]], over its policy.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Andrew|title=What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/stonewall-gay-marriage-21378.html|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=LibDemVoice.org|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nSummerskill later accused ''PinkNews'' of running an \"unethical campaign\u201d against Stonewall after asking every LGBT organisation and political group to outline their stance on the issue, with only Stonewall refusing to comment. In October 2010, Stonewall revised its policy and agreed to support same-sex marriage, stating \"Stonewall is pleased to be widening its campaigning objectives to include extending the legal form of marriage to gay people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20101204165931/http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2010 |title=Stonewall undermines campaign for gay marriage |publisher=Peter Tatchell |accessdate=22 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Geen |first=Jessica |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/10/27/stonewall-says-it-will-campaign-for-gay-marriage/ |title=Stonewall says it will campaign for gay marriage |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n''PinkNews'' also regularly reported on criticism of Stonewall for its refusal to campaign on transgender issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/11/07/celebs-split-over-trans-protests-at-stonewall-awards/|title=Celebs split over trans protest at Stonewall Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> PinkNews has collaborated closely with Stonewall following the departure of Summerskill in 2014.
