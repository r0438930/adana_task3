The station is served by [[Sydney Trains]] [[North Shore, Northern & Western Line|T1 Western line]] services. The station marks the end of the four-track section of the Main Western line. It was designed by [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and was built in 1862. It is also known as '''St. Marys Railway Station Group''' and '''St Marys Railway Station'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] in the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1249>{{cite NSW SHR|5012221|St. Marys Railway Station Group|hr=01249|fn=10/01111|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSt. Marys station opened on 1 May 1862 as the interim terminus of the Main Western line when it was extended from [[Rooty Hill railway station|Rooty Hill]]. It was initially named South Creek, being renamed St Marys on 5 August 1885.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:St+Marys St Marys Station] NSWrail.net</ref> Prior to this a brick goods shed was built in the yard, which remains in the station precinct. A crane is also extant.<ref name=nswshr-1249/> On 19 January 1863, the line was extended to [[Penrith railway station, Sydney|Penrith]]. The line was duplicated in 1886. The Platform 3 & 4 building dates from 1888 and the contractor was John Ahearn & William King.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nMajor changes were made to the site in 1942-3, which included construction of the present signal box, the Platform 1 & 2 building, and the islanding of both platforms as well as the opening in stages of the [[Ropes Creek railway line|branch line]] to [[Ropes Creek (New South Wales)|Ropes Creek]]. These changes were one part of a much larger scheme to increase the tracks to four main lines between [[Lidcombe]] and St. Marys during [[World War II]] in order to provide maximum track capacity to the American ammunition and general store built at Ropes Creek. It took over 32 years until all aspects of the quadruplication were completed between [[Westmead, New South Wales|Westmead]] and [[Blacktown]]. Quadruplication reached St. Marys in 1978, while the [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]] to Westmead section was finally completed in 1986.<ref name=nswshr-1249/> The line closed in 1986, being truncated into two storage sidings at the western end of the station with the overhead wiring removed.\n\nThe signal box is of a select non-standard elevated electric power operated type and is only the second to be built at the station. It was constructed in 1942 to provide signal and track control on the main line and the then new branch line serving the wartime munitions factories at Dunheved and Ropes Creek. The signal box was the only example built during World War II to have a flat roof. The original electric control console and wall panel have been replaced.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nThe 1943 footbridge underwent major upgrading work in 1994-95, including covering the footbridge deck and stairs and a new overhead booking office designed by Spooner Harris & Associates. The 1995 works also involved replacing the canopy on the Platform 1 & 2 building.<ref name=nswshr-1249/> In March 1983, 40 people were injured when a suburban train failed to stop at the station and derailed at catch-points to the west of the station.<ref>\"Train derailment injures 40\" ''[[The Age]]'' 3 March 1983</ref>\n\nIn 2001 additional platform canopies were constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n==Future==\nA scoping study into rail investment to service [[Western Sydney]] and the proposed [[Western Sydney Airport]] was announced by the New South Wales and Australian governments in November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Western Sydney Airport|url=https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects-western-sydney-airport|publisher=Transport for NSW|accessdate=18 February 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201190430/https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects-western-sydney-airport|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The study's final report was released in March 2018 and included a proposal to construct a \"North-South Link\" from Schofields to Macarthur via the airport.<ref name=\"outcomes report\">{{cite web|title=Western Sydney Rail Needs Scoping Study Outcomes Report|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306142557/https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/system/files/media/documents/2018/wsrnsoutcome-report.pdf|publisher=Australian Government and New South Wales Government|accessdate=7 March 2018|pages=55\u201356|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the governments announced the development of a new rail line serving the airport. This line would form part of the North-South Link, running south from St Marys to the airport, before continuing on to the \"Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis\" - an area south of the airport. Funding for the line will be split 50:50 between the governments.<ref name=\"city deal march 2018\">{{cite web|title=Western Sydney City Deal to deliver rail, investment and jobs|url=https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/news-and-events/media-releases/western-sydney-city-deal-to-deliver-rail-investment-and-jobs|publisher=Transport for NSW|accessdate=6 March 2018|date=4 March 2018}}</ref> The line is likely to be constructed as a [[rapid transit|metro]] or [[light metro]].<ref name=\"outcomes report\" />\n\n== Description ==\nThe St Mary's Station complex includes:<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Station building on Platforms 3/4, type 3, brick, second class (1888)\n*Signal box - non-standard, platform structure (1942)\n*Goods [[shed]] - subtype 2, brick, side shed without [[awning]] ({{circa|1880}})\n*Two x island platforms (1888 & 1942-3)\n*Footbridge - steel, beam and [[column]] structure over the platforms (1942, 1994/5)\n*Crane - type 1, jib crane - 5 ton, iron, Gregory & Co, San Francisco (1943)\n\n===Platforms 3/4 building, 1888===\nExternal: St Marys station building is a type 3 second class station building and is constructed of brick with centrally located waiting room flanked by attached two small wings on both ends. The waiting room has no wall on the rail side and extends by a wide [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated metal]] awning supported on timber posts and beams featuring exposed [[rafter]]s and decorative timberboards at both ends. The street elevation of the waiting room consists of four vertically proportioned timber box framed windows and a door opening with no glass or door panels. Both wing rooms are locked and secured by security grills installed on both window and door openings. Each wing features one face brick tall [[chimney]] with corbelled top above the relatively new corrugated metal roof of the building. A pitched modern metal canopy with [[awnings]] on both elevations supported on steel frame and [[columns]] extends on Down and Up ends of the building.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nInternal: Internal access to the enclosed side wings was not possible, however they could be viewed from the windows and appear to have remained relatively intact. The central waiting room features painted brick walls, timber board ceiling lining and tile floor finish.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Signal box, 1942===\nExternal: A two-storey signal box accommodating the control room on the first floor level with staff amenities and the relay room on the ground floor. The timber framed walls are clad in flat asbestos cement sheets. The first floor roof, which is extended over the roof of the relay room together with the top roof are of flat membrane concealed behind wide moulded [[Fascia (architecture)|fascias]] that project over wide [[eaves]]. The control room has curved walls and aluminium curved windows at the western end. Ground floor doors and windows are timber framed. The box is situated at ground level a short distance from the western end of the station island platform. Designed by New South Wales Government Railways.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nInternal: The spaces are original but the electric control console and wall panel have been replaced in recent years by computerised console system placed behind a high bench. Access to the ground floor and relay room was not available. The curved observation windows of the control room have been covered by blinds from inside and metal sun control panel from outside as direct visual communication is no longer required.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Goods shed, {{circa|1880}}===\nExternal: A Subtype 2 rectangular face [[brickwork]] goods shed with corrugated metal pitched roof. It is the only brick example of a Subtype 2 shed and remains relatively intact. The shed features simply detailed timber bargeboards at both [[gable]] ends, semi-circular arched tall window openings (boarded externally) with cement rendered sills, flat cement rendered [[Lintel (architecture)|lintels]] and timber thresholds to two-panel timberboard loading doors on both station side and street side elevations, and a single segmental arched door on the western side facing the bus interchange. Facades of the Goods Shed are emphasised by recessed [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with dentilated tops around the arched windows. A brick platform with bullnosed capped brick [[retaining wall]]s along the edges and the sides of brick steps is located on the rail side of the Goods Shed.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nInternal: The Shed is essentially a large single space with exposed timber framed [[truss]] roof underneath of the corrugated metal roofing visible and timberboard flooring. Configuration of the multi-paned steel windows with [[fanlight]]s and toughened glazing is evident from the interior. The brick walls are painted. Horizontal steel mechanisms for the sliding loading doors cross over the fanlights of the windows.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Platforms, 1888 & 1942-3===\n2 island platforms with concrete faces and decks topped with asphalt finish. Corrugated metal pitched canopies supported on a steel beam and column frames provide protection over both platforms with the canopy on Platform 3/4 extending around the existing 1888 Waiting Room roof and awning, which remain visible above the new canopy. Modern timber bench seating, [[lighting]], amenities, vending machines and aluminium palisade fencing are other features on the platforms. Platforms are accessible via [[stairs]] and lift towers leading to the footbridge, where the 1995 overhead booking office and concourse are located. The 1995 corrugated metal canopy replaced the 1942 brick station building on Platform 1/2.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Footbridge, 1942===\nA modified standard footbridge with 1942 steel structural frame supported on steel columns. Sets of stairs to each street and platform provides access together with two modern lift towers at either end of the footbridge. Both sides of the footbridge, which accommodates the concourse and the overhead booking office, are enclosed by steel framed glass panels. The main space of the footbridge is covered by a corrugated metal [[hipped roof]] punctuated by ventilation [[gable]]s and a central tower element creating a common architectural language with the motor towers of the station lifts.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Crane (1943)===\nA type 1 jib crane that was manufactured by Frederick Gregory & Co and placed at St Marys on 24 August 1943. It is of five ton capacity with official number of \"T 166\". It is placed on an octagonal concrete [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] and currently preserved as an industrial archaeological item within a brick dwarf wall and aluminium palisade fencing around its perimeter. A mature tree is also located within the protected space. It is one of approximately 8 jib cranes remaining in the Sydney area, other cranes also remain at Fairfield and Windsor.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Landscape features===\nOther than a couple of trees within the forecourt of the Goods Shed there are no landscape features. These trees appear to date from the early 1990s.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Potential archaeological features===\nThere is no visible evidence of the 1942 brick station building that was removed from Platform 1/2 or other previous structures. St Marys Station has therefore low archaeological potential.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n*Station Buildings: Both of the station buildings are in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Signal Box: The building is generally in good condition with some rusting at the metal fascia of the [[parapet]] and broken window glass (appears to be vandalised).<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Goods Shed: The goods shed is vacant and is in relatively poor condition though structurally appears to be sound. Significant rising damp and salt problem is evident throughout the base of the walls both externally and internally, which requires immediate attention to halt further deterioration and prevent any structural damage. A number of timber floorboards are broken or missing. Internal wall painting finish is flaking.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Platforms: Both of the platforms are in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Footbridge: It is in good condition.\n*Crane: It is secured by metal fencing and is in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nSt Marys Station Group is a relatively intact example of a station group. However, removal of the 1940s Platform 1/2 building and signal equipment of the signal box reduced its integrity. The station building is relatively intact both externally and internally and maintains its integrity. The goods shed has high integrity. The crane is intact. The footbridge has low integrity.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n*1994-95{{spaced endash}}major upgrading work to footbridge, including covering footbridge deck and stairs.\n*1995{{spaced endash}}overhead booking office designed by Spooner Harris & Associates - builder unknown - erected on 1943 steel beam sub-structure\n*1995 - 1942{{spaced endash}}station building on Platforms 1/2 (type 13, brick, standard roadside) has been demolished and replaced by a canopy\n*2001{{spaced endash}}original electric control console and wall panel of the Signal Box have been replaced, and additional platform canopies installed.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n==Platforms and services==\n{{Sydney Trains platform box\n|p1linename = T1\n|p1stop     = services to [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]] via [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]] & [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood]]\n|p1notes    = <ref name=T1Timetable>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|Western}}</ref>\n|p2linename = T1\n|p2stop     = services to [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]] via [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]] & [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood]]\n|p2notes    = <ref name=T1Timetable/>\n|p3linename = T1\n|p3stop     = services to [[Emu Plains railway station|Emu Plains]]\n|p3notes    = <ref name=T1Timetable/>\n|p4linename = T1\n|p4stop     = services to [[Emu Plains railway station|Emu Plains]]\n|p4notes    = <ref name=T1Timetable/>}}\n\n==Transport links==\n'''St Marys Station Bus Interchange'''\n\n[[Busways (New South Wales)|Busways]] operates 12 routes via St Marys station:\n*745: to [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B745}}</ref>\n*758: to [[Mount Druitt railway station|Mount Druitt station]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B758}}</ref>\n*759: to Mount Druitt station via [[Willmot, New South Wales|Willmot]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B759}}</ref>\n*770: Mount Druitt station to [[Penrith railway station, Sydney|Penrith]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B770}}</ref>\n*771: to Mount Druitt station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B771}}</ref>\n*774: Mount Druitt station to Penrith station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B774}}</ref>\n*775: Mount Druitt station to Penrith station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B775}}</ref>\n*776: Mount Druitt station to Penrith station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B776}}</ref>\n*779: to [[Erskine Park]], peak hour service<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B779}}</ref>\n*781: Penrith station to [[Orchard Hills, New South Wales|Orchard Hills]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B781}}</ref>\n*782: to Penrith station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B782}}</ref>\n*S11: Shopping service to [[St Clair, New South Wales|St Clair]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|BS11}}</ref>\n\n[[Transit Systems Sydney]] operates one route via St Marys station:\n*835: [[Prairiewood, New South Wales|Prairiewood]] to [[Western Sydney University#Penrith|Western Sydney University, Kingswood]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B835}}</ref>\n\nSt Marys station is served by one [[NightRide]] route:\n*N70 [[Penrith railway station, Sydney|Penrith station]] to [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|City (Town Hall)]].<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|BN70}}</ref>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 1 November 2010, St Marys Station Group is of state significance as an early station opened in the 1860s when the Great Western Railway was extended from Parramatta and for the role it played in handling the increased traffic for the American ammunition and general store built at Ropes Creek during World War II. The station, in particular the signal box, has strong associations with the operations of the once important rail system to Dunheved and Ropes Creek, and with the development of local industry and residential expansion of St Marys after 1942. The place has research and technical potential for its ability to provide evidence on the construction techniques and operational system of the NSW Railways in the 1880s and during the World War II period.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nSt Marys Station Group has representative significance combining a range of buildings and structures dating from the 1880s and World War II period to the present day including the station building, goods shed, signal box, crane and footbridge substructure. St Marys Station Group features a number of rare structures including the goods shed, the only brick example of its type in the state and the associated crane, one of a few remaining cranes in the [[Sydney]] area. The signal box is one of few remaining such structures using utilitarian materials in a non-standard style.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nSt Marys railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station Group is of historical significance as one of the early railway stations opened when the Great Western Railway was extended from Parramatta and for its role during World War II in handling the increased traffic for the American ammunition and general store built at Ropes Creek.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nThe signal box is also of historical significance as a wartime box built as a result of the important branch line workings to the Ropes Creek munitions factory.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station Group is of aesthetic significance for its collection of railway structures including an early station building, goods shed and crane dating from the 1880s and 1940s featuring typical architectural elements of their types. The aesthetic significance of the station, however; has been reduced by the addition of extensive metal canopies on both platforms affecting the visual quality of the 1880s building and the overall station. The goods shed is aesthetically significant as a good example of its type and dominant feature within the station precinct. The signal box is a good example of the Inter-War period \"Modern\" design box built with utilitarian materials in a non-standard style.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station has research and technical potential for its ability to provide evidence on the construction techniques and operational system of the NSW Railways in the 1880s and during the World War II period.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station Group features a number of rare items in that the goods shed is the only brick example of a side goods shed in NSW. Furthermore, the goods shed is rare, as only a few goods sheds remain in the Metropolitan area, being once a common structure at all major railway station sites.

The station is served by [[Sydney Trains]] [[North Shore, Northern & Western Line|T1 Western line]] services. The station marks the end of the four-track section of the Main Western line. It was designed by [[New South Wales Government Railways]] and was built in 1862. It is also known as '''St. Marys Railway Station Group''' and '''St Marys Railway Station'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] in the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1249>{{cite NSW SHR|5012221|St. Marys Railway Station Group|hr=01249|fn=10/01111|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSt. Marys station opened on 1 May 1862 as the interim terminus of the Main Western line when it was extended from [[Rooty Hill railway station|Rooty Hill]]. It was initially named South Creek, being renamed St Marys on 5 August 1885.<ref>[http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:St+Marys St Marys Station] NSWrail.net</ref> Prior to this a brick goods shed was built in the yard, which remains in the station precinct. A crane is also extant.<ref name=nswshr-1249/> On 19 January 1863, the line was extended to [[Penrith railway station, Sydney|Penrith]]. The line was duplicated in 1886. The Platform 3 & 4 building dates from 1888 and the contractor was John Ahearn & William King.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nMajor changes were made to the site in 1942-3, which included construction of the present signal box, the Platform 1 & 2 building, and the islanding of both platforms as well as the opening in stages of the [[Ropes Creek railway line|branch line]] to [[Ropes Creek (New South Wales)|Ropes Creek]]. These changes were one part of a much larger scheme to increase the tracks to four main lines between [[Lidcombe]] and St. Marys during [[World War II]] in order to provide maximum track capacity to the American ammunition and general store built at Ropes Creek. It took over 32 years until all aspects of the quadruplication were completed between [[Westmead, New South Wales|Westmead]] and [[Blacktown]]. Quadruplication reached St. Marys in 1978, while the [[Granville, New South Wales|Granville]] to Westmead section was finally completed in 1986.<ref name=nswshr-1249/> The line closed in 1986, being truncated into two storage sidings at the western end of the station with the overhead wiring removed.\n\nThe signal box is of a select non-standard elevated electric power operated type and is only the second to be built at the station. It was constructed in 1942 to provide signal and track control on the main line and the then new branch line serving the wartime munitions factories at Dunheved and Ropes Creek. The signal box was the only example built during World War II to have a flat roof. The original electric control console and wall panel have been replaced.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nThe 1943 footbridge underwent major upgrading work in 1994-95, including covering the footbridge deck and stairs and a new overhead booking office designed by Spooner Harris & Associates. The 1995 works also involved replacing the canopy on the Platform 1 & 2 building.<ref name=nswshr-1249/> In March 1983, 40 people were injured when a suburban train failed to stop at the station and derailed at catch-points to the west of the station.<ref>\"Train derailment injures 40\" ''[[The Age]]'' 3 March 1983</ref>\n\nIn 2001 additional platform canopies were constructed.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n==Future==\nA scoping study into rail investment to service [[Western Sydney]] and the proposed [[Western Sydney Airport]] was announced by the New South Wales and Australian governments in November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Western Sydney Airport|url=https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects-western-sydney-airport|publisher=Transport for NSW|accessdate=18 February 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201190430/https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/projects-western-sydney-airport|archivedate=1 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The study's final report was released in March 2018 and included a proposal to construct a \"North-South Link\" from Schofields to Macarthur via the airport.<ref name=\"outcomes report\">{{cite web|title=Western Sydney Rail Needs Scoping Study Outcomes Report|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306142557/https://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/system/files/media/documents/2018/wsrnsoutcome-report.pdf|publisher=Australian Government and New South Wales Government|accessdate=7 March 2018|pages=55\u201356|date=March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the governments announced the development of a new rail line serving the airport. This line would form part of the North-South Link, running south from St Marys to the airport, before continuing on to the \"Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis\" - an area south of the airport.

The waiting room has no wall on the rail side and extends by a wide [[Corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated metal]] awning supported on timber posts and beams featuring exposed [[rafter]]s and decorative timberboards at both ends. The street elevation of the waiting room consists of four vertically proportioned timber box framed windows and a door opening with no glass or door panels. Both wing rooms are locked and secured by security grills installed on both window and door openings. Each wing features one face brick tall [[chimney]] with corbelled top above the relatively new corrugated metal roof of the building. A pitched modern metal canopy with [[awnings]] on both elevations supported on steel frame and [[columns]] extends on Down and Up ends of the building.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nInternal: Internal access to the enclosed side wings was not possible, however they could be viewed from the windows and appear to have remained relatively intact. The central waiting room features painted brick walls, timber board ceiling lining and tile floor finish.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Signal box, 1942===\nExternal: A two-storey signal box accommodating the control room on the first floor level with staff amenities and the relay room on the ground floor. The timber framed walls are clad in flat asbestos cement sheets. The first floor roof, which is extended over the roof of the relay room together with the top roof are of flat membrane concealed behind wide moulded [[Fascia (architecture)|fascias]] that project over wide [[eaves]]. The control room has curved walls and aluminium curved windows at the western end. Ground floor doors and windows are timber framed. The box is situated at ground level a short distance from the western end of the station island platform. Designed by New South Wales Government Railways.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nInternal: The spaces are original but the electric control console and wall panel have been replaced in recent years by computerised console system placed behind a high bench. Access to the ground floor and relay room was not available. The curved observation windows of the control room have been covered by blinds from inside and metal sun control panel from outside as direct visual communication is no longer required.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Goods shed, {{circa|1880}}===\nExternal: A Subtype 2 rectangular face [[brickwork]] goods shed with corrugated metal pitched roof. It is the only brick example of a Subtype 2 shed and remains relatively intact. The shed features simply detailed timber bargeboards at both [[gable]] ends, semi-circular arched tall window openings (boarded externally) with cement rendered sills, flat cement rendered [[Lintel (architecture)|lintels]] and timber thresholds to two-panel timberboard loading doors on both station side and street side elevations, and a single segmental arched door on the western side facing the bus interchange. Facades of the Goods Shed are emphasised by recessed [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] with dentilated tops around the arched windows. A brick platform with bullnosed capped brick [[retaining wall]]s along the edges and the sides of brick steps is located on the rail side of the Goods Shed.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nInternal: The Shed is essentially a large single space with exposed timber framed [[truss]] roof underneath of the corrugated metal roofing visible and timberboard flooring. Configuration of the multi-paned steel windows with [[fanlight]]s and toughened glazing is evident from the interior. The brick walls are painted. Horizontal steel mechanisms for the sliding loading doors cross over the fanlights of the windows.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Platforms, 1888 & 1942-3===\n2 island platforms with concrete faces and decks topped with asphalt finish. Corrugated metal pitched canopies supported on a steel beam and column frames provide protection over both platforms with the canopy on Platform 3/4 extending around the existing 1888 Waiting Room roof and awning, which remain visible above the new canopy. Modern timber bench seating, [[lighting]], amenities, vending machines and aluminium palisade fencing are other features on the platforms. Platforms are accessible via [[stairs]] and lift towers leading to the footbridge, where the 1995 overhead booking office and concourse are located. The 1995 corrugated metal canopy replaced the 1942 brick station building on Platform 1/2.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Footbridge, 1942===\nA modified standard footbridge with 1942 steel structural frame supported on steel columns. Sets of stairs to each street and platform provides access together with two modern lift towers at either end of the footbridge. Both sides of the footbridge, which accommodates the concourse and the overhead booking office, are enclosed by steel framed glass panels. The main space of the footbridge is covered by a corrugated metal [[hipped roof]] punctuated by ventilation [[gable]]s and a central tower element creating a common architectural language with the motor towers of the station lifts.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Crane (1943)===\nA type 1 jib crane that was manufactured by Frederick Gregory & Co and placed at St Marys on 24 August 1943. It is of five ton capacity with official number of \"T 166\". It is placed on an octagonal concrete [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] and currently preserved as an industrial archaeological item within a brick dwarf wall and aluminium palisade fencing around its perimeter. A mature tree is also located within the protected space. It is one of approximately 8 jib cranes remaining in the Sydney area, other cranes also remain at Fairfield and Windsor.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Landscape features===\nOther than a couple of trees within the forecourt of the Goods Shed there are no landscape features. These trees appear to date from the early 1990s.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n===Potential archaeological features===\nThere is no visible evidence of the 1942 brick station building that was removed from Platform 1/2 or other previous structures. St Marys Station has therefore low archaeological potential.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n=== Condition ===\n*Station Buildings: Both of the station buildings are in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Signal Box: The building is generally in good condition with some rusting at the metal fascia of the [[parapet]] and broken window glass (appears to be vandalised).<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Goods Shed: The goods shed is vacant and is in relatively poor condition though structurally appears to be sound. Significant rising damp and salt problem is evident throughout the base of the walls both externally and internally, which requires immediate attention to halt further deterioration and prevent any structural damage. A number of timber floorboards are broken or missing. Internal wall painting finish is flaking.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Platforms: Both of the platforms are in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n*Footbridge: It is in good condition.\n*Crane: It is secured by metal fencing and is in good condition.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nSt Marys Station Group is a relatively intact example of a station group. However, removal of the 1940s Platform 1/2 building and signal equipment of the signal box reduced its integrity. The station building is relatively intact both externally and internally and maintains its integrity. The goods shed has high integrity. The crane is intact. The footbridge has low integrity.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n=== Modifications and dates ===\n*1994-95{{spaced endash}}major upgrading work to footbridge, including covering footbridge deck and stairs.\n*1995{{spaced endash}}overhead booking office designed by Spooner Harris & Associates - builder unknown - erected on 1943 steel beam sub-structure\n*1995 - 1942{{spaced endash}}station building on Platforms 1/2 (type 13, brick, standard roadside) has been demolished and replaced by a canopy\n*2001{{spaced endash}}original electric control console and wall panel of the Signal Box have been replaced, and additional platform canopies installed.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n==Platforms and services==\n{{Sydney Trains platform box\n|p1linename = T1\n|p1stop     = services to [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]] via [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]] & [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood]]\n|p1notes    = <ref name=T1Timetable>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|Western}}</ref>\n|p2linename = T1\n|p2stop     = services to [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]] via [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]] & [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood]]\n|p2notes    = <ref name=T1Timetable/>\n|p3linename = T1\n|p3stop     = services to [[Emu Plains railway station|Emu Plains]]\n|p3notes    = <ref name=T1Timetable/>\n|p4linename = T1\n|p4stop     = services to [[Emu Plains railway station|Emu Plains]]\n|p4notes    = <ref name=T1Timetable/>}}\n\n==Transport links==\n'''St Marys Station Bus Interchange'''\n\n[[Busways (New South Wales)|Busways]] operates 12 routes via St Marys station:\n*745: to [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B745}}</ref>\n*758: to [[Mount Druitt railway station|Mount Druitt station]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B758}}</ref>\n*759: to Mount Druitt station via [[Willmot, New South Wales|Willmot]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B759}}</ref>\n*770: Mount Druitt station to [[Penrith railway station, Sydney|Penrith]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B770}}</ref>\n*771: to Mount Druitt station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B771}}</ref>\n*774: Mount Druitt station to Penrith station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B774}}</ref>\n*775: Mount Druitt station to Penrith station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B775}}</ref>\n*776: Mount Druitt station to Penrith station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B776}}</ref>\n*779: to [[Erskine Park]], peak hour service<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B779}}</ref>\n*781: Penrith station to [[Orchard Hills, New South Wales|Orchard Hills]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B781}}</ref>\n*782: to Penrith station<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B782}}</ref>\n*S11: Shopping service to [[St Clair, New South Wales|St Clair]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|BS11}}</ref>\n\n[[Transit Systems Sydney]] operates one route via St Marys station:\n*835: [[Prairiewood, New South Wales|Prairiewood]] to [[Western Sydney University#Penrith|Western Sydney University, Kingswood]]<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|B835}}</ref>\n\nSt Marys station is served by one [[NightRide]] route:\n*N70 [[Penrith railway station, Sydney|Penrith station]] to [[Town Hall railway station, Sydney|City (Town Hall)]].<ref>{{Cite New South Wales transport timetables|BN70}}</ref>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nAs at 1 November 2010, St Marys Station Group is of state significance as an early station opened in the 1860s when the Great Western Railway was extended from Parramatta and for the role it played in handling the increased traffic for the American ammunition and general store built at Ropes Creek during World War II. The station, in particular the signal box, has strong associations with the operations of the once important rail system to Dunheved and Ropes Creek, and with the development of local industry and residential expansion of St Marys after 1942. The place has research and technical potential for its ability to provide evidence on the construction techniques and operational system of the NSW Railways in the 1880s and during the World War II period.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nSt Marys Station Group has representative significance combining a range of buildings and structures dating from the 1880s and World War II period to the present day including the station building, goods shed, signal box, crane and footbridge substructure. St Marys Station Group features a number of rare structures including the goods shed, the only brick example of its type in the state and the associated crane, one of a few remaining cranes in the [[Sydney]] area. The signal box is one of few remaining such structures using utilitarian materials in a non-standard style.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nSt Marys railway station was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station Group is of historical significance as one of the early railway stations opened when the Great Western Railway was extended from Parramatta and for its role during World War II in handling the increased traffic for the American ammunition and general store built at Ropes Creek.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\nThe signal box is also of historical significance as a wartime box built as a result of the important branch line workings to the Ropes Creek munitions factory.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station Group is of aesthetic significance for its collection of railway structures including an early station building, goods shed and crane dating from the 1880s and 1940s featuring typical architectural elements of their types. The aesthetic significance of the station, however; has been reduced by the addition of extensive metal canopies on both platforms affecting the visual quality of the 1880s building and the overall station. The goods shed is aesthetically significant as a good example of its type and dominant feature within the station precinct. The signal box is a good example of the Inter-War period \"Modern\" design box built with utilitarian materials in a non-standard style.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''\n\nThe place has the potential to contribute to the local community's sense of place, and can provide a connection to the local community's past.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station has research and technical potential for its ability to provide evidence on the construction techniques and operational system of the NSW Railways in the 1880s and during the World War II period.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station Group features a number of rare items in that the goods shed is the only brick example of a side goods shed in NSW. Furthermore, the goods shed is rare, as only a few goods sheds remain in the Metropolitan area, being once a common structure at all major railway station sites. The signal box is rare as one of a few such signal boxes left in the state.<ref name=nswshr-1249/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.'''\n\nSt Marys Station Group is a representative example of railway station arrangements combining a range of buildings and structures dating from the 1880s and World War II period to the present day including the main station building, goods shed, signal box, crane, footbridge substructure and overhead booking office.
