A court-appointed psychiatrist declared Bremer mentally ill, yet stable enough to continue to live in the community.

I intend to shoot one or the other while he attends a campaign rally for the Wisconsin Primary.\" The following evening, Bremer attended an organizational meeting for Wallace at [[The Pfister Hotel]] in Milwaukee.\n\nAlthough Bremer's main aim was to [[assassinate]] then-[[President of the United States|President]] Richard Nixon, on March 23, he attended a Wallace dinner and rally at Milwaukee's Red Carpet Airport Inn. Then on April 3, he attended a Wallace victory rally at a Holiday Inn in Milwaukee. On April 8, while preparing for a trip to [[Ottawa, Ontario]], he put one of his guns, a [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] 9mm, under a mat in the trunk of his car, but it fell down so deeply into the right wheel well that he could not retrieve it. It was removed a week after Bremer's arrest when the car was dismantled.\n\nOn April 10, he traveled from Milwaukee to Ottawa. Three days later, Bremer, dressed in a business suit, wearing sunglasses and with a revolver in his pocket, initiated an attempt to assassinate Nixon but could not find an opportunity to do so. Security was tight, making it impossible for Bremer to get close to Nixon. Bremer also doubted whether any bullets would go through the glass of Nixon's limousine. He later returned to Milwaukee where he remained for most of the following three weeks.\n\n== Plans to assassinate George Wallace ==\n\nOn May 4, 1972, after a ten-day break from writing, Bremer realized it would be almost impossible to assassinate Nixon, and decided that it was Wallace's \"fate\" to be his victim, even though his diary entries never showed the same level of interest or enthusiasm as they did with regard to assassinating Nixon. Bremer made this clear in his diary writing \"He (Wallace) certainly won't be buried with the snobs in Washington. . . . I won't even rate a TV interruption in Russia or/Europe when the news breaks\u2014 they never heard of Wallace.\"<Ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/of-apple-pie-and-the-killing-of-presidents-bremer.html</ref> The following day, he checked out two books from the public library in Milwaukee, both detailing the [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassination]] of Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] by [[Sirhan Sirhan]]: ''Sirhan'' by Aziz Shihab and ''\"R.F.K. Must Die!\"'' by [[Robert Blair Kaiser]].\n\nDespite his lack of enthusiasm, early on the morning of May 9, 1972 Bremer took a car ferry to [[Ludington, Michigan]] and visited the Wallace campaign headquarters in Silver Lake, Michigan and offered to be a volunteer. The evening after that, he attended a Wallace rally in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. Two nights later, he was present at a Wallace rally in [[Cadillac, Michigan|Cadillac]] and stayed overnight at the Reid Hotel in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn the afternoon of May 13, Kalamazoo Police received an anonymous phone call saying a suspicious looking person had been sitting in a car near the National Guard Armory. When questioned, Bremer said he was waiting for the Wallace rally to begin and wanted to get a good seat. Bremer was photographed at the rally that evening, where he had a clear opportunity to shoot his target, but, according to his diary, he did not do so because he might have shattered some glass and blinded some \"stupid 15-year-olds\" who stood nearby. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nShort of money and unable to afford a hotel room, Bremer slept in his car for the following two nights, as he had done on some nights the previous week. He made his final diary entry on May 14, 1972, when he drove to [[Maryland]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n== Shooting ==\n\nBremer turned up in [[Wheaton, Maryland]], for a noon appearance which Wallace made at [[Wheaton Plaza]], during a shopping center rally on May 15, 1972. He was dressed in dark glasses; patriotic red, white, and blue; and was wearing his new [[campaign button]] which said \"WALLACE in '72\". He strongly applauded Wallace, in contrast with many others present, who heckled and taunted the speaker. Two tomatoes were thrown at Wallace during the rally, but missed. Based on this reception, Wallace refused to shake hands with anyone present, denying Bremer the opportunity to carry out his plan.\n\nAt a second rally, which took place at [[Laurel Shopping Center]], 16 miles away in [[Laurel, Maryland]], there was minor heckling but it did not last. About 1,000 people were present; they were mostly quiet and it was generally a friendly crowd. After he had finished speaking, Wallace shook hands with some of those present, against the advice of his Secret Service guards. At approximately 4:00&nbsp;p.m., Bremer pushed his way forward, aimed his .38 revolver at Wallace's abdomen and opened fire, emptying the weapon before he could be subdued.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Wallace's assassination attempt: FBI agent reflects, 40 years later|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-05-09/local/35454828_1_arthur-bremer-george-wallace-alabama-gov|date=May 9, 2012|work=Washington Post|author=Kraut, Aaron|accessdate=Aug 20, 2013}}</ref> He hit Wallace four times. Wallace fell back and lost a pint of blood, going into a mild state of shock. One bullet lodged in his spinal cord. The other bullets hit Wallace in the [[abdomen]] and [[chest]]. Three other people present were wounded unintentionally: [[Alabama]] [[State police|State Trooper]] Captain E. C. Dothard (Wallace's personal bodyguard), who was shot in the abdomen, Dora Thompson (a campaign volunteer) who was shot in the leg, and Nick Zarvos, a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent. Zarvos was shot in the neck, and his [[Manner of articulation|speech]] was severely impaired following the shooting.\n\nBremer had planned to yell his carefully chosen catchphrase, [[wiktionary:penny for your thoughts|\"A Penny For Your Thoughts!\"]], as he shot Wallace. However, in the heat of the assassination attempt, he forgot to do so.<ref>''The crocodile man: a case of brain chemistry and criminal violence'' Andr\u00e9 Mayer & Michael Wheeler. p. 7</ref>\n\n==Arrest==\n\nAfter emptying his revolver, Bremer was wrestled to the ground and then arrested. Bremer himself was taken to a hospital for treatment of a head wound. Just after midnight, he was arraigned and taken to the [[Baltimore County]] Jail, where he would be held for the next two months. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nUpon searching it, police described Bremer's car as a \"hotel on wheels\". In it they found blankets, pillows, a blue steel [[9mm]] [[Browning Hi-Power|13-shot Browning Hi-Power Semi-automatic Pistol]], [[binoculars]], a woman's umbrella, a tape recorder, a portable radio with [[Spectrum management|police band]], an electric shaver, photographic equipment, a garment bag with several changes of clothes, a toilet kit, and a 1972 copy of a [[Writers' & Artists' Yearbook|''Writers' Yearbook'']] and the two books he had borrowed from the Milwaukee public library ten days earlier. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nWithin hours of the assassination attempt, then-President Richard M. Nixon and a top aide dispatched a political operative, [[E. Howard Hunt]], who rushed to Milwaukee, with plans to [[Black bag operation|surreptitiously enter]] Bremer's apartment, and plant the campaign literature of Democratic contender [[George S. McGovern|George McGovern's]] campaign as a means to drive Wallace supporters away from the Democratic Party and toward Nixon and Republican candidates.

When asked if he had anything to say, Bremer replied, \"Well, Mr. Marshall mentioned that he would like society to be protected from someone like me. Looking back on my life I would have liked it if society had protected me from myself. That's all I have to say at this time.\" The sentence was reduced to 53 years on September 28, 1972, after an appeal. On July 6, 1973, Bremer's second appeal to have the sentence reduced further was rejected.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nA 113-page portion of Bremer's diary was published in 1973 as ''[[An Assassin's Diary]]''; it covers the period from April 4, 1972, to the day before he shot Wallace and his subsequent arrest. In it, Bremer states that he was not particularly opposed to Wallace's political agenda, which was notable for its pro-[[Racial segregation|segregationist]] stance, but that his primary motive was to become infamous and to gain notoriety.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe first half of Bremer's diary (pages 1\u2013148) was found on August 26, 1980, where he had concealed it, heavily wrapped, in a plastic suitcase, at the foot of Milwaukee's 27th Street [[viaduct]]. It was dated from March 1 to April 3, 1972.<ref>[[Associated Press]]. \"Finder can keep Bremer diary\" ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'' September 11, 1981, p. 2.</ref> In it, Bremer discusses his desire to kill Nixon (Wallace was clearly a secondary target); fantasized about killing unnamed individuals who angered him, or opening fire at random at the corner of 3rd Street and Wisconsin Avenue downtown; and also confessed his admiration for [[Vel Phillips]], a pioneering black office holder of Milwaukee (who was elected and serving as [[Secretary of State of Wisconsin]] when the diary was found). The diary was eventually sold to an official of the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], who donated it to UAB's Reynolds Historical Library.<ref>AP. \"Bremer diary traces nightmare journey.\" ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'' June 16, 1985, p. 20A.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bremer\u2019s actions and trial and conviction attracted media attention, he soon faded into comparative obscurity. He did not reach the level of infamy of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] or [[John Wilkes Booth]], who had assassinated presidents.\n\nBremer's assassination attempt did not end Wallace\u2019s political career. Wallace was subsequently elected governor of Alabama twice, in 1974 and 1982. However, the result of the assassination attempt, combined with changing circumstances&nbsp;&ndash; both Wallace's, and on the political stage&nbsp;&ndash; ended Wallace's presidential aspirations. Public concerns over Wallace's health meant he would never gain the same momentum as he did in the 1972 campaign. He entered the presidential election race in 1976 but withdrew early due to poor support.\n\nWallace forgave Bremer in August 1995 and wrote to him expressing the hope that the two could get to know each other better.<ref>[https://archive.is/20060520180033/http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050406/wallace.shtml \"Pope-Wallace meeting remembered\"], ''[[The Decatur Daily]]'', [[Decatur, Alabama]].

He was reprimanded after another fight in December 1972, and then placed in solitary again for 30 days after a third fight in February 1973.

I intend to shoot one or the other while he attends a campaign rally for the Wisconsin Primary.\" The following evening, Bremer attended an organizational meeting for Wallace at [[The Pfister Hotel]] in Milwaukee.\n\nAlthough Bremer's main aim was to [[assassinate]] then-[[President of the United States|President]] Richard Nixon, on March 23, he attended a Wallace dinner and rally at Milwaukee's Red Carpet Airport Inn. Then on April 3, he attended a Wallace victory rally at a Holiday Inn in Milwaukee. On April 8, while preparing for a trip to [[Ottawa, Ontario]], he put one of his guns, a [[Browning Arms Company|Browning]] 9mm, under a mat in the trunk of his car, but it fell down so deeply into the right wheel well that he could not retrieve it. It was removed a week after Bremer's arrest when the car was dismantled.\n\nOn April 10, he traveled from Milwaukee to Ottawa. Three days later, Bremer, dressed in a business suit, wearing sunglasses and with a revolver in his pocket, initiated an attempt to assassinate Nixon but could not find an opportunity to do so. Security was tight, making it impossible for Bremer to get close to Nixon. Bremer also doubted whether any bullets would go through the glass of Nixon's limousine. He later returned to Milwaukee where he remained for most of the following three weeks.\n\n== Plans to assassinate George Wallace ==\n\nOn May 4, 1972, after a ten-day break from writing, Bremer realized it would be almost impossible to assassinate Nixon, and decided that it was Wallace's \"fate\" to be his victim, even though his diary entries never showed the same level of interest or enthusiasm as they did with regard to assassinating Nixon. Bremer made this clear in his diary writing \"He (Wallace) certainly won't be buried with the snobs in Washington. . . . I won't even rate a TV interruption in Russia or/Europe when the news breaks\u2014 they never heard of Wallace.\"<Ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/06/archives/of-apple-pie-and-the-killing-of-presidents-bremer.html</ref> The following day, he checked out two books from the public library in Milwaukee, both detailing the [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassination]] of Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]] by [[Sirhan Sirhan]]: ''Sirhan'' by Aziz Shihab and ''\"R.F.K. Must Die!\"'' by [[Robert Blair Kaiser]].\n\nDespite his lack of enthusiasm, early on the morning of May 9, 1972 Bremer took a car ferry to [[Ludington, Michigan]] and visited the Wallace campaign headquarters in Silver Lake, Michigan and offered to be a volunteer. The evening after that, he attended a Wallace rally in [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. Two nights later, he was present at a Wallace rally in [[Cadillac, Michigan|Cadillac]] and stayed overnight at the Reid Hotel in [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nOn the afternoon of May 13, Kalamazoo Police received an anonymous phone call saying a suspicious looking person had been sitting in a car near the National Guard Armory. When questioned, Bremer said he was waiting for the Wallace rally to begin and wanted to get a good seat. Bremer was photographed at the rally that evening, where he had a clear opportunity to shoot his target, but, according to his diary, he did not do so because he might have shattered some glass and blinded some \"stupid 15-year-olds\" who stood nearby. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nShort of money and unable to afford a hotel room, Bremer slept in his car for the following two nights, as he had done on some nights the previous week. He made his final diary entry on May 14, 1972, when he drove to [[Maryland]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Shooting==\nBremer turned up in [[Wheaton, Maryland]], for a noon appearance which Wallace made at [[Wheaton Plaza]], during a shopping center rally on May 15, 1972. He was dressed in dark glasses; patriotic red, white, and blue; and was wearing his new [[campaign button]] which said \"WALLACE in '72\". He strongly applauded Wallace, in contrast with many others present, who heckled and taunted the speaker. Two tomatoes were thrown at Wallace during the rally, but missed. Based on this reception, Wallace refused to shake hands with anyone present, denying Bremer the opportunity to carry out his plan.\n\nAt a second rally, which took place at [[Laurel Shopping Center]], 16 miles away in [[Laurel, Maryland]], there was minor heckling but it did not last. About 1,000 people were present; they were mostly quiet and it was generally a friendly crowd. After he had finished speaking, Wallace shook hands with some of those present, against the advice of his Secret Service guards. At approximately 4:00&nbsp;p.m., Bremer pushed his way forward, aimed his .38 revolver at Wallace's abdomen and opened fire, emptying the weapon before he could be subdued.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Wallace's assassination attempt: FBI agent reflects, 40 years later|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-05-09/local/35454828_1_arthur-bremer-george-wallace-alabama-gov|date=May 9, 2012|work=Washington Post|author=Kraut, Aaron|accessdate=Aug 20, 2013}}</ref> He hit Wallace four times. Wallace fell back and lost a pint of blood, going into a mild state of shock. One bullet lodged in his spinal cord. The other bullets hit Wallace in the [[abdomen]] and [[chest]]. Three other people present were wounded unintentionally: [[Alabama]] [[State police|State Trooper]] Captain E. C. Dothard (Wallace's personal bodyguard), who was shot in the stomach, Dora Thompson (a campaign volunteer) who was shot in the leg, and Nick Zarvos, a [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent. Zarvos was shot in the neck, and his [[Manner of articulation|speech]] was severely impaired following the shooting.\n\nBremer had planned to yell his carefully chosen catchphrase, [[wiktionary:penny for your thoughts|\"A Penny For Your Thoughts!\"]], as he shot Wallace. However, in the heat of the assassination attempt, he forgot to do so.<ref>''The crocodile man: a case of brain chemistry and criminal violence'' Andr\u00e9 Mayer & Michael Wheeler. p. 7</ref>\n\n==Arrest==\n\nAfter emptying his revolver, Bremer was wrestled to the ground and then arrested. Bremer himself was taken to a hospital for treatment of a head wound. Just after midnight, he was arraigned and taken to the [[Baltimore County]] Jail, where he would be held for the next two months. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nUpon searching it, police described Bremer's car as a \"hotel on wheels\". In it they found blankets, pillows, a blue steel [[9mm]] [[Browning Hi-Power|13-shot Browning Hi-Power Semi-automatic Pistol]], [[binoculars]], a woman's umbrella, a tape recorder, a portable radio with [[Spectrum management|police band]], an electric shaver, photographic equipment, a garment bag with several changes of clothes, a toilet kit, and a 1972 copy of a [[Writers' & Artists' Yearbook|''Writers' Yearbook'']] and the two books he had borrowed from the Milwaukee public library ten days earlier. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nWithin hours of the assassination attempt, then-President Richard M. Nixon and a top aide dispatched a political operative, [[E. Howard Hunt]], who rushed to Milwaukee, with plans to [[Black bag operation|surreptitiously enter]] Bremer's apartment, and plant the campaign literature of Democratic contender [[George S. McGovern|George McGovern's]] campaign as a means to drive Wallace supporters away from the Democratic Party and toward Nixon and Republican candidates.  Hunt aborted his clandestine operation after the FBI had already sealed off Bremer's apartment prior to his arrival.<ref>{{cite news |date= December 7, 1992 |title= Article Says Nixon Schemed To Tie Foe to Wallace Attack |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/07/us/article-says-nixon-schemed-to-tie-foe-to-wallace-attack.html|work= The New York Times|access-date= March 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date= December 7, 1992 |title= Nixon Plot to Tie McGovern to Wallace Attack Reported : Archives: Plan to plant campaign flyers is among new disclosures in unreleased tapes, magazine says. |url= https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-12-07-mn-1225-story.html |work= Los Angeles Times |access-date= March 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Trial and conviction==\n\nHis subsequent [[Jury trial|trial]] in [[Upper Marlboro, Maryland]], was condensed to five days, and was held only 2\u00bd months after Bremer shot Wallace, beginning on July 31, 1972. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The defense argued that Bremer was [[schizophrenic]] and [[Insanity defense|legally insane]] at the time of the shooting, and that he had \"no emotional capacity to understand anything\"; but the jury rejected this argument after the prosecution countered that he was perfectly sane. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Arthur Marshall, for the prosecution, told the court that Bremer, while disturbed and in need of psychiatric help and treatment, was sane, knew what he was doing, had been seeking glory and was still sorry that Wallace had not died. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nJonas Rappeport, the chief psychiatrist for the circuit court in Baltimore, who spent nine hours with Bremer in June 1972 on four separate occasions, said Bremer had a \"[[schizoid personality disorder]] with some [[paranoid]] and [[psychopathic]] features\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The south-east missourian - 2 August 1972</ref> but also stated that this didn't \"substantially impair his capacity to understand the criminality of his actions\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nOn August 4, 1972, the jury of six men and six women took 95 minutes to reach their verdict.<ref name=\"Nuckols\"/> Bremer was sentenced to 63 years in prison for shooting Wallace and three other people. When asked if he had anything to say, Bremer replied, \"Well, Mr. Marshall mentioned that he would like society to be protected from someone like me. Looking back on my life I would have liked it if society had protected me from myself. That's all I have to say at this time.\" The sentence was reduced to 53 years on September 28, 1972, after an appeal. On July 6, 1973, Bremer's second appeal to have the sentence reduced further was rejected.\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nA 113-page portion of Bremer's diary was published in 1973 as ''[[An Assassin's Diary]]''; it covers the period from April 4, 1972, to the day before he shot Wallace and his subsequent arrest. In it, Bremer states that he was not particularly opposed to Wallace's political agenda, which was notable for its pro-[[Racial segregation|segregationist]] stance, but that his primary motive was to become infamous and to gain notoriety. {{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe first half of Bremer's diary (pages 1\u2013148) was found on August 26, 1980, where he had concealed it, heavily wrapped, in a plastic suitcase, at the foot of Milwaukee's 27th Street [[viaduct]]. It was dated from March 1 to April 3, 1972.<ref>[[Associated Press]]. \"Finder can keep Bremer diary\" ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'' September 11, 1981, p. 2.</ref> In it, Bremer discusses his desire to kill Nixon (Wallace was clearly a secondary target); fantasized about killing unnamed individuals who angered him, or opening fire at random at the corner of 3rd Street and Wisconsin Avenue downtown; and also confessed his admiration for [[Vel Phillips]], a pioneering black office holder of Milwaukee (who was elected and serving as [[Secretary of State of Wisconsin]] when the diary was found). The diary was eventually sold to an official of the [[University of Alabama at Birmingham]], who donated it to UAB's Reynolds Historical Library.<ref>AP. \"Bremer diary traces nightmare journey.\" ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'' June 16, 1985, p. 20A.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bremer's actions and trial and conviction attracted media attention, he soon faded into comparative obscurity. He did not reach the level of infamy of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] or [[John Wilkes Booth]], both of whom had assassinated presidents.\n\nBremer's assassination attempt did not end Wallace's political career. Wallace was subsequently elected governor of Alabama twice, in 1974 and 1982. However, the result of the assassination attempt, combined with changing circumstances&nbsp;&ndash; both Wallace's, and on the political stage&nbsp;&ndash; ended Wallace's presidential aspirations. Public concerns over Wallace's health meant he would never gain the same momentum as he did in the 1972 campaign. He entered the presidential election race in 1976 but withdrew early due to poor support.\n\nWallace forgave Bremer in August 1995 and wrote to him expressing the hope that the two could get to know each other better.<ref>[https://archive.is/20060520180033/http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/050406/wallace.shtml \"Pope-Wallace meeting remembered\"], ''[[The Decatur Daily]]'', [[Decatur, Alabama]].

Bremer was placed in [[solitary confinement]] for 30 days after a fight on October 6, 1972. He was reprimanded after another fight in December 1972, and then placed in solitary again for 30 days after a third fight in February 1973. In prison, he declined to receive mental health treatment or evaluation. He worked in the prison library and was described by the chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission, David Blumberg, as \"compliant and unobtrusive.\" He was visited multiple times by his parents before they died.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/arthur-bremer-alone-96865|title='Arthur Bremer Is Alone'|date=2007-11-10|newspaper=Newsweek|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAccording to 1997 parole records, psychological testing indicated releasing him would be risky.
