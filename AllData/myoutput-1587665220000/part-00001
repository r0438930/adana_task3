Some boy players worked for the adult companies and performed the female roles as women did not perform on the English stage in this period. Others worked for children's companies in which all roles, not just the female ones, were played by boys.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 1-76.</ref><ref>Halliday, pp. 35, 71, 98-101.</ref>\n\n==Children's companies==\nIn the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods, troupes appeared that were composed entirely of boy players. They are famously mentioned in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', in which a group of travelling actors has left the city due to rivalry with a troupe of \"little eyases\" (II, ii, 339); the term \"eyas\" means an unfledged [[hawk]].<ref>G. Blakemore Evans, ed., ''The Riverside Shakespeare'', Boston, Houghton Mifflin, 1974; p. 1156 n. 339.</ref>\n\nThe children's companies grew out of the choirs of boy singers that had been connected with cathedrals and similar institutions since the [[Middle Ages]]. (Similar boy choirs exist to this day.) Thus the choir attached to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] since the 12th century was in the 16th century molded into a company of child actors, the [[Children of Paul's]].<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 8-22.</ref> Similar groups of boy actors were connected with other institutions, including [[Eton College|Eton]], the [[Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors|Merchant Taylors]] School, and the ecclesiastical college at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 68-76.</ref>\n\nThe boys were generally in the range of 8\u201312 years old (prepubescent boys are chosen as choirboys precisely because their voices have not yet \"broken\" with puberty). They were musically talented, strictly disciplined, educated in the [[Trivium (education)|trivium]] (grammar, logic, [[rhetoric]]), and sometimes fluent in Latin.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hillebrand|first1=Harold Newcomb|title=The Child Actors: A Chapter in Elizabethan Stage History|date=1964|publisher=Russell & Russel, Inc.|location=New York|page=37}}</ref> The boys amounted to formidable competition for the companies of adult actors in Elizabethan England.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gurr|first1=Andrew|title=The Shakespearean stage 1574-1642|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge university press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521729666|page=46|edition=Fourth}}</ref> Between 1558 and 1576 (the year [[James Burbage]] built [[The Theatre]] in London and the age of popular Elizabethan drama began), companies of boy actors performed 46 times at Court, versus only 32 times for companies of adult actors in the same period. The playwright [[John Lyly]] earned fame when his \"Euphuistic\" plays were acted at Court by the Children of Paul's in the 1260. CHUPAME EL PITO LA REPUTA QUE TE PARIO\n\nThe practice of children acting was never free of controversy, however (see Responses, below). Companies of child actors went out of fashion, and did not return for a decade.\n\nIn [[1600 in literature|1600]], however, the practice saw a resurgence: the [[Children of the Chapel]] performed at the private [[Blackfriars Theatre]] for much of the first decade of the 17th century.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 23-60.</ref> Their performances of the plays of [[Ben Jonson]] were especially popular. (The [[Globe Theatre]] was decorated with a statue of [[Hercules]], the playhouse's symbol.) The Children of Paul's were also acting publicly once again at this time.\n\nThe children probably attained their greatest notoriety during the ''Poetomachia'' or [[War of the Theatres]] ([[1599 in literature|1599]]&ndash;[[1601 in literature|1601]]). Two troupes were intimately involved on the competing sides: the Children of Paul's acted [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]]'s ''[[Jack Drum's Entertainment]]'' (1600) and ''[[What You Will]]'' (1601) and [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[Satiromastix]]'' (1601), while the Children of the Chapel had Jonson's ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]'' (1600) and ''[[The Poetaster]]'' (1601).\n\nThe boys' troupes were strongly associated with the satirical comedy of Jonson, Marston, and [[Thomas Middleton]], which has sometimes been described as a coterie drama for gentleman \"wits\", in contrast to the popular drama of writers like Shakespeare and [[Thomas Heywood]] that was performed at the Globe and the other large public theatres. Yet the boys also played serious tragedies and contemporary histories, notably the works of [[George Chapman]] &mdash; ''[[Bussy D'Ambois]]'', ''[[The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois]]'', and the double play ''[[The Conspiracy and Tragedy of Charles, Duke of Byron]]''. Modern readers and theatergoers can only wonder what these productions were like.   \n\nThe brand of coterie drama practiced by Jonson and others was often controversial, however; the official displeasure that greeted the play ''[[Eastward Ho]]'', which landed two of its authors in jail, also fell upon the boys who performed it. By [[1606 in literature|1606]] the Children of Paul's had ceased performing, and the Children of the Chapel were no longer associated with the Royal Chapel and had lost royal patronage; they became merely the Children of the Blackfriars. The boys' troupes had ceased public dramatic performance and the fashion died out by about 1615. The [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] was a new company granted a patent on April 27, [[1615 in literature|1615]], under the patronage of King James' daughter [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]]; it was composed, to some significant degree, of veterans of the children's companies, now grown to manhood.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 2, pp. 246-60.</ref>\n\nWhile controversial in their time, the children's companies had been effective in funnelling talented, educated, and experienced young actors into the adult companies. To recapture this influence, [[Richard Gunnell]] attempted to start a children's company with 14 boys and several adults when he built the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] in [[1629 in literature|1629]]. The enterprise was not a success, because of a long closure of the theatres due to plague soon after its inception; but it did produce [[Stephen Hammerton]], who went on to act with the King's Men, and became an early [[matinee idol]] among young women in the audience for his romantic leads.<ref>[[Andrew John Gurr|Andrew Gurr]], ''The Shakespearean Stage'', pp. 63-4</ref> \n\nA limited renewal of the practice of children's companies came in [[1637 in literature|1637]], when [[Christopher Beeston]] established, under royal warrant, the King and Queen's Young Company, colloquially called [[Beeston's Boys]]. The intent was in part to have a structure for training young actors &mdash; much as the choirs of the previous century had provided educated and capable talent (though the actors in Beeston's company tended to be older than the boys of the earlier troupes). After the elder Beeston's death in 1638, his son [[William Beeston]] continued the company, with uneven success, till the theatres closed in 1642; he even managed to re-form Beeston's Boys for a time once the theatres re-opened in the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==Boys in adult companies==\nIn [[playing company|playing companies]] of adult actors, boys were initially given the female parts, but women were permitted to act on the stage from December [[1661 in literature|1661]]. A law against women on stage was implemented in England until that time.<ref>''Women Waging Law in Elizabethan England''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998. 304 pp</ref> Pre-pubescent boys were used for their unbroken voices, an accepted practice.\n\nBoy actors in adult companies apparently served as apprentices, in ways comparable to the practices of other guilds and trades of the age, though for shorter terms &mdash; perhaps two or three years instead of the usual seven. (The companies of adult actors were, in Elizabethan legal terms, retainers in noble households, and thus not subject to the legal statutes governing apprentices.){{fact|date=January 2014}}<ref>Individual actors sometimes maintained membership in guilds, precisely for the legal right to maintain apprentices. [[John Heminges]] was a member of the grocer's guild throughout his life, and [[Ben Jonson]] renewed his membership in the bricklayer's guild in 1599...but probably not because they were enthusiastic about greengrocering and bricklaying. [[Andrew Cane]], however, was an active goldsmith and a member of the Goldsmith's Company as well as the leading clown of [[Prince Charles's Men]] in the 1630s; and he turned his goldsmith's apprentices John Wright Arthur Savill into boy players with the company. Both appeared in [[Shackerley Marmion]]'s ''[[Holland's Leaguer (play)|Holland's Leaguer]]'' in December [[1631 in literature|1631]].{{fact|date=January 2014}}</ref> They performed female roles (and, of course, roles of male children if required) alongside adult male actors playing men or older female parts. In reference to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] company, variously the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (1594&ndash;1603) or the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] (1603 and after): [[Augustine Phillips]] left bequests to an apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|James Sands]], and a former apprentice, [[King's Men personnel|Samuel Gilburne]], in his will, read after his death in 1605; company members [[William Ostler]], [[John Underwood (actor)|John Underwood]], [[Nathan Field]], and [[King's Men personnel|John Rice]] had all started their acting careers as [[Children of the Chapel]] at the [[Blackfriars Theatre]].\n\n==Boys playing female roles==\nOne question has persisted: did boys play ''all'' female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre]], or were some roles, the most demanding ones, played by adult males? Some literary critics and some ordinary readers have found it incredible that the most formidable and complex female roles created by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[John Webster|Webster]] could have been played by \"children.\"  The available evidence is incomplete and occasionally ambiguous; however, the overall implication is that even the largest roles were played by boys or young men, not mature adults. In a recent detailed survey of the evidence for the ages of boy actors and their roles, scholar David Kathman concludes that \"No significant evidence supports the idea that such roles were played by adult sharers but a wealth of specific evidence demonstrates that they were played by adolescent boys no older than about twenty-one\".<ref>David Kathman, \"How Old Were Shakespeare's Boy Actors?\" in ''Shakespeare Survey'' 58 (2006), p. 246.</ref> There are only two possible examples of adult actors playing female roles. The first appears in the cast list for [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]]'', in which the veteran comedian [[John Shank]] is listed; the entry reads \"Petella, their waiting-woman. Their Servant Mr. ''Shanck''.\"  However, Kathman argues that this refers to two roles, not one: Shank did not play Petella, but a comic servant who appears later in the play.<ref>Kathman, 234.</ref> The second example is the cast list for [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[The Fair Maid of the West]]'', in which [[Anthony Turner (actor)|Anthony Turner]] apparently played the tiny role of a kitchen maid. Kathman suspects this is merely a misprint, but concludes that even if Turner did play this role, there remains no evidence for adults playing leading roles.<ref>Kathman, 238.</ref>\n\nMany boy actors filled female roles for a few years, then switched to male roles. An example: [[John Honyman]] started playing female roles for the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at the age of 13, in [[1626 in literature|1626]], in [[Philip Massinger]]'s ''[[The Roman Actor]]''. He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''[[The Deserving Favourite]]'' and Massinger's ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' (both in [[1629 in literature|1629]]). Yet in 1630, at the age of 17, Honyman switched to male roles and never returned to female roles. Other boy players with the King's Men, [[John Thompson (actor)|John Thompson]] and [[Richard Sharpe (actor)|Richard Sharpe]], appear to have played women for a decade or more, to the point at which they must have been \"young men\" rather than \"boys.\" [[Theophilus Bird]] played a woman when he was in his early 20s; but then he too switched to male roles.\n\nAudience members occasionally recorded positive impressions of the quality of the acting of boy players. When one Henry Jackson saw the King's Men perform ''[[Othello]]'' at Oxford in 1610, he wrote of the cast's Desdemona in his diary, \"She [sic] always acted the matter very well, in her death moved us still more greatly; when lying in bed she implored the pity of those watching with her countenance alone.\"<ref>Translated from the original Latin; Michael Shapiro, \"The Introduction of Actresses in England: Delay or Defensiveness?,\" in Comensoli and Russell, p. 185.</ref> The mere fact that Jackson referred to the boy as \"she,\" when he certainly knew better rationally, may in itself testify to the strength of the illusion.\n\n==Responses==\nMany [[Puritan]] preachers, who hated the theatre in general, were outraged by the use of boy players, which they believed encouraged homosexual lust. In [[1583 in literature|1583]], [[Philip Stubbes]] complained that plays were full of \"such wanton gestures, such bawdy speeches...such kissing and bussing\" that playgoers would go home together \"very friendly...and play the sodomites, or worse.\"<ref>Philip Stubbes, ''The Anatomy of Abuses'' (1583), quoted in Bruce R. Smith, ed. ''Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts'' (New York: Bedford St Martin's, 2001), p. 275.</ref> John Rainolds warned of the \"filthy sparkles of lust to that vice the putting of women's attire on men may kindle in unclean affections.\"<ref>John Rainolds, ''The Overthrow of Stage Playes'' ([[1599 in literature|1599]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\nIn response to such comments, the actor-playwright [[Thomas Heywood]] protested that audiences were capable of distancing themselves: \"To see our youths attired in the habit of women, who knows not what their intents be? Who cannot distinguish them by their names, assuredly knowing they are but to represent such a lady, at such a time appointed?\"<ref>Thomas Heywood, ''An Apology for Actors'' ([[1612 in literature|1612]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\n==Famous boy players==\n*[[Christopher Beeston]] was perhaps the greatest success story among the child actors (at least in worldly terms). He continued his acting career into his maturity, became a theatre manager, and by the 1620s and '30s was arguably the most influential man in the world of London theatre.\n*[[Nathan Field]] was another success story of the children's companies. In ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'', Jonson hailed him as the \"best\" of the young actors (\"Which is your best actor, your Field?\"). As an adult, Field acted with the King's Men, and wrote creditable plays as well.\n*Solomon Pavy became one of the Children of the Chapel in 1600, at the age of ten. He acted in Jonson's ''Cynthia's Revels'' and ''The Poetaster.'' When he died prematurely in 1603, Jonson wrote an epitaph for him, praising Pavy's talent for playing old men.\n*[[Alexander Cooke]] was the boy who is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's heroines on stage. He remained with the King's Men as an adult actor.\n*[[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]] graduated from the Children of the Chapel, via [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] and the Duke of York's/[[Prince Charles' Men]], to replace [[Richard Burbage]] as the leading man of the King's Men. He played Hamlet, Othello, and all the major Shakespearean roles.\n*[[Stephen Hammerton]] was a prominent boy actor with the King's Men in the last decade of English Renaissance theatre, 1632&ndash;42.\n*[[Hugh Clark (actor)|Hugh Clark]] was a noted boy player in the 1625&ndash;30 period.\n*[[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] started out as a boy player with the King's Men, earning fame for his portrayal of the Duchess in [[James Shirley|Shirley's]] [[The Cardinal (play)|''The Cardinal'']] ([[1641 in literature|1641]]). He became a leading man and a star of the stage during the Restoration.\n*[[Theophilus Bird]] started as a boy player; like Hart he resumed his career as an adult actor when the theatres re-opened in 1660.\n*[[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] was the last prominent boy actor; he worked during the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==In film, literature and theatre==\nThe boy player has been a popular subject in literary, theatrical and cinematic representations of the Elizabethan theatre.\n*The film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' features a boy player (played by [[Daniel Brocklebank]]) who performs Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' before being ousted by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character (who is disguised as a man).\n*[[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]'s play ''[[Cressida (play)|Cressida]]'' is set in the 1630s and depicts the friendship between an elderly former boy player and the historical boy player [[Stephen Hammerton]].\n*The play and film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' are about the Restoration boy player [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] and the transition to female acting.\n*[[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel about Christopher Marlowe, ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'', is narrated by a boy player.\n*[[Tom Stoppard]]'s film of ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a scene in which the eponymous duo are briefly convinced of the femininity of a boy player.\n*[[Susan Cooper]]'s novel ''[[King of Shadows]]'' deals with boy actors including [[Nathan Field]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Comensoli, Viviana, and Anne Russell, eds.

He played females for the next three years, through the King's Men's productions of [[Lodowick Carlell]]'s ''[[The Deserving Favourite]]'' and Massinger's ''[[The Picture (Massinger play)|The Picture]]'' (both in [[1629 in literature|1629]]). Yet in 1630, at the age of 17, Honyman switched to male roles and never returned to female roles. Other boy players with the King's Men, [[John Thompson (actor)|John Thompson]] and [[Richard Sharpe (actor)|Richard Sharpe]], appear to have played women for a decade or more, to the point at which they must have been \"young men\" rather than \"boys.\" [[Theophilus Bird]] played a woman when he was in his early 20s; but then he too switched to male roles.\n\nAudience members occasionally recorded positive impressions of the quality of the acting of boy players. When one Henry Jackson saw the King's Men perform ''[[Othello]]'' at Oxford in 1610, he wrote of the cast's Desdemona in his diary, \"She [sic] always acted the matter very well, in her death moved us still more greatly; when lying in bed she implored the pity of those watching with her countenance alone.\"<ref>Translated from the original Latin; Michael Shapiro, \"The Introduction of Actresses in England: Delay or Defensiveness?,\" in Comensoli and Russell, p. 185.</ref> The mere fact that Jackson referred to the boy as \"she,\" when he certainly knew better rationally, may in itself testify to the strength of the illusion.\n\n==Responses==\nMany [[Puritan]] preachers, who hated the theatre in general, were outraged by the use of boy players, which they believed encouraged homosexual lust. In [[1583 in literature|1583]], [[Philip Stubbes]] complained that plays were full of \"such wanton gestures, such bawdy speeches...such kissing and bussing\" that playgoers would go home together \"very friendly...and play the sodomites, or worse.\"<ref>Philip Stubbes, ''The Anatomy of Abuses'' (1583), quoted in Bruce R. Smith, ed. ''Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts'' (New York: Bedford St Martin's, 2001), p. 275.</ref> John Rainolds warned of the \"filthy sparkles of lust to that vice the putting of women's attire on men may kindle in unclean affections.\"<ref>John Rainolds, ''The Overthrow of Stage Playes'' ([[1599 in literature|1599]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\nIn response to such comments, the actor-playwright [[Thomas Heywood]] protested that audiences were capable of distancing themselves: \"To see our youths attired in the habit of women, who knows not what their intents be? Who cannot distinguish them by their names, assuredly knowing they are but to represent such a lady, at such a time appointed?\"<ref>Thomas Heywood, ''An Apology for Actors'' ([[1612 in literature|1612]]), quoted in Smith, ''Twelfth Night'', p. 276</ref>\n\n==Famous boy players==\n*[[Christopher Beeston]] was perhaps the greatest success story among the child actors (at least in worldly terms). He continued his acting career into his maturity, became a theatre manager, and by the 1620s and '30s was arguably the most influential man in the world of London theatre.\n*[[Nathan Field]] was another success story of the children's companies. In ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'', Jonson hailed him as the \"best\" of the young actors (\"Which is your best actor, your Field?\"). As an adult, Field acted with the King's Men, and wrote creditable plays as well.\n*Solomon Pavy became one of the Children of the Chapel in 1600, at the age of ten. He acted in Jonson's ''Cynthia's Revels'' and ''The Poetaster.'' When he died prematurely in 1603, Jonson wrote an epitaph for him, praising Pavy's talent for playing old men.\n*[[Alexander Cooke]] was the boy who is thought to have created many of Shakespeare's heroines on stage. He remained with the King's Men as an adult actor.\n*[[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]] graduated from the Children of the Chapel, via [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] and the Duke of York's/[[Prince Charles' Men]], to replace [[Richard Burbage]] as the leading man of the King's Men. He played Hamlet, Othello, and all the major Shakespearean roles.\n*[[Stephen Hammerton]] was a prominent boy actor with the King's Men in the last decade of English Renaissance theatre, 1632&ndash;42.\n*[[Hugh Clark (actor)|Hugh Clark]] was a noted boy player in the 1625&ndash;30 period.\n*[[Charles Hart (17th-century actor)|Charles Hart]] started out as a boy player with the King's Men, earning fame for his portrayal of the Duchess in [[James Shirley|Shirley's]] [[The Cardinal (play)|''The Cardinal'']] ([[1641 in literature|1641]]). He became a leading man and a star of the stage during the Restoration.\n*[[Theophilus Bird]] started as a boy player; like Hart he resumed his career as an adult actor when the theatres re-opened in 1660.\n*[[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] was the last prominent boy actor; he worked during the [[Restoration comedy|Restoration]].\n\n==In film, literature and theatre==\nThe boy player has been a popular subject in literary, theatrical and cinematic representations of the Elizabethan theatre.\n*The film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' features a boy player (played by [[Daniel Brocklebank]]) who performs Juliet in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' before being ousted by [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character (who is disguised as a man).\n*[[Nicholas Wright (playwright)|Nicholas Wright]]'s play ''[[Cressida (play)|Cressida]]'' is set in the 1630s and depicts the friendship between an elderly former boy player and the historical boy player [[Stephen Hammerton]].\n*The play and film ''[[Stage Beauty]]'' are about the Restoration boy player [[Edward Kynaston (actor)|Edward Kynaston]] and the transition to female acting.\n*[[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel about Christopher Marlowe, ''[[A Dead Man in Deptford]]'', is narrated by a boy player.\n*[[Tom Stoppard]]'s film of ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' features a scene in which the eponymous duo are briefly convinced of the femininity of a boy player.\n*[[Susan Cooper]]'s novel ''[[King of Shadows]]'' deals with boy actors including [[Nathan Field]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Comensoli, Viviana, and Anne Russell, eds.
