At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 72, based on 7 reviews.<ref name=\"Meta\"/>\n\nDavid Drake of ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' praised the album for its \"bombastic production and surreal lyricism\" and Cam's \"unique brand of idiosyncratic gangsta\" being wildly engaging because of his absurd, poker-faced delivery, concluding that \"''Purple Haze'' is such a twisted take on gangsta that it has to be heard to be believed.\"<ref name=\"Stylus\"/> ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' contributor Jonah Weiner noted how the production throughout the record moves between \"aggressively insane (\"Shake\")\" to \"adore pop (the [[Cyndi Lauper]]-interpolating \"[[Girls Just Wanna Have Fun]]\")\" while Cam matches that balance with wordplay that's \"[[Missy Elliott|Missy]] gibberish swathed in [[50 Cent]] menace,\" concluding that he \"writes pop hooks and avant-garde rhymes while staying as close to the streets as a manhole cover.\"<ref name=\"Blender\"/> Chris Ryan from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' gave credit to Cam for tightening his signature flow, choosing quality and risk-worthy beats, and maintaining listener interest while delivering \"Harlem symbolism and non-sensical muttering\" throughout the album.<ref name=\"Spin\"/> [[AllMusic]] editor Andy Kellman was mixed about the tracks on the record, finding \"Girls\" and \"Harlem Streets\" to be weak inclusions but praised the contributions from Kanye West (\"Down and Out\"), Pop & Versatile (\"Soap Opera\") and the Heatmakerz (\"More Gangsta Music\"). He also commented that the \"Diplomat-affiliated material\" being released alongside it that year may cause their fanbase to suffer burnout from too much content.<ref name=\"AM\"/> [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V.
