The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock's land. The town's trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], Pittsboro is named for his son, [[William Pitt the Younger]].\n\nPittsboro was once considered as a site for both the [[University of North Carolina]] and the state capital. The university was established in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], beginning in 1789. The state capital is [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], {{convert|34|mi}} east of Pittsboro.\n\nAs the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.\n\n=== Slavery and racial segregation ===\nThe area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and [[emancipation]], whites used violence and other means to enforce [[white supremacy]] and suppress the freedmen's vote. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other supremacist groups were active in the county.<ref name=\"huber\" />\n\nIn 1885 Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of four African Americans]], including a woman, that earned statewide condemnation. They were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case.<ref name=\"huber\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522619 Patrick J.

This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] in Pittsboro was taken down.<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/chatham-county/article237568224.html Confederate monument at the center of protests in Chatham County taken down]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/pittsboro-confederate-statue.html Confederate Statue in North Carolina Comes Down After 112 Years]</ref>\n\n=== Early industrialization ===\nDuring the previous decade, textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.\n\n=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===\n[[image:pittsboro1.jpeg|Chatham County Courthouse|right]]\nOn March 25, 2010, the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] (pictured below), while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15&nbsp;p.m.; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45&nbsp;p.m. By 5 p.m., smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.\n\nThe building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7303536/|title=Fire severely damages Chatham County courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=25 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30&nbsp;a.m., the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.\n\n[[File:2013-08-18--14.46.12-tpl.jpg|thumb|left|Viewed from the west-northwest, the Chatham County Court House in August 2013, having been rebuilt after a fire destroyed the upper floors and clock tower.]]\nThe fire marshal's investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a [[soldering]] torch that ignited wood near the [[soffit]]. Workers attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful. On March 31, 2010, the Chatham County Commissioners voted to rebuild the courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7335504/|title=Chatham commissioners vote to rebuild courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=31 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> It reopened on April 20, 2013.<ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/04/20/2839308/historic-chatham-county-courthouse.html</ref>\n\n== City government ==\nThe mayor of Pittsboro is elected [[at-large]].

The Chatham County Court House was built on land belonging to Mial Scurlock, but in 1787 the legislature declared that a town could not be established on Scurlock's land. The town's trustees instead purchased adjacent land belonging to William Petty and laid out the town. That same year, Pittsboro was officially named the county seat. Although Chatham County is named for [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], Pittsboro is named for his son, [[William Pitt the Younger]].\n\nPittsboro was once considered as a site for both the [[University of North Carolina]] and the state capital. The university was established in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], beginning in 1789. The state capital is [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], {{convert|34|mi}} east of Pittsboro.\n\nAs the county seat, Pittsboro has been a center of trade and local government, including the courts. Many farmers would come into town on the weekend for trade. In 1881 a new county courthouse and jail were built in Pittsboro.\n\n=== Slavery and racial segregation ===\nThe area did not have large plantations, but farmers also depended on slave labor. In 1860 nearly one-third of the county population was made up of enslaved African Americans. After the Civil War and [[emancipation]], whites used violence and other means to enforce [[white supremacy]] and suppress the freedmen's vote. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] and other supremacist groups were active in the county.<ref name=\"huber\" />\n\nIn 1885 Pittsboro was the scene of a notorious mass [[Lynching in the United States|lynching of four African Americans]], including a woman, that earned statewide condemnation. They were tenant farmers. A masked mob took Jerry Finch, his wife Harriet, and Lee Tyson from jail, where they were being held after arrest as suspects in a robbery/murder case.<ref name=\"huber\">[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23522619 Patrick J.

This political exclusion lasted until after 1965 and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act]].  In 2019, a statue erected in 1907 of a Confederate soldier outside the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] in Pittsboro was taken down.<ref>[https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/counties/chatham-county/article237568224.html Confederate monument at the center of protests in Chatham County taken down]</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/pittsboro-confederate-statue.html Confederate Statue in North Carolina Comes Down After 112 Years]</ref>\n\n=== Early industrialization ===\nDuring the previous decade, textile mills in the north-central area of the county along the Haw River, Rocky River, and Deep River provided new manufacturing jobs to workers who had lost farm holdings due to economic depressions of the 1870s and early 1880s. It was the beginning of industrialization around Pittsboro.\n\n=== Chatham County Courthouse fire ===\n[[image:pittsboro1.jpeg|Chatham County Courthouse|right]]\nOn March 25, 2010, the [[Chatham County Courthouse]] (pictured below), while undergoing a $415,000 exterior renovation, caught fire. Smoke was first reported in the area around 4:15&nbsp;p.m.; the fire was dispatched to the Pittsboro Fire Department around 4:45&nbsp;p.m. By 5 p.m., smoke was reported to be rising from out of the clock tower, which was surrounded by scaffolds. The building was evacuated safely.\n\nThe building suffered severe damage to the clock tower and the third floor. It was reported that the fire had destroyed all the computers and records, but there were offsite copies and the information was recoverable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7303536/|title=Fire severely damages Chatham County courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=25 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 26, 2010, at approximately 1:30&nbsp;a.m., the clock tower collapsed onto the main building, but the building as a whole was damaged only on the second floor. Damage in the rest of the building was from water and smoke effects. Overall 11 fire departments participated in the fire efforts.\n\n[[File:2013-08-18--14.46.12-tpl.jpg|thumb|left|Viewed from the west-northwest, the Chatham County Court House in August 2013, having been rebuilt after a fire destroyed the upper floors and clock tower.]]\nThe fire marshal's investigation into the fire determined that it was caused by a [[soldering]] torch that ignited wood near the [[soffit]]. Workers attempted to extinguish the blaze, but were unsuccessful. On March 31, 2010, the Chatham County Commissioners voted to rebuild the courthouse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/7335504/|title=Chatham commissioners vote to rebuild courthouse :: WRAL.com|first=|last=WRAL|date=31 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> It reopened on April 20, 2013.<ref>http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/04/20/2839308/historic-chatham-county-courthouse.html</ref>\n\n== City government ==\nThe mayor of Pittsboro is elected [[at-large]].
