The summers (March\u2013June) are very hot and dry while the winters are fairly pleasant. The temperatures in the summers often rise over 50 degrees during the day. The rainy season (July\u2013December) is often the best time for tourist visits, as fields are brilliantly green with paddy crops, rivers flowing with monsoon water, and a relatively cool climate. The region has long been home to the Indian nobles due to its climate and fertile soil, and several [[zamindar]] large mansions are scattered around the Godavari area.\n\n[[File:Caves on Dhammalingesvarasvami Hill 03.JPG|thumbnail|Caves on Dhammalingesvarasvami Hill at Guntupalle]]\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{historical populations|11=1901|12=9,19,234|13=1911|14=10,46,050|15=1921|16=11,18,436|17=1931|18=12,98,758|19=1941|20=14,65,111|21=1951|22=16,97,727|23=1961|24=19,78,257|25=1971|26=23,74,306|27=1981|28=28,73,958|29=1991|30=35,17,568|31=2001|32=38,03,517|33=2011|34=39,36,966|percentages=pagr|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/PCA/A2_Data_Table.html Decadal Variation In Population Since 1901]</ref>|align=right}}{{As of|2011}} [[Census of India]], West Godavari district has a population of 3,936,966 with 1,091,525 households, which is the 11th most populous district in the state.<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web|title=District Census Handbook \u2013 West Godavari |url=http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/dchb/2815_PART_B_DCHB_WEST%20GODAVARI.pdf|website=Census of India|accessdate=18 January 2015|pages=24|format=PDF}}</ref> The district's population is approximately equal to the population of [[Liberia]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url =  https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 1 October 2011 | quote =Liberia 3,786,764July 2011 est.}}</ref> and [[Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=2010 Resident Population Data|publisher=U.
