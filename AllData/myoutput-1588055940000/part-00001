Streaming TV stands in contrast to dedicated [[terrestrial television]] delivered by [[Broadcast television systems|over-the-air]] aerial systems, [[cable television]], and/or [[satellite television]] systems.

[[CNBC]], [[Bloomberg Television]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] use live-streaming services from [[BitGravity]] to stream live television to paid subscribers using the HTTP protocol.\n\nBBC iPlayer originally incorporated [[peer-to-peer]] streaming, moved towards centralized distribution for their video streaming services.  BBC executive Anthony rose cited network performance as an important factor in the decision, as well as the unhappiness among consumers unhappy with their own network bandwidth being consumed for transmitting content to other viewers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crave.cnet.co.uk/software/0,39029471,49302215,00.htm|title=iPlayer uncovered: What powers the BBC's epic creation?|date=November 18, 2009}} CNet interview with iPlayer boss Anthony Rose, mostly on iPlayer 3.0</ref>\n\nSamsung TV has also announced their plans to provide streaming options including 3D Video on Demand through their Explore 3D service.<ref>[http://www.twice.com/article/468711-Samsung_To_Do_3D_VOD_Streaming.php Samsung To Do 3D VOD Streaming], May 24, 2011</ref>\n===Access control===\nSome streaming services incorporate [[digital rights management]].

The goal of these systems is to enable parents to keep children from viewing sexually-themed, violent, or otherwise inappropriate material. Flagging systems can be used to warn a user that content may be certified or that it is intended for viewing post-[[Watershed (television)|watershed]]. Honour systems are also used where users are asked for their dates of birth or age to verify if they are able to view certain content.<ref>{{cite news |title=Internet en TV Vergelijken: Vandaag nog de goedkoopste aanbieding |url=https://www.internetvergelijk.nl/televisie/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=www.internetvergelijk.nl |agency=Roza Sinensis |language=nl}}</ref>\n\n===IPTV===\n{{main|IPTV}}\n[[IPTV]] delivers television content using signals based on the [[Internet protocol]] (IP), through the open, unmanaged Internet with the \"last-mile\" telecom company acting only as the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). As described above, \"Internet television\" is \"over-the-top technology\" (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a [[packet-switched network]] to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system\u2014a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narang|first=Nitin|title= Concept Series : What is the Difference between OTT and IPTV|url=http://www.mediaentertainmentinfo.com/2013/04/2-concept-series-what-is-the-difference-between-ott-and-iptv.html/|work=Researcher on TV technology|publisher=Media Entertainment Info|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional [[circuit switched]] analog or [[digital television]] channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]] that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.\n\nThe Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for [[time shifting]] television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports [[video on demand]]\u2014browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company's scheduled broadcasts.\n\nIPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!\n!IPTV\n!Over-the-top technology\n|-\n!Content provider\n|Local telecom\n|Studio, channel, or independent service\n|-\n!Transmission network\n|Local telecom - dedicated owned or leased network\n|Public Internet + local telecom\n|-\n!Receiver\n|Local telecom provides  (set-top box)\n|Purchased by consumer (box, stick, TV, computer, or mobile)\n|-\n!Display device\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|-\n!Examples\n| [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Bell Fibe TV]], [[Verizon Fios]] (IPTV service now discontinued)\n| [[Video on demand]] services like [[fuboTV]], [[PlayStation Vue]], [[Sky Go]], [[YouTube]], [[Netflix]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DittoTV]], [[Yupptv|YuppTV]], [[Lovefilm]], [[BBC iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Sony Liv]], [[MyTV (Arabic)|myTV]], [[Now TV (UK)|Now TV]], [[Emagine International|Emagine]], [[Sling TV|SlingTV]], KlowdTV\n|}\n\n==Streaming quality==\nStreaming quality is the quality of image and audio transmission from the servers of the distributor to the user's screen. High-definition video (720p+) and later standards require higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds than previous standards, because they carry higher spatial resolution image content. In addition, transmission packet loss and latency caused by network impairments and insufficient bandwidth degrade replay quality. Decoding errors may manifest themselves with video breakup and macro blocks. The generally accepted download rate for streaming high-definition video encoded in [[H.264]] is 3500 kbit/s, whereas standard-definition television can range from 500 to 1500 kbit/s depending on the resolution on screen. In the UK, the BBC iPlayer deals with the largest amount of traffic yet it offers HD content along with SD content. As more people have gotten broadband connections which can deal with streaming HD video over the Internet, the BBC iPlayer has tried to keep up with demand and pace. However, as streaming HD video takes around 1.5 GB of data per hour of video the BBC has had to invest a lot of money collected from License Fee payers to implement this on a large scale.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/04/bbc_iplayer_goes_hd_adds_highe.html BBC iPlayer goes HD, adds higher quality streams, releases iPlayer Desktop out of Labs], BBC Internet Blog, 20/04/2009</ref>\n\nFor users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD video or even high-SD video, which requires 1500 kbit/s, the BBC iPlayer offers lower bitrate streams which in turn lead to lower video quality. This makes use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user's bandwidth suddenly drops, iPlayer will lower its streaming rate to compensate. A diagnostic tool offered on the BBC iPlayer site measures a user's streaming capabilities and bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/diagnostics |title=BBC web page which runs a diagnostic of Internet download speeds for streaming remotely |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nInternet television is common in most US households as of the mid 2010s.

Internet-only channels are now established enough to feature some Emmy-nominated shows, such as [[Netflix]]'s ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/house-cards-season-2-sees-surge-viewers-netflix-article-1.1617972 | title='House of Cards' season 2 sees surge of Netflix viewers over first season | work=NY Daily News | date=February 18, 2014 | accessdate=July 2, 2016 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}</ref> Many networks also distribute their shows the next day to streaming providers such as [[Hulu]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com|title=Watch TV and movies on Xbox, PS3, Apple TV, and more - Hulu|work=Hulu}}</ref> Some networks may use a proprietary system, such as the [[BBC]] utilizes their [[iPlayer]] format. This has resulted in bandwidth demands increasing to the point of causing issues for some networks. It was reported in February 2014 that [[FIOS|Verizon]] is having issues coping with the demand placed on their network infrastructure. Until long-term bandwidth issues are worked out and regulation such at net neutrality Internet Televisions push to HDTV may start to hinder growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/computing/177073-why-netflix-streaming-is-getting-slower-and-probably-wont-get-better-any-time-soon|title=Why Netflix streaming is getting slower, and probably won\u2019t get better any time soon|work=ExtremeTech}}</ref>\n\n[[Aereo]] was launched in March 2012 in New York City (and subsequently stopped from broadcasting in June 2014). It streamed network TV only to New York customers over the Internet. Broadcasters filed lawsuits against Aereo, because Aereo captured broadcast signals and streamed the content to Aereo's customers without paying broadcasters. In mid-July 2012, a federal judge sided with the Aereo start-up. Aereo planned to expand to every major metropolitan area by the end of 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/aereo-broadcasters-streams-networks-tv_n_1690173.html |title=Aereo Threatens Broadcasters By Streaming Network TV Online |date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The Supreme Court ruled against Aereo June 24, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|date=June 25, 2014|work=CNNMoney| title=Supreme Court rules against Aereo| author=Stelter, Brian |url=http://money.cnn.com/2014/06/25/media/aereo-supreme-court-ruling/}}</ref>\n\n==Market competitors==\nMany providers of Internet television services exist\u2014including conventional television stations that have taken advantage of the Internet as a way to continue showing television shows after they have been broadcast, often advertised as \"on-demand\" and \"catch-up\" services. Today, almost every major broadcaster around the world is operating an Internet television platform.<ref>[http://www.international-television.org/itve/ Internet television platforms around the world] International TV Explorer</ref> Examples include the BBC, which introduced the [[BBC iPlayer]] on 25 June 2008 as an extension to its \"RadioPlayer\" and already existing streamed video-clip content, and Channel 4 that launched 4oD (\"4 on Demand\") (now All 4) in November 2006 allowing users to watch recently shown content. Most Internet television services allow users to view content free of charge; however, some content is for a fee.\n\nSince 2012, around 200 over-the-top (OTT) platforms providing streamed and downloadable content have emerged.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parksassociates.com/blog/article/pr-11092017|title=Parks Associates Announces 2017 Top 10 U.S. Subscription OTT Video Services|website=www.parksassociates.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-07}}</ref> Investment by [[Netflix]] in new original content for its OTT platform reached $13bn in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/07/08/netflix-original-programming-13-billion/|title=Netflix Is Expected to Spend up to $13 Billion on Original Programming This Year|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting rights==\nBroadcasting rights vary from country to country and even within provinces of countries. These rights govern the distribution of copyrighted content and media and allow the sole distribution of that content at any one time. An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a [[VPN]] or [[proxy server]]. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as [[HBO]] for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.\n\nSome companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America {{when|date=September 2016}} is the use of the \"[[TV Everywhere]]\" system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select [[Internet service provider]]s, usually cable television companies that pay a [[retransmission consent]] or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.\n\n==Profits and costs==\nWith the advent of broadband Internet connections, multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as [[Netflix]] and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider; it has over 130 million members and its membership numbers are growing.{{when|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/|title=Netflix subscribers count in the U.S.|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called \"cord cutters\". [[Cord-cutting|Cord cutter]]s are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to [[streaming media|stream]] TV shows, movies and other content via the [[Internet]]. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of [[video sharing website]]s (e.g., [[YouTube]]) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.\n\n==Overview of platforms and availability==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Service !! Supporting company/companies !! Regional availability !!

Flagging systems can be used to warn a user that content may be certified or that it is intended for viewing post-[[Watershed (television)|watershed]]. Honour systems are also used where users are asked for their dates of birth or age to verify if they are able to view certain content.<ref>{{cite news |title=Internet en TV Vergelijken: Vandaag nog de goedkoopste aanbieding |url=https://www.internetvergelijk.nl/televisie/ |accessdate=27 November 2018 |work=www.internetvergelijk.nl |agency=Roza Sinensis |language=nl}}</ref>\n\n===IPTV===\n{{main|IPTV}}\n[[IPTV]] delivers television content using signals based on the [[Internet protocol]] (IP), through the open, unmanaged Internet with the \"last-mile\" telecom company acting only as the [[Internet service provider]] (ISP). As described above, \"Internet television\" is \"over-the-top technology\" (OTT). Both IPTV and OTT use the Internet protocol over a [[packet-switched network]] to transmit data, but IPTV operates in a closed system\u2014a dedicated, managed network controlled by the local cable, satellite, telephone, or fiber-optic company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Narang|first=Nitin|title= Concept Series : What is the Difference between OTT and IPTV|url=http://www.mediaentertainmentinfo.com/2013/04/2-concept-series-what-is-the-difference-between-ott-and-iptv.html/|work=Researcher on TV technology|publisher=Media Entertainment Info|accessdate=4 September 2013}}</ref> In its simplest form, IPTV simply replaces traditional [[circuit switched]] analog or [[digital television]] channels with digital channels which happen to use packet-switched transmission. In both the old and new systems, subscribers have [[set-top box]]es or other [[customer-premises equipment]] that communicates directly over company-owned or dedicated leased lines with central-office servers. Packets never travel over the public Internet, so the television provider can guarantee enough local bandwidth for each customer's needs.\n\nThe Internet protocol is a cheap, standardized way to enable two-way communication and simultaneously provide different data (e.g., TV-show files, email, Web browsing) to different customers. This supports DVR-like features for [[time shifting]] television: for example, to catch up on a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago, or to replay the current TV show from its beginning. It also supports [[video on demand]]\u2014browsing a catalog of videos (such as movies or television shows) which might be unrelated to the company's scheduled broadcasts.\n\nIPTV has an ongoing standardization process (for example, at the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]]).\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!\n!IPTV\n!Over-the-top technology\n|-\n!Content provider\n|Local telecom\n|Studio, channel, or independent service\n|-\n!Transmission network\n|Local telecom - dedicated owned or leased network\n|Public Internet + local telecom\n|-\n!Receiver\n|Local telecom provides  (set-top box)\n|Purchased by consumer (box, stick, TV, computer, or mobile)\n|-\n!Display device\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|Screen provided by consumer\n|-\n!Examples\n| [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Bell Fibe TV]], [[Verizon Fios]] (IPTV service now discontinued)\n| [[Video on demand]] services like [[fuboTV]], [[PlayStation Vue]], [[Sky Go]], [[YouTube]], [[Netflix]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DittoTV]], [[Yupptv|YuppTV]], [[Lovefilm]], [[BBC iPlayer]], [[Hulu]], [[Sony Liv]], [[MyTV (Arabic)|myTV]], [[Now TV (UK)|Now TV]], [[Emagine International|Emagine]], [[Sling TV|SlingTV]], KlowdTV\n|}\n\n==Streaming quality==\nStreaming quality is the quality of image and audio transmission from the servers of the distributor to the user's screen. High-definition video (720p+) and later standards require higher bandwidth and faster connection speeds than previous standards, because they carry higher spatial resolution image content. In addition, transmission packet loss and latency caused by network impairments and insufficient bandwidth degrade replay quality. Decoding errors may manifest themselves with video breakup and macro blocks. The generally accepted download rate for streaming high-definition video encoded in [[H.264]] is 3500 kbit/s, whereas standard-definition television can range from 500 to 1500 kbit/s depending on the resolution on screen. In the UK, the BBC iPlayer deals with the largest amount of traffic yet it offers HD content along with SD content. As more people have gotten broadband connections which can deal with streaming HD video over the Internet, the BBC iPlayer has tried to keep up with demand and pace. However, as streaming HD video takes around 1.5 GB of data per hour of video the BBC has had to invest a lot of money collected from License Fee payers to implement this on a large scale.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2009/04/bbc_iplayer_goes_hd_adds_highe.html BBC iPlayer goes HD, adds higher quality streams, releases iPlayer Desktop out of Labs], BBC Internet Blog, 20/04/2009</ref>\n\nFor users who do not have the bandwidth to stream HD video or even high-SD video, which requires 1500 kbit/s, the BBC iPlayer offers lower bitrate streams which in turn lead to lower video quality. This makes use of an adaptive bitrate stream so that if the user's bandwidth suddenly drops, iPlayer will lower its streaming rate to compensate. A diagnostic tool offered on the BBC iPlayer site measures a user's streaming capabilities and bandwidth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/diagnostics |title=BBC web page which runs a diagnostic of Internet download speeds for streaming remotely |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nInternet television is common in most US households as of the mid 2010s.

An example of content only being aired in certain countries is BBC iPlayer. The BBC checks a user's IP address to make sure that only users located in the UK can stream content from the BBC. The BBC only allows free use of their product for users within the UK as those users have paid for a television license that funds part of the BBC. This IP address check is not foolproof as the user may be accessing the BBC website through a [[VPN]] or [[proxy server]]. Broadcasting rights can also be restricted to allowing a broadcaster rights to distribute that content for a limited time. Channel 4's online service All 4 can only stream shows created in the US by companies such as [[HBO]] for thirty days after they are aired on one of the Channel 4 group channels. This is to boost DVD sales for the companies who produce that media.\n\nSome companies pay very large amounts for broadcasting rights with sports and US sitcoms usually fetching the highest price from UK-based broadcasters. A trend among major content producers in North America {{when|date=September 2016}} is the use of the \"[[TV Everywhere]]\" system. Especially for live content, the TV Everywhere system restricts viewership of a video feed to select [[Internet service provider]]s, usually cable television companies that pay a [[retransmission consent]] or subscription fee to the content producer. This often has the negative effect of making the availability of content dependent upon the provider, with the consumer having little or no choice on whether they receive the product.\n\n==Profits and costs==\nWith the advent of broadband Internet connections, multiple streaming providers have come onto the market in the last couple of years. The main providers are Netflix, Hulu and Amazon. Some of these providers such as Hulu advertise and charge a monthly fee. Other such as [[Netflix]] and Amazon charge users a monthly fee and have no commercials. Netflix is the largest provider; it has over 130 million members and its membership numbers are growing.{{when|date=September 2016}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/250937/quarterly-number-of-netflix-streaming-subscribers-in-the-us/|title=Netflix subscribers count in the U.S.|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> The rise of internet TV has resulted in cable companies losing customers to a new kind of customer called \"cord cutters\". [[Cord-cutting|Cord cutter]]s are consumers who are cancelling their cable TV or satellite TV subscriptions and choosing instead to [[streaming media|stream]] TV shows, movies and other content via the [[Internet]]. Cord cutters are forming communities. With the increasing availability of [[video sharing website]]s (e.g., [[YouTube]]) and streaming services, there is an alternative to cable and satellite television subscriptions. Cord cutters tend to be younger people.\n\n==Overview of platforms and availability==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Service !! Supporting company/companies !! Regional availability !!
