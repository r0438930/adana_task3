The film was written and directed by the show's creators, [[Matt Maiellaro]] and [[Dave Willis]]. The film features the voices of [[Dana Snyder]], [[Carey Means]], Willis, Maiellaro, [[Mike Schatz]], [[Andy Merrill]], [[C. Martin Croker]], [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Neil Peart]] and [[Chris Kattan]]. The film was theatrically released on April 13, 2007. The film marks the first time an Adult Swim series was adapted into a feature film. The film grossed $5.5 million on a $750,000 budget.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> [[Warner Home Video]] released the film in a two-disc DVD edition on August 14, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nBefore the main feature, a faux theater [[concession stand]] advertisement plays. A group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] theater snacks, The Soda Dog Refreshment Band, sings a spoof of ''[[Let's All Go to the Lobby]]'' until they are interrupted by another snack band (performed by [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]). They proceed to loudly sing their own bizarre theater rules before finishing on a guitar solo.\n\nThe film properly begins in [[Egypt]], where [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], and [[Meatwad]] break free from the [[Sphinx]], and are attacked by an oversized [[Poodle]] who kills Frylock before Shake defeats it. Shake and Meatwad flee with Frylock's corpse and meet [[Abraham Lincoln|Time Lincoln]]. He helps revive Frylock; however, when government agents break into his house, Time Lincoln helps the Aqua Teens escape in a wooden [[rocket ship]]. Time Lincoln is shot, changing the timeline and resulting in the Confederate States of America's victory in the [[Civil War|American Civil War]] and the government agents being made slaves to a black Kentucky Colonel as punishment for their crimes against [[Southern United States|the South]]. All this, however, is an elaborate story concocted by Shake to explain their origin to Meatwad. Meanwhile, a triangular slice of [[watermelon]] named Walter Melon is flying about in a [[spaceship]] made from a hollowed-out watermelon. He begins observing events of the Aqua Teens on [[Earth]], including a backyard concert performed by Meatwad. Walter Melon is joined in the ship by [[Neil Peart]] from [[Rush (band)|Rush]], sitting at his drums.\n\nShake plans to work out on his new [[exercise machine]], the \"Insanoflex\". Frylock notices that the machine isn't assembled properly and the instructions are nowhere to be found. He searches online for them and instead finds a website written in a rare dialect, with a message in English warning not to assemble the machine ever. The site however lists a phone number which Frylock calls. It is revealed to be the number of Emory and Oglethorpe, the Plutonians. Before they even bother to answer the phone, they discover the [[Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future]] on board with them. The Cybernetic Ghost explains to the two aliens the story of the Insanoflex: a machine, when assembled, will exercise a man into a super-being, who will attract all the women on Earth leading to massive [[inbreeding]] and the eventual [[Human Extinction|extinction of mankind]]. To prevent this, the Ghost traveled to the past and stole a single screw that holds the machine together. The Plutonians point out to him that to get it assembled, someone could just buy another screw or shove a pencil in the screw hole.\n\nBack on Earth, Frylock finishes re-building the Insanoflex, with a pencil in the screw hole, somehow having obtained instructions. He discovers a missing M-shaped circuit board on the back panel. The trio visit [[Carl Brutananadilewski|Carl]], from whom Shake had stolen the machine, to see if he has the missing piece. After he refuses to tell them, Meatwad finds the address in the Insanoflex's box. Dr. Weird, whose abandoned asylum has been purchased and is being turned into condominiums around them, is visited by Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad. Frylock retrieves the missing circuit board and installs it into the machine upon returning home. Carl insists that as the rightful owner he should be the first to test out the machine. The Insanoflex straps him in and transforms itself into a giant one-eyed robot. The robot plays [[Dance music|dance]]/[[techno music]] and heads for downtown [[Philadelphia]], all while Carl's strapped-in form is forced to exercise. Eventually, the robot begins laying metallic spherical eggs, which hatch into smaller versions of the machine.\n\nThe Aqua Teens, aided by an instructional workout video, find a way to destroy the machine by using music. With little time and a failed encounter with MC Pee Pants (reincarnated as a [[fly]]), the Aqua Teens have no choice but to have Shake play his music. Shake poorly plays his original song \"Nude Love\" on acoustic guitar, forcing the Insanoflex to commit [[suicide]]. Carl (now bulging with so much muscle that he can barely move) leaves with his newly found date, a female [[bodybuilder]] named Linda, and they head back to her condo while the Aqua Teens try to figure out a way to stop the newly hatched Insanoflexes from destroying the city.\n\nAs they travel to a possible lead back at Dr. Weird's asylum, Frylock begins to tell the [[origin story]] of the Aqua Teens: they were created by Dr. Weird, along with a [[chicken nugget]] who had gone by the name of Chicken Bittle. In the [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]], Dr. Weird proclaims that the Aqua Teens were created for one purpose: to crash a jet into a brick wall. Realizing the pointlessness of this mission, Frylock diverted the jet and set a course to [[Africa]], where they would try to use their intelligence to solve world hunger. Upon entering Africa, Bittle was attacked and eaten by a [[lion]]. The remaining Aqua Teens then tried to help a small village but instead scared them away. After realizing they couldn't be much help, they returned to America and rented out what is now their house in [[New Jersey]]. Shake and Meatwad state that they do not remember any of this, but Frylock explains it was because they were too busy playing [[Game Boy]] to pay any attention.\n\nMeanwhile, Carl and Linda recline in her room, where she reveals \"herself\" to be Dr. Weird in disguise. He cuts off Carl's muscles and grafts them onto his own body. Frylock and Dr. Weird do battle while they argue back and forth about who created whom. Dr. Weird claims that it was Frylock who created him, not the other way around. Dr Weird shows Frylock a [[teddy bear]] filled with razor blades. Shake tries to take the teddy bear, but he loses his hand. Dr. Weird then reveals that the blue diamond on Frylock's back hides a [[VCR]], in which a video tape with false memories of Dr. Weird creating Frylock had been playing in Frylock's head. Frylock also admits that he is [[Transsexualism|transsexual]] lesbian trapped in a man's body. Just then, Walter Melon arrives in his ship. Meatwad mentions he saw the ship earlier. Shake calls him a liar and shoots him with a shotgun. Shake gets concerned when Meatwad doesn't reform like always. Walter tells Neil to play the Drum Solo Of Life to bring Meatwad [[Resurrection|back to life]]. Meanwhile, Shake tries to pick up the teddy bear for the 2nd time, but loses his other hand; Shake decides he doesn't want the teddy bear and leaves it. Walter Melon explains he created the Aqua Teens and all the other characters, including the Insanoflex. His plan was so that they would all eventually kill each other and Walter would inherit all their real estate in order to create the \"Insano-Gym\". Everyone, however, informs Walter that they all rent and do not own any property, proving Walter's plan and everyone's existence had been useless and pointless. Walter storms off in his ship, threatening to tell their mother. Just then, the Teens see their alleged mother standing before them, revealed to be a 9-layer [[bean burrito]]. Shake suddenly jumps out the window upon hearing this news, Meatwad hugs her, and Frylock states, \"That's neat.\"  In an abrupt end, The Soda Dog Refreshment Gang come onscreen once again and sing the audience out.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], The Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future is seen humping the TV in the Aqua Teens' living room. Then a female box of fries (presumably Frylock who got a [[Sexual reassignment surgery|sex change]]) comes in and says, \"Time for bed, honey...\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dana Snyder]] as [[Master Shake]]\n* [[Carey Means]] as [[Frylock]]\n* [[Dave Willis]] as [[Meatwad]], [[Carl Brutananadilewski]], [[The Mooninites|Ignignokt]], Video Game Voice\n* [[Matt Maiellaro]] as [[The Mooninites|Err]], [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Cybernetic Ghost]], [[Satan]]\n* [[Andy Merrill]] as [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Oglethorpe]]\n* [[Mike Schatz]] as [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Emory]]\n* [[C.

While they dodged many questions, they confirmed that the film would run 80 minutes, produced on a meager $750,000 budget, and features a plot detail about a \"lost Aqua Teen\", who is a large chicken nugget named \"Chicken Bittle\" (voiced by [[Bruce Campbell]]).<ref name=\"Ain't It Cool News\">{{cite web | title = Bruce Campbell As A Chicken Nugget \"Fucks!\", \"Shits!\", And \"Bleeps\" Ahoy!!

But we don't know yet. We're still waiting to find out.\" Following this, the released trailer advertised the film as rated R. The film is mostly uncensored; when censoring does occur, it is occasionally accompanied by a censoring beep that does not obscure the word. Censoring also occurs once during a flashback. As explained in the production feature, the inconsistency was an editing mistake, but left untouched for comic effect.\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{anchor|Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters Colon the Soundtrack}}\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name         = Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters Colon the Soundtrack\n| type         = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist       = Various Artists\n| cover        = \n| alt          =\n| released     = {{Start date|2007|04|10}}\n| recorded     = 2007\n| venue        =\n| studio       =\n| genre        = [[Alternative rock]]<br>[[hard rock]]<br>[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<br>[[rap rock]]\n| length       = 44:25\n| label        = [[Williams Street Records|Williams Street]]\n| producer     = Various Artists\n| chronology   = [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]] music\n| prev_title   =\n| prev_year    =\n| next_title   = [[Have Yourself a Meaty Little Christmas]]\n| next_year    = 2009\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[AllMusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1020832|pure_url=yes}}|title=Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters Colon T - Various Artists|publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>\n}}\nThe [[soundtrack]] was released on April 10, 2007, under the title ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters Colon the Soundtrack''.

Its only reasoning behind this stunt, as stated in the advertisement, was, \"because we're fucking crazy\". While Adult Swim's TV listings on its website stated the movie would be shown, other TV listings reported the same Sunday block. The stunt was, in actuality, yet another one of Adult Swim's annual [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] pranks: though the first few minutes of the movie were shown normally, the remainder was shown in a small [[picture-in-picture]] box in the bottom left-hand corner, with no sound over the normal programming and occasional giant pop-ups alerting viewers of its presence, as well as advertising the actual premiere. The advertising was shown again on one episode of the ''[[Family Guy]]'' marathon on July 6, 2007. The movie eventually was shown on Sunday, March 30, 2008.

The DVD features include the ten fake endings as shown on the internet, a \"making of\" featurette, promos, the \"Deleted Scenes\" episode, a music video, and an eighty-minute animatic (rough cut) of the movie made out of the deleted scenes from the film and scenes from the \"Deleted Scenes\" episode as well as a commentary.

The film was written and directed by the show's creators, [[Matt Maiellaro]] and [[Dave Willis]]. The film features the voices of [[Dana Snyder]], [[Carey Means]], Willis, Maiellaro, [[Mike Schatz]], [[Andy Merrill]], [[C. Martin Croker]], [[Bruce Campbell]], [[Neil Peart]] and [[Chris Kattan]]. The film was theatrically released on April 13, 2007. The film marks the first time an Adult Swim series was adapted into a feature film. The film grossed $5.5 million on a $750,000 budget.<ref name=\"mojo\"/> [[Warner Home Video]] released the film in a two-disc DVD edition on August 14, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nBefore the main feature, a faux theater [[concession stand]] advertisement plays. A group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] theater snacks, The Soda Dog Refreshment Band, sings a spoof of ''[[Let's All Go to the Lobby]]'' until they are interrupted by another snack band (performed by [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]). They proceed to loudly sing their own bizarre theater rules before finishing on a guitar solo.\n\nThe film properly begins in [[Egypt]], where [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], and [[Meatwad]] break free from the [[Sphinx]], and are attacked by an oversized [[Poodle]] who kills Frylock before Shake defeats it. Shake and Meatwad flee with Frylock's corpse and meet [[Abraham Lincoln|Time Lincoln]]. He helps revive Frylock; however, when government agents break into his house, Time Lincoln helps the Aqua Teens escape in a wooden [[rocket ship]]. Time Lincoln is shot, changing the timeline and resulting in the Confederate States of America's victory in the American Civil War and the government agents being made slaves to a black Kentucky Colonel as punishment for their crimes against the South. All this, however, is an elaborate story concocted by Shake to explain their origin to Meatwad. Meanwhile, a triangular slice of [[watermelon]] named Walter Melon is flying about in a spaceship made from a hollowed-out watermelon. He begins observing events of the Aqua Teens on Earth, including a backyard concert performed by Meatwad. Walter Melon is joined in the ship by [[Neil Peart]] from [[Rush (band)|Rush]], sitting at his drums.\n\nShake plans to work out on his new exercise machine, the \"Insanoflex\". Frylock notices that the machine isn't assembled properly and the instructions are nowhere to be found. He searches online for them and instead finds a website written in a rare dialect, with a message in English warning not to assemble the machine ever. The site however lists a phone number which Frylock calls. It is revealed to be the number of Emory and Oglethorpe, the Plutonians. Before they even bother to answer the phone, they discover the [[Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future]] on board with them. The Cybernetic Ghost explains to the two aliens the story of the Insanoflex: a machine, when assembled, will exercise a man into a super-being, who will attract all the women on Earth leading to massive [[inbreeding]] and the eventual extinction of mankind. To prevent this, the Ghost traveled to the past and stole a single screw that holds the machine together. The Plutonians point out to him that to get it assembled, someone could just buy another screw or shove a pencil in the screw hole.\n\nBack on Earth, Frylock finishes re-building the Insanoflex, with a pencil in the screw hole, somehow having obtained instructions. He discovers a missing M-shaped circuit board on the back panel. The trio visit [[Carl Brutananadilewski|Carl]], from whom Shake had stolen the machine, to see if he has the missing piece. After he refuses to tell them, Meatwad finds the address in the Insanoflex's box. Dr. Weird, whose abandoned asylum has been purchased and is being turned into condominiums around them, is visited by Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad. Frylock retrieves the missing circuit board and installs it into the machine upon returning home. Carl insists that as the rightful owner he should be the first to test out the machine. The Insanoflex straps him in and transforms itself into a giant one-eyed robot. The robot plays dance/techno music and heads for downtown [[Philadelphia]], all while Carl's strapped-in form is forced to exercise. Eventually, the robot begins laying metallic spherical eggs, which hatch into smaller versions of the machine.\n\nThe Aqua Teens, aided by an instructional workout video, find a way to destroy the machine by using music. With little time and a failed encounter with MC Pee Pants (reincarnated as a fly), the Aqua Teens have no choice but to have Shake play his music. Shake poorly plays his original song \"Nude Love\" on acoustic guitar, forcing the Insanoflex to commit suicide. Carl (now bulging with so much muscle that he can barely move) leaves with his newly found date, a female bodybuilder named Linda, and they head back to her condo while the Aqua Teens try to figure out a way to stop the newly hatched Insanoflexes from destroying the city.\n\nAs they travel to a possible lead back at Dr. Weird's asylum, Frylock begins to tell the origin story of the Aqua Teens: they were created by Dr. Weird, along with a [[chicken nugget]] who had gone by the name of Chicken Bittle. In the flashback, Dr. Weird proclaims that the Aqua Teens were created for one purpose: to crash a jet into a brick wall. Realizing the pointlessness of this mission, Frylock diverted the jet and set a course to Africa, where they would try to use their intelligence to solve world hunger. Upon entering Africa, Bittle was attacked and eaten by a lion. The remaining Aqua Teens then tried to help a small village but instead scared them away. After realizing they couldn't be much help, they returned to America and rented out what is now their house in New Jersey. Shake and Meatwad state that they do not remember any of this, but Frylock explains it was because they were too busy playing [[Game Boy]] to pay any attention.\n\nMeanwhile, Carl and Linda recline in her room, where she reveals \"herself\" to be Dr. Weird in disguise. He cuts off Carl's muscles and grafts them onto his own body. Frylock and Dr. Weird do battle while they argue back and forth about who created whom. Dr. Weird claims that it was Frylock who created him, not the other way around. Dr Weird shows Frylock a teddy bear filled with razor blades. Shake tries to take the teddy bear, but he loses his hand. Dr. Weird then reveals that the blue diamond on Frylock's back hides a [[VCR]], in which a video tape with false memories of Dr. Weird creating Frylock had been playing in Frylock's head. Frylock also admits that he is [[Transsexualism|transsexual]] lesbian trapped in a man's body. Just then, Walter Melon arrives in his ship. Meatwad mentions he saw the ship earlier. Shake calls him a liar and shoots him with a shotgun. Shake gets concerned when Meatwad doesn't reform like always. Walter tells Neil to play the Drum Solo Of Life to bring Meatwad back to life. Meanwhile, Shake tries to pick up the teddy bear for the 2nd time, but loses his other hand; Shake decides he doesn't want the teddy bear and leaves it. Walter Melon explains he created the Aqua Teens and all the other characters, including the Insanoflex. His plan was so that they would all eventually kill each other and Walter would inherit all their real estate in order to create the \"Insano-Gym\". Everyone, however, informs Walter that they all rent and do not own any property, proving Walter's plan and everyone's existence had been useless and pointless. Walter storms off in his ship, threatening to tell their mother. Just then, the Teens see their alleged mother standing before them, revealed to be a 9-layer bean burrito. Shake suddenly jumps out the window upon hearing this news, Meatwad hugs her, and Frylock states, \"That's neat.\"  In an abrupt end, The Soda Dog Refreshment Gang come onscreen once again and sing the audience out.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], The Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future is seen humping the TV in the Aqua Teens' living room. Then a female box of fries (presumably Frylock who got a [[Sexual reassignment surgery|sex change]]) comes in and says, \"Time for bed, honey...\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Dana Snyder]] as [[Master Shake]]\n* [[Carey Means]] as [[Frylock]]\n* [[Dave Willis]] as [[Meatwad]], [[Carl Brutananadilewski]], [[The Mooninites|Ignignokt]], Video Game Voice\n* [[Matt Maiellaro]] as [[The Mooninites|Err]], [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Cybernetic Ghost]], [[Satan]]\n* [[Andy Merrill]] as [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Oglethorpe]]\n* [[Mike Schatz]] as [[List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force characters|Emory]]\n* [[C.

Its only reasoning behind this stunt, as stated in the advertisement, was, \"because we're fucking crazy\". While Adult Swim's TV listings on its website stated the movie would be shown, other TV listings reported the same Sunday block. The stunt was, in actuality, yet another one of Adult Swim's annual [[April Fools' Day|April Fools']] pranks: though the first few minutes of the movie were shown normally, the remainder was shown in a small [[picture-in-picture]] box in the bottom left-hand corner, with no sound over the normal programming and occasional giant pop-ups alerting viewers of its presence, as well as advertising the actual premiere. The advertising was shown again on one episode of the ''[[Family Guy]]'' marathon on July 6, 2007. The movie eventually was shown on Sunday, March 30, 2008. The day after the April Fools' joke, Cartoon Network showed another [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumper]], stating: \"Sorry you will still have to pay to actually see the movie.

These endings are parodies of other films. For example, one of the endings spoofs ''[[The Terminator]]'', featuring Meatwad as \"The Determinator\".\n\n==Release==\n===Home media===\n{{See also|Aqua Teen Hunger Force#Home releases|l1=List of Aqua Teen Hunger Force DVDs}}\n[[Warner Home Video]] released ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters'' in a two-disc [[DVD]] edition on August 14, 2007. For the DVD release, the studio changed the title of the eighty-seven-minute full-length movie to ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters for DVD'', just like the film soundtrack's title. The DVD features include the ten fake endings as shown on the internet, a \"making of\" featurette, promos, the \"Deleted Scenes\" episode, a music video, and an eighty-minute animatic (rough cut) of the movie made out of the deleted scenes from the film and scenes from the \"Deleted Scenes\" episode as well as a commentary. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee [[Patti Smith]] is featured on the DVD commentary. The scene after the credits was removed from the UK DVD release.\n\nThe set also features the [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 4)|season four]] episode \"Deleted Scenes\" (also known as \"Star-Studded Xmas Spectacular\"), which makes heavy references and parallels to the film that originally aired years prior to the film's release on December 18, 2005.\n\nThe film is also available in [[HD video|HD]] and SD on the [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].<ref>[http://video.xbox.com/tv-episode/aqua-teen-hunger-force/season-0/aqua-teen-hunger-force-colon-movie-film-for-theatres/4e23e9e9-4cf9-4ee7-92bf-53812974ccf3 ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518100949/http://video.xbox.com/tv-episode/aqua-teen-hunger-force/season-0/aqua-teen-hunger-force-colon-movie-film-for-theatres/4e23e9e9-4cf9-4ee7-92bf-53812974ccf3 |date=May 18, 2015 }} at [[Xbox Live Marketplace]].</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was a box office success, making $5,520,368 domestically against its $750,000 budget.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aquateenhungerforce.htm|title=Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters (2007)|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=November 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120124610/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aquateenhungerforce.htm|archive-date=November 20, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Critical response===\nWith 28 reviews compiled, [[Metacritic]] reported that ''Movie Film for Theaters'' has received an average rating of 54/100, which it labeled \"mixed reviews\".<ref>[https://www.metacritic.com/movie/aqua-teen-hunger-force-colon-movie-film-for-theaters Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150805000954/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/aqua-teen-hunger-force-colon-movie-film-for-theaters |date=August 5, 2015 }} on [[Metacritic]]</ref> [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film an approval rating of 48% based on reviews from 85 critics, with an average rating of 5.1/10.
