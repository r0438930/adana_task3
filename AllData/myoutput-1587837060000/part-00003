Heavily influenced by [[The Doors]], My Bloody Valentine, [[Hawkwind]], [[Bruce Haack]], and [[Chrome (band)|Chrome]], Spindrift's early stages were experimental and differed greatly from their present sound though the band's musical style is ever in a period of flux.\n\nIn the summer of 2001, band members Kirpatrick Thomas, Joe Baluta and Zachary Hansen re-located to Los Angeles.

Tours with [[Dead Meadow]] (Kirpatrick Thomas filled in for an ailing Jason Simons on guitar during one tour), [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]], and [[The Dandy Warhols]] followed until November 2009 when the band suffered a major lineup change due to tour burnout and financial difficulties.\n\nIt was around this time that Spindrift began performing electro-acoustic shows with a more intimate, stripped down campfire atmosphere under the name of \"Bluniform\" and \"Boy Scout Jamboree\" with Koenig and Thomas taking the lead harmonies and performing tunes written by the likes of the \"singing cowboys\" such as [[Johnny Western]], [[Johnny Bond]], [[Tex Ritter]], [[The Louvin Brothers]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[The Sons of the Pioneers]],  and [[Rex Allen]]. Spindrift also began incorporating these songs into their regular set and on occasion, would play them live. This would prove to be a huge influence on their later years.\n\nIn December 2009, Henry Evans and Kirpatrick Thomas began reforming and rebuilding Spindrift while rehearsing and writing new songs in the [[Gram Parsons]] death room at Joshua Tree Inn. Added were Luke Dawson (who was innkeeper at the time) on pedal steel and rhythm guitar, Sasha Vallely on vocals, organ, and Native American flute, and James Acton on autoharp, vocals, and drums. This current lineup performed at SXSW 2010, Psych Fest III, supported [[Black Mountain (band)|Black Mountain]], and toured Europe for the first time with [[Black Rebel Motorcycle Club|B.R.M.C.]] in May 2010.

In 2009, Tee Pee Records re-released the soundtrack and the band toured the United States, opening for The Dandy Warhols who under their Beat The World record label released the Spindrift album \"The West\" Nov. 2008.\n\nSpindrift has also contributed to the VBS.tv VICE documentary series ''[[Coffin Joe]]'', and the songs \"Ace Coletrain\" and \"Girlz, Booze, Gunz\" were featured in the HBO Comedy series Eastbound & Down.\"  The band has also scored a restored version of \"Tecumseh's Curse\", a film about the [[Curse of Tippecanoe]] by director [[J.X. Williams]].\n\nIn 2010, Spindrift went on to supply the score to Mike Bruce's next feature \"Treasure of the Black Jaguar\", an action survival story loosely based on [[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)]].\n\nSpindrift has cited the Sergio Leone film [[Once Upon a Time in the West]] and Sam Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch\" as cinematic influences on the band's music and overall style.\n\nIn 2011, Spindrift supported the soundtrack of the award-winning skiing documentary film [[All.I.Can]] by Sherpa Cinema with three songs.\n\nThe film, ''Dust Up'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1991034/|title=Dust Up|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref> starring [[Amber Benson]] also contained a Spindrift score and was released Oct. 2012.\n\nIn Jan 2016, the band contributed to the score and soundtrack of the film \"Diablo\" which was Directed by Lawrence Roeck and starred Scott Eastwood, Danny Glover, and Walton Goggings. As well, early that year, Cherry Red Records released the 5 disc box set title \"Still In A Dream: A History of Shoegaze 1988-1995 which featured Spindrift's first B-Side Single (originally recorded in 1992 and released by Neck Records) called \"Surround Sound\".\n\n==''Classic Soundtracks''==\nIn Spring of 2011, Spindrift released ''Classic Soundtracks Volume 1'' on Xemu Records. The album featured 14 theme songs to various film scores they are set to and up to 8 different directors participated in the project. The film clips, music videos, and movie trailers were all premiered on [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] and featured films by [[Burke Roberts]], [[J. X. Williams]], [[Abigail Bean]], [[Simon Chan (director)|Simon Chan]], and many others. The music crossed genres such as [[Bollywood songs]], Science fiction, Exploitation films, and [[Film noir]]. The album was engineered by Ethan Allen (of [[Gram Rabbit]]) and mastered by [[Howie Weinberg]]. The band went on to tour Europe in the Spring of 2011 for 2 months supporting Black Mountain, Dead Meadow, and [[Kurt Vile]] and did a full U.S. and Canadian tour in the Fall with The Black Angels and Dead Meadow totaling over 100 live shows throughout the year.\n\n==''Spindrift - Ghost of the West'' and the Ghost Town Tour==\nIn 2012, production for the album ''Spindrift - Ghost of the West''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2580492/|title=Ghost of the West|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=2013-07-26}}</ref> began. The songs consisted of variations on early golden era [[singing cowboy]] tunes and originals. New styles and instrumentation were brought in such as Henry Evans playing acoustic upright bass, more trumpet, and the ever more present vocal harmonies. During the mixing with engineer Riley Bray, Kirpatrick brought forth the idea that the band should tour [[ghost town]]s, perform the songs, and document the journey. Booking, filming, and performing during the tour was a difficult process as many of the destinations were unreachable and roads and conditions were hazardous. However, the tour brought them to over twenty-one different ghost towns, including [[Bodie, California]], [[Tombstone, Arizona]], and [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], and it was all tracked and filmed. Many landmarks and monuments were also reached, such as [[Cathedral Gorge State Park]] and the [[Sonoran Desert]]. The soundtrack album was released October 22, 2013, on [[Tee Pee Records]] and the feature film companion, directed by [[Burke Roberts]], is set to follow in 2014. Directly following the Ghost Town Tour of October 2012, keyboardist-vocalist [[Michelle Vidal]] replaced Sasha Vallely due to her inability to tour from a recent back surgery. In 2013, the band toured the US with Joshua Tree desert pals [[Gram Rabbit]], toured Europe in the spring, and once again headlined a tour around the United States in the fall in promotion of the soundtrack which included supporting the punk band [[X (American band)|X]] in front of a crowd of 7,500 at Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles, California. Guitarist Thomas Bellier from Paris, France, joined the band officially in January 2014 after guesting on guitar during several tours and independent gigs. Bellier also fronts the heavy surf-middle eastern influenced band [[Blaak Heat (band)|Blaak Heat]] and is label-mates on Tee Pee Records. Spindrift performed and screened ''Spindrift - Ghost of the West'' at [[Slamdance Film Festival]] in Park City, Utah, in January 2014.\n\nIn 2015, even while the lineup lost longtime bass player Henry Evans, the band continued to tour and work on new recordings and soundtrack productions with older members including bass player Joe Baluta and drummer Daniel Allare rejoining the ranks. The band's Engineer, Riley Bray, briefly filled in for Mr. Evans taking over his famed signature custom made Danelectro double neck bass and baritone guitar. After Riley's second rehearsal, the double neck was stolen and a search went out to find the unique instrument. Remarkably, due to some detective work done by Riley and one specific fans relentless internet search, the instrument was recovered in a \"set up and recover\" operation which local authorities helped to set up the sting operation. Highlights from 2015 were performances at Austin's \"Levitation\" Psychedelic Rock Festival and \"Desert Stars\" festival in Yucca Valley, CA. One new member, the young, talented guitarist Becca Davidson also joined the band that year.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{External links|date=July 2013}}\n* [http://www.spindriftwest.com/ Official Website]\n* [http://larecord.com/issues/2007/07/05/vol-2-no-22-spindrift-and-langhorne-slim/ Cover Photo from The LA Record]\n* [http://larecord.com/interviews/2007/07/05/spindrift-just-once-in-the-nuts/ July 2007 Interview] with [[L.A.
