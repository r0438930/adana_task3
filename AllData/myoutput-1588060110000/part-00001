Spoken natively by an estimated 76 million people (as of 2009), it is the [[native language]] of the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese (Kinh) people]], as well as a [[first language|first]] or [[second language|second]] language for the many [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic minorities of Vietnam]]. As a result of [[overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese emigration]] and cultural influence, Vietnamese speakers are found throughout the world, notably in East and Southeast Asia, North America, Australia and Western Europe. Vietnamese has also been officially recognized as a minority language in the [[Czech Republic]].\n\nVietnamese is the Austroasiatic language with by far the most speakers, several times as many as the rest of the family combined.<ref>{{cite book|last=Driem|first=George van|authorlink=George van Driem|title=Handbuch Der Orientalistik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiavPYCz4dYC&pg=PA264|year=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12062-9|page=264|quote=Of the approximately 90 millions speakers of Austroasiatic languages, over 70 million speak Vietnamese, nearly ten million speak Khmer and roughly five million speak Santali.}}</ref> Its vocabulary has borrowings from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and it formerly used a modified set of [[Chinese characters]] called [[Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]], which were given vernacular pronunciation.

It is similar to Yue Yu (\u8d8a\u8bed) spoken by the [[Gin people|Gin]] in southern [[Guangxi|Guangxi Province]] in [[China]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China |given=Linda |surname=Tsung |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4411-4235-1 |page=188 }}</ref> However, the language spoken by the Gin is unintelligible to Vietnamese, although they share many similarities. A significant number of native speakers also reside in neighboring [[Vietnamese Cambodians|Cambodia]] and [[Vietnamese people in Laos|Laos]].\n\nIn the United States, Vietnamese is the fifth most spoken language, with over 1.5 million speakers, who are concentrated in a handful of states.

In countries with strongly established Vietnamese-speaking communities such as Australia, Canada, France, and the United States, Vietnamese language education largely serves as a cultural role to link descendants of Vietnamese immigrants to their ancestral culture. Meanwhile, in countries near Vietnam such as Cambodia, Laos, South Korea, and Thailand, the increased role of Vietnamese in foreign language education is largely due to the growth and influence of Vietnam's economy.<ref>[http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=7197&a=3 More Thai Students Interested in Learning ASEAN Languages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110064409/http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=7197&a=3 |date=2015-01-10 }}.

Some 30% to 60% of the lexical stock has naturalized word borrowings from Chinese, although many compound words are composed of native Vietnamese words combined with naturalized word borrowings (i.e. having Vietnamese pronunciation). {{citation needed|date=December 2011}} From the [[French assistance to Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh]] (1777) to the [[1954 Geneva Conference]] (1954), Vietnamese has been influenced by the 177 years of [[French language in Vietnam]], for example {{lang|vi|c\u00e0 ph\u00ea}} (from French {{lang|fr|caf\u00e9}}). Nowadays, many new words are being added to the language's lexicon due to heavy Western cultural influence; these are usually borrowed from English, for example ''TV'' (though usually seen in the written form as {{lang|vi|tivi}}). Sometimes these borrowings are [[calque]]s literally translated into Vietnamese (for example, ''software'' is calqued into {{lang|vi|ph\u1ea7n m\u1ec1m}}, which literally means \"soft part\").

In addition, in the diphthongs {{IPA|[\u0101j]}} and {{IPA|[\u0101\u02d0j]}} the letters ''y'' and ''i'' also indicate the pronunciation of the main vowel: ''ay'' = ''\u0103'' + {{IPA|/j/}}, ''ai'' = ''a'' + {{IPA|/j/}}. Thus, ''tay'' \"hand\" is {{IPA|[t\u0101j]}} while ''tai'' \"ear\" is {{IPA|[t\u0101\u02d0j]}}. Similarly, ''u'' and ''o'' indicate different pronunciations of the main vowel: ''au'' = ''\u0103'' + {{IPA|/w/}}, ''ao'' = ''a'' + {{IPA|/w/}}. Thus, ''thau'' \"brass\" is {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u0101w]}} while ''thao'' \"raw silk\" is {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u0101\u02d0w]}}.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonants that occur in Vietnamese are listed below in the [[Vietnamese orthography]] with the phonetic pronunciation to the right.\n\n:{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n!

See the [[#Language variation|language variation section]] for further elaboration.\n\nThe analysis of syllable-final orthographic ''ch'' and ''nh'' in Hanoi Vietnamese has had different analyses.

The other analysis has final ''ch'' and ''nh'' as predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after the upper front vowels ''i'' {{IPA|/i/}} and ''\u00ea'' {{IPA|/e/}}; although they also occur after ''a'', but in such cases are believed to have resulted from an earlier ''e'' {{IPA|/\u025b/}} which diphthongized to ''ai'' (cf.

However, Michel Ferlus and Nguy\u1ec5n T\u00e0i C\u1ea9n offer evidence for considering a North-Central region separate from Central. The term ''Haut-Annam'' refers to dialects spoken from northern Ngh\u1ec7 An Province to southern (former) Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Province that preserve archaic features (like consonant clusters and undiphthongized vowels) that have been lost in other modern dialects.\n\nThese dialect regions differ mostly in their sound systems (see below), but also in vocabulary (including basic vocabulary, non-basic vocabulary, and grammatical words) and grammar.<ref>Some differences in [[grammatical word]]s are noted in [[Vietnamese grammar#Demonstratives|Vietnamese grammar: Demonstratives]], [[Vietnamese grammar#Pronouns|Vietnamese grammar: Pronouns]].</ref> The North-central and Central regional varieties, which have a significant amount of vocabulary differences, are generally less [[mutually intelligible]] to Northern and Southern speakers. There is less internal variation within the Southern region than the other regions due to its relatively late settlement by Vietnamese speakers (around the end of the 15th century). The North-central region is particularly conservative; its pronunciation has diverged less from Vietnamese orthography than the other varieties, which tend to merge certain sounds. Along the coastal areas, regional variation has been neutralized to a certain extent, while more mountainous regions preserve more variation. As for [[sociolinguistic]] attitudes, the North-central varieties are often felt to be \"peculiar\" or \"difficult to understand\" by speakers of other dialects, despite the fact that their pronunciation fits the written language the most closely; this is typically because of various words in their vocabulary which are unfamiliar to other speakers (see the example vocabulary table below).\n{{Listen\n| header      = \n| type        = speech\n| filename    = Universal declaration of human rights VN.ogg\n| title       = The first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n| description = The first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights spoken by Nghiem Mai Phuong, native speaker of a northern variety.\n}}\n\nThe large movements of people between North and South beginning in the mid-20th century and continuing to this day have resulted in a sizeable number of Southern residents speaking in the Northern accent/dialect and, to a greater extent, Northern residents speaking in the Southern accent/dialect. Following the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords of 1954]] that called for the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|temporary division of the country]], about a million northerners (mainly from Hanoi, [[Haiphong]] and the surrounding Red River Delta areas) moved south (mainly to Saigon and heavily to [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] and [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]], and the surrounding areas) as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]]. About 3% (~30,000) of that number of people made the move in the reverse direction (''T\u1eadp k\u1ebft ra B\u1eafc'', literally \"go to the North\".)\n\nFollowing the [[Fall of Saigon|reunification of Vietnam]] in 1975, Northern and North-Central speakers from the densely populated Red River Delta and the traditionally poorer provinces of Ngh\u1ec7 An, H\u00e0 T\u0129nh and Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh have continued to move South to look for better economic opportunities, beginning with the new government's \"New Economic Zones program\" which lasted from 1975\u201385.<ref name=Desbarats>{{cite web|last=Desbarats|first=Jacqueline|title=Repression in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam: Executions and Population Relocation|url=http://jim.com/repression.htm|work=Indochina report; no. 11|publisher=Executive Publications, Singapore 1987|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref> The first half of the program (1975\u201380), resulted in 1.3 million people sent to the New Economic Zones (NEZs), majority of which were relocated in the southern half of the country in previously uninhabited areas, of which 550,000 were Northerners.<ref name=Desbarats /> The second half (1981\u201385) saw almost 1 million Northerners relocated to the NEZs.<ref name=Desbarats /> As well, government and military personnel, many from Northern and north-central Vietnam, are posted to various locations throughout the country, often away from their home regions. More recently, the growth of the free market system has resulted in business people and tourists traveling to distant parts of Vietnam. These movements have resulted in some small blending of the dialects, but more significantly, have made the Northern dialect more easily understood in the South and vice versa. Most Southerners, when singing modern/old popular Vietnamese songs or addressing the public, do so in the Northern accent if possible. This is true in Vietnam as well as in the overseas Vietnamese communities.\n\n===Vocabulary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ {{Anchor|Examples of regional variation in grammatical words}}Regional variation in vocabulary<ref>Table data from Ho\u00e0ng (1989).</ref>\n!

In some northern varieties, this numeral appears with an initial ''nh'' instead of ''l'': {{lang|vi|hai m\u01b0\u01a1i nh\u0103m}} \"twenty-five\", instead of mainstream {{lang|vi|hai m\u01b0\u01a1i l\u0103m}}.<ref>Gregerson (1981) notes that this variation was present in de Rhodes's time in some initial consonant clusters: ''ml\u1ebd'' ~ ''mnh\u1ebd'' \"reason\" (cf. modern Vietnamese ''l\u1ebd'' \"reason\").</ref>\n\nThere is also a merger of ''r'' and ''g'' in certain rural varieties in the South:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ ''r'', ''g'' variation\n!

''g''\n| {{IPA|[\u0263]}}\n|}\n\nThe consonant clusters that were originally present in Middle Vietnamese (of the 17th century) have been lost in almost all modern Vietnamese varieties (but retained in other closely related [[Vietic languages]]). However, some speech communities have preserved some of these archaic clusters: \"sky\" is {{lang|vi|bl\u1eddi}} with a cluster in H\u1ea3o Nho ([[Y\u00ean M\u00f4 District|Y\u00ean M\u00f4]], [[Ninh B\u00ecnh Province]]) but ''tr\u1eddi'' in Southern Vietnamese and {{lang|vi|gi\u1eddi}} in Hanoi Vietnamese (initial single consonants {{IPA|/\u0288/, /z/}}, respectively).\n\n===Tones===\nGenerally, the Northern varieties have six tones while those in other regions have five tones. The ''h\u1ecfi'' and ''ng\u00e3'' tones are distinct in North and some North-central varieties (although often with different [[pitch contour]]s) but have merged in Central, Southern, and some North-Central varieties (also with different pitch contours). Some North-Central varieties (such as {{lang|vi|H\u00e0 T\u0129nh}} Vietnamese) have a merger of the ''ng\u00e3'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones while keeping the ''h\u1ecfi'' tone distinct. Still, other North-Central varieties have a three-way merger of ''h\u1ecfi'', ''ng\u00e3'', and ''n\u1eb7ng'' resulting in a four-tone system. In addition, there are several phonetic differences (mostly in pitch contour and [[phonation]] type) in the tones among dialects.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Regional tone correspondences{{Anchor|Regional tone correspondences}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Tone\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Northern\n! colspan=\"3\" | North-central\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Central\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Southern\n|- style=\"font-size: small; line-height: 1.1em;\"\n!

Vietnamese does not use [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] marking of [[Grammatical case|case]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]] or [[grammatical tense|tense]] (and, as a result, has no [[finite verb|finite]]/[[Non-finite verb|nonfinite]] distinction).<ref>\nComparison note: As such its grammar relies on word order and sentence structure rather than morphology (in which word changes through [[inflection]]). Whereas European languages tend to use morphology to express tense, Vietnamese uses [[grammatical particles]] or syntactic constructions.</ref> Also like other languages in the region, Vietnamese syntax conforms to [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] [[word order]], is [[head-initial]] (displaying modified-[[Grammatical modifier|modifier]] ordering), and has a noun [[Classifier (linguistics)|classifier]] system. Additionally, it is [[pro-drop]], [[wh-in-situ]], and allows [[verb serialization]].\n\nSome Vietnamese sentences with English word [[Interlinear gloss|glosses]] and translations are provided below.\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|Minh l\u00e0 {gi\u00e1o vi\u00ean}\n|Minh BE teacher.\n|\"Min is a teacher.\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|Tr\u00ed 13 tu\u1ed5i\n|Tr\u00ed 13 age\n|\"Tr\u00ed is 13 years old,\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|T\u00e0i \u0111ang n\u00f3i.\n|T\u00e0i PRES.CONT talk\n|\"T\u00e0i is talking.\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|Mai {c\u00f3 v\u1ebb} l\u00e0 {sinh vi\u00ean} ho\u1eb7c {h\u1ecdc sinh}.\n|Mai seem BE {student (college)} or {student (under-college)}\n|\"Mai seems to be a college or high school student.\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|Gi\u00e1p r\u1ea5t cao.\n|Gi\u00e1p INT tall\n|\"Gi\u00e1p is very tall.\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u00f3 l\u00e0 anh c\u1ee7a n\u00f3.\n|person that.DET BE {older brother} POSS 3.PRO\n|\"That person is his/her brother.\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|Con ch\u00f3 n\u00e0y ch\u1eb3ng {bao gi\u1edd} s\u1ee7a c\u1ea3.\n|CL dog DET NEG ever bark all\n|\"This dog never barks at all.\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|N\u00f3 ch\u1ec9 \u0103n c\u01a1m {Vi\u1ec7t Nam} th\u00f4i.\n|3.PRO just eat rice.FAM Vietnam only\n|\"He/she/it only eats Vietnamese rice (or food, especially spoken by the elderly).\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|T\u00f4i th\u00edch con ng\u1ef1a \u0111en.\n|1.PRO like CL horse black\n|\"I like the black horse.\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|T\u00f4i th\u00edch c\u00e1i con ng\u1ef1a \u0111en \u0111\u00f3.\n|1.PRO like FOC CL horse black DET\n|\"I like that black horse.\"}}\n\n: {{interlinear|lang=vi\n|H\u00e3y {\u1edf l\u1ea1i} \u0111\u00e2y \u00edt ph\u00fat {cho t\u1edbi} khi t\u00f4i quay l\u1ea1i.\n|HORT stay here few minute until when 1.PRO turn come\n|\"Please stay here for a few minutes until I come back.\"}}\n\n==Dates and numbers writing formats==\nVietnameses speak date in the format \"[day] [month] [year]\".

Historically, the Vietnamese order was the same as Chinese, Korean and Japanese (YYYY/MM/DD), but it changed because of French influence in the 20th century.

An example is 1 629,15 (one thousand six hundred twenty-nine point fifteen).

Created in the 13th century or earlier, the ''N\u00f4m'' writing reached its zenith in the 18th century when many Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in N\u00f4m, most notably [[Nguy\u1ec5n Du]] and [[H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (dubbed \"the Queen of N\u00f4m poetry\").\nHowever it was only used for official purposes during the brief [[H\u1ed3 dynasty|H\u1ed3]] and [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty|T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] dynasties.\n\nA [[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Vietnamese Catholic]], [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng T\u1ed9]], sent petitions to the Court which suggested a Chinese character-based syllabary which would be used for Vietnamese sounds; however, his petition failed.

This [[Vietnamese alphabet]] (''ch\u1eef qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef'' or \"national script\") was gradually expanded from its initial domain in Christian writing to become more popular among the general public.\nHowever, the Romanized script did not come to predominate until the beginning of the 20th century, when education became widespread and a simpler writing system was found more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population.\nUnder [[French Indochina]] colonial rule, French superseded Chinese in administration.\nVietnamese written with the alphabet became required for all public documents in 1910 by issue of a decree by the French R\u00e9sident Sup\u00e9rieur of the protectorate of Tonkin. By the middle of the 20th century virtually all writing was done in ''ch\u1eef qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef'', which became the official script on independence. Ch\u1eef nho was still in use on early [[North Vietnam]]ese and late [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] banknotes issued after World War II,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://art-hanoi.com/collection/icpaper/p83.html |title=French Indochina 500 Piastres 1951 |website=art-hanoi.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://art-hanoi.com/collection/vnpaper/ho5d.html |title=North Vietnam 5 Dong 1946 |website=art-hanoi.com}}</ref> but fell out of official use shortly thereafter.\nOnly a few scholars and some extremely elderly people are able to read ''ch\u1eef N\u00f4m'' today. In China, members of the [[Gin people|Jing]] minority still write in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m.\n\nChanges in the script were made by French scholars and administrators and by conferences held after independence during 1954\u20131974. The script now reflects a so-called ''Middle Vietnamese'' dialect that has vowels and final consonants most similar to northern dialects and initial consonants most similar to southern dialects (Nguy\u1ec5n 1996). This Middle Vietnamese is presumably close to the Hanoi variety as spoken sometime after 1600 but before the present.  (This is not unlike how [[English orthography]] is based on the Chancery Standard of [[Middle English#Late Middle English|Late Middle English]], with many spellings retained even after the [[Great Vowel Shift]].)\n\n===Computer support===\n{{main|Vietnamese language and computers}}\n\nThe [[Unicode]] character set contains all Vietnamese characters and the Vietnamese currency symbol. On systems that do not support Unicode, many 8-bit Vietnamese [[code page]]s are available such as [[Vietnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (VSCII) or [[Windows-1258]]. Where [[ASCII]] must be used, Vietnamese letters are often typed using the [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable|VIQR]] convention, though this is largely unnecessary with the increasing ubiquity of Unicode. There are many software tools that help type true Vietnamese text on US keyboards, such as [http://winvnkey.sf.net WinVNKey] and [http://unikey.sf.net Unikey] on Windows, or [http://macvnkey.sf.net MacVNKey] on Macintosh.\n\n==History==\n\nIt seems likely that in the distant past, Vietnamese shared more characteristics common to other languages in the Austroasiatic family, such as an inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and a richer set of [[consonant cluster]]s, which have subsequently disappeared from the language. However, Vietnamese appears to have been heavily influenced by its location in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], with the result that it has acquired or converged toward characteristics such as isolating morphology and phonemically distinctive [[tonal language|tones]], through processes of [[tonogenesis]]. These characteristics have become part of many of the genetically unrelated languages of Southeast Asia; for example, [[Tsat language|Tsat]] (a member of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] group within [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]), and Vietnamese each developed tones as a phonemic feature. The ancestor of the Vietnamese language is usually believed to have been originally based in the area of the [[Red River Delta]] in what is now northern Vietnam.<ref name=\"Sagart 2008\">{{citation|last= Sagart|first = Laurent|title= Past human migrations in East Asia: matching archaeology, linguistics and genetics|chapter= The expansion of Setaria farmers in East Asia|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/3077307|year= 2008|pages= 141\u2013145}}</ref><ref name=\"Ferlus 2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Ferlus|first1=Michael|title=A Layer of Dongsonian Vocabulary in Vietnamese|journal=Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society|date=2009|volume=1|page=105|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00932218v3/document}}</ref>\n\nDistinctive tonal variations emerged during the subsequent expansion of the Vietnamese language and people into what is now central and southern Vietnam through conquest of the ancient nation of [[Champa]] and the [[Khmer people]] of the [[Mekong Delta]] in the vicinity of present-day [[Ho Chi Minh City]], also known as Saigon.\n\nVietnamese was primarily influenced by Chinese, which came to predominate politically in the 2nd century BC.  After Vietnam achieved independence in the 10th century, the ruling class adopted [[Classical Chinese]] as the medium of government, scholarship and literature.  With the dominance of Chinese came radical importation of Chinese vocabulary and grammatical influence.  A portion of the Vietnamese lexicon in all realms consists of [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese words]] (They comprise about a third of the Vietnamese lexicon, and may account for as much as 60% of the vocabulary used in formal texts.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=8}})\n\nWhen France invaded Vietnam in the late 19th century, French gradually replaced Chinese as the official language in education and government. Vietnamese adopted many French terms, such as ''\u0111\u1ea7m'' (dame, from ''madame''), ''ga'' (train station, from ''gare''), ''s\u01a1 mi'' (shirt, from ''chemise''), and ''b\u00fap b\u00ea'' (doll, from ''poup\u00e9e'').

Ferlus 1992<ref name=\"ferlus1992\"/> also had additional phonemes *{{IPA|/d\u0292/}} and *{{IPA|/\u0255/}}.\n\n{{note|fricative|2}} The fricatives indicated above in parentheses developed as allophones of stop consonants occurring between vowels (i.e. when a [[minor syllable]] occurred).  These fricatives were not present in Proto-Viet\u2013Muong, as indicated by their absence in Muong, but were evidently present in the later Proto-Vietnamese stage.  Subsequent loss of the minor-syllable prefixes phonemicized the fricatives.  Ferlus 1992<ref name=\"ferlus1992\"/> proposes that originally there were both voiced and voiceless fricatives, corresponding to original voiced or voiceless stops, but Ferlus 2009<ref name=\"ferlus2009\"/> appears to have abandoned that hypothesis, suggesting that stops were softened and voiced at approximately the same time, according to the following pattern:\n*{{IPA|*p, *b}} > {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}\n*{{IPA|*t, *d}} > {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}\n*{{IPA|*s}} > {{IPA|/r\u031d/}}\n*{{IPA|*c, *\u025f, *t\u0283}} > {{IPA|/\u029d/}}\n*{{IPA|*k, *\u0261}} > {{IPA|/\u0263/}}\n\n{{note|v|3}} In [[Middle Vietnamese]], the outcome of these sounds was written with a hooked ''b'' ([[File:B with flourish.svg|10px|alt=\u0238|b with flourish]]), representing a {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} that was still distinct from ''v'' (then pronounced {{IPA|/w/}}).  See below.\n\n{{note|sigma|4}} It is unclear what this sound was.  According to Ferlus 1992,<ref name=\"ferlus1992\"/> in the Archaic Vietnamese period (c. 10th century AD, when [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] was borrowed) it was *{{IPA|r\u031d}}, distinct at that time from *{{IPA|r}}.\n\nThe following initial clusters occurred, with outcomes indicated:\n* *pr, *br, *tr, *dr, *kr, *gr > {{IPA|/k\u02b0r/}} > {{IPA|/k\u0282/}} > ''s''\n* *pl, *bl > MV ''bl'' > Northern ''gi'', Southern ''tr''\n* *kl, *gl > MV ''tl'' > ''tr''\n* *ml > MV ''ml'' > ''mnh'' > ''nh''\n* *kj > ''gi''\n\nA large number of words were borrowed from [[Middle Chinese]], forming part of the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]].  These caused the original introduction of the retroflex sounds {{IPA|/\u0282/}} and {{IPA|/\u0288/}} (modern ''s'', ''tr'') into the language.\n\n===Origin of the tones===\n\nProto-Viet\u2013Muong had no tones to speak of.  The tones later developed in some of the daughter languages from distinctions in the initial and final consonants.  Vietnamese tones developed as follows:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! [[Register (phonology)|Register]]\n! Initial consonant\n! Smooth ending\n! Glottal ending\n! Fricative ending\n|-\n! High (first) register\n| Voiceless\n| A1 ''ngang'' \"level\"\n| B1 ''s\u1eafc'' \"sharp\"\n| C1 ''h\u1ecfi'' \"asking\"\n|-\n! Low (second) register\n| Voiced\n| A2 ''huy\u1ec1n'' \"deep\"\n| B2 ''n\u1eb7ng'' \"heavy\"\n| C2 ''ng\u00e3'' \"tumbling\"\n|}\n\nGlottal-ending syllables ended with a glottal stop {{IPA|/\u0294/}}, while fricative-ending syllables ended with {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/h/}}.  Both types of syllables could co-occur with a resonant (e.g. {{IPA|/m/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}).\n\nAt some point, a [[tone split]] occurred, as in many other [[Southeast Asian languages]].  Essentially, an [[allophonic]] distinction developed in the tones, whereby the tones in syllables with voiced initials were pronounced differently from those with voiceless initials. (Approximately speaking, the voiced [[allotone]]s were pronounced with additional [[breathy voice]] or [[creaky voice]] and with lowered pitch.  The quality difference predominates in today's northern varieties, e.g. in [[Hanoi]], while in the southern varieties the pitch difference predominates, as in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].) Subsequent to this, the plain-voiced stops became voiceless and the allotones became new phonemic tones.  Note that the implosive stops were unaffected, and in fact developed tonally as if they were unvoiced. (This behavior is common to all East Asian languages with implosive stops.)\n\nAs noted above, Proto-Viet\u2013Muong had [[sesquisyllabic]] words with an initial [[minor syllable]] (in addition to, and independent of, initial clusters in the main syllable).  When a minor syllable occurred, the main syllable's initial consonant was [[intervocalic]] and as a result suffered [[lenition]], becoming a voiced fricative.  The minor syllables were eventually lost, but not until the tone split had occurred.  As a result, words in modern Vietnamese with voiced fricatives occur in all six tones, and the tonal register reflects the voicing of the minor-syllable prefix and not the voicing of the main-syllable stop in Proto-Viet\u2013Muong that produced the fricative.  For similar reasons, words beginning with {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} occur in both registers. (Thompson 1976<ref name=\"thompson1976\"/> reconstructed voiceless resonants to account for outcomes where resonants occur with a first-register tone, but this is no longer considered necessary, at least by Ferlus.)\n\n===Middle Vietnamese===\nThe writing system used for Vietnamese is based closely on the system developed by [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] for his 1651 ''[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]''. It reflects the pronunciation of the Vietnamese of Hanoi at that time, a stage commonly termed ''Middle Vietnamese'' ({{lang|vi|ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t trung \u0111\u1ea1i}}).  The pronunciation of the \"rime\" of the syllable, i.e. all parts other than the initial consonant (optional {{IPA|/w/}} glide, vowel nucleus, tone and final consonant), appears nearly identical between Middle Vietnamese and modern Hanoi pronunciation.  On the other hand, the Middle Vietnamese pronunciation of the initial consonant differs greatly from all modern dialects, and in fact is significantly closer to the modern Saigon dialect than the modern Hanoi dialect.\n\nThe following diagram shows the orthography and pronunciation of Middle Vietnamese:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

This ''\u0115'', and the {{IPA|/j/}} it notated, have disappeared from the modern language.\n\nNote that ''b'' {{IPA|[\u0253]}} and ''p'' {{IPA|[p]}} never contrast in any position, suggesting that they are allophones.\n\nThe language also has three clusters at the beginning of syllables, which have since disappeared:\n\n*''tl'' {{IPA|/tl/}} > modern ''tr''\n*''bl'' {{IPA|/\u0253l/}} > modern ''gi'' (Northern), ''tr'' (Southern)\n*''ml'' {{IPA|/ml/}} > ''mnh'' {{IPA|/m\u0272/}} > modern ''nh''\n\nMost of the unusual correspondences between spelling and modern pronunciation are explained by Middle Vietnamese.  Note in particular:\n*de Rhodes' system has two different b letters, a regular b and a \"hooked\" b in which the upper section of the curved part of the b extends leftward past the vertical bar and curls down again in a semicircle.  This apparently represented a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}.  Within a century or so, both {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} had merged as {{IPA|/v/}}, spelled as ''v''.\n*de Rhodes' system has a second medial glide {{IPA|/j/}} that is written ''\u0115'' and appears in some words with initial ''d'' and hooked ''b''.  These later disappear.\n*''\u0111'' {{IPA|/\u0257/}} was (and still is) [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], whereas ''d'' {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} was dental.  The choice of symbols was based on the dental rather than alveolar nature of {{IPA|/d/}} and its [[allophone]] {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} in Spanish and other Romance languages.  The inconsistency with the symbols assigned to {{IPA|/\u0253/}} vs. {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} was based on the lack of any such place distinction between the two, with the result that the [[stop consonant]] {{IPA|/\u0253/}} appeared more \"normal\" than the fricative {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}.  In both cases, the [[implosive consonant|implosive]] nature of the stops does not appear to have had any role in the choice of symbol.\n*''x'' was the [[alveolo-palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0255/}} rather than the [[voiceless dental sibilant fricative|dental]] {{IPA|/s/}} of the modern language.  In 17th-century [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the common language of the Jesuits, ''s'' was the [[voiceless alveolar fricative|apico-alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|/s\u033a/}} (as still in much of Spain and some parts of Portugal), while ''x'' was a [[Palato-alveolar consonant|palatoalveolar]] {{IPA|/\u0283/}}.  The similarity of apicoalveolar {{IPA|/s\u033a/}} to the Vietnamese [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPA|/\u0282/}} led to the assignment of ''s'' and ''x'' as above.\n\n[[File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, breve acute apex.png|thumb|right|de Rhodes's entry for {{lang|vi|d\u0115\u00f3u\u1dc4}} shows distinct [[breve]]s, [[acute accent|acutes]] and [[apex (diacritic)|apices]].]]\nDe Rhodes's orthography also made use of an [[apex (diacritic)|apex]] diacritic to indicate a final [[labial-velar nasal]] {{IPA|/\u014b\u0361m/}}, an allophone of {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that is peculiar to the Hanoi dialect to the present day. This diacritic is often mistaken for a tilde in modern reproductions of early Vietnamese writing.\n\n==Word play==\nA [[language game]] known as ''[[n\u00f3i l\u00e1i]]'' is used by Vietnamese speakers.<ref>Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110.-H. (1997)</ref> ''N\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' involves switching the tones in a pair of words and also the order of the two words or the first consonant and [[Syllable rime|rime]] of each word; the resulting ''n\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' pair preserves the original sequence of tones. Some examples:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Original phrase !! !! Phrase after ''n\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' transformation !! Structural change\n|-\n| ''\u0111\u00e1i d\u1ea7m'' \"(child) pee \" || \u2192 || ''d\u1ea5m \u0111\u00e0i'' (literal translation \"vinegar stage\") || word order and tone switch\n|-\n| ''ch\u1eeda hoang'' \"pregnancy out of wedlock\" || \u2192 || ''ho\u1ea3ng ch\u01b0a'' \"scared yet?\" || word order and tone switch\n|-\n| ''b\u1ea7y t\u00f4i'' \"all the king's subjects\" || \u2192 || ''b\u1ed3i t\u00e2y'' \"French waiter\" || initial consonant, rime, and tone switch\n|-\n| ''b\u00ed m\u1eadt'' \"secrets\" || \u2192 || ''b\u1eadt m\u00ed'' \"revealing secrets\"|| initial consonant and rime switch\n|}\n\nThe resulting transformed phrase often has a different meaning but sometimes may just be a nonsensical word pair. ''N\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' can be used to obscure the original meaning and thus soften the discussion of a socially sensitive issue, as with ''d\u1ea5m \u0111\u00e0i'' and ''ho\u1ea3ng ch\u01b0a'' (above) or, when implied (and not overtly spoken), to deliver a hidden subtextual message, as with ''b\u1ed3i t\u00e2y''.<ref>Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110.-H. (1997: 29) gives the following context: \"... a collaborator under the French administration was presented with a congratulatory panel featuring the two Chinese characters ''qu\u1ea7n th\u1ea7n''. This Sino-Vietnamese expression could be defined as ''b\u1ea7y t\u00f4i'' meaning 'all the king's subjects'. But those two syllables, when undergoing commutation of rhyme and tone, would generate ''b\u1ed3i t\u00e2y'' meaning 'servant in a French household'.\"</ref> Naturally, ''n\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' can be used for a humorous effect.<ref>See [http://www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222075952/http://www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html |date=2008-02-22 }}, Language Log's [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001788.html itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001788.html], and [http://tphcm.blogspot.com/2005/01/ni-li.html tphcm.blogspot.com/2005/01/ni-li.html] for more examples.</ref>\n\nAnother word game somewhat reminiscent of [[pig latin]] is played by children.

As a result of [[overseas Vietnamese|Vietnamese emigration]] and cultural influence, Vietnamese speakers are found throughout the world, notably in East and Southeast Asia, North America, Australia and Western Europe. Vietnamese has also been officially recognized as a minority language in the [[Czech Republic]].\n\nVietnamese is the Austroasiatic language with by far the most speakers, several times as many as the rest of the family combined.<ref>{{cite book|last=Driem|first=George van|authorlink=George van Driem|title=Handbuch Der Orientalistik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiavPYCz4dYC&pg=PA264|year=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-12062-9|page=264|quote=Of the approximately 90 millions speakers of Austroasiatic languages, over 70 million speak Vietnamese, nearly ten million speak Khmer and roughly five million speak Santali.}}</ref> Its vocabulary has borrowings from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], and it formerly used a modified set of [[Chinese characters]] called [[Ch\u1eef N\u00f4m]], which were given vernacular pronunciation.

It is similar to Yue Yu (\u8d8a\u8bed) spoken by the [[Gin people|Gin]] in southern [[Guangxi|Guangxi Province]] in [[China]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Language Power and Hierarchy: Multilingual Education in China |given=Linda |surname=Tsung |publisher=Bloomsbury |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4411-4235-1 |page=188 }}</ref> However, the language spoken by the Gin is unintelligible to Vietnamese, although they share many similarities. A significant number of native speakers also reside in neighboring [[Vietnamese Cambodians|Cambodia]] and [[Vietnamese people in Laos|Laos]].\n\nIn the United States, Vietnamese is the fifth most spoken language, with over 1.5 million speakers, who are concentrated in a handful of states.

In countries with strongly established Vietnamese-speaking communities such as Australia, Canada, France, and the United States, Vietnamese language education largely serves as a cultural role to link descendants of Vietnamese immigrants to their ancestral culture. Meanwhile, in countries near Vietnam such as Cambodia, Laos, South Korea, and Thailand, the increased role of Vietnamese in foreign language education is largely due to the growth and influence of Vietnam's economy.<ref>[http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=7197&a=3 More Thai Students Interested in Learning ASEAN Languages] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110064409/http://thailand.prd.go.th/view_news.php?id=7197&a=3 |date=2015-01-10 }}.

Some 30% to 60% of the lexical stock has naturalized word borrowings from Chinese, although many compound words are composed of native Vietnamese words combined with naturalized word borrowings (i.e. having Vietnamese pronunciation). {{citation needed|date=December 2011}} From the [[French assistance to Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh]] (1777) to the [[1954 Geneva Conference]] (1954), Vietnamese has been influenced by the 177 years of [[French language in Vietnam]], for example {{lang|vi|c\u00e0 ph\u00ea}} (from French {{lang|fr|caf\u00e9}}). Nowadays, many new words are being added to the language's lexicon due to heavy Western cultural influence; these are usually borrowed from English, for example ''TV'' (though usually seen in the written form as {{lang|vi|tivi}}). Sometimes these borrowings are [[calque]]s literally translated into Vietnamese (for example, ''software'' is calqued into {{lang|vi|ph\u1ea7n m\u1ec1m}}, which literally means \"soft part\"). Some borrowings nowadays, usually names, are multi-syllabic, for example, {{lang|vi|Campuchia}} ([[Cambodia]]).\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main|Vietnamese phonology}}\n\n===Vowels===\nLike other Southeast Asian languages, Vietnamese has a comparatively large number of [[vowel]]s.\n\nBelow is a [[vowel diagram]] of Hanoi Vietnamese (including [[centering diphthong]]s):\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n!

The vowels ''\u00e2'' {{IPA|[\u0259]}} and ''\u0103'' {{IPA|[a]}} are pronounced very short, much shorter than the other vowels. Thus, ''\u01a1'' and ''\u00e2'' are basically pronounced the same except that ''\u01a1'' {{IPA|[\u0259\u02d0]}} is of normal length while ''\u00e2'' {{IPA|[\u0259]}} is short \u2013 the same applies to the vowels long ''a'' {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}} and short ''\u0103'' {{IPA|[a]}}.<ref>There are different descriptions of Hanoi vowels. Another common description is that of Thompson (1965):\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n! unrounded\n! rounded\n|-\n!

[[Open vowel|Open]]\n|\n| ''a'' {{IPA|[a]}}\n| colspan=\"2\" |\n|}\n\nThis description distinguishes four degrees of vowel height and a rounding contrast (rounded vs. unrounded) between back vowels. The relative shortness of ''\u0103'' and ''\u00e2'' would then be a secondary feature. Thompson describes the vowel ''\u0103'' {{IPA|[\u0250]}} as being slightly higher ([[Near-open vowel|upper low]]) than ''a'' {{IPA|[a]}}.</ref>\n\nThe centering diphthongs are formed with only the three high vowels (''i'', ''\u01b0'', ''u''). They are generally spelled as ''ia'', ''\u01b0a'', ''ua'' when they end a word and are spelled ''i\u00ea'', ''\u01b0\u01a1'', ''u\u00f4'', respectively, when they are followed by a consonant.\n\nIn addition to single vowels (or [[monophthong]]s) and centering diphthongs, Vietnamese has closing [[diphthong]]s<ref>In Vietnamese, diphthongs are ''\u00e2m \u0111\u00f4i''.</ref> and [[triphthong]]s. The closing diphthongs and triphthongs consist of a main vowel component followed by a shorter semivowel [[offglide]] {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}.<ref>The closing diphthongs and triphthongs as described by Thompson can be compared with the description above:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!&nbsp;\n! colspan=\"2\"| {{IPA|/w/}} offglide\n! colspan=\"2\"| {{IPA|/j/}} offglide\n|-\n!

For example, the offglide {{IPA|/j/}} is usually written as ''i''; however, it may also be represented with ''y''. In addition, in the diphthongs {{IPA|[\u0101j]}} and {{IPA|[\u0101\u02d0j]}} the letters ''y'' and ''i'' also indicate the pronunciation of the main vowel: ''ay'' = ''\u0103'' + {{IPA|/j/}}, ''ai'' = ''a'' + {{IPA|/j/}}. Thus, ''tay'' \"hand\" is {{IPA|[t\u0101j]}} while ''tai'' \"ear\" is {{IPA|[t\u0101\u02d0j]}}. Similarly, ''u'' and ''o'' indicate different pronunciations of the main vowel: ''au'' = ''\u0103'' + {{IPA|/w/}}, ''ao'' = ''a'' + {{IPA|/w/}}. Thus, ''thau'' \"brass\" is {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u0101w]}} while ''thao'' \"raw silk\" is {{IPA|[t\u02b0\u0101\u02d0w]}}.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe consonants that occur in Vietnamese are listed below in the [[Vietnamese orthography]] with the phonetic pronunciation to the right.\n\n:{| class=wikitable style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=2|\n!

See the [[#Language variation|language variation section]] for further elaboration.\n\nThe analysis of syllable-final orthographic ''ch'' and ''nh'' in Hanoi Vietnamese has had different analyses. One analysis has final ''ch'', ''nh'' as being phonemes {{IPA|/c/, /\u0272/}} contrasting with syllable-final ''t'', ''c'' {{IPA|/t/, /k/}} and ''n'', ''ng'' {{IPA|/n/, /\u014b/}} and identifies final ''ch'' with the syllable-initial ''ch'' {{IPA|/c/}}. The other analysis has final ''ch'' and ''nh'' as predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after the upper front vowels ''i'' {{IPA|/i/}} and ''\u00ea'' {{IPA|/e/}}; although they also occur after ''a'', but in such cases are believed to have resulted from an earlier ''e'' {{IPA|/\u025b/}} which diphthongized to ''ai'' (cf. ''ach'' from ''aic'', ''anh'' from ''aing'').

However, Michel Ferlus and Nguy\u1ec5n T\u00e0i C\u1ea9n offer evidence for considering a North-Central region separate from Central. The term ''Haut-Annam'' refers to dialects spoken from northern Ngh\u1ec7 An Province to southern (former) Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean Province that preserve archaic features (like consonant clusters and undiphthongized vowels) that have been lost in other modern dialects.\n\nThese dialect regions differ mostly in their sound systems (see below), but also in vocabulary (including basic vocabulary, non-basic vocabulary, and grammatical words) and grammar.<ref>Some differences in [[grammatical word]]s are noted in [[Vietnamese grammar#Demonstratives|Vietnamese grammar: Demonstratives]], [[Vietnamese grammar#Pronouns|Vietnamese grammar: Pronouns]].</ref> The North-central and Central regional varieties, which have a significant amount of vocabulary differences, are generally less [[mutually intelligible]] to Northern and Southern speakers. There is less internal variation within the Southern region than the other regions due to its relatively late settlement by Vietnamese speakers (around the end of the 15th century). The North-central region is particularly conservative; its pronunciation has diverged less from Vietnamese orthography than the other varieties, which tend to merge certain sounds. Along the coastal areas, regional variation has been neutralized to a certain extent, while more mountainous regions preserve more variation. As for [[sociolinguistic]] attitudes, the North-central varieties are often felt to be \"peculiar\" or \"difficult to understand\" by speakers of other dialects, despite the fact that their pronunciation fits the written language the most closely; this is typically because of various words in their vocabulary which are unfamiliar to other speakers (see the example vocabulary table below).\n{{Listen\n| header      = \n| type        = speech\n| filename    = Universal declaration of human rights VN.ogg\n| title       = The first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n| description = The first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights spoken by Nghiem Mai Phuong, native speaker of a northern variety.\n}}\n\nThe large movements of people between North and South beginning in the mid-20th century and continuing to this day have resulted in a sizeable number of Southern residents speaking in the Northern accent/dialect and, to a greater extent, Northern residents speaking in the Southern accent/dialect. Following the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords of 1954]] that called for the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|temporary division of the country]], about a million northerners (mainly from Hanoi, [[Haiphong]] and the surrounding Red River Delta areas) moved south (mainly to Saigon and heavily to [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] and [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u]], and the surrounding areas) as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]]. About 3% (~30,000) of that number of people made the move in the reverse direction (''T\u1eadp k\u1ebft ra B\u1eafc'', literally \"go to the North\".)\n\nFollowing the [[Fall of Saigon|reunification of Vietnam]] in 1975, Northern and North-Central speakers from the densely populated Red River Delta and the traditionally poorer provinces of Ngh\u1ec7 An, H\u00e0 T\u0129nh and Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh have continued to move South to look for better economic opportunities, beginning with the new government's \"New Economic Zones program\" which lasted from 1975\u201385.<ref name=Desbarats>{{cite web|last=Desbarats|first=Jacqueline|title=Repression in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam: Executions and Population Relocation|url=http://jim.com/repression.htm|work=Indochina report; no. 11|publisher=Executive Publications, Singapore 1987|accessdate=28 November 2013}}</ref> The first half of the program (1975\u201380), resulted in 1.3 million people sent to the New Economic Zones (NEZs), majority of which were relocated in the southern half of the country in previously uninhabited areas, of which 550,000 were Northerners.<ref name=Desbarats /> The second half (1981\u201385) saw almost 1 million Northerners relocated to the NEZs.<ref name=Desbarats /> As well, government and military personnel, many from Northern and north-central Vietnam, are posted to various locations throughout the country, often away from their home regions. More recently, the growth of the free market system has resulted in business people and tourists traveling to distant parts of Vietnam. These movements have resulted in some small blending of the dialects, but more significantly, have made the Northern dialect more easily understood in the South and vice versa. Most Southerners, when singing modern/old popular Vietnamese songs or addressing the public, do so in the Northern accent if possible. This is true in Vietnam as well as in the overseas Vietnamese communities.\n\n===Vocabulary===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ {{Anchor|Examples of regional variation in grammatical words}}Regional variation in vocabulary<ref>Table data from Ho\u00e0ng (1989).</ref>\n!

''l''\n| {{IPA|[l]}}\n|}\n\nVariation between ''l'' and ''n'' can be found even in mainstream Vietnamese in certain words. For example, the numeral \"five\" appears as ''n\u0103m'' by itself and in compound numerals like ''n\u0103m m\u01b0\u01a1i'' \"fifty\" but appears as {{lang|vi|l\u0103m}} in {{lang|vi|m\u01b0\u1eddi l\u0103m}} \"fifteen\" (see [[Vietnamese grammar#Cardinal]]). In some northern varieties, this numeral appears with an initial ''nh'' instead of ''l'': {{lang|vi|hai m\u01b0\u01a1i nh\u0103m}} \"twenty-five\", instead of mainstream {{lang|vi|hai m\u01b0\u01a1i l\u0103m}}.<ref>Gregerson (1981) notes that this variation was present in de Rhodes's time in some initial consonant clusters: ''ml\u1ebd'' ~ ''mnh\u1ebd'' \"reason\" (cf. modern Vietnamese ''l\u1ebd'' \"reason\").</ref>\n\nThere is also a merger of ''r'' and ''g'' in certain rural varieties in the South:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ ''r'', ''g'' variation\n!

However, some speech communities have preserved some of these archaic clusters: \"sky\" is {{lang|vi|bl\u1eddi}} with a cluster in H\u1ea3o Nho ([[Y\u00ean M\u00f4 District|Y\u00ean M\u00f4]], [[Ninh B\u00ecnh Province]]) but ''tr\u1eddi'' in Southern Vietnamese and {{lang|vi|gi\u1eddi}} in Hanoi Vietnamese (initial single consonants {{IPA|/\u0288/, /z/}}, respectively).\n\n===Tones===\nGenerally, the Northern varieties have six tones while those in other regions have five tones. The ''h\u1ecfi'' and ''ng\u00e3'' tones are distinct in North and some North-central varieties (although often with different [[pitch contour]]s) but have merged in Central, Southern, and some North-Central varieties (also with different pitch contours). Some North-Central varieties (such as {{lang|vi|H\u00e0 T\u0129nh}} Vietnamese) have a merger of the ''ng\u00e3'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones while keeping the ''h\u1ecfi'' tone distinct. Still, other North-Central varieties have a three-way merger of ''h\u1ecfi'', ''ng\u00e3'', and ''n\u1eb7ng'' resulting in a four-tone system. In addition, there are several phonetic differences (mostly in pitch contour and [[phonation]] type) in the tones among dialects.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Regional tone correspondences{{Anchor|Regional tone correspondences}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Tone\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Northern\n! colspan=\"3\" | North-central\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Central\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Southern\n|- style=\"font-size: small; line-height: 1.1em;\"\n!

An example is 1 629,15 (one thousand six hundred twenty-nine point fifteen).

Created in the 13th century or earlier, the ''N\u00f4m'' writing reached its zenith in the 18th century when many Vietnamese writers and poets composed their works in N\u00f4m, most notably [[Nguy\u1ec5n Du]] and [[H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (dubbed \"the Queen of N\u00f4m poetry\").\nHowever it was only used for official purposes during the brief [[H\u1ed3 dynasty|H\u1ed3]] and [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n dynasty|T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] dynasties.\n\nA [[Catholic Church in Vietnam|Vietnamese Catholic]], [[Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u01b0\u1eddng T\u1ed9]], sent petitions to the Court which suggested a Chinese character-based syllabary which would be used for Vietnamese sounds; however, his petition failed.

This [[Vietnamese alphabet]] (''ch\u1eef qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef'' or \"national script\") was gradually expanded from its initial domain in Christian writing to become more popular among the general public.\nHowever, the Romanized script did not come to predominate until the beginning of the 20th century, when education became widespread and a simpler writing system was found more expedient for teaching and communication with the general population.\nUnder [[French Indochina]] colonial rule, French superseded Chinese in administration.\nVietnamese written with the alphabet became required for all public documents in 1910 by issue of a decree by the French R\u00e9sident Sup\u00e9rieur of the protectorate of Tonkin. By the middle of the 20th century virtually all writing was done in ''ch\u1eef qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef'', which became the official script on independence. Ch\u1eef nho was still in use on early [[North Vietnam]]ese and late [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] banknotes issued after World War II,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://art-hanoi.com/collection/icpaper/p83.html |title=French Indochina 500 Piastres 1951 |website=art-hanoi.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://art-hanoi.com/collection/vnpaper/ho5d.html |title=North Vietnam 5 Dong 1946 |website=art-hanoi.com}}</ref> but fell out of official use shortly thereafter.\nOnly a few scholars and some extremely elderly people are able to read ''ch\u1eef N\u00f4m'' today. In China, members of the [[Gin people|Jing]] minority still write in ch\u1eef N\u00f4m.\n\nChanges in the script were made by French scholars and administrators and by conferences held after independence during 1954\u20131974. The script now reflects a so-called ''Middle Vietnamese'' dialect that has vowels and final consonants most similar to northern dialects and initial consonants most similar to southern dialects (Nguy\u1ec5n 1996). This Middle Vietnamese is presumably close to the Hanoi variety as spoken sometime after 1600 but before the present.  (This is not unlike how [[English orthography]] is based on the Chancery Standard of [[Middle English#Late Middle English|Late Middle English]], with many spellings retained even after the [[Great Vowel Shift]].)\n\n===Computer support===\n{{main|Vietnamese language and computers}}\n\nThe [[Unicode]] character set contains all Vietnamese characters and the Vietnamese currency symbol. On systems that do not support Unicode, many 8-bit Vietnamese [[code page]]s are available such as [[Vietnamese Standard Code for Information Interchange]] (VSCII) or [[Windows-1258]]. Where [[ASCII]] must be used, Vietnamese letters are often typed using the [[Vietnamese Quoted-Readable|VIQR]] convention, though this is largely unnecessary with the increasing ubiquity of Unicode. There are many software tools that help type true Vietnamese text on US keyboards, such as [http://winvnkey.sf.net WinVNKey] and [http://unikey.sf.net Unikey] on Windows, or [http://macvnkey.sf.net MacVNKey] on Macintosh.\n\n==History==\n\nIt seems likely that in the distant past, Vietnamese shared more characteristics common to other languages in the Austroasiatic family, such as an inflectional [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and a richer set of [[consonant cluster]]s, which have subsequently disappeared from the language. However, Vietnamese appears to have been heavily influenced by its location in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area]], with the result that it has acquired or converged toward characteristics such as isolating morphology and phonemically distinctive [[tonal language|tones]], through processes of [[tonogenesis]]. These characteristics have become part of many of the genetically unrelated languages of Southeast Asia; for example, [[Tsat language|Tsat]] (a member of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] group within [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]]), and Vietnamese each developed tones as a phonemic feature. The ancestor of the Vietnamese language is usually believed to have been originally based in the area of the [[Red River Delta]] in what is now northern Vietnam.<ref name=\"Sagart 2008\">{{citation|last= Sagart|first = Laurent|title= Past human migrations in East Asia: matching archaeology, linguistics and genetics|chapter= The expansion of Setaria farmers in East Asia|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/3077307|year= 2008|page= 141-145}}</ref><ref name=\"Ferlus 2009\">{{cite journal|last1=Ferlus|first1=Michael|title=A Layer of Dongsonian Vocabulary in Vietnamese|journal=Journal of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society|date=2009|volume=1|page=105|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00932218v3/document}}</ref> \n\nDistinctive tonal variations emerged during the subsequent expansion of the Vietnamese language and people into what is now central and southern Vietnam through conquest of the ancient nation of [[Champa]] and the [[Khmer people]] of the [[Mekong Delta]] in the vicinity of present-day [[Ho Chi Minh City]], also known as Saigon.\n\nVietnamese was primarily influenced by Chinese, which came to predominate politically in the 2nd century BC.  After Vietnam achieved independence in the 10th century, the ruling class adopted [[Classical Chinese]] as the medium of government, scholarship and literature.  With the dominance of Chinese came radical importation of Chinese vocabulary and grammatical influence.  A portion of the Vietnamese lexicon in all realms consists of [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese words]] (They comprise about a third of the Vietnamese lexicon, and may account for as much as 60% of the vocabulary used in formal texts.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1977|p=8}})\n\nWhen France invaded Vietnam in the late 19th century, French gradually replaced Chinese as the official language in education and government. Vietnamese adopted many French terms, such as ''\u0111\u1ea7m'' (dame, from ''madame''), ''ga'' (train station, from ''gare''), ''s\u01a1 mi'' (shirt, from ''chemise''), and ''b\u00fap b\u00ea'' (doll, from ''poup\u00e9e'').

Ferlus 1992<ref name=\"ferlus1992\"/> also had additional phonemes *{{IPA|/d\u0292/}} and *{{IPA|/\u0255/}}.\n\n{{note|fricative|2}} The fricatives indicated above in parentheses developed as allophones of stop consonants occurring between vowels (i.e. when a [[minor syllable]] occurred).  These fricatives were not present in Proto-Viet\u2013Muong, as indicated by their absence in Muong, but were evidently present in the later Proto-Vietnamese stage.  Subsequent loss of the minor-syllable prefixes phonemicized the fricatives.  Ferlus 1992<ref name=\"ferlus1992\"/> proposes that originally there were both voiced and voiceless fricatives, corresponding to original voiced or voiceless stops, but Ferlus 2009<ref name=\"ferlus2009\"/> appears to have abandoned that hypothesis, suggesting that stops were softened and voiced at approximately the same time, according to the following pattern:\n*{{IPA|*p, *b}} > {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}\n*{{IPA|*t, *d}} > {{IPA|/\u00f0/}}\n*{{IPA|*s}} > {{IPA|/r\u031d/}}\n*{{IPA|*c, *\u025f, *t\u0283}} > {{IPA|/\u029d/}}\n*{{IPA|*k, *\u0261}} > {{IPA|/\u0263/}}\n\n{{note|v|3}} In [[Middle Vietnamese]], the outcome of these sounds was written with a hooked ''b'' ([[File:B with flourish.svg|10px|alt=\u0238|b with flourish]]), representing a {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} that was still distinct from ''v'' (then pronounced {{IPA|/w/}}).  See below.\n\n{{note|sigma|4}} It is unclear what this sound was.  According to Ferlus 1992,<ref name=\"ferlus1992\"/> in the Archaic Vietnamese period (c. 10th century AD, when [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]] was borrowed) it was *{{IPA|r\u031d}}, distinct at that time from *{{IPA|r}}.\n\nThe following initial clusters occurred, with outcomes indicated:\n* *pr, *br, *tr, *dr, *kr, *gr > {{IPA|/k\u02b0r/}} > {{IPA|/k\u0282/}} > ''s''\n* *pl, *bl > MV ''bl'' > Northern ''gi'', Southern ''tr''\n* *kl, *gl > MV ''tl'' > ''tr''\n* *ml > MV ''ml'' > ''mnh'' > ''nh''\n* *kj > ''gi''\n\nA large number of words were borrowed from [[Middle Chinese]], forming part of the [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]].  These caused the original introduction of the retroflex sounds {{IPA|/\u0282/}} and {{IPA|/\u0288/}} (modern ''s'', ''tr'') into the language.\n\n===Origin of the tones===\n\nProto-Viet\u2013Muong had no tones to speak of.  The tones later developed in some of the daughter languages from distinctions in the initial and final consonants.  Vietnamese tones developed as follows:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! [[Register (phonology)|Register]]\n! Initial consonant\n! Smooth ending\n! Glottal ending\n! Fricative ending\n|-\n! High (first) register\n| Voiceless\n| A1 ''ngang'' \"level\"\n| B1 ''s\u1eafc'' \"sharp\"\n| C1 ''h\u1ecfi'' \"asking\"\n|-\n! Low (second) register\n| Voiced\n| A2 ''huy\u1ec1n'' \"deep\"\n| B2 ''n\u1eb7ng'' \"heavy\"\n| C2 ''ng\u00e3'' \"tumbling\"\n|}\n\nGlottal-ending syllables ended with a glottal stop {{IPA|/\u0294/}}, while fricative-ending syllables ended with {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/h/}}.  Both types of syllables could co-occur with a resonant (e.g. {{IPA|/m/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}).\n\nAt some point, a [[tone split]] occurred, as in many other [[Southeast Asian languages]].  Essentially, an [[allophonic]] distinction developed in the tones, whereby the tones in syllables with voiced initials were pronounced differently from those with voiceless initials. (Approximately speaking, the voiced [[allotone]]s were pronounced with additional [[breathy voice]] or [[creaky voice]] and with lowered pitch.  The quality difference predominates in today's northern varieties, e.g. in [[Hanoi]], while in the southern varieties the pitch difference predominates, as in [[Ho Chi Minh City]].) Subsequent to this, the plain-voiced stops became voiceless and the allotones became new phonemic tones.  Note that the implosive stops were unaffected, and in fact developed tonally as if they were unvoiced. (This behavior is common to all East Asian languages with implosive stops.)\n\nAs noted above, Proto-Viet\u2013Muong had [[sesquisyllabic]] words with an initial [[minor syllable]] (in addition to, and independent of, initial clusters in the main syllable).  When a minor syllable occurred, the main syllable's initial consonant was [[intervocalic]] and as a result suffered [[lenition]], becoming a voiced fricative.  The minor syllables were eventually lost, but not until the tone split had occurred.  As a result, words in modern Vietnamese with voiced fricatives occur in all six tones, and the tonal register reflects the voicing of the minor-syllable prefix and not the voicing of the main-syllable stop in Proto-Viet\u2013Muong that produced the fricative.  For similar reasons, words beginning with {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} occur in both registers. (Thompson 1976<ref name=\"thompson1976\"/> reconstructed voiceless resonants to account for outcomes where resonants occur with a first-register tone, but this is no longer considered necessary, at least by Ferlus.)\n\n===Middle Vietnamese===\nThe writing system used for Vietnamese is based closely on the system developed by [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] for his 1651 ''[[Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum]]''. It reflects the pronunciation of the Vietnamese of Hanoi at that time, a stage commonly termed ''Middle Vietnamese'' ({{lang|vi|ti\u1ebfng Vi\u1ec7t trung \u0111\u1ea1i}}).  The pronunciation of the \"rime\" of the syllable, i.e. all parts other than the initial consonant (optional {{IPA|/w/}} glide, vowel nucleus, tone and final consonant), appears nearly identical between Middle Vietnamese and modern Hanoi pronunciation.  On the other hand, the Middle Vietnamese pronunciation of the initial consonant differs greatly from all modern dialects, and in fact is significantly closer to the modern Saigon dialect than the modern Hanoi dialect.\n\nThe following diagram shows the orthography and pronunciation of Middle Vietnamese:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |\n!

It has a rounded hook that starts halfway up the left side (where the top of the curved part of the b meets the vertical, straight part) and curves about 180 degrees counterclockwise, ending below the bottom-left corner.<br />\n{{note|yod|3}} {{IPA|[j]}} does not occur at the beginning of a syllable, but can occur at the end of a syllable, where it is notated ''i'' or ''y'' (with the difference between the two often indicating differences in the quality or length of the preceding vowel), and after {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} and {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}, where it is notated ''\u0115''.  This ''\u0115'', and the {{IPA|/j/}} it notated, have disappeared from the modern language.\n\nNote that ''b'' {{IPA|[\u0253]}} and ''p'' {{IPA|[p]}} never contrast in any position, suggesting that they are allophones.\n\nThe language also has three clusters at the beginning of syllables, which have since disappeared:\n\n*''tl'' {{IPA|/tl/}} > modern ''tr''\n*''bl'' {{IPA|/\u0253l/}} > modern ''gi'' (Northern), ''tr'' (Southern)\n*''ml'' {{IPA|/ml/}} > ''mnh'' {{IPA|/m\u0272/}} > modern ''nh''\n\nMost of the unusual correspondences between spelling and modern pronunciation are explained by Middle Vietnamese.  Note in particular:\n*de Rhodes' system has two different b letters, a regular b and a \"hooked\" b in which the upper section of the curved part of the b extends leftward past the vertical bar and curls down again in a semicircle.  This apparently represented a [[voiced bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}.  Within a century or so, both {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} and {{IPA|/w/}} had merged as {{IPA|/v/}}, spelled as ''v''.\n*de Rhodes' system has a second medial glide {{IPA|/j/}} that is written ''\u0115'' and appears in some words with initial ''d'' and hooked ''b''.  These later disappear.\n*''\u0111'' {{IPA|/\u0257/}} was (and still is) [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], whereas ''d'' {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} was dental.  The choice of symbols was based on the dental rather than alveolar nature of {{IPA|/d/}} and its [[allophone]] {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} in Spanish and other Romance languages.  The inconsistency with the symbols assigned to {{IPA|/\u0253/}} vs. {{IPA|/\u03b2/}} was based on the lack of any such place distinction between the two, with the result that the [[stop consonant]] {{IPA|/\u0253/}} appeared more \"normal\" than the fricative {{IPA|/\u03b2/}}.  In both cases, the [[implosive consonant|implosive]] nature of the stops does not appear to have had any role in the choice of symbol.\n*''x'' was the [[alveolo-palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0255/}} rather than the [[voiceless dental sibilant fricative|dental]] {{IPA|/s/}} of the modern language.  In 17th-century [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the common language of the Jesuits, ''s'' was the [[voiceless alveolar fricative|apico-alveolar sibilant]] {{IPA|/s\u033a/}} (as still in much of Spain and some parts of Portugal), while ''x'' was a [[Palato-alveolar consonant|palatoalveolar]] {{IPA|/\u0283/}}.  The similarity of apicoalveolar {{IPA|/s\u033a/}} to the Vietnamese [[retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPA|/\u0282/}} led to the assignment of ''s'' and ''x'' as above.\n\n[[File:Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum, breve acute apex.png|thumb|right|de Rhodes's entry for {{lang|vi|d\u0115\u00f3u\u1dc4}} shows distinct [[breve]]s, [[acute accent|acutes]] and [[apex (diacritic)|apices]].]]\nDe Rhodes's orthography also made use of an [[apex (diacritic)|apex]] diacritic to indicate a final [[labial-velar nasal]] {{IPA|/\u014b\u0361m/}}, an allophone of {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that is peculiar to the Hanoi dialect to the present day. This diacritic is often mistaken for a tilde in modern reproductions of early Vietnamese writing.\n\n==Word play==\nA [[language game]] known as ''[[n\u00f3i l\u00e1i]]'' is used by Vietnamese speakers.<ref>Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110.-H. (1997)</ref> ''N\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' involves switching the tones in a pair of words and also the order of the two words or the first consonant and [[Syllable rime|rime]] of each word; the resulting ''n\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' pair preserves the original sequence of tones. Some examples:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Original phrase !! !! Phrase after ''n\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' transformation !! Structural change\n|-\n| ''\u0111\u00e1i d\u1ea7m'' \"(child) pee \" || \u2192 || ''d\u1ea5m \u0111\u00e0i'' (literal translation \"vinegar stage\") || word order and tone switch\n|-\n| ''ch\u1eeda hoang'' \"pregnancy out of wedlock\" || \u2192 || ''ho\u1ea3ng ch\u01b0a'' \"scared yet?\" || word order and tone switch\n|-\n| ''b\u1ea7y t\u00f4i'' \"all the king's subjects\" || \u2192 || ''b\u1ed3i t\u00e2y'' \"French waiter\" || initial consonant, rime, and tone switch\n|-\n| ''b\u00ed m\u1eadt'' \"secrets\" || \u2192 || ''b\u1eadt m\u00ed'' \"revealing secrets\"|| initial consonant and rime switch\n|}\n\nThe resulting transformed phrase often has a different meaning but sometimes may just be a nonsensical word pair. ''N\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' can be used to obscure the original meaning and thus soften the discussion of a socially sensitive issue, as with ''d\u1ea5m \u0111\u00e0i'' and ''ho\u1ea3ng ch\u01b0a'' (above) or, when implied (and not overtly spoken), to deliver a hidden subtextual message, as with ''b\u1ed3i t\u00e2y''.<ref>Nguy\u1ec5n \u0110.-H. (1997: 29) gives the following context: \"... a collaborator under the French administration was presented with a congratulatory panel featuring the two Chinese characters ''qu\u1ea7n th\u1ea7n''. This Sino-Vietnamese expression could be defined as ''b\u1ea7y t\u00f4i'' meaning 'all the king's subjects'. But those two syllables, when undergoing commutation of rhyme and tone, would generate ''b\u1ed3i t\u00e2y'' meaning 'servant in a French household'.\"</ref> Naturally, ''n\u00f3i l\u00e1i'' can be used for a humorous effect.<ref>See [http://www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222075952/http://www.users.bigpond.com/doanviettrung/noilai.html |date=2008-02-22 }}, Language Log's [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001788.html itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001788.html], and [http://tphcm.blogspot.com/2005/01/ni-li.html tphcm.blogspot.com/2005/01/ni-li.html] for more examples.</ref>\n\nAnother word game somewhat reminiscent of [[pig latin]] is played by children. Here a nonsense syllable (chosen by the child) is prefixed onto a target word's syllables, then their initial consonants and rimes are switched with the tone of the original word remaining on the new switched rime.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Nonsense syllable !! Target word !! !! Intermediate form with prefixed syllable !! !! Resulting \"secret\" word\n|-\n| ''la'' || ''ph\u1edf'' \"beef or chicken noodle soup\" || \u2192 || ''la ph\u1edf'' || \u2192 || ''l\u01a1 ph\u1ea3''\n|-\n| ''la'' || ''\u0103n'' \"to eat\" || \u2192 || ''la \u0103n'' || \u2192 || ''l\u0103n a''\n|-\n| ''la'' || ''ho\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh'' \"situation\" || \u2192 || ''la ho\u00e0n la c\u1ea3nh'' || \u2192 || ''loan h\u00e0 lanh c\u1ea3''\n|-\n| ''chim'' || ''ho\u00e0n c\u1ea3nh'' \"situation\" || \u2192 || ''chim ho\u00e0n chim c\u1ea3nh'' || \u2192 || ''choan h\u00ecm chanh k\u1ec9m''\n|}\n\nThis language game is often used as a \"secret\" or \"coded\" language useful for obscuring messages from adult comprehension.\n\n==Examples==\n''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'' is an epic narrative poem by the celebrated poet [[Nguy\u1ec5n Du]], ({{vi-nom|[[wikt:\u962e\u6538|\u962e\u6538]]}}), which is often considered the most significant work of [[Vietnamese literature]].
