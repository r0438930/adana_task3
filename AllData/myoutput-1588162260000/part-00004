Ko\u0161tunica received 50.26 percent of the vote in the first round of voting, just a few thousand votes over the threshold needed to win outright. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 disputed the results of the first round, claiming that Ko\u0161tunica had only received 49 percent of the vote and a runoff was required. The Otpor movement, a student-led movement to oust Milosevic and install free and fair elections, organized a protest where thousands of Serbians participated in strikes and took over the Belgrade capital and forced Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to accept the results and step down as president. Ko\u0161tunica then assumed the presidency. He was the last president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Ko\u0161tunica opposed the extradition of his predecessor, to the Hague Tribunal, and voiced opposition to the court several times.\n\n===Prime Minister of Serbia (2004\u201308)===\n{{See also|First cabinet of Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica|Second cabinet of Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica}}\nFollowing the parliamentary elections in December 2003, in which the DSS emerged as the largest of the reformist parties, Ko\u0161tunica became prime minister in March 2004 at the head of the new minority government, albeit with the support of the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]].

Milo\u0161evi\u0107 disputed the results of the first round, claiming that Ko\u0161tunica had only received 49 percent of the vote and a runoff was required. The Otpor movement, a student-led movement to oust Milosevic and install free and fair elections, organized a protest where thousands of Serbians participated in strikes and took over the Belgrade capital and forced Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to accept the results and step down as president. Ko\u0161tunica then assumed the presidency. He was the last president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
