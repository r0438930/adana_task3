It aims at uncovering these groups' [[genetic history]]. The geographic position of South Asia makes its biodiversity important for the study of the early dispersal of [[anatomically modern human]]s across [[Asia]].\n\nStudies based on Mitochondrial DNA ([[mtDNA]]) variations have reported genetic unity across various South Asian sub\u2013populations.<ref name=\"Kivisild1999b\" /><ref name=\"Baig2004\" /><ref name=\"Kumar\" /><ref name=Tripathy2008 /> Conclusions of studies based on Y Chromosome variation and Autosomal DNA variation have been varied, although many researchers argue that most of the ancestral nodes of the phylogenetic tree of all the mtDNA types originated in South Asia. Recent genome studies appear to show that most South Asians are descendants of two major ancestral components, one restricted to South Asia (''Ancestral South Indian'', deriving from [[Indus Valley Civilisation|IVC]]-people and a native South Asian population possibly distantly related to the [[Andamanese]]) and the other component (''Ancestral North Indian'') derived from IVC-people and Steppe-people, making it more closely related to those in [[Central Asia]], [[West Asia]] and [[Europe]].<ref name=Metspalu2011 /><ref name=Moorjani2013 /><ref name=Silva2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Silva M, Oliveira M, Vieira D, Brand\u00e3o A, Rito T, Pereira JB, Fraser RM, Hudson B, Gandini F, Edwards C, Pala M, Koch J, Wilson JF, Pereira L, Richards MB, Soares P | display-authors = 6 | title = A genetic chronology for the Indian Subcontinent points to heavily sex-biased dispersals | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 88 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28335724 | pmc = 5364613 | doi = 10.1186/s12862-017-0936-9 }}</ref> Genomic studies have described the genetic landscape of South Asia as a composite of West Eurasian and [[East Asia]]n exogenous components that mixed with the indigenous South Asian groups to create modern-day South Asians.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite journal|last=Yelmen|first=Burak|last2=Mondal|first2=Mayukh|last3=Marnetto|first3=Davide|last4=Pathak|first4=Ajai K.|last5=Montinaro|first5=Francesco|last6=Gallego Romero|first6=Irene|last7=Kivisild|first7=Toomas|last8=Metspalu|first8=Mait|last9=Pagani|first9=Luca|date=1 August 2019|title=Ancestry-Specific Analyses Reveal Differential Demographic Histories and Opposite Selective Pressures in Modern South Asian Populations|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|language=en|volume=36|issue=8|pages=1628\u20131642|doi=10.1093/molbev/msz037|pmid=30952160|pmc=6657728|issn=0737-4038}}</ref> The East Asian ancestry component detected in South Asia is mainly restricted to specific populations in the Himalayan foothills and northeastern part of India.<ref name=\"ChaubeyEast\"/>\n\nIt has been found that the ancestral node of the phylogenetic tree of all the [[mtDNA]] types ([[mitochondrial DNA haplogroup]]s) typically found in Central Asia, the West Asia and Europe are also to be found in South Asia at relatively high frequencies.

Moreover, the mtDNA haplogroup M and  the Y-chromosome haplogroups C and D are restricted to the area ''east'' of South Asia. All the West [[Eurasian]] populations derive from the N and R haplogroups of mtDNA and the F haplogroup of the Y-chromosome.{{sfn|Endicott|Metspalu|Kivisild|2007|p=231}}\n\nEndicott et al. state that these facts are consistent with the hypothesis of a single exodus from East Africa 65,000 years ago via a [[Recent African origin of modern humans#Movement out of Africa|southern coastal route]], with the West Eurasian lineages separating from the South Asian lineages somewhere between East/Northeast Africa and South Asia.{{sfn|Endicott|Metspalu|Kivisild|2007|pp=234\u2013235}}\n\nThe predominant majority genome markers of South Asians are all closely related to [[West Eurasians]] and may have either originated in [[Western Asia]] or [[South Asia]] itself.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2016/11/25/089466.full.pdf|title=Tracing the biogeographical origin of South Asian populations using DNA SatNav |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|quote=Our hypothesis is supported by archaeological, linguistic and genetic evidences that suggest that there were two prominent waves of immigrations to India.

The absence of haplogroup M in Europeans, compared to its equally high frequency among South Asians, East Asians and in some Central Asian populations contrasts with the Western Eurasian leanings of South Asian paternal lineages.<ref name =Kivisild2000a />\n\nMost of the extant mtDNA boundaries in South and Southwest Asia were likely shaped during the initial settlement of Eurasia by anatomically modern humans.<ref name=\"Metspalu2004\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size: 90%\"\n|-\n!

Recent claims for a linkage of haplogroups J2, L, R1a, and R2 with a contemporaneous origin for the majority of the Indian castes\u2019 paternal lineages from outside the South Asia are rejected, although our findings do support a local origin of haplogroups F* and H.

In a major study (2009) using over 500,000 biallelic autosomal markers, Reich hypothesized that the modern South Asian population was the result of admixture between two genetically divergent ancestral populations dating from the post-Holocene era. These two \"reconstructed\" ancient populations he termed \"Ancestral South Indians\" (ASI) and \"Ancestral North Indians\" (ANI). According to Reich: \"ANI ancestry is significantly higher in Indo-European than Dravidian speakers, suggesting that the ancestral ASI may have spoken a Dravidian language before mixing with the ANI.\" While the ANI is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians and Europeans, the ASI is not closely related to groups outside of the subcontinent. As no \"ASI\" ancient DNA is available, the indigenous [[Andamanese]] [[Onge]] are used as an (imperfect) proxy of ASI, though nevertheless distinct from (according to Reich et al., the Andamanese, though distinct from them, are the closest living population to ASI). According to Reich et al., both ANI and ASI ancestry are found all over the subcontinent (in both northern and southern India) in varying proportions, and that \u201cANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in India, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers.\"<ref name=\"Reich2009\" />\n\nMoorjani et al. 2013 state that the ASI, though not closely related to any living group, are \"related (distantly) to indigenous Andaman Islanders.\" Moorjani et al. also suggest possible gene flow into the Andamanese from a population related to the ASI.

ANI formed out of a mixture of \"''Indus Periphery''-related groups\" and migrants from the steppe, while ASI was formed out of \"''Indus Periphery''-related groups\" who moved south and mixed further with local hunter-gatherers. The ancestry of the ASI population is suggested to have averaged about 73% from the AASI and 27% from Iranian-related farmers. Narasimhan et al. observe that samples from the Indus periphery group are always mixes of the same two proximal sources of AASI and Iranian agriculturalist-related ancestry; with \"one of the Indus Periphery individuals having ~42% AASI ancestry and the other two individuals having ~14-18% AASI ancestry\" (with the remainder of their ancestry being from the Iranian agriculturalist-related population).{{sfn|Narasimhan et al.|2018|p=15}}\n\nA genetic study by Yelmen et al.

They concluded that modern South Asians are basically a mixture of a native South Asian genetic component and a later-arriving West-Eurasian component (derived from both West Asia and the western Steppes). The authors also argue that the native South Asian genetic component is distinct from the Andamanese, and that the Andamanese are thus an imperfect proxy. The Andamanese component (represented by the Andamanese Onge) was not found in the northern Indian [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]], and thus it is suggested that the South Indian tribal [[Paniya]] people would serve as a better proxy than the Andamanese (Onge) for the \"native South Asian\" component in modern South Asians.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTwo genetic studies (Shinde et al. 2019 and Narasimhan et al. 2019,) analysing remains from the Indus Valley civilisation (of parts of Bronze Age Northwest India and East Pakistan), found them to have a mixture of ancestry: Shinde et al. found their samples to have about 50-98% of their genome from peoples related to early Iranian farmers, and from 2-50% of their genome from native South Asian hunter-gatherers sharing a common ancestry with the Andamanese, with the Iranian-related ancestry being on average predominant. The samples analyzed by Narasimhan et al. had 45\u201382% Iranian farmer-related ancestry and 11\u201350% AASI (or Andamanese-related hunter-gatherer ancestry). The analysed samples of both studies have little to none of the \"[[Steppe ancestry]]\" component associated with later Indo-European migrations into India.

The perennial concept of people, language, and agriculture arriving to India together through the northwest corridor does not hold up to close scrutiny. Recent claims for a linkage of haplogroups J2, L, R1a, and R2 with a contemporaneous origin for the majority of the Indian castes\u2019 paternal lineages from outside the South Asia are rejected, although our findings do support a local origin of haplogroups F* and H.

In a major study (2009) using over 500,000 biallelic autosomal markers, Reich hypothesized that the modern South Asian population was the result of admixture between two genetically divergent ancestral populations dating from the post-Holocene era. These two \"reconstructed\" ancient populations he termed \"Ancestral South Indians\" (ASI) and \"Ancestral North Indians\" (ANI). According to Reich: \"ANI ancestry is significantly higher in Indo-European than Dravidian speakers, suggesting that the ancestral ASI may have spoken a Dravidian language before mixing with the ANI.\" While the ANI is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians and Europeans, the ASI is not closely related to groups outside of the subcontinent. As no \"ASI\" ancient DNA is available, the indigenous [[Andamanese]] [[Onge]] are used as an (imperfect) proxy of ASI, though nevertheless distinct from (according to Reich et al., the Andamanese, though distinct from them, are the closest living population to ASI). According to Reich et al., both ANI and ASI ancestry are found all over the subcontinent (in both northern and southern India) in varying proportions, and that \u201cANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in India, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers.\"<ref name=\"Reich2009\" />\n\nMoorjani et al. 2013 state that the ASI, though not closely related to any living group, are \"related (distantly) to indigenous Andaman Islanders.\" Moorjani et al. also suggest possible gene flow into the Andamanese from a population related to the ASI. The study concluded that \u201calmost all groups speaking Indo-European or Dravidian languages lie along a gradient of varying relatedness to West Eurasians in PCA (referred to as \u201cIndian cline\u201d)\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moorjani P, Thangaraj K, Patterson N, Lipson M, Loh PR, Govindaraj P, Berger B, Reich D, Singh L | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetic evidence for recent population mixture in India | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 422\u201338 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23932107 | pmc = 3769933 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.006 }}</ref>\n\nA 2013 study using the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), shows that the genome of Andamanese people (Onge) is closer to those of other Oceanic Negrito groups than to that of South Asians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259114532|title=The Andaman Islanders in a Regional Genetic Context: Reexamining the Evidence for an Early Peopling of the Archipelago from South Asia|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Basu et al. 2016, further analysis revealed that the genomic structure of mainland Indian populations is best explained by contributions from four ancestral components.

ANI formed out of a mixture of \"''Indus Periphery''-related groups\" and migrants from the steppe, while ASI was formed out of \"''Indus Periphery''-related groups\" who moved south and mixed further with local hunter-gatherers. The ancestry of the ASI population is suggested to have averaged about 73% from the AASI and 27% from Iranian-related farmers. Narasimhan et al. observe that samples from the Indus periphery group are always mixes of the same two proximal sources of AASI and Iranian agriculturalist-related ancestry; with \"one of the Indus Periphery individuals having ~42% AASI ancestry and the other two individuals having ~14-18% AASI ancestry\" (with the remainder of their ancestry being from the Iranian agriculturalist-related population).{{sfn|Narasimhan et al.|2018|p=15}}\n\nA genetic study by Yelmen et al.

They concluded that modern South Asians are basically a mixture of a native South Asian genetic component and a later-arriving West-Eurasian component (derived from both West Asia and the western Steppes). The authors also argue that the native South Asian genetic component is distinct from the Andamanese, and that the Andamanese are thus an imperfect proxy. The Andamanese component (represented by the Andamanese Onge) was not found in the northern Indian [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]], and thus it is suggested that the South Indian tribal [[Paniya]] people would serve as a better proxy than the Andamanese (Onge) for the \"native South Asian\" component in modern South Asians.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTwo genetic studies (Shinde et al. 2019 and Narasimhan et al. 2019,) analysing remains from the Indus Valley civilisation (of parts of Bronze Age Northwest India and East Pakistan), found them to have a mixture of ancestry: Shinde et al. found their samples to have about 50-98% of their genome from peoples related to early Iranian farmers, and from 2-50% of their genome from native South Asian hunter-gatherers sharing a common ancestry with the Andamanese, with the Iranian-related ancestry being on average predominant. The samples analyzed by Narasimhan et al. had 45\u201382% Iranian farmer-related ancestry and 11\u201350% AASI (or Andamanese-related hunter-gatherer ancestry). The analysed samples of both studies have little to none of the \"[[Steppe ancestry]]\" component associated with later Indo-European migrations into India.
