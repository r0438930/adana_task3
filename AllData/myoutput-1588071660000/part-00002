She was best known for her time with [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) and for her appearance on ''[[Survivor: China]]''.\n\nMassaro made her debut in WWE after winning the [[WWE Diva Search]] in 2005. She was firstly incorporated into the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] brand where she had her first wrestling feud against [[Vince's Devils]] (a villainous female [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stable|stable]]) while she also aligned herself with [[Trish Stratus]] in the process to defeat the team. With Stratus, she was involved in another feud with the then debuting [[Mickie James]] who was obsessed with Stratus and was jealous of Ashley's friendship with her, attacking and causing her to lose matches. She was later drafted to [[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]] and became the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Valet|valet]] for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[Paul London and Brian Kendrick]]. Her most high-profile matches were a [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]] match against [[Melina Perez|Melina]] at [[WrestleMania 23]] and a ''Playboy Bunnymania'' [[Professional wrestling match types#Lumberjack match|Lumberjill match]] at [[WrestleMania XXIV]].\n\nShe left WWE in mid-2008.
