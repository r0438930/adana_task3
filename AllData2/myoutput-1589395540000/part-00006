If considered as a \"source term\" in the field equation, it can be viewed as equivalent to the mass of empty space (which conceptually could be either positive or negative), or \"[[vacuum energy]]\".\n\nThe cosmological constant was first proposed by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] as a mechanism to obtain a solution of the gravitational [[field equation]] that would lead to a static universe, effectively using dark energy to balance gravity.<ref name=\"Einstein\">{{cite arXiv|author=Harvey, Alex |title=How Einstein Discovered Dark Energy |year=2012|eprint = 1211.6338|class=physics.hist-ph }}</ref> Einstein gave the cosmological constant the symbol \u039b (capital lambda). Einstein stated that the cosmological constant required that 'empty space takes the role of gravitating [[negative mass]]es which are distributed all over the interstellar space'.<ref>Albert Einstein, \"Comment on Schr\u00f6dinger's Note 'On a System of Solutions for the Generally Covariant Gravitational Field Equations'\" https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol7-trans/47</ref><ref>O\u2019Raifeartaigh C., O\u2019Keeffe M., Nahm W. and S.

(H) 42: 431\u2013474.</ref>\n\nThe mechanism was an example of [[fine-tuning]], and it was later realized that Einstein's static universe would not be stable: local inhomogeneities would ultimately lead to either the runaway expansion or contraction of the universe. The [[dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue contracting. These sorts of disturbances are inevitable, due to the uneven distribution of matter throughout the universe. Further, observations made by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 showed that the universe appears to be expanding and not static at all. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to predict the idea of a dynamic universe, in contrast to a static universe, as his greatest blunder.<ref>Gamow, George (1970) ''My World Line: An Informal Autobiography''. p. 44: \"Much later, when I was discussing cosmological problems with Einstein, he remarked that the introduction of the cosmological term was the biggest blunder he ever made in his life.\" \u2013 Here the \"cosmological term\" refers to the cosmological constant in the equations of general relativity, whose value Einstein initially picked to ensure that his model of the universe would neither expand nor contract; if he hadn't done this he might have theoretically predicted the universal expansion that was first observed by Edwin Hubble.</ref>\n\n===Inflationary dark energy===\n[[Alan Guth]] and [[Alexei Starobinsky]] proposed in 1980 that a negative pressure field, similar in concept to dark energy, could drive [[cosmic inflation]] in the very early universe. Inflation postulates that some repulsive force, qualitatively similar to dark energy, resulted in an enormous and exponential expansion of the universe slightly after the [[Big Bang]]. Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang. However, inflation must have occurred at a much higher energy density than the dark energy we observe today and is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction of a second old. It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark energy and inflation. Even after inflationary models became accepted, the cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.\n\nNearly all inflation models predict that the total (matter+energy) density of the universe should be very close to the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]. During the 1980s, most cosmological research focused on models with critical density in matter only, usually 95% [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and 5% ordinary matter (baryons). These models were found to be successful at forming realistic galaxies and clusters, but some problems appeared in the late 1980s: in particular, the model required a value for the [[Hubble constant]] lower than preferred by observations, and the model under-predicted observations of large-scale galaxy clustering. These difficulties became stronger after the discovery of [[anisotropy]] in the [[cosmic microwave background]] by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] spacecraft in 1992, and several modified CDM models came under active study through the mid-1990s: these included the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and a mixed cold/hot dark matter model.  The first direct evidence for dark energy came from supernova observations in 1998 of [[deceleration parameter|accelerated expansion]] in [[Adam Riess|Riess]] ''et al.''<ref name=\"riess\" /> and in [[Saul Perlmutter|Perlmutter]] ''et al.'',<ref name=\"perlmutter\" /> and the Lambda-CDM model then became the leading model. Soon after, dark energy was supported by independent observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]] and [[Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array|Maxima]] cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments observed the first [[Baryon acoustic oscillations|acoustic peak]] in the CMB, showing that the total (matter+energy) density is close to 100% of critical density. Then in 2001, the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] gave strong evidence that the matter density is around 30% of critical. The large difference between these two supports a smooth component of dark energy making up the difference. Much more precise measurements from [[WMAP]] in 2003\u20132010 have continued to support the standard model and give more accurate measurements of the key parameters.\n\nThe term \"dark energy\", echoing [[Fritz Zwicky]]'s \"dark matter\" from the 1930s, was coined by [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] in 1998.<ref>The first appearance of the term \"dark energy\" is in the article with another cosmologist and Turner's student at the time, Dragan Huterer, \"Prospects for Probing the Dark Energy via Supernova Distance Measurements\", which was posted to the [[ArXiv.org e-print archive]] in [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808133 August 1998] and published in {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.60.081301| title = Prospects for probing the dark energy via supernova distance measurements| journal = Physical Review D| volume = 60| issue = 8| pages = 081301| year = 1999| last1 = Huterer | first1 = D. | last2 = Turner | first2 = M. |arxiv = astro-ph/9808133 |bibcode = 1999PhRvD..60h1301H }}, although the manner in which the term is treated there suggests it was already in general use.

In general relativity, the evolution of the expansion rate is estimated from the [[shape of the universe|curvature of the universe]] and the cosmological [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space). Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today. Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|FLRW metric]] leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the \"''standard model of cosmology''\" because of its precise agreement with observations.\n\nAs of 2013, the Lambda-CDM model is consistent with a series of increasingly rigorous cosmological observations, including the [[Planck spacecraft]] and the Supernova Legacy Survey. First results from the SNLS reveal that the average behavior (i.e., equation of state) of dark energy behaves like Einstein's cosmological constant to a precision of 10%.<ref name=\"snls\">{{cite journal|author=Astier, Pierre ([[Supernova Legacy Survey]])|title=The Supernova legacy survey: Measurement of \u03a9<sub>M</sub>, \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> and W from the first year data set|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=447|issue=1|pages=31\u201348|year=2006|arxiv=astro-ph/0510447|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20054185|bibcode=2006A&A...447...31A|last2=Guy|last3=Regnault|last4=Pain|last5=Aubourg|last6=Balam|last7=Basa|last8=Carlberg|last9=Fabbro|last10=Fouchez|last11=Hook|last12=Howell|last13=Lafoux|last14=Neill|last15=Palanque-Delabrouille|last16=Perrett|last17=Pritchet|last18=Rich|last19=Sullivan|last20=Taillet|last21=Aldering|last22=Antilogus|last23=Arsenijevic|last24=Balland|last25=Baumont|last26=Bronder|last27=Courtois|last28=Ellis|last29=Filiol|last30=Gon\u00e7alves|display-authors=29}}</ref> Recent results from the Hubble Space Telescope Higher-Z Team indicate that dark energy has been present for at least 9 billion years and during the period preceding cosmic acceleration.\n\n== Nature ==\nThe nature of dark energy is more hypothetical than that of dark matter, and many things about it remain in the realm of speculation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Overbye|first1=Dennis|title=Astronomers Report Evidence of 'Dark Energy' Splitting the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/22/us/astronomers-report-evidence-of-dark-energy-splitting-the-universe.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=August 5, 2015|date=2003-07-22}}</ref> Dark energy is thought to be very homogeneous and not very [[density|dense]], and is not known to interact through any of the [[fundamental forces]] other than [[gravity]].

The reason dark energy can have such a profound effect on the universe, making up 68% of universal density in spite of being so dilute, is that it uniformly fills otherwise empty space.\n\nIndependently of its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong negative pressure (repulsive action), like [[radiation pressure]] in a [[metamaterial]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Zhong-Yue Wang|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503\u2013508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}</ref> to explain the observed [[Accelerating universe|acceleration]] of the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]]. According to general relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction for other objects just as its mass density does. This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to generate gravitational effects is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]], which contains both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure and viscosity{{doubtful|date=February 2017}}. In the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric]], it can be shown that a strong constant negative pressure in all the universe causes an acceleration in the expansion if the universe is already expanding, or a deceleration in contraction if the universe is already contracting. This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled \"gravitational repulsion\".\n\n===Technical definition===\n{{see also|Friedmann equations}}\nIn standard cosmology, there are three components of the universe: matter, radiation, and dark energy. Matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the scale factor, i.e., ''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''a''<sup>\u22123</sup>, while radiation is anything which scales to the inverse fourth power of the scale factor (''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''a''<sup>\u22124</sup>). This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cube-shaped box, doubling the length of an edge of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (2<sup>3</sup>).

The relationship is roughly linear, according to [[Hubble's law]]. It is relatively easy to measure redshift, but finding the distance to an object is more difficult. Usually, astronomers use standard candles: objects for which the intrinsic brightness, or [[absolute magnitude]], is known. This allows the object's distance to be measured from its actual observed brightness, or [[apparent magnitude]].

This is the cosmological constant, usually represented by the Greek letter \u039b (Lambda, hence [[Lambda-CDM model]]). Since energy and mass are related according to the equation ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>, Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that this energy will have a gravitational effect. It is sometimes called a [[vacuum energy]] because it is the energy density of empty [[vacuum]].\n\nThe cosmological constant has negative pressure equal and opposite to its [[energy density]] and so causes the expansion of the universe to [[Deceleration parameter|accelerate]]. The reason a cosmological constant has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics. In general, energy must be lost from inside a container (the container must do work on its environment) in order for the volume to increase. Specifically, a change in volume ''dV'' requires work done equal to a change of energy \u2212''P&nbsp;dV'', where ''P'' is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a container full of vacuum actually increases when the volume increases, because the energy is equal to ''\u03c1V'', where ''\u03c1'' is the energy density of the cosmological constant. Therefore, ''P'' is negative and, in fact, ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''\u03c1''.\n\nThere are two major advantages for the cosmological constant. The first is that it is simple. Einstein had in fact introduced this term in his original formulation of general relativity such as to get a static universe. Although he later discarded the term after [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] found that the universe is expanding, a nonzero cosmological constant can act as dark energy, without otherwise changing the Einstein field equations. The other advantage is that there is a natural explanation for its origin. Most [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuations]] that would give the vacuum this sort of energy. This is related to the [[Casimir effect]], in which there is a small suction into regions where virtual particles are geometrically inhibited from forming (e.g. between plates with tiny separation).\n\nA major outstanding [[Unsolved problems in physics|problem]] is that the same [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict a huge [[cosmological constant]], more than 100 [[orders of magnitude]] too large.<ref name=\"carroll\"/> This would need to be almost, but not exactly, cancelled by an equally large term of the opposite sign. Some [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero,<ref>{{cite book |last1= Wess |first1= Julius |last2=Bagger |first2=Jonathan |title=Supersymmetry and Supergravity |isbn=978-0691025308|year= 1992 }}</ref> which does not help because supersymmetry must be broken. Also, it is unknown if there is a metastable vacuum state in [[string theory]] with a positive cosmological constant.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wolchover |first1=Natalie |title=Dark Energy May Be Incompatible With String Theory |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/dark-energy-may-be-incompatible-with-string-theory-20180809/ |website=[[Quanta Magazine]] |publisher=Simons Foundation |accessdate=2 April 2020 |date=9 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, the cosmological constant is the most [[Occam's razor|economical solution]] to the problem of [[cosmic acceleration]]. Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, includes the cosmological constant as an essential feature.\n\n===Quintessence===\n{{main|Quintessence (physics)}}\nIn [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] models of dark energy, the observed acceleration of the scale factor is caused by the potential energy of a dynamical [[scalar field|field]], referred to as quintessence field. Quintessence differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In order for it not to clump and form [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|structure]] like matter, the field must be very light so that it has a large [[Compton wavelength]].\n\nNo evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out either. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] and [[equivalence principle#Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle|variation of the fundamental constants]] in space or time.<ref name=\"Carroll1998\">{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Quintessence and the Rest of the World: Suppressing Long-Range Interactions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=81|issue=15|year=1998|pages=3067\u20133070|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3067|arxiv = astro-ph/9806099 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.3067C }}</ref> [[Scalar field]]s are predicted by the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics and [[string theory]], but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of [[cosmological inflation]]) occurs: [[renormalization]] theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses.\n\nThe coincidence problem asks why the [[accelerating universe|acceleration]] of the Universe began when it did.  If acceleration began earlier in the universe, structures such as [[galaxy|galaxies]] would never have had time to form, and life, at least as we know it, would never have had a chance to exist. Proponents of the [[anthropic principle]] view this as support for their arguments. However, many models of quintessence have a so-called \"tracker\" behavior, which solves this problem. In these models, the quintessence field has a density which closely tracks (but is less than) the radiation density until [[Big Bang|matter-radiation equality]], which triggers quintessence to start behaving as dark energy, eventually dominating the universe.

If considered as a \"source term\" in the field equation, it can be viewed as equivalent to the mass of empty space (which conceptually could be either positive or negative), or \"[[vacuum energy]]\".\n\nThe cosmological constant was first proposed by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] as a mechanism to obtain a solution of the gravitational [[field equation]] that would lead to a static universe, effectively using dark energy to balance gravity.<ref name=\"Einstein\">{{cite arXiv|author=Harvey, Alex |title=How Einstein Discovered Dark Energy |year=2012|eprint = 1211.6338|class=physics.hist-ph }}</ref> Einstein gave the cosmological constant the symbol \u039b (capital lambda). Einstein stated that the cosmological constant required that 'empty space takes the role of gravitating [[negative mass]]es which are distributed all over the interstellar space'.<ref>Albert Einstein, \"Comment on Schr\u00f6dinger's Note 'On a System of Solutions for the Generally Covariant Gravitational Field Equations'\" https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol7-trans/47</ref><ref>O\u2019Raifeartaigh C., O\u2019Keeffe M., Nahm W. and S. Mitton. (2017). 'Einstein\u2019s 1917 Static Model of the Universe: A Centennial Review'. Eur. Phys. J. (H) 42: 431\u2013474.</ref>\n\nThe mechanism was an example of [[fine-tuning]], and it was later realized that Einstein's static universe would not be stable: local inhomogeneities would ultimately lead to either the runaway expansion or contraction of the universe. The [[dynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]] is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe which contracts slightly will continue contracting. These sorts of disturbances are inevitable, due to the uneven distribution of matter throughout the universe. Further, observations made by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929 showed that the universe appears to be expanding and not static at all. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to predict the idea of a dynamic universe, in contrast to a static universe, as his greatest blunder.<ref>Gamow, George (1970) ''My World Line: An Informal Autobiography''. p. 44: \"Much later, when I was discussing cosmological problems with Einstein, he remarked that the introduction of the cosmological term was the biggest blunder he ever made in his life.\" \u2013 Here the \"cosmological term\" refers to the cosmological constant in the equations of general relativity, whose value Einstein initially picked to ensure that his model of the universe would neither expand nor contract; if he hadn't done this he might have theoretically predicted the universal expansion that was first observed by Edwin Hubble.</ref>\n\n===Inflationary dark energy===\n[[Alan Guth]] and [[Alexei Starobinsky]] proposed in 1980 that a negative pressure field, similar in concept to dark energy, could drive [[cosmic inflation]] in the very early universe. Inflation postulates that some repulsive force, qualitatively similar to dark energy, resulted in an enormous and exponential expansion of the universe slightly after the [[Big Bang]]. Such expansion is an essential feature of most current models of the Big Bang. However, inflation must have occurred at a much higher energy density than the dark energy we observe today and is thought to have completely ended when the universe was just a fraction of a second old. It is unclear what relation, if any, exists between dark energy and inflation. Even after inflationary models became accepted, the cosmological constant was thought to be irrelevant to the current universe.\n\nNearly all inflation models predict that the total (matter+energy) density of the universe should be very close to the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]. During the 1980s, most cosmological research focused on models with critical density in matter only, usually 95% [[cold dark matter]] (CDM) and 5% ordinary matter (baryons). These models were found to be successful at forming realistic galaxies and clusters, but some problems appeared in the late 1980s: in particular, the model required a value for the [[Hubble constant]] lower than preferred by observations, and the model under-predicted observations of large-scale galaxy clustering. These difficulties became stronger after the discovery of [[anisotropy]] in the [[cosmic microwave background]] by the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] spacecraft in 1992, and several modified CDM models came under active study through the mid-1990s: these included the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and a mixed cold/hot dark matter model.  The first direct evidence for dark energy came from supernova observations in 1998 of [[deceleration parameter|accelerated expansion]] in [[Adam Riess|Riess]] ''et al.''<ref name=\"riess\" /> and in [[Saul Perlmutter|Perlmutter]] ''et al.'',<ref name=\"perlmutter\" /> and the Lambda-CDM model then became the leading model. Soon after, dark energy was supported by independent observations: in 2000, the [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]] and [[Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array|Maxima]] cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments observed the first [[Baryon acoustic oscillations|acoustic peak]] in the CMB, showing that the total (matter+energy) density is close to 100% of critical density. Then in 2001, the [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] gave strong evidence that the matter density is around 30% of critical. The large difference between these two supports a smooth component of dark energy making up the difference. Much more precise measurements from [[WMAP]] in 2003\u20132010 have continued to support the standard model and give more accurate measurements of the key parameters.\n\nThe term \"dark energy\", echoing [[Fritz Zwicky]]'s \"dark matter\" from the 1930s, was coined by [[Michael Turner (cosmologist)|Michael Turner]] in 1998.<ref>The first appearance of the term \"dark energy\" is in the article with another cosmologist and Turner's student at the time, Dragan Huterer, \"Prospects for Probing the Dark Energy via Supernova Distance Measurements\", which was posted to the [[ArXiv.org e-print archive]] in [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9808133 August 1998] and published in {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.60.081301| title = Prospects for probing the dark energy via supernova distance measurements| journal = Physical Review D| volume = 60| issue = 8| pages = 081301| year = 1999| last1 = Huterer | first1 = D. | last2 = Turner | first2 = M. |arxiv = astro-ph/9808133 |bibcode = 1999PhRvD..60h1301H }}, although the manner in which the term is treated there suggests it was already in general use. Cosmologist Saul Perlmutter has credited Turner with coining the term [http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/dark-energy.html in an article] they wrote together with Martin White, where it is introduced in quotation marks as if it were a neologism. {{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.83.670| title = Constraining Dark Energy with Type Ia Supernovae and Large-Scale Structure| journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 83| issue = 4| pages = 670\u2013673| year = 1999| last1 = Perlmutter | first1 = S. | last2 = Turner | first2 = M. | last3 = White | first3 = M. |arxiv = astro-ph/9901052 |bibcode = 1999PhRvL..83..670P }}</ref>\n\n===Change in expansion over time===\n[[File:Dark Energy.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram representing the accelerated expansion of the universe due to dark energy.]]\nHigh-precision measurements of the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] are required to understand how the expansion rate changes over time and space. In general relativity, the evolution of the expansion rate is estimated from the [[shape of the universe|curvature of the universe]] and the cosmological [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] (the relationship between temperature, pressure, and combined matter, energy, and vacuum energy density for any region of space). Measuring the equation of state for dark energy is one of the biggest efforts in observational cosmology today. Adding the cosmological constant to cosmology's standard [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|FLRW metric]] leads to the Lambda-CDM model, which has been referred to as the \"''standard model of cosmology''\" because of its precise agreement with observations.\n\nAs of 2013, the Lambda-CDM model is consistent with a series of increasingly rigorous cosmological observations, including the [[Planck spacecraft]] and the Supernova Legacy Survey. First results from the SNLS reveal that the average behavior (i.e., equation of state) of dark energy behaves like Einstein's cosmological constant to a precision of 10%.<ref name=\"snls\">{{cite journal|author=Astier, Pierre ([[Supernova Legacy Survey]])|title=The Supernova legacy survey: Measurement of \u03a9<sub>M</sub>, \u03a9<sub>\u039b</sub> and W from the first year data set|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=447|issue=1|pages=31\u201348|year=2006|arxiv=astro-ph/0510447|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20054185|bibcode=2006A&A...447...31A|last2=Guy|last3=Regnault|last4=Pain|last5=Aubourg|last6=Balam|last7=Basa|last8=Carlberg|last9=Fabbro|last10=Fouchez|last11=Hook|last12=Howell|last13=Lafoux|last14=Neill|last15=Palanque-Delabrouille|last16=Perrett|last17=Pritchet|last18=Rich|last19=Sullivan|last20=Taillet|last21=Aldering|last22=Antilogus|last23=Arsenijevic|last24=Balland|last25=Baumont|last26=Bronder|last27=Courtois|last28=Ellis|last29=Filiol|last30=Gon\u00e7alves|display-authors=29}}</ref> Recent results from the Hubble Space Telescope Higher-Z Team indicate that dark energy has been present for at least 9 billion years and during the period preceding cosmic acceleration.\n\n== Nature ==\nThe nature of dark energy is more hypothetical than that of dark matter, and many things about it remain in the realm of speculation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Overbye|first1=Dennis|title=Astronomers Report Evidence of 'Dark Energy' Splitting the Universe|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/22/us/astronomers-report-evidence-of-dark-energy-splitting-the-universe.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=August 5, 2015|date=2003-07-22}}</ref> Dark energy is thought to be very homogeneous and not very [[density|dense]], and is not known to interact through any of the [[fundamental forces]] other than [[gravity]].

The reason dark energy can have such a profound effect on the universe, making up 68% of universal density in spite of being so dilute, is that it uniformly fills otherwise empty space.\n\nIndependently of its actual nature, dark energy would need to have a strong negative pressure (repulsive action), like [[radiation pressure]] in a [[metamaterial]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Zhong-Yue Wang|title=Modern Theory for Electromagnetic Metamaterials|journal=Plasmonics|date=2016|volume=11|pages=503\u2013508|doi=10.1007/s11468-015-0071-7|issue=2}}</ref> to explain the observed [[Accelerating universe|acceleration]] of the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]]. According to general relativity, the pressure within a substance contributes to its gravitational attraction for other objects just as its mass density does. This happens because the physical quantity that causes matter to generate gravitational effects is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]], which contains both the energy (or matter) density of a substance and its pressure and viscosity{{doubtful|date=February 2017}}. In the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric]], it can be shown that a strong constant negative pressure in all the universe causes an acceleration in the expansion if the universe is already expanding, or a deceleration in contraction if the universe is already contracting. This accelerating expansion effect is sometimes labeled \"gravitational repulsion\".\n\n===Technical definition===\n{{see also|Friedmann equations}}\nIn standard cosmology, there are three components of the universe: matter, radiation, and dark energy. Matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the scale factor, i.e., ''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''a''<sup>\u22123</sup>, while radiation is anything which scales to the inverse fourth power of the scale factor (''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''a''<sup>\u22124</sup>). This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a cube-shaped box, doubling the length of an edge of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (2<sup>3</sup>). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is greater, because an increase in spatial distance also causes a redshift.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf|title=Cosmology: Part III Mathematical Tripos, Cambridge University|author=Daniel Baumann|page=21\u221222|access-date=2017-01-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202065045/http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/Cosmology/Lectures.pdf|archive-date=2017-02-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe final component, dark energy, is an intrinsic property of space, and so has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration (''\u03c1''&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''a''<sup>0</sup>).

The relationship is roughly linear, according to [[Hubble's law]]. It is relatively easy to measure redshift, but finding the distance to an object is more difficult. Usually, astronomers use standard candles: objects for which the intrinsic brightness, or [[absolute magnitude]], is known. This allows the object's distance to be measured from its actual observed brightness, or [[apparent magnitude]].

This is the cosmological constant, usually represented by the Greek letter \u039b (Lambda, hence [[Lambda-CDM model]]). Since energy and mass are related according to the equation ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>, Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]] predicts that this energy will have a gravitational effect. It is sometimes called a [[vacuum energy]] because it is the energy density of empty [[vacuum]].\n\nThe cosmological constant has negative pressure equal and opposite to its [[energy density]] and so causes the expansion of the universe to [[Deceleration parameter|accelerate]]. The reason a cosmological constant has negative pressure can be seen from classical thermodynamics. In general, energy must be lost from inside a container (the container must do work on its environment) in order for the volume to increase. Specifically, a change in volume ''dV'' requires work done equal to a change of energy \u2212''P&nbsp;dV'', where ''P'' is the pressure. But the amount of energy in a container full of vacuum actually increases when the volume increases, because the energy is equal to ''\u03c1V'', where ''\u03c1'' is the energy density of the cosmological constant. Therefore, ''P'' is negative and, in fact, ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212''\u03c1''.\n\nThere are two major advantages for the cosmological constant. The first is that it is simple. Einstein had in fact introduced this term in his original formulation of general relativity such as to get a static universe. Although he later discarded the term after [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] found that the universe is expanding, a nonzero cosmological constant can act as dark energy, without otherwise changing the Einstein field equations. The other advantage is that there is a natural explanation for its origin. Most [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict [[quantum fluctuation|vacuum fluctuations]] that would give the vacuum this sort of energy. This is related to the [[Casimir effect]], in which there is a small suction into regions where virtual particles are geometrically inhibited from forming (e.g. between plates with tiny separation).\n\nA major outstanding [[Unsolved problems in physics|problem]] is that the same [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] predict a huge [[cosmological constant]], more than 100 [[orders of magnitude]] too large.<ref name=\"carroll\"/> This would need to be almost, but not exactly, cancelled by an equally large term of the opposite sign. Some [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero,<ref>{{cite book |last1= Wess |first1= Julius |last2=Bagger |first2=Jonathan |title=Supersymmetry and Supergravity |isbn=978-0691025308|year= 1992 }}</ref> which does not help because supersymmetry must be broken.

Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, includes the cosmological constant as an essential feature.\n\n===Quintessence===\n{{main|Quintessence (physics)}}\nIn [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] models of dark energy, the observed acceleration of the scale factor is caused by the potential energy of a dynamical [[scalar field|field]], referred to as quintessence field. Quintessence differs from the cosmological constant in that it can vary in space and time. In order for it not to clump and form [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|structure]] like matter, the field must be very light so that it has a large [[Compton wavelength]].\n\nNo evidence of quintessence is yet available, but it has not been ruled out either. It generally predicts a slightly slower acceleration of the expansion of the universe than the cosmological constant. Some scientists think that the best evidence for quintessence would come from violations of Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] and [[equivalence principle#Tests of the Einstein equivalence principle|variation of the fundamental constants]] in space or time.<ref name=\"Carroll1998\">{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean M.|title=Quintessence and the Rest of the World: Suppressing Long-Range Interactions|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=81|issue=15|year=1998|pages=3067\u20133070|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.81.3067|arxiv = astro-ph/9806099 |bibcode = 1998PhRvL..81.3067C }}</ref> [[Scalar field]]s are predicted by the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics and [[string theory]], but an analogous problem to the cosmological constant problem (or the problem of constructing models of [[cosmological inflation]]) occurs: [[renormalization]] theory predicts that scalar fields should acquire large masses.\n\nThe coincidence problem asks why the [[accelerating universe|acceleration]] of the Universe began when it did.  If acceleration began earlier in the universe, structures such as [[galaxy|galaxies]] would never have had time to form, and life, at least as we know it, would never have had a chance to exist. Proponents of the [[anthropic principle]] view this as support for their arguments. However, many models of quintessence have a so-called \"tracker\" behavior, which solves this problem. In these models, the quintessence field has a density which closely tracks (but is less than) the radiation density until [[Big Bang|matter-radiation equality]], which triggers quintessence to start behaving as dark energy, eventually dominating the universe. This naturally sets the low [[energy scale]] of the dark energy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ratra|first1=Bharat|last2=Peebles|first2=P.J.E.|title=Cosmological consequences of a rolling homogeneous scalar field|journal=Phys.

This scenario is so-called [[Quintom scenario]].\n\nSome special cases of quintessence are [[phantom energy]], in which the energy density of quintessence actually increases with time, and k-essence (short for kinetic quintessence) which has a non-standard form of [[kinetic energy]] such as a [[negative kinetic energy]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=R.R.Caldwell|title=A phantom menace?

Assuming the dark energy is constant (a [[cosmological constant]]), the current distance to this cosmological event horizon is about 16 billion light years, meaning that a signal from an event happening ''at present'' would eventually be able to reach us in the future if the event were less than 16 billion light years away, but the signal would never reach us if the event were more than 16 billion light years away.<ref name=ly93 />\n\nAs galaxies approach the point of crossing this cosmological event horizon, the light from them will become more and more [[redshift]]ed, to the point where the wavelength becomes too large to detect in practice and the galaxies appear to vanish completely<ref>{{cite journal|last = Krauss|first = Lawrence M.|author2=Robert J.

Science Friday, 3 Apr 2009. According to the [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102715275 transcript], [[Brian Greene]] makes the comment \"And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared. The entire universe will disappear before our very eyes, and it's one of my arguments for actually funding cosmology. We've got to do it while we have a chance.\"</ref> (''see'' [[Future of an expanding universe]]). Planet Earth, the [[Milky Way]], and the Local Group of which the Milky way is a part, would all remain virtually undisturbed as the rest of the universe recedes and disappears from view. In this scenario, the Local Group would ultimately suffer [[heat death of the universe|heat death]], just as was hypothesized for the flat, matter-dominated universe before measurements of [[accelerating expansion of the universe|cosmic acceleration]].\n\nThere are other, more speculative ideas about the future of the universe. The [[phantom energy]] model of dark energy results in ''divergent'' expansion, which would imply that the effective force of dark energy continues growing until it dominates all other forces in the universe. Under this scenario, dark energy would ultimately tear apart all gravitationally bound structures, including galaxies and solar systems, and eventually overcome the [[electric force|electrical]] and [[nuclear force]]s to tear apart atoms themselves, ending the universe in a \"[[Big Rip]]\". On the other hand, dark energy might dissipate with time or even become attractive. Such uncertainties leave open the possibility that gravity might yet rule the day and lead to a universe that contracts in on itself in a \"[[Big Crunch]]\",<ref name=HTUW>{{cite AV media | title=How the Universe Works 3 | volume=End of the Universe | year=2014 | publisher=Discovery Channel}}</ref> or that there may even be a dark energy cycle, which implies a [[cyclic model|cyclic model of the universe]] in which every iteration ([[Big Bang]] then eventually a [[Big Crunch]]) takes about a [[1000000000000 (number)|trillion]] (10<sup>12</sup>) years.<ref>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9114-cyclic-universe-can-explain-cosmological-constant.html 'Cyclic universe' can explain cosmological constant], NewScientistSpace, 4 May 2006</ref><ref name = \"Steinhardt & Turok 2002\">{{cite journal\n | last = Steinhardt | first = P.
