A status that continues today. The largest discoveries have been made in the Utsira High ([[Johan Sverdrup oil field]], [[Edvard Grieg oil field]]) and in the southern Barents Sea (the Alta, Gohta and Filicudi discoveries). By the end of 2016, Lundin Energy had drilled a total of 84 exploration and appraisal wells in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lundin-petroleum.com/Documents/ar_2016_e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2016 |publisher=Lundin Petroleum AB |accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Lundin family has been involved in oil exploration and production for over thirty years.

In the summer of 2003, Lundin Petroleum sold its working interest in [[Block 5A, South Sudan|Block 5A]] to [[Petronas]] Carigali for US$142.5 million. In 1998 the company discovered the En Naga North and West field in southern part of the [[Sirte Basin]], [[Libya]]. After a successful appraisal program in 1998 and 1999 the field was declared. The commercial and development program commenced. Development included the construction of a central production facility, 100&nbsp;km pipeline together with the drilling of 20 production, 15 injector and 15 water supply wells. Recoverable reserves were estimated to be approximately {{convert|100|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} of [[oil equivalent]]. In [[Tunisia]], the Oudna field development (Lundin Petroleum 40% working interest) was successfully completed and production commenced in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lundin-petroleum.com/Documents/ar_2006_e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2006 |publisher=Lundin Petroleum |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Lundin Petroleum acquired Coparex International from BNP Paribas, adding exploration and production assets in France, Netherlands, Tunisia, Venezuela, Indonesia and Albania to the existing portfolio. The acquisition transformed Lundin Petroleum from a pure exploration company into a larger E&P player. In early 2003, Lundin Petroleum entered Norway for the first time by acquiring 75 percent of the shareholding in Norwegian OER oil.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 2004, Lundin Petroleum acquired a portfolio of producing assets in the UK from DNO AS, doubling Lundin Petroleum's reserves to {{convert|138|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=unit|order=flip}} of oil equivalent and increased production to {{convert|28,900|oilbbl|m3|order=flip}} per day of oil equivalent.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn April 2010 it [[demerger|demerged]] its assets on the [[United Kingdom Continental Shelf]] into [[Petrofac]]'s Energy Developments unit to form the stand-alone company [[EnQuest]].\n\nIn 2010, Lundin Petroleum made a large discovery on the Avaldsnes prospect in PL501 on the Utsira High in the North Sea, estimated to contain recoverable resources of {{convert|100|to|400|e6oilbbl|e6m3|order=flip|abbr=unit}} of oil equivalent.

The trial is likely to begin by the end of 2020 and may take several years.\n\nThe Swedish war crimes investigation raises the issue of access to remedy and reparation for victims of human rights violations linked with business activities.

It would be the first time since the Nuremberg trails that a multibillion-dollar company were to be charged for international crimes. The court is likely to answer a number of important legal questions, including about the individual criminal liability of corporate executives vs. corporate criminal liability of organisations, the applicable standard of proof for international crimes before a national court, and the question whether a lack of due diligence is sufficient for a finding of guilt.

Market capitalisation at year end 2016 was SEK 67 billion which made Lundin Energy the largest independent E&P company in Europe in 2016, measured by market capitalisation.\n\nLundin Energy had {{convert|714.1|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on|order=flip|sigfig=3}} of [[oil equivalent]] of certified reserves at the end of 2016 of which 96 percent was in Norway and contingent resources amounted to {{convert|249|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=unit|order=flip}} of oil equivalent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lundin-petroleum.com/Documents/ar_2016_e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2016 |publisher=Lundin Petroleum AB |accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref> The company's commercial success is overshadowed by a Swedish war crimes investigation into its past operations in Sudan.

A status that continues today. The largest discoveries have been made in the Utsira High ([[Johan Sverdrup oil field]], [[Edvard Grieg oil field]]) and in the southern Barents Sea (the Alta, Gohta and Filicudi discoveries). By the end of 2016, Lundin Energy had drilled a total of 84 exploration and appraisal wells in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lundin-petroleum.com/Documents/ar_2016_e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2016 |publisher=Lundin Petroleum AB |accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Lundin family has been involved in oil exploration and production for over thirty years.

In the summer of 2003, Lundin Petroleum sold its working interest in [[Block 5A, South Sudan|Block 5A]] to [[Petronas]] Carigali for US$142.5 million. In 1998 the company discovered the En Naga North and West field in southern part of the [[Sirte Basin]], [[Libya]]. After a successful appraisal program in 1998 and 1999 the field was declared. The commercial and development program commenced. Development included the construction of a central production facility, 100&nbsp;km pipeline together with the drilling of 20 production, 15 injector and 15 water supply wells. Recoverable reserves were estimated to be approximately {{convert|100|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} of [[oil equivalent]]. In [[Tunisia]], the Oudna field development (Lundin Petroleum 40% working interest) was successfully completed and production commenced in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lundin-petroleum.com/Documents/ar_2006_e.pdf |title=Annual Report 2006 |publisher=Lundin Petroleum |date= |accessdate=2011-10-21}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Lundin Petroleum acquired Coparex International from BNP Paribas, adding exploration and production assets in France, Netherlands, Tunisia, Venezuela, Indonesia and Albania to the existing portfolio. The acquisition transformed Lundin Petroleum from a pure exploration company into a larger E&P player. In early 2003, Lundin Petroleum entered Norway for the first time by acquiring 75 percent of the shareholding in Norwegian OER oil.<ref name=\"History\"/> In 2004, Lundin Petroleum acquired a portfolio of producing assets in the UK from DNO AS, doubling Lundin Petroleum's reserves to {{convert|138|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=unit|order=flip}} of oil equivalent and increased production to {{convert|28,900|oilbbl|m3|order=flip}} per day of oil equivalent.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn April 2010 it [[demerger|demerged]] its assets on the [[United Kingdom Continental Shelf]] into [[Petrofac]]'s Energy Developments unit to form the stand-alone company [[EnQuest]].\n\nIn 2010, Lundin Petroleum made a large discovery on the Avaldsnes prospect in PL501 on the Utsira High in the North Sea, estimated to contain recoverable resources of {{convert|100|to|400|e6oilbbl|e6m3|order=flip|abbr=unit}} of oil equivalent.
