(2006)</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Julius Caesar]] has been assigned a role in the inspiration for sauerbraten as he sent [[amphora]]s filled with beef marinated in wine over the [[Alps]] to the newly founded Roman colony of [[Cologne]].  According to this legend (Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BC and the Roman city of Cologne was founded in 50 AD), this inspired the residents of Cologne to imitate the Roman import.<ref name=\"Hassani 2004, p.156\"/> While quite common, these claims are largely unsubstantiated.\n\nSeveral sources believe sauerbraten was invented by [[Charlemagne]] in the 9th century AD as a means of using leftover roasted meat.<ref name=\"Schmidt 2003, p.94\"/><ref>Herter 1995.</ref> [[Saint Albertus Magnus]], also known as Saint Albert the Great and Albert of Cologne, is also credited with popularizing the dish in the 13th century.<ref>[http://www.foodreference.com/html/html/april2.html April 2 Today's Events in Food History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}\n\nSauerbraten was originally made from horse meat; this is still done by many traditional restaurants, particularly in the [[Rhineland]], but today sauerbraten is most often made from beef.<ref name=\"Kummer 2007, p. 553\"/><ref>Babcock 2002 p. 248.</ref>\n\n==Regional variations==\n[[File:Sauerbraten-gebraten.jpg|thumb|300px|Rheinischer Sauerbraten, in which raisins are added to provide a sweet balance to the sourness and acidity of the marinade]]\nThere are many regional variants of sauerbraten.  Many of the variations are in the ingredients used for the marinade in which the cut of meat is immersed for several days before cooking.\n\nGenerally, the marinade's base is either [[red wine]], vinegar or a combination of both. While Germany largely produces [[white wine]]s such as [[Riesling]] and [[Gew\u00fcrztraminer]], regions of Germany that are closer to France often use [[red wine]] as the base for the marinade. [[Wine vinegar]], [[apple cider vinegar]] and other varieties can be used as a base. Recipes from eastern regions of Germany closer to Poland and the Czech Republic tend to use vinegar as the base more frequently. In many regions, wine and vinegar are used together.\n\n* ''Rheinischer Sauerbraten'' is prepared in Germany's [[Rhineland]] region\u2014along the valley of the [[Rhine]]. [[Raisin]]s and sometimes [[sugar beet syrup]] are added in cooking to provide sweetness to complement the sourness of the marinade.<ref name=\"Hassani 2004, p.156\">Hassani 2004, p. 156.</ref>\n\n==Preparation==\n\n===Selection of the roast===\nSauerbraten can be made with many different kinds of roasting meat.  Tougher, less expensive cuts of meat are used\u2014typically a rump roast or bottom round of beef.\n\n[[Venison]] or other game are often prepared as sauerbraten as the spices and vinegar take away the gamey taste of the meat.<ref name=\"Schmidt 2003, p.94\">Schmidt 2003, p.94.</ref>\n\n===Marinating the roast===\n[[File:Sauerbraten-mariniert.jpg|thumb|Sauerbraten marinating]]\nA solid cut from the bottom [[Round steak|round]]<ref>[[The Culinary Institute of America]] Publisher 2006, p. 178.</ref> or rump is marinated for three or four days,<ref name=\"Mitchell 1953, p.106\">Mitchell 1953, p. 106.</ref> or as many as ten,<ref>Sales 1977, p. 176.</ref> before cooking.\n\nRed wine vinegar and wine typically form the basis of the marinade, which also includes earthy aromatic spices such as [[peppercorns]], [[juniper berries]], [[cloves]], [[nutmeg]], and [[bay leaves]] and less commonly [[coriander]], [[mustard seed]], [[cinnamon]], [[mace (spice)|mace]], [[ginger]], and [[thyme]].<ref name=\"Kummer 2007, p. 553\"/><ref>[http://www.thespicehouse.com/spices/sauerbraten-spice-blend Sauerbraten Blend of Whole Spices<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Wood 1983, p.95.</ref> The marinade may also include vegetables such as onions, celery, and carrots.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1953, p.106\"/> The acidic marinade helps tenderize the meat before it cooks.
