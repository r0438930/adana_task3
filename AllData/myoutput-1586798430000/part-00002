Transformational leadership serves to enhance the motivation, morale, and [[job performance]] of followers through a variety of mechanisms; these include connecting the follower's sense of [[self-identity|identity]] and self to a [[project]] and to the [[collective identity]] of the organization; being a [[role model]] for followers in order to inspire them and to raise their interest in the project; challenging followers to take greater [[ownership]] for their work, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of followers, which allows the leader to align followers with tasks that enhance their performance. It is also important to understand the qualities a transformational leadership can bring to a work organization. Transformational leaders are strong in the abilities to adapt to different situations, share a collective consciousness, self-manage, and be inspirational while leading a group of employees.   \n\nTransformational leadership  is when leader behaviors influence followers and inspire them to perform beyond their perceived capabilities. Transformational leadership inspires people to achieve unexpected or remarkable results. It gives workers autonomy over specific jobs, as well as the authority to make decisions once they have been trained. This induces a positive change in the followers attitudes and the organization as a whole. Transformational leaders typically perform four distinct behaviors, also known as the four I's. These behaviors are inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.   \n\nInspirational motivation is when the leader inspires their followers to achieve. This leader sets high and reasonable goals for their followers and their organization. They inspire commitment and they create a shared vision for their organization. Leaders that utilize inspirational motivation motivate followers extrinsically and intrinsically, and they are able to articulate their expectations clearly.   \n\nIdealized influence is when the leader acts as a strong role model for their organization and leads by example. These types of leaders consider the needs of their followers and prioritize their needs. They typically have loads of charisma and are very ethical. Followers of these leaders typically try to emulate their leader as they tend to identify with them easily.\n\nIntellectual stimulation is when the leader encourages their followers to think for themselves. These leaders are creative, innovative, and are very open to new ideas. They tend to be tolerant of their followers' mistakes, and even encourage them as they believe they promote growth and improvement within the organization. These leaders create learning opportunities for their followers and abandon obsolete practices.   \n\nIndividualized consideration is when the leader establishes a strong relationship with their followers. These leaders act as a caring supportive resource for their followers and their organization. They mentor their followers and allocate their time to developing their followers potential.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe concept of transformational leadership was initially introduced by [[James V. Downton]], the first to coin the term \"Transformational leadership\", a concept further developed by leadership expert and presidential biographer [[James MacGregor Burns]]. According to Burns, transformational leadership can be seen when \"leaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=d5r6dul5Mv0C&pg=PA1|title = Transformational Leadership|accessdate = |website = |isbn = 9780802141187|last1 = Burns|first1 = James Macgregor|year = 2004}}</ref> Through the strength of their vision and personality, transformational leaders are able to inspire followers to change expectations, perceptions, and motivations to work towards common goals. Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's [[personality]], traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and challenging goals. Transforming leaders are idealized in the sense that they are a moral exemplar of working towards the benefit of the team, organization and/or community. Burns theorized that transforming and transactional leadership were mutually exclusive styles. Later, researcher [[Bernard M. Bass]] expanded upon Burns' original ideas to develop what is today referred to as Bass\u2019 Transformational Leadership Theory. According to Bass, transformational leadership can be defined based on the impact that it has on followers. Transformational leaders, Bass suggested, garner trust, respect, and admiration from their followers.\n\nBernard M. Bass (1985), extended the work of Burns (1978) by explaining the [[psychological]] mechanisms that underlie transforming and transactional leadership. Bass introduced the term \"transformational\" in place of \"transforming.\" Bass added to the initial concepts of Burns (1978) to help explain how transformational leadership could be measured, as well as how it impacts follower motivation and performance. The extent to which a leader is transformational, is measured first, in terms of his influence on the followers. The followers of such a leader feel trust, admiration, [[loyalty]] and respect for the leader and because of the qualities of the transformational leader are willing to work harder than originally expected. These outcomes occur because the transformational leader offers followers something more than just working for self-gain; they provide followers with an inspiring mission and vision and give them an [[Identity (social science)|identity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision|accessdate = |doi=10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S |volume=18 |issue = 3|journal=Organizational Dynamics |pages=19\u201331|year = 1990|last1 = Bass|first1 = Bernard M.}}</ref> The leader transforms and motivates followers through their idealized influence (earlier referred to as charisma), intellectual stimulation and individual consideration. In addition, this leader encourages followers to come up with new and unique ways to challenge the status quo and to alter the environment to support being successful. Finally, in contrast to Burns, Bass suggested that leadership can simultaneously display both transformational and transactional leadership.\n\nIn 1985, transformational leadership had become more defined and developed whereby leaders known to use this style possessed the following traits: idealized influences, charisma, and inspirational motivation. Transformational leadership made transactional leadership more effective.<ref>Barling, J., & Cooper, C. L. (2008). ''The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior''. Vol. 1: Micro Approaches.

As a result, they inspire, empower, and stimulate followers to exceed normal levels of performance. Transformational leaders also focus on and care about followers and their personal needs and development.<ref name=\":1\" /> Transformational leaders fit well in leading and working with complex work groups and organizations, where beyond seeking an inspirational leader to help guide them through an uncertain environment, followers are also challenged and feel empowered; this nurtures them into becoming loyal, high performers.\n\nThere are 4 components to transformational leadership, sometimes referred to as the 4 I's:\n* '''Idealized Influence (II)''' \u2013 the leader serves as an ideal role model for followers; the leader \"walks the talk,\" and is admired for this. A transformational leader embodies the qualities that he/she wants in his/her team. In this case, the followers see the leader as a model to emulate. For the followers, it is easy to believe and trust in a transformational leader.  \n* '''Inspirational Motivation (IM)''' \u2013 Transformational leaders have the ability to inspire and motivate followers through having a vision and presenting that vision. Combined, these first two I's are what constitute the transformational leader's charisma. A transformational leader manages to inspire the followers easily with clarity. The transformational leader convinces the followers with simple and easy-to-understand words, as well as with their own image.\n* '''Individualized Consideration (IC)''' \u2013 Transformational leaders demonstrate genuine concern for the needs and feelings of followers and help them self-actualize. This personal attention to each follower assists in developing trust among the organization's members and their authority figure(s). For example, the transformational leader can point out the problems of a  member working in a group. From this perspective, the leader can work towards training and developing a follower who is having difficulties in a job. This is an important element because teams are able to rely on and work together, so decisions can be made more quickly, while the transformational leader increases their buy-in.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smirl |first1=Paul |title=Becoming a Transformational Leader |url=https://wsb.wisc.edu/programs-degrees/mba/blog/2018/08/23/becoming-a-transformational-leader |website=Wisconsin School of Business |accessdate=November 22, 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Intellectual Stimulation (IS)''' \u2013 the leader challenges followers to be innovative and creative, they encourage their followers to challenge the status quo. A common misunderstanding is that transformational leaders are \"soft,\" but the truth is that they constantly challenge followers to higher levels of performance.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Riggio|first1=Ronald E.|title=Are You a Transformational Leader?|date=2009-03-24|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/200903/are-you-transformational-leader|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>\nTransformational leadership is said to have occurred when engagement in a group results in leaders and followers raising one another to increased levels of motivation and morality.<ref name=\":0\" />  It is not enough to make the correct choice, but to make the moral choice. In simple words, a transformational leader is not selfish and sees an opportunity of growth in others. Transformational leadership enhances intellectual stimulation through employee training and development.\n\nTransformational leaders do one thing tranactional leaders don't, which is going beyond self-actualization. The importance of transcending self-interests is something lost sight of by those who see that the ultimate in maturity of development is self-actualization. Bass. (1999).\n\n== Characteristics==\n\nFive major [[personality traits]] have been identified as factors contributing to the likelihood of an individual displaying the characteristics of a transformational leader. Different emphasis on different elements of these traits point to inclination in personality to inspirational leadership, [[transactional leadership]], and transformational leadership. These five traits are as follows.<ref name=\"Bono\">{{cite journal | last1 = Joyce | first1 = E. | last2 = Judge | first2 = Timothy A. | year = 2004 | title = Personality and Transformational and Transactional Leadership: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 901\u2013910 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.901 | pmid=15506869| citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.7909 }}</ref>\n[[File:\ud2b9\uc9d51.jpg|thumb|right|490px|Results of Meta Analysis finding correlation between personality traits and transformational leadership from data gathered by Joyce Bono and Timothy Judge.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>]]\n\n=== Extraversion ===\nThe two main characteristics of extraverts are [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]] and [[Agency (sociology)|agency]],<ref name=\"Bono\"/> which relate to the social and leadership aspects of their personality, respectively. Extraversion is generally seen as an inspirational trait usually exhibited in transformational leadership.\n\n=== Neuroticism ===\n[[Neuroticism]] generally gives an individual an anxiety related to productivity which, in a group setting can be debilitating to a degree where they are unlikely to position themselves in a role of transformational leadership due to lower self-esteem and a tendency to shirk from leadership responsibilities.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>\n\n=== Openness to experience ===\nCreative expression and emotional responsiveness have been linked to a general tendency of openness to experience.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is also seen as a component of transformational leadership as it relates to the ability to give big-picture visionary leadership for an [[organization]].\n\n=== Agreeableness ===\nAlthough not a trait which specifically points to transformational leadership, leaders in general possess an agreeable nature stemming from a natural concern for others and high levels of individual consideration.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> [[Charisma]] and idealized influence is a classic ability of individuals who possess agreeability.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>\n\n=== Conscientiousness ===\nStrong sense of direction and the ability to put large amounts of productive work into tasks is the by-product of [[conscientious]] leaders.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is more linked to a transactional form of leadership given the management-based abilities of such individuals and the detail oriented nature of their personality. Results suggest that transformational leaders might give greater importance to values pertaining to others than to values concerning only themselves.<ref name=\"Krishnan\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Krishnan | first1 = Venkat | year = 2001 | title = Value Systems of Transformational Leaders | journal = Leadership & Organization Development Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 126\u2013132 | doi = 10.1108/01437730110389274}}</ref>\n\n\nStudies have shown that subordinates' and leaders' ratings of transformational leadership may not converge. According to leaders' self\u2010ratings, the extraverted, intuitive and perceiving preferences favour transformational leadership. On the contrary, subordinates' ratings indicated that leaders with sensing preference are associated with transformational leadership.<ref name=\"Hautala\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Hautala | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = The relationship between personality and transformational leadership | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 25 | issue = 8| pages = 777\u2013794 | doi = 10.1108/02621710610684259}}</ref>\n\n== Measurement ==\nOne of the ways in which transformational leadership is measured is through use of the [[Multifactor leadership questionnaire|Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire]] (MLQ), a survey which identifies different leadership characteristics based on examples and provides a basis for leadership training.  Early development was limited because the knowledge in this area was primitive, and as such, finding good examples for the items in the questionnaire was difficult.  Subsequent development on the MLQ led to the current version of the survey, the MLQ5X.\n\nThe current version of the MLQ5X includes 36 items that are broken down into 9 scales with 4 items measuring each scale. Subsequent validation work by [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues provided strong evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the MLQ5X.<ref name=\"Antonakis\">{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B.

Although other researchers have still been critical of the MLQ model, since 2003 no one has been able to provide dis-confirming evidence of the theorized nine-factor model with such large sample sizes as those published by Antonakis.\n\nIn regards to transformational leadership, the first 5 components \u2013 Idealized Attributes, Idealized Behaviors, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration \u2013 are considered to be transformational leadership behaviors.\n\n== Effectiveness as compared to other leadership styles ==\nStudies have shown that transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes in relation to other leadership styles.  It is suggested that transformational leadership augments transactional in predicating effects on follower satisfaction and performance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bass, Riggio |first1=Bernard, Ronald |title=Transformational Leadership |date=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |pages=10 |edition=Second }}</ref> According to studies performed by Lowe, Kroeck, and Sivasubramaniam, charisma (or Idealized Influence) was found to be a variable that was most strongly related to leader effectiveness among MLQ scales.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1048-9843(96)90027-2|url=https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/K_Lowe_Effectiveness_1996.pdf|title=Effectiveness correlates of transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic review of the MLQ literature|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385\u2013425|year=1996|last1=Lowe|first1=Kevin B.|last2=Kroeck|first2=K.Galen|last3=Sivasubramaniam|first3=Nagaraj}}</ref>  Other studies show that transformational leadership is positively associated with employee outcomes including commitment, role clarity, and well-being.<ref name=\":3\"/> However, the effectiveness of transformational leadership varies by the situational contexts. For example, it can be more effective when applied to smaller, privately held firms than complex organizations based on its outreach effect with members of the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ling |first1=Y |last2=Simseck |first2=Z |last3=Lubatkin |first3=M.H. |last4=Veiga |first4=J.F. |title=The impact of transformational CEOs on the performance of small- to medium-sized firms: Does organizational context matter?  |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=923\u201334 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.93.4.923 |pmid=18642995 }}</ref> However, we can conclude that transformational leadership has a positive effect on organizational effectiveness. This is because transformational leaders can encourage and facilitate change in their subordinates and encourage their development and creativity. <ref>Chi, H., Lan, C. and Dorigotov, B.

According to Burns, the transforming approach creates significant change\nin the life of people and organizations. It redesigns perceptions and values, and changes expectations and aspirations\nof employees.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=J.M |title=Transformational Leadership |url=https://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/TransformationalLeadership.pdf |website=Langston |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref> Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's personality, traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and\nchallenging goals.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Burns |first1=J.M |title=Transformational Leadership |url=https://www.langston.edu/sites/default/files/basic-content-files/TransformationalLeadership.pdf |website=Langston |accessdate=5 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nTransformational leaders look towards changing the future to inspire followers and accomplish goals, whereas transactional leaders seek to maintain the ''status quo'', not aiming for progress. Transactional leaders frequently get results from employees by using authority, while transformational leaders have a true vision for their company, are able to inspire people, and are entirely committed to their work.\n\nThe MLQ does test for some transactional leadership elements \u2013 Contingent Reward and [[Management by exception|Management-by-Exception]] \u2013 and the results for these elements are often compared to those for the transformational elements tested by the MLQ.  Studies have shown transformational leadership practices lead to higher satisfaction with leader among followers and greater leader effectiveness, while transactional practices lead to higher follower job satisfaction and leader job performance.<ref name=\"piccolo\">{{cite journal|pmid=15506858|url=http://www.panglossinc.com/TA-TF%20Paper--JAP%20published.pdf|year=2004|last1=Judge|first1=T.

This leads to subordinates having a free hand in deciding policies and methods.\n\nStudies have shown that while transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes, laissez-faire leadership is associated with negative outcomes, especially in terms of follower satisfaction with leader and leader effectiveness.<ref name=\"piccolo\" />  Also, other studies comparing the leadership styles of men and women have shown that female leaders tend to be more transformational with their leadership styles, whereas laissez-faire leadership is more prevalent in male leaders.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=12848221|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/64ab/af52dd802cf569379cf52bbb9822d56857aa.pdf|year=2003|last1=Eagly|first1=A.

The results indicated a hierarchy of leadership styles and related subcomponents. Transformational Leadership characteristics were the most effective; in the following order of effectiveness from most to least: charisma-inspiration, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. Transactional Leadership was the next most effective; in the following order of effectiveness from most to least: contingent reward and managing-by-exception. Laissez Faire leadership does not intentionally intervene, and as such, is not measured, and has no effectiveness score.\n\nTable 2.3\n\nCorrelations With Effectiveness in Public and Private Organizations\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|\n|''Sector''\n|\n|-\n|''Leadership''\n|''Public''\n|''Private''\n|-\n|Transformational\n|\n|\n|-\n|  Charisma-inspiration\n|.74\n|.69\n|-\n|  Intellectual stimulation\n|.65\n|.56\n|-\n|  Individual consideration\n|.63\n|.62\n|-\n|Transactional\n|\n|\n|-\n|  Contingent reward\n|.41\n|.41\n|-\n|  Managing-by-exception\n|.10\n|\u2013.02\n|}\nResults of a meta-analysis of effectiveness of as adapted by Bass (2006) in Transformational Leadership.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transformational leadership|author=Bass, Bernard|date=2006|publisher=L.

Openness to experience allows the leader to be more accepting of novel ideas and thus more likely to stimulate the follower intellectually. Conscientious leaders are achievement oriented and thus more likely to motivate their followers to achieve organizational goals. Extraverted and agreeable individuals are more outgoing and pleasant, respectively, and more likely to have successful interpersonal relationships. Thus, they are more likely to influence their followers and to be considerate towards them. Emotionally stable leaders would be better able to influence their followers because their stability would enable them to be better role models to followers and to thoroughly engage them in the goal fulfillment process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss3/7_Edited_Phipps%20Big5_pp430_447_jmDF.pdf|title = THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY FACTORS ON TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP: EXPLORING THE MODERATING ROLE OF POLITICAL SKILL|last = Phipps|first = Simone T.A.|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Leadership Studies|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nA specific example of cultural background affecting the effectiveness of transformational leadership would be Indian culture, where a nurturant-task style of leadership has been shown to be an effective leadership style. Singh and Bhandarker (1990) demonstrated that effective transformational leaders in India are likes heads of Indian families taking personal interest in the welfare of their followers. Leaders in Indian organizations are therefore more likely to exhibit transformational behaviors if their followers are more self-effacing in approaching the leaders. It is also hypothesized in general that subordinates\u2019 being socialized to be less assertive, self-confident, and independent would enhance superiors\u2019 exhibition of transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://rkvenkat.org/varun.pdf|title = Impact of Socialization on Transformational Leadership: Role of Leader Member Exchange|last = Gupta|first = Varun|date = July\u2013September 2004|journal = South Asian Journal of Management|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nFollower characteristics, combined with their perceptions of the leader and their own situation, did appear to moderate the connection between transformational leadership and subordinates\u2019 willingness to take charge and be good organizational citizens. For instance, if subordinates in a work group perceive their leader to be prototypical of them, then transformational leadership would have less of an impact on their willingness to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors. Likewise, if subordinates are goal oriented and possess a traditional view of the organizational hierarchy, they tend to be less affected by transformational leadership. Self-motivated employees are less likely to need transformational leaders to prod them into action, while \u201ctraditionalists\u201d tend to see positive organizational citizenship as something expected given their roles as followers\u2014not something they need to be \u201cinspired\u201d to do.\n\nEvidence suggests that the above sets of factors act, in essence, as both inhibitors of and substitutes for transformational leadership. As inhibitors, the presence of any of these factors\u2014either independently or especially collectively\u2014could make the presence of a transformational leader \u201credundant\u201d since followers\u2019 positive behavior would instead be sparked by their own motivations or perceptions. On the other hand, when these factors are not present (e.g., employees in a work group do not see their leader as \u201cone of us\u201d), then transformational leadership is likely to have a much greater impact on subordinates. In essence, when such \u201cfavorable conditions\u201d are not present, managers\u2014and the organizations they work for\u2014should see a better return on investment from transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|date = 2013|journal = Academy of Management Perspectives|doi = 10.5465/amp.2013.0064|pmid =|volume=27|issue = 2|last1 = Wyld|first1 = David|title = Transformation Leadership: When is It Redundant?}}</ref>\n\nIt was shown that leader continuity enhanced the effect of transformational leadership on role clarity and commitment, indicating that it takes time before transformational leaders actually have an effect on employees. Furthermore, co-worker support enhanced the effect on commitment, reflecting the role of followers in the transformational leadership process.

It is not necessarily about cost structure, but about finding new ways to grow. Models need to be produced to help leaders create the future. Kent Thirty, CEO of DaVita, chose the name DaVita, Italian for \u201cgiving life,\u201d and settled on a list of core values that included\nservice excellence, teamwork, accountability, and fun. A transformational leader inspires and follows the employee's self-interests, while a transactional leader manages and reinforces generally without employee consideration. Aligning the organization into transformational leaders by committing, being involved, and developing with the employees will lead to higher job satisfaction and motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bass|title=Two Decades of Research and Development in Transformational Leadership|journal=European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology|volume=8|pages=9\u201332|doi=10.1080/135943299398410|url=http://techtied.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/bass_transforrmational_leadership.pdf|year=1999}}</ref> \n\nWhen transformational leadership was used in a nursing environment, researchers found that it led to an increase in organizational commitment.<ref name=b1/> A separate study examined that way that transformational leadership and transactional leadership compare when implemented into an online class.<ref name=\"Kahai\" /> The results of this study indicate that transformational leadership increases cognitive effort while transactional leadership decreases it.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Nelson Mandela===\nNelson Mandela used transformational leadership principles while working to abolish apartheid and enforce change in South Africa.  In 1995, he visited [[Betsie Verwoerd]], the widow of the architect of apartheid Hendrik Verwoerd, at her home in Orania.  Orania was an Afrikaner homeland and a striking anachronistic symbol of racial separation, and Mandela's recurring emphasis on forgiveness contributed toward the healing the prejudices of South Africa and as vast influence as a leader.  In 2000, he was quoted as saying, \"For all people who have found themselves in the position of being in jail and trying to transform society, forgiveness is natural because you have no time to be retaliative.\"<ref name=\"schoemaker\">Schoemaker, Paul (2013-12-05). [https://www.inc.com/paul-schoemaker/what-made-mandela-a-transformational-leader.html \"Nelson Mandela, Transformational Leader.\"] Inc.com.</ref> This illustrates a common approach in the narratives of transformational leadership, of describing a collective or corporate effort in individualised terms, and pointing to the responsibility or opportunity for individuals to commit to making the effort a success. Such an approach is seen in [[Community organizing|community organising]].\n\nHe also set an example for others to follow in terms of sacrifice and philanthropy.  Schoemaker describes one such instance:\n{{Quote|text=\"One such leader received a call from Mandela's office requesting that he accompany the President to the Eastern Cape.  This leader was less than enthusiastic and pleaded that he had an appointment around mid-day clashing with Mandela's request.  But there was no denying Mandela, so the leader agreed to go\u2014but first consulted with his financial director to set a reasonable limit on the size of the anticipated donation request.  They settled on 500,000 Rand, or about $50,000 in those days...upon landing, about 80,000 black school children\u2014all adorned in crisp white shirts\u2014simultaneously bowed to acknowledge the great man's arrival.  As they were climbing down from the helicopter, Mandela planted his hand firmly in his guest's back and said, 'Now, I hope you are not going to disappoint me?' The business leader decided in that instance to double the donation...how could he tell a man who sacrificed as much as Mandela that he couldn't afford to be more generous?\"}}\n\n=== Other Contexts ===\nTransformational leadership studies have been conducted in a variety of contexts including military,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kane|first=Thomas D.|last2=Tremble|first2=Trueman R.|title=Transformational leadership effects at different levels of the Army.|journal=Military Psychology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=137\u2013160|doi=10.1207/s15327876mp1202_4|year=2000}}</ref> education,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koh|first=William L.|last2=Steers|first2=Richard M.|last3=Terborg|first3=James R.|date=1995-07-01|title=The effects of transformational leadership on teacher attitudes and student performance in Singapore|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=16|issue=4|pages=319\u2013333|doi=10.1002/job.4030160404}}</ref> higher education teaching,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balwant|first=Paul T.|date=2016-02-01|title=Transformational Instructor-Leadership in Higher Education Teaching: A Meta-Analytic Review and Research Agenda|journal=Journal of Leadership Studies|volume=9|issue=4|pages=20\u201342|doi=10.1002/jls.21423}}</ref> business,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gang Wang|last2=Wang|first2=Gang|last3=Oh|first3=In-Sue|last4=Courtright|first4=Stephen H.|last5=Colbert|first5=Amy E.|date=2011-03-15|title=Transformational Leadership and Performance Across Criteria and Levels: A Meta-Analytic Review of 25 Years of Research|journal=Group & Organization Management|volume=36|issue=2|pages=223\u2013270|doi=10.1177/1059601111401017}}</ref> and temporary settings (e.g., project teams in corporate and education).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tyssen|first=Ana K.|last2=Wald|first2=Andreas|last3=Heidenreich|first3=Sven|date=2014|title=Leadership in the context of temporary organizations: A study on the effects of transactional and transformational leadership on followers' commitment in projects|journal=Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies|volume=21|issue=4|pages=376\u2013393|doi=10.1177/1548051813502086}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balwant|first=Paul T.|date=2019|title=Stay close!

The academic community is a front-runner in this sense of redefining transformational leadership to suit these changes in job definition.\n\nThe future of transformational leadership is also related to [[political globalization]] and a more homogenous spectrum of economic systems under which organizations find themselves operating. Cultural and geographical dimensions of transformational leadership become blurred as globalization renders ethnically specific collectivist and individualistic effects of organizational behavior obsolete in a more diversified workplace.\n\nThe concept of transformational leadership further needs clarification, especially when a leader is declared as a transformational or transactional leader. While discussing Jinnah's leadership style, Yousaf (2015) argued that it is not the number of followers, but the nature of the change that indicates whether a leader is transformational or transactional.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yousaf|first=Nadeem|date=2015-01-01|title=Salient features of Jinnah's politics|journal=International Journal of Public Leadership|volume=11|issue=1|pages=46\u201364|doi=10.1108/IJPL-07-2014-0007|issn=2056-4929}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Leadership]]\n", "text_old": "<ref>Odumeru, J.

Transformational leadership serves to enhance the motivation, morale, and [[job performance]] of followers through a variety of mechanisms; these include connecting the follower's sense of [[self-identity|identity]] and self to a [[project]] and to the [[collective identity]] of the organization; being a [[role model]] for followers in order to inspire them and to raise their interest in the project; challenging followers to take greater [[ownership]] for their work, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of followers, which allows the leader to align followers with tasks that enhance their performance. It is also important to understand the qualities a transformational leadership can bring to a work organization. Transformational leaders are strong in the abilities to adapt to different situations, share a collective consciousness, self-manage, and be inspirational while leading a group of employees.   \n\nTransformational leadership  is when leader behaviors influence followers and inspire them to perform beyond their perceived capabilities. Transformational leadership inspires people to achieve unexpected or remarkable results. It gives workers autonomy over specific jobs, as well as the authority to make decisions once they have been trained. This induces a positive change in the followers attitudes and the organization as a whole. Transformational leaders typically perform four distinct behaviors, also known as the four I's. These behaviors are inspirational motivation, idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, individualized consideration.   \n\nInspirational motivation is when the leader inspires their followers to achieve. This leader sets high and reasonable goals for their followers and their organization. They inspire commitment and they create a shared vision for their organization. Leaders that utilize inspirational motivation motivate followers extrinsically and intrinsically, and they are able to articulate their expectations clearly.   \n\nIdealized influence is when the leader acts as a strong role model for their organization and leads by example. These types of leaders consider the needs of their followers and prioritize their needs. They typically have loads of charisma and are very ethical. Followers of these leaders typically try to emulate their leader as they tend to identify with them easily.\n\nIntellectual stimulation is when the leader encourages their followers to think for themselves. These leaders are creative, innovative, and are very open to new ideas. They tend to be tolerant of their followers' mistakes, and even encourage them as they believe they promote growth and improvement within the organization. These leaders create learning opportunities for their followers and abandon obsolete practices.   \n\nIndividualized consideration is when the leader establishes a strong relationship with their followers. These leaders act as a caring supportive resource for their followers and their organization. They mentor their followers and allocate their time to developing their followers potential.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe concept of transformational leadership was initially introduced by [[James V. Downton]], the first to coin the term \"Transformational leadership\", a concept further developed by leadership expert and presidential biographer [[James MacGregor Burns]]. According to Burns, transformational leadership can be seen when \"leaders and followers make each other advance to a higher level of morality and motivation.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=d5r6dul5Mv0C&pg=PA1|title = Transformational Leadership|accessdate = |website = |isbn = 9780802141187|last1 = Burns|first1 = James Macgregor|year = 2004}}</ref> Through the strength of their vision and personality, transformational leaders are able to inspire followers to change expectations, perceptions, and motivations to work towards common goals. Unlike in the transactional approach, it is not based on a \"give and take\" relationship, but on the leader's [[personality]], traits and ability to make a change through example, articulation of an energizing vision and challenging goals. Transforming leaders are idealized in the sense that they are a moral exemplar of working towards the benefit of the team, organization and/or community. Burns theorized that transforming and transactional leadership were mutually exclusive styles. Later, researcher [[Bernard M. Bass]] expanded upon Burns' original ideas to develop what is today referred to as Bass\u2019 Transformational Leadership Theory. According to Bass, transformational leadership can be defined based on the impact that it has on followers. Transformational leaders, Bass suggested, garner trust, respect, and admiration from their followers.\n\nBernard M. Bass (1985), extended the work of Burns (1978) by explaining the [[psychological]] mechanisms that underlie transforming and transactional leadership. Bass introduced the term \"transformational\" in place of \"transforming.\" Bass added to the initial concepts of Burns (1978) to help explain how transformational leadership could be measured, as well as how it impacts follower motivation and performance. The extent to which a leader is transformational, is measured first, in terms of his influence on the followers. The followers of such a leader feel trust, admiration, [[loyalty]] and respect for the leader and because of the qualities of the transformational leader are willing to work harder than originally expected. These outcomes occur because the transformational leader offers followers something more than just working for self-gain; they provide followers with an inspiring mission and vision and give them an [[Identity (social science)|identity]].<ref>{{cite journal|title = From transactional to transformational leadership: Learning to share the vision|accessdate = |doi=10.1016/0090-2616(90)90061-S |volume=18 |issue = 3|journal=Organizational Dynamics |pages=19\u201331|year = 1990|last1 = Bass|first1 = Bernard M.}}</ref> The leader transforms and motivates followers through their idealized influence (earlier referred to as charisma), intellectual stimulation and individual consideration. In addition, this leader encourages followers to come up with new and unique ways to challenge the status quo and to alter the environment to support being successful. Finally, in contrast to Burns, Bass suggested that leadership can simultaneously display both transformational and transactional leadership.\n\nIn 1985, transformational leadership had become more defined and developed whereby leaders known to use this style possessed the following traits: idealized influences, charisma, and inspirational motivation. Transformational leadership made transactional leadership more effective.<ref>Barling, J., & Cooper, C. L. (2008). ''The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior''. Vol. 1: Micro Approaches.

As a result, they inspire, empower, and stimulate followers to exceed normal levels of performance. Transformational leaders also focus on and care about followers and their personal needs and development.<ref name=\":1\" /> Transformational leaders fit well in leading and working with complex work groups and organizations, where beyond seeking an inspirational leader to help guide them through an uncertain environment, followers are also challenged and feel empowered; this nurtures them into becoming loyal, high performers.\n\nThere are 4 components to transformational leadership, sometimes referred to as the 4 I's:\n* '''Idealized Influence (II)''' \u2013 the leader serves as an ideal role model for followers; the leader \"walks the talk,\" and is admired for this. A transformational leader embodies the qualities that he/she wants in his/her team. In this case, the followers see the leader as a model to emulate. For the followers, it is easy to believe and trust in a transformational leader.  \n* '''Inspirational Motivation (IM)''' \u2013 Transformational leaders have the ability to inspire and motivate followers through having a vision and presenting that vision. Combined, these first two I's are what constitute the transformational leader's charisma. A transformational leader manages to inspire the followers easily with clarity. The transformational leader convinces the followers with simple and easy-to-understand words, as well as with their own image.\n* '''Individualized Consideration (IC)''' \u2013 Transformational leaders demonstrate genuine concern for the needs and feelings of followers and help them self-actualize. This personal attention to each follower assists in developing trust among the organization's members and their authority figure(s). For example, the transformational leader can point out the problems of a  member working in a group. From this perspective, the leader can work towards training and developing a follower who is having difficulties in a job. This is an important element because teams are able to rely on and work together, so decisions can be made more quickly, while the transformational leader increases their buy-in.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smirl |first1=Paul |title=Becoming a Transformational Leader |url=https://wsb.wisc.edu/programs-degrees/mba/blog/2018/08/23/becoming-a-transformational-leader |website=Wisconsin School of Business |accessdate=November 22, 2018}}</ref>\n* '''Intellectual Stimulation (IS)''' \u2013 the leader challenges followers to be innovative and creative, they encourage their followers to challenge the status quo. A common misunderstanding is that transformational leaders are \"soft,\" but the truth is that they constantly challenge followers to higher levels of performance.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|last1=Riggio|first1=Ronald E.|title=Are You a Transformational Leader?|date=2009-03-24|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cutting-edge-leadership/200903/are-you-transformational-leader|website=Psychology Today}}</ref>\nTransformational leadership is said to have occurred when engagement in a group results in leaders and followers raising one another to increased levels of motivation and morality.<ref name=\":0\" />  It is not enough to make the correct choice, but to make the moral choice. In simple words, a transformational leader is not selfish and sees an opportunity of growth in others. Transformational leadership enhances intellectual stimulation through employee training and development.\n\nTransformational leaders do one thing tranactional leaders don't, which is going beyond self-actualization. The importance of transcending self-interests is something lost sight of by those who see that the ultimate in maturity of development is self-actualization. Bass. (1999).\n\n== Characteristics==\n\nFive major [[personality traits]] have been identified as factors contributing to the likelihood of an individual displaying the characteristics of a transformational leader. Different emphasis on different elements of these traits point to inclination in personality to inspirational leadership, [[transactional leadership]], and transformational leadership. These five traits are as follows.<ref name=\"Bono\">{{cite journal | last1 = Joyce | first1 = E. | last2 = Judge | first2 = Timothy A. | year = 2004 | title = Personality and Transformational and Transactional Leadership: A Meta-Analysis | journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | volume = 89 | issue = 5| pages = 901\u2013910 | doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.5.901 | pmid=15506869| citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.7909 }}</ref>\n[[File:\ud2b9\uc9d51.jpg|thumb|right|490px|Results of Meta Analysis finding correlation between personality traits and transformational leadership from data gathered by Joyce Bono and Timothy Judge.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>]]\n\n=== Extraversion ===\nThe two main characteristics of extraverts are [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]] and [[Agency (sociology)|agency]],<ref name=\"Bono\"/> which relate to the social and leadership aspects of their personality, respectively. Extraversion is generally seen as an inspirational trait usually exhibited in transformational leadership.\n\n=== Neuroticism ===\n[[Neuroticism]] generally gives an individual an anxiety related to productivity which, in a group setting can be debilitating to a degree where they are unlikely to position themselves in a role of transformational leadership due to lower self-esteem and a tendency to shirk from leadership responsibilities.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>\n\n=== Openness to experience ===\nCreative expression and emotional responsiveness have been linked to a general tendency of openness to experience.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is also seen as a component of transformational leadership as it relates to the ability to give big-picture visionary leadership for an [[organization]].\n\n=== Agreeableness ===\nAlthough not a trait which specifically points to transformational leadership, leaders in general possess an agreeable nature stemming from a natural concern for others and high levels of individual consideration.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> [[Charisma]] and idealized influence is a classic ability of individuals who possess agreeability.<ref name=\"Bono\"/>\n\n=== Conscientiousness ===\nStrong sense of direction and the ability to put large amounts of productive work into tasks is the by-product of [[conscientious]] leaders.<ref name=\"Bono\"/> This trait is more linked to a transactional form of leadership given the management-based abilities of such individuals and the detail oriented nature of their personality. Results suggest that transformational leaders might give greater importance to values pertaining to others than to values concerning only themselves.<ref name=\"Krishnan\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Krishnan | first1 = Venkat | year = 2001 | title = Value Systems of Transformational Leaders | journal = Leadership & Organization Development Journal | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 126\u2013132 | doi = 10.1108/01437730110389274}}</ref>\n\n\nStudies have shown that subordinates' and leaders' ratings of transformational leadership may not converge. According to leaders' self\u2010ratings, the extraverted, intuitive and perceiving preferences favour transformational leadership. On the contrary, subordinates' ratings indicated that leaders with sensing preference are associated with transformational leadership.<ref name=\"Hautala\">{{cite journal  | last1 = Hautala | first1 = T. | year = 2006 | title = The relationship between personality and transformational leadership | journal = Journal of Management Development | volume = 25 | issue = 8| pages = 777\u2013794 | doi = 10.1108/02621710610684259}}</ref>\n\n== Measurement ==\nOne of the ways in which transformational leadership is measured is through use of the [[Multifactor leadership questionnaire|Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire]] (MLQ), a survey which identifies different leadership characteristics based on examples and provides a basis for leadership training.  Early development was limited because the knowledge in this area was primitive, and as such, finding good examples for the items in the questionnaire was difficult.  Subsequent development on the MLQ led to the current version of the survey, the MLQ5X.\n\nThe current version of the MLQ5X includes 36 items that are broken down into 9 scales with 4 items measuring each scale. Subsequent validation work by [[John Antonakis]] and his colleagues provided strong evidence supporting the validity and reliability of the MLQ5X.<ref name=\"Antonakis\">{{cite journal | last1 = Antonakis | first1 = J. | last2 = Avolio | first2 = B.

Although other researchers have still been critical of the MLQ model, since 2003 no one has been able to provide dis-confirming evidence of the theorized nine-factor model with such large sample sizes as those published by Antonakis.\n\nIn regards to transformational leadership, the first 5 components \u2013 Idealized Attributes, Idealized Behaviors, Inspirational Motivation, Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration \u2013 are considered to be transformational leadership behaviors.\n\n== Effectiveness as compared to other leadership styles ==\nStudies have shown that transformational leadership styles are associated with positive outcomes in relation to other leadership styles.  It is suggested that transformational leadership augments transactional in predicating effects on follower satisfaction and performance.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bass, Riggio |first1=Bernard, Ronald |title=Transformational Leadership |date=2006 |publisher=Psychology Press |location=New York |pages=10 |edition=Second }}</ref> According to studies performed by Lowe, Kroeck, and Sivasubramaniam, charisma (or Idealized Influence) was found to be a variable that was most strongly related to leader effectiveness among MLQ scales.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1048-9843(96)90027-2|url=https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/K_Lowe_Effectiveness_1996.pdf|title=Effectiveness correlates of transformational and transactional leadership: A meta-analytic review of the MLQ literature|journal=The Leadership Quarterly|volume=7|issue=3|pages=385\u2013425|year=1996|last1=Lowe|first1=Kevin B.|last2=Kroeck|first2=K.Galen|last3=Sivasubramaniam|first3=Nagaraj}}</ref>  Other studies show that transformational leadership is positively associated with employee outcomes including commitment, role clarity, and well-being.<ref name=\":3\"/> However, the effectiveness of transformational leadership varies by the situational contexts. For example, it can be more effective when applied to smaller, privately held firms than complex organizations based on its outreach effect with members of the organization.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ling |first1=Y |last2=Simseck |first2=Z |last3=Lubatkin |first3=M.H. |last4=Veiga |first4=J.F. |title=The impact of transformational CEOs on the performance of small- to medium-sized firms: Does organizational context matter?  |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |date=2008 |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=923\u201334 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.93.4.923 |pmid=18642995 }}</ref> However, we can conclude that transformational leadership has a positive effect on organizational effectiveness. This is because transformational leaders can encourage and facilitate change in their subordinates and encourage their development and creativity. <ref>Chi, H., Lan, C. and Dorigotov, B.

According to Burns, the transforming approach creates significant change\nin the life of people and organizations.

Openness to experience allows the leader to be more accepting of novel ideas and thus more likely to stimulate the follower intellectually. Conscientious leaders are achievement oriented and thus more likely to motivate their followers to achieve organizational goals. Extraverted and agreeable individuals are more outgoing and pleasant, respectively, and more likely to have successful interpersonal relationships. Thus, they are more likely to influence their followers and to be considerate towards them. Emotionally stable leaders would be better able to influence their followers because their stability would enable them to be better role models to followers and to thoroughly engage them in the goal fulfillment process.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|url = http://www.regent.edu/acad/global/publications/ijls/new/vol6iss3/7_Edited_Phipps%20Big5_pp430_447_jmDF.pdf|title = THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONALITY FACTORS ON TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP: EXPLORING THE MODERATING ROLE OF POLITICAL SKILL|last = Phipps|first = Simone T.A.|date = 2011|journal = International Journal of Leadership Studies|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nA specific example of cultural background affecting the effectiveness of transformational leadership would be Indian culture, where a nurturant-task style of leadership has been shown to be an effective leadership style. Singh and Bhandarker (1990) demonstrated that effective transformational leaders in India are likes heads of Indian families taking personal interest in the welfare of their followers. Leaders in Indian organizations are therefore more likely to exhibit transformational behaviors if their followers are more self-effacing in approaching the leaders. It is also hypothesized in general that subordinates\u2019 being socialized to be less assertive, self-confident, and independent would enhance superiors\u2019 exhibition of transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://rkvenkat.org/varun.pdf|title = Impact of Socialization on Transformational Leadership: Role of Leader Member Exchange|last = Gupta|first = Varun|date = July\u2013September 2004|journal = South Asian Journal of Management|access-date = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nFollower characteristics, combined with their perceptions of the leader and their own situation, did appear to moderate the connection between transformational leadership and subordinates\u2019 willingness to take charge and be good organizational citizens. For instance, if subordinates in a work group perceive their leader to be prototypical of them, then transformational leadership would have less of an impact on their willingness to engage in organizational citizenship behaviors. Likewise, if subordinates are goal oriented and possess a traditional view of the organizational hierarchy, they tend to be less affected by transformational leadership. Self-motivated employees are less likely to need transformational leaders to prod them into action, while \u201ctraditionalists\u201d tend to see positive organizational citizenship as something expected given their roles as followers\u2014not something they need to be \u201cinspired\u201d to do.\n\nEvidence suggests that the above sets of factors act, in essence, as both inhibitors of and substitutes for transformational leadership. As inhibitors, the presence of any of these factors\u2014either independently or especially collectively\u2014could make the presence of a transformational leader \u201credundant\u201d since followers\u2019 positive behavior would instead be sparked by their own motivations or perceptions. On the other hand, when these factors are not present (e.g., employees in a work group do not see their leader as \u201cone of us\u201d), then transformational leadership is likely to have a much greater impact on subordinates. In essence, when such \u201cfavorable conditions\u201d are not present, managers\u2014and the organizations they work for\u2014should see a better return on investment from transformational leadership.<ref>{{Cite journal|date = 2013|journal = Academy of Management Perspectives|doi = 10.5465/amp.2013.0064|pmid =|volume=27|issue = 2|last1 = Wyld|first1 = David|title = Transformation Leadership: When is It Redundant?}}</ref>\n\nIt was shown that leader continuity enhanced the effect of transformational leadership on role clarity and commitment, indicating that it takes time before transformational leaders actually have an effect on employees.

It is not necessarily about cost structure, but about finding new ways to grow. Models need to be produced to help leaders create the future. Kent Thirty, CEO of DaVita, chose the name DaVita, Italian for \u201cgiving life,\u201d and settled on a list of core values that included\nservice excellence, teamwork, accountability, and fun. A transformational leader inspires and follows the employee's self-interests, while a transactional leader manages and reinforces generally without employee consideration. Aligning the organization into transformational leaders by committing, being involved, and developing with the employees will lead to higher job satisfaction and motivation.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bass|title=Two Decades of Research and Development in Transformational Leadership|journal=European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology|volume=8|pages=9\u201332|doi=10.1080/135943299398410|url=http://techtied.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/bass_transforrmational_leadership.pdf|year=1999}}</ref> \n\nWhen transformational leadership was used in a nursing environment, researchers found that it led to an increase in organizational commitment.<ref name=b1/> A separate study examined that way that transformational leadership and transactional leadership compare when implemented into an online class.<ref name=\"Kahai\" /> The results of this study indicate that transformational leadership increases cognitive effort while transactional leadership decreases it.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Nelson Mandela===\nNelson Mandela used transformational leadership principles while working to abolish apartheid and enforce change in South Africa.  In 1995, he visited [[Betsie Verwoerd]], the widow of the architect of apartheid Hendrik Verwoerd, at her home in Orania.  Orania was an Afrikaner homeland and a striking anachronistic symbol of racial separation, and Mandela's recurring emphasis on forgiveness contributed toward the healing the prejudices of South Africa and as vast influence as a leader.  In 2000, he was quoted as saying, \"For all people who have found themselves in the position of being in jail and trying to transform society, forgiveness is natural because you have no time to be retaliative.\"<ref name=\"schoemaker\">Schoemaker, Paul (2013-12-05). [https://www.inc.com/paul-schoemaker/what-made-mandela-a-transformational-leader.html \"Nelson Mandela, Transformational Leader.\"] Inc.com.</ref> This illustrates a common approach in the narratives of transformational leadership, of describing a collective or corporate effort in individualised terms, and pointing to the responsibility or opportunity for individuals to commit to making the effort a success. Such an approach is seen in [[Community organizing|community organising]].\n\nHe also set an example for others to follow in terms of sacrifice and philanthropy.  Schoemaker describes one such instance:\n{{Quote|text=\"One such leader received a call from Mandela's office requesting that he accompany the President to the Eastern Cape.  This leader was less than enthusiastic and pleaded that he had an appointment around mid-day clashing with Mandela's request.  But there was no denying Mandela, so the leader agreed to go\u2014but first consulted with his financial director to set a reasonable limit on the size of the anticipated donation request.  They settled on 500,000 Rand, or about $50,000 in those days...upon landing, about 80,000 black school children\u2014all adorned in crisp white shirts\u2014simultaneously bowed to acknowledge the great man's arrival.  As they were climbing down from the helicopter, Mandela planted his hand firmly in his guest's back and said, 'Now, I hope you are not going to disappoint me?' The business leader decided in that instance to double the donation...how could he tell a man who sacrificed as much as Mandela that he couldn't afford to be more generous?\"}}\n\n=== Other Contexts ===\nTransformational leadership studies have been conducted in a variety of contexts including military,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kane|first=Thomas D.|last2=Tremble|first2=Trueman R.|title=Transformational leadership effects at different levels of the Army.|journal=Military Psychology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=137\u2013160|doi=10.1207/s15327876mp1202_4|year=2000}}</ref> education,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koh|first=William L.|last2=Steers|first2=Richard M.|last3=Terborg|first3=James R.|date=1995-07-01|title=The effects of transformational leadership on teacher attitudes and student performance in Singapore|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=16|issue=4|pages=319\u2013333|doi=10.1002/job.4030160404}}</ref> higher education teaching,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balwant|first=Paul T.|date=2016-02-01|title=Transformational Instructor-Leadership in Higher Education Teaching: A Meta-Analytic Review and Research Agenda|journal=Journal of Leadership Studies|volume=9|issue=4|pages=20\u201342|doi=10.1002/jls.21423}}</ref> business,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gang Wang|last2=Wang|first2=Gang|last3=Oh|first3=In-Sue|last4=Courtright|first4=Stephen H.|last5=Colbert|first5=Amy E.|date=2011-03-15|title=Transformational Leadership and Performance Across Criteria and Levels: A Meta-Analytic Review of 25 Years of Research|journal=Group & Organization Management|volume=36|issue=2|pages=223\u2013270|doi=10.1177/1059601111401017}}</ref> and temporary settings (e.g., project teams in corporate and education).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tyssen|first=Ana K.|last2=Wald|first2=Andreas|last3=Heidenreich|first3=Sven|date=2014|title=Leadership in the context of temporary organizations: A study on the effects of transactional and transformational leadership on followers' commitment in projects|journal=Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies|volume=21|issue=4|pages=376\u2013393|doi=10.1177/1548051813502086}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balwant|first=Paul T.|date=2019|title=Stay close!

The academic community is a front-runner in this sense of redefining transformational leadership to suit these changes in job definition.\n\nThe future of transformational leadership is also related to [[political globalization]] and a more homogenous spectrum of economic systems under which organizations find themselves operating. Cultural and geographical dimensions of transformational leadership become blurred as globalization renders ethnically specific collectivist and individualistic effects of organizational behavior obsolete in a more diversified workplace.\n\nThe concept of transformational leadership further needs clarification, especially when a leader is declared as a transformational or transactional leader. While discussing Jinnah's leadership style, Yousaf (2015) argued that it is not the number of followers, but the nature of the change that indicates whether a leader is transformational or transactional.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yousaf|first=Nadeem|date=2015-01-01|title=Salient features of Jinnah's politics|journal=International Journal of Public Leadership|volume=11|issue=1|pages=46\u201364|doi=10.1108/IJPL-07-2014-0007|issn=2056-4929}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Leadership]]\n", "name_user": "149.200.202.240", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_leadership"}
