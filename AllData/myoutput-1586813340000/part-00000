submitted to [[Cao Cao]], the ruler of the Wei Kingdom, surrendering his state in exchange for gaining state religion status for Tianshi Daoism. Zhang was given a title and land, as were several other family members and generals.  His daughter was married to Cao Cao\u2019s son, [[Cao Yu (playwright)|Cao Yu]].  His followers were forced to resettle in other parts of China, with one group being sent to the [[Chang'an]] area, and another being sent to [[Luoyang]]. Zhang relocated to the Han court until the Han Dynasty changed to the [[Cao Wei|Wei]]. He then used his own popularity as a religious leader to lend legitimacy to the Wei, proclaiming that the Wei court had inherited divine authority from the Tao church, as well as from Confucian laws.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\nThe collapse of the Wei Kingdom in 260 CE, along with the fall of Northern China to the Huns in 317, further scattered adherents to the Celestial Master.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 150.</ref> The Celestial Masters later reemerged in the 4th and 5th centuries as two distinct offshoots, the Northern and Southern Celestial Masters.\n\nCelestial Masters had prophecy rituals banned since what happens in the future it was supposed to be just known already by the member without rituals.<ref name=\"LagerweyL\u00fc2009 47\">{{cite book|author1=John Lagerwey|author2=Pengzhi L\u00fc|title=Early Chinese Religion: The Period of Division (220-589 Ad)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2nWdWbN3MQC&pg=PA370#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=30 October 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-17585-7|pages=370\u2013}}</ref>\n\nFor the water, earth, and heaven officials, Celestial Masters wrote the \u4e09\u5b98\u624b\u66f8 sanguan shoushu.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Chinese Religion I (2 vol.set): Song-Liao-Jin-Yuan (960-1368 AD)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DiBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA986#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=8 December 2014|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-27164-7|pages=986\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===The Southern Celestial Masters===\nAfter the fall of [[Luoyang]] to non-Chinese invaders in 311, the remnants of the court fled to Jiankang (modern-day [[Nanjing]]) and established a new state known as the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Eastern Jin]] dynasty. Among the court members who fled were members of the Celestial Masters. There is also evidence that after Zhang Lu\u2019s submission to Cao Cao, numerous adherents fled south from Sichuan. These various followers of The Way of the Celestial Master coalesced to form a distinct form of Celestial Master Daoism known as the Southern Celestial Masters. The Southern Celestial Masters lasted as a distinct movement into the fifth century.\n\n===The Northern Celestial Masters===\n{{Main|The Northern Celestial Masters}}\n[[Kou Qianzhi]], who was raised in a Celestial Master family, received two visions of Laozi in 415 and in 423. In 424, he brought the work that resulted from these visions to the court of the [[Northern Wei]] dynasty. The rulers put his works into practice, and Kou became the Celestial Master of the Daoist theocracy of the Northern Wei. After Kou died in 448, the prime minister, [[Cui Hao]], became power hungry and began to insult the Wei rulers. Unhappy with his insubordination, the rulers had Cui executed in 450, and ended the Daoist theocracy.\n\n===The Celestial Masters today===\n{{Main|Zhengyi Dao}}\nDuring the Yuan Dynasty, the [[Zhengyi Dao]] School of Daoism claimed lineage to the Celestial Masters.  They became one of the two leading schools of Daoism in China, along with [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Dao]].

In 1949, after the communists gained power in the mainland, the 64th Celestial Master, [[Zhang Enpu]], fled to [[Taiwan]].<ref>\"[http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/arts---leisure/2008/12/15/187654/Who%E2%80%99s-going.htm Who\u2019s going to be the 65th Taoist pope?],\" ''The China Post'', December 15, 2008.</ref> After his death, a succession dispute arose between different branches of the family in Taiwan and mainland China.\n\nIn fact, the Way of the Celestial Masters have flourished during the reign of Communism.  They regularly ordain priests at the Zhengyi Monastery at the Celestial Master\u2019s Mansion in Mainland China.\n\n==Beliefs and practices==\n[[Image:Zhang Daoling.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master]]\nEach of the three different eras of the Celestial Masters had distinct beliefs. However, because the Southern and Northern Celestial Masters both descended directly from the initial movement founded by Zhang Daoling, there are many beliefs that are shared. A number of texts exist that give insight into early Celestial Master practice, in particular the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' and the ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the Laozi.\n\nThe foundation of Daoist belief is that there is an energy source known as [[qi]] that pervades all things. The human body also contains qi, but it only has a limited amount of qi. Qi could be lost from the body through things such as sweating and ejaculation. The Celestial Masters shared these foundational Daoist beliefs, but modified them slightly.\n\nOne such change was that illness was caused by [[sin]]. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring that the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and [[kowtow]]ing to heaven. Illness could also be cured in other ways as well, among them using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.\n\nSexual practices (known as [[heqi]], or 'The Union of the Breaths') were not part of Celestial Master Daoism. While the School of the Naturalists (and offshoot schools) advocate not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain,' the Celestial Masters frowned upon this, and simply advocated celibacy as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the macrobiotic method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 83.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\nThe Celestial Masters were the first group of organized Daoists. Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] movements.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Xiang'er]]\n*[[Zhang Daoling]]\n*[[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Bokenkamp, Stephen.

Among the court members who fled were members of the Celestial Masters. There is also evidence that after Zhang Lu\u2019s submission to Cao Cao, numerous adherents fled south from Sichuan.

They regularly ordain priests at the Zhengyi Monastery at the Celestial Master\u2019s Mansion in Mainland China.\n\n==Beliefs and practices==\n[[Image:Zhang Daoling.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Zhang Daoling, the first Celestial Master]]\nEach of the three different eras of the Celestial Masters had distinct beliefs. However, because the Southern and Northern Celestial Masters both descended directly from the initial movement founded by Zhang Daoling, there are many beliefs that are shared. A number of texts exist that give insight into early Celestial Master practice, in particular the ''[[Taiping Jing]]'' and the ''[[Xiang'er]]'' commentary to the Laozi.\n\nThe foundation of Daoist belief is that there is an energy source known as [[qi]] that pervades all things. The human body also contains qi, but it only has a limited amount of qi. Qi could be lost from the body through things such as sweating and ejaculation. The Celestial Masters shared these foundational Daoist beliefs, but modified them slightly.\n\nOne such change was that illness was caused by [[sin]]. This was because sin caused qi to leave the body. In order to cure any illness, repentance was a crucial factor in ensuring that the loss of qi could be staunched. Repentance could be accomplished by spending time in a 'Chamber of Silence,' and reflecting on one's sins, or by beating one's breasts and [[kowtow]]ing to heaven. Illness could also be cured in other ways as well, among them using medicinal herbs and by listening to ritual music. Eating very little was also of extreme importance, and an ideal diet would consist of no food at all, but only noncorporeal things such as air, which the person could absorb through meditation.\n\nSexual practices (known as [[heqi]], or 'The Union of the Breaths') were not part of Celestial Master Daoism. While the School of the Naturalists (and offshoot schools) advocate not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain,' the Celestial Masters frowned upon this, and simply advocated celibacy as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the macrobiotic method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced.<ref>Bokenkamp (1997), p. 83.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\n\nThe Celestial Masters were the first group of organized Daoists. Before their foundation, Daoism did not exist as an organized religion. Being the first organized religious Daoists, the Celestial Masters are the ancestors of subsequent Daoist movements such as the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] movements.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Xiang'er]]\n*[[Zhang Daoling]]\n*[[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Bokenkamp, Stephen.
