Flow Attacks take the place of Normal Attacks from previous games, and in place of Charge Attacks are Trigger Attacks, which are performed by pressing the right trigger button and any face button.  Trigger attacks allows the player to stun an opponent, knock down an opponent, or send them airborne; each player also has a unique fourth reactive attack, known as a Special Attack, that has a longer cooldown before they may be used. Trigger Attacks may be followed up by a Flow Attack combo, which can, in turn, combo into another Trigger Attack.  Additionally, the player have access to a Reactive Attack, used whenever the player presses the right button when prompted to do so; this attack allows the player to charge into enemies, counter enemy attacks, or finish off weakened enemies. Musou Attacks return from previous games, and their mechanics are identical to ''Dynasty Warriors'' series games prior to ''Dynasty Warriors 6''. The player also have access to an airborne Musou Attack, which depletes only a small portion of the Musou gauge. New to ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' is the Stamina Gauge, a gauge that gradually replenishes until full. The stamina gauge is depleted upon double jumping, wall jumping, or in other selectable circumstances.\n\nCharacters will automatically draw their weapons when close to an enemy, or put away their weapons when they are no longer near them; however, the player may manually draw or withdraw their weapon by pressing on the left analog stick. Some actions, such as initiating conversations in towns and villages, may only be done when their weapons are not drawn. When a character does not have their weapon drawn, the player may also crouch and sneak behind groups of enemies.\n\nAll characters also have access to a bow, which they may access by pressing down on the directional pad. The player may acquire different types of ammunition over the course of the game, which may be selected by pressing left and right on the directional pad and fired by pressing the flow attack button.  These come into play when sneaking into enemies, hunting wildlife, or initiating specialized attacks.\n\nHorses return from previous games; the player may buy horses and ride them to level up their attributes.  While on a horse, the player may have the horse automatically take them to the next recommended destination by pressing the left trigger button, or make their horse sprint by pressing the right shoulder button. Like characters, horses have their own stamina gauge, which depletes when sprinting but replenishes when they are not.\n\nAll 83 characters from ''[[Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires]]'' returned. New characters also were introduced, one of whom made his first appearance in the spin-off ''[[Warriors All-Stars]]''.<ref name=\"FamInt\" /><ref name=\"Gematsu\" /> Other than playable characters, there are four [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) who have unique designs but wield generic weapons common to other NPCs.<ref>{{cite web | author=Sato | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/01/26/dynasty-warriors-9-details-unique-npcs-xiahou-ji-dong-bai-hua-xiong-yuan-shu/ | title=Dynasty Warriors 9 Details Its Unique NPCs Xiahou Ji, Dong Bai, Hua Xiong, And Yuan Shu | work=[[Siliconera]] | date=January 26, 2018 | accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== Story mode ===\nStory Mode in ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' retells the story of ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' in a series of 13 chapters, from the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] to the [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|fall of Shu]] in the final chapter. Each playable character has a story set within a subset of these chapters, corresponding roughly to the time in history where they were historically relevant; no character has a story that spans the full 13 chapters, and some characters will have longer stories than others. Each character has their own individual ending, roughly corresponding to their historical death or the point in which they were no longer historically relevant.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player may only select the patriarchs of the three kingdoms: [[Liu Bei]], [[Cao Cao]], and [[Sun Jian]]; additional characters are unlocked for the most part by completing the first chapter a character is playable in with a different character. The progression of each character in their own story is kept separately, allowing the player to switch between different characters at any time. All characters share a common pool of acquired weapons, items, and map knowledge, but must be leveled separately.\n\n=== Free Mode ===\nFree Mode in ''Dynasty Warriors 9'', unlocked once the story of any character is complete, allows the player to play as any character in any chapter that has been previously completed by any character, without regard to historical context. The player may only have either a Story Mode save or a Free Mode save for a particular character; if a character has a Free Mode save, they must replay their Story Mode from the beginning if a new Story Mode game is started with that character.\n\n== Development ==\nIn an interview with ''[[Famitsu]]'' in May 2016, Omega Force brand manager [[Kenichi Ogasawara]] commented that \"the evolution from ''[[Dynasty Warriors 7]]'' to ''[[Dynasty Warriors 8|8]]'' was insufficient\", and hoped that the announcement of their next game in the series would \"have a great impact\".<ref>{{cite web | last=Ramsey | first=Robert | title=Dynasty Warriors 9 Announcement will 'Have a Greater Impact than You Can Imagine' | work=[[Push Square]] | date=May 18, 2016 | accessdate=December 18, 2016 | url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2016/05/dynasty_warriors_9_announcement_will_have_a_greater_impact_than_you_can_imagine}}</ref>\n\nThe game was revealed later in the year in December during a \"Greatest Games Lineup in History\" broadcast, with Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Asia (SCEJA) president Atsushi Morita introducing the title; Koei Tecmo's western branches followed and announced the game alongside Japan.

For the first time in the series, ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' featured an [[open world]] environment, allowing players to enter and exit towns and freely explore the map of mainland China with considerable differences in elevation. A ''Famitsu'' interview with Koei Tecmo's Masaki Furusawa and Akihiro Suzuki revealed that all 83 characters that appeared in ''Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires'' would appear in the game. [[Zhou Cang]] was announced as one of the new playable characters, having appeared prior in ''Musou Stars''.<ref name=\"Gematsu\">{{cite web | last=Romano | first=Sal | title=Dynasty Warriors 9 announced | work=Gematsu | date=December 17, 2016 | accessdate=December 18, 2016 | url=http://gematsu.com/2016/12/dynasty-warriors-9-announced}}</ref> The combat system, which in previous games relied on players linking together combos by pressing two alternate buttons designated to light and heavy attacks, was overhauled.<ref>{{cite web | last=Glagowski | first=Peter | title=Dynasty Warriors 9 is coming and it sounds epic | work=[[Destructoid]] | date=December 17, 2016 | accessdate=December 18, 2016 | url=https://www.destructoid.com/dynasty-warriors-9-is-coming-and-it-sounds-epic-405530.phtml}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2017, Koei Tecmo declared that the game was scheduled to be released in early 2018.
