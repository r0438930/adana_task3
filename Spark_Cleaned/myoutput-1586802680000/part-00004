In the game, the player controls a [[submarine]] via a set of touch-screen based levers and wheels. The game was released in 2011, and was followed up by a [[free-to-play]] sequel in 2014, titled ''[[#Steel Diver: Sub Wars|Steel Diver: Sub Wars]]''.\n\n==Story==\nIn the year 19XX, a 'power-hungry rogue nation' invaded several nearby countries. A secret organization known as the 'Steel Divers' was formed from various countries' navies to combat this threat. The Steel Divers travel through various areas including [[Arctic]] and [[jungle]] settings and are eventually tasked with destroying the enemy stronghold.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Steel Diver'' consists of 3 main modes: ''Missions'', ''Periscope Strike'', and ''Steel Commander''. ''Missions'' is further broken down into 2 modes: ''Campaign'' and ''Time Trials''. The main gameplay occurs during ''Campaign''. In ''Campaign'', the player uses sliders and dials on the touchscreen to manoeuver a submarine through side-scrolling levels displayed on the top screen, sinking enemy submarines, [[battleship]]s and avoiding [[naval mine]]s and [[depth charge]]s as required. There are seven missions available, playable with different subs and difficulty modes, which usually involve goals such as eliminating enemy fleets or infiltrating enemy bases by reaching the goal in a time limit. ''Time Trials'' features the same gameplay style and controls, however the levels are shorter and are not connected to the story, instead being solely to achieve a fast time through a complex path. ''Periscope Strike'' mode is played after every successful mission or can also be played separately, or as part of ''Steel Commander''. This mode sees the player moving the system to rotate a [[periscope]] to fire torpedoes at enemy ships. ''Steel Commander'' is playable against the CPU or a human opponent via Download Play. It is a strategy game in which the two players command a fleet of battleships and submarines and try to sink each other's fleet.<ref name=\"Steel Diver Official Site (AU)\">{{cite web|title=Steel Diver|url=http://gamesites.nintendo.com.au/steel-diver/en_AU/index.php|publisher=Nintendo Australia Pty.
