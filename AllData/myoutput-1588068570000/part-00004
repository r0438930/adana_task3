He ascended the throne on the death of his grandfather, [[King Gustaf VI Adolf]], on 15 September 1973.\n\nHe is the youngest child and only son of [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten]], and [[Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. His father died on 26 January 1947 [[1947 KLM Douglas DC-3 Copenhagen disaster|in an airplane crash]] in Denmark when Carl Gustaf was nine months old. Upon his father's death, he became second in line to the throne, after his grandfather, the then Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf. Following the death of his great-grandfather [[King Gustaf V]] in 1950, Gustaf Adolf ascended the throne and thus Carl Gustaf became Sweden's new crown prince and [[heir apparent]] to the throne at the age of four.\n\nA short while after he became king in 1973, the new [[1974 Instrument of Government]] took effect, formally stripping Carl XVI Gustaf of even a nominal role in governmental affairs. As a result, he no longer performs many of the duties normally accorded to a [[head of state]], such as the formal appointment of the prime minister, signing off on legislation, and being [[commander-in-chief]] of the nation's military. The new instrument explicitly limits the king to ceremonial functions and, among other things, to be regularly informed of affairs of state. As head of the [[House of Bernadotte]] Carl Gustaf has also been able to make a number of decisions about the titles and positions of its members.\n\nThe king's heir apparent, after passage on 1 January 1980 of a new law establishing [[absolute primogeniture]] (the first such law passed in Western European history<ref>[https://sweden.se/society/the-swedish-monarchy/ Article] by the [[Swedish Institute]] 2018-06-15</ref>), is [[Crown Princess Victoria]], the eldest child of the King and his wife, [[Queen Silvia]]. Before the passage of that law, Crown Princess Victoria's younger brother, [[Prince Carl Philip]], was briefly the heir apparent, as of his birth in May 1979.\n\nCarl XVI Gustaf is the longest-reigning monarch in Swedish history, having surpassed King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus IV]]'s reign of 44 years and 222 days on 26 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20180426/king-carl-xvi-gustaf-now-swedens-longest-reigning-monarch |title=King Carl XVI Gustaf now Sweden's longest-reigning monarch |date=26 April 2018 |publisher= |accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCarl Gustaf was born on 30 April 1946 at 10:20<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Erik |editor-last=Rudberg |title=Svenska dagbladets \u00e5rsbok 1946 |year=1947 |publisher=Svenska Dagbladet |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|283647}} |page=43}}</ref> in [[Haga Palace]] in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], [[Stockholm County]].

After graduating from [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] in 1966, Carl Gustaf completed two-and-a-half years of education in the [[Swedish Army]], the [[Royal Swedish Navy]], and the [[Swedish Air Force]]. During the winter 1966-1967 he took part in a round-the-world voyage with the mine-laying vessel ''[[\u00c4lvsnabben]]''. The Crown Prince received his commission as an officer in all three services in 1968, eventually rising to the rank of captain (in the army and air force) and lieutenant (in the navy), before his ascension to the throne.

Though the King was a near-autocrat on paper, the Riksdag's authority grew steadily into the early 20th century. \n\nThe new [[Constitution of Sweden|1974 Instrument of Government]] first took effect on 1 January 1975 and formally stripped the new king of most of his formal political powers, thus codifying actual practices dating from the definitive establishment of parliamentary government in 1917. The new document reduced the king a mostly representative and ceremonial role.  Previously, the King formally appointed the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]], though in practice he was almost always the leader of the majority party or coalition in the Riksdag.  Since the adoption of the current Instrument, a prospective prime minister is nominated by the [[Speaker of the Riksdag]], and if that candidate is elected by the Riksdag, the Speaker signs the commission ({{lang-sv|f\u00f6rordnande}}). Additionally, bills passed by the Riksdag do not need [[Royal assent]] to become law.\n\nHe is the foremost representative of Sweden and pays [[List of state visits made by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|state visits abroad]] and receives those to Sweden, he opens the annual session of the [[Riksdag]], chairs the Special Council held during a change of Government ({{lang-sv|skifteskonselj}}), holds regular Information Councils with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet ({{lang-sv|informationskonselj}}), chairs the meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council ({{lang-sv|Utrikesn\u00e4mnden}}), and receives [[Letters of Credence]] of foreign ambassadors to Sweden and signs those of Sweden to foreign nations.

Under the provisions of the [[Constitution of Sweden|Instrument of Government of 1974]], which became effective on 1 January 1975, the King no longer holds this constitutionally-mandated position, but he kept his ranks ''[[\u00e0 la suite]]'' since he no longer has any military command authority, except over [[His Majesty's Military Staff]].\n\nWorldwide, Carl XVI Gustaf is probably best known as the presenter of the [[Nobel Prize]]s each year; the first [[Nobel laureate]] who received the prize from his hands was [[Leo Esaki]].<ref>\u6c5f\u5d0e\u73b2\u65bc\u5948\u300e\u9650\u754c\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\u2015\u79c1\u306e\u5c65\u6b74\u66f8\u300f\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e\u51fa\u7248\u793e\uff092007\u5e74</ref> He also hands over the [[Polar Music Prize]].

Folke Hubertus; born 30 April 1946) is the reigning [[King of Sweden]]. He ascended the throne on the death of his grandfather, [[King Gustaf VI Adolf]], on 15 September 1973.\n\nHe is the youngest child and only son of [[Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten]], and [[Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. His father died on 26 January 1947 [[1947 KLM Douglas DC-3 Copenhagen disaster|in an airplane crash]] in Denmark when Carl Gustaf was nine months old. Upon his father's death, he became second in line to the throne, after his grandfather, the then Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf. Following the death of his great-grandfather [[King Gustaf V]] in 1950, Gustaf Adolf ascended the throne and thus Carl Gustaf became Sweden's new crown prince and [[heir apparent]] to the throne at the age of four.\n\nA short while after he became king in 1973, the new [[1974 Instrument of Government]] took effect, formally stripping Carl XVI Gustaf of even a nominal role in governmental affairs. As a result, he no longer performs many of the duties normally accorded to a [[head of state]], such as the formal appointment of the prime minister, signing off on legislation, and being [[commander-in-chief]] of the nation's military. The new instrument explicitly limits the king to ceremonial functions and, among other things, to be regularly informed of affairs of state. As head of the [[House of Bernadotte]] Carl Gustaf has also been able to make a number of decisions about the titles and positions of its members.\n\nThe king's heir apparent, after passage on 1 January 1980 of a new law establishing [[absolute primogeniture]] (the first such law passed in Western European history<ref>[https://sweden.se/society/the-swedish-monarchy/ Article] by the [[Swedish Institute]] 2018-06-15</ref>), is [[Crown Princess Victoria]], the eldest child of the King and his wife, [[Queen Silvia]]. Before the passage of that law, Crown Princess Victoria's younger brother, [[Prince Carl Philip]], was briefly the heir apparent, as of his birth in May 1979.\n\nCarl XVI Gustaf is the longest-reigning monarch in Swedish history, having surpassed King [[Magnus IV of Sweden|Magnus IV]]'s reign of 44 years and 222 days on 26 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thelocal.se/20180426/king-carl-xvi-gustaf-now-swedens-longest-reigning-monarch |title=King Carl XVI Gustaf now Sweden's longest-reigning monarch |date=26 April 2018 |publisher= |accessdate=29 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCarl Gustaf was born on 30 April 1946 at 10:20<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Erik |editor-last=Rudberg |title=Svenska dagbladets \u00e5rsbok 1946 |year=1947 |publisher=Svenska Dagbladet |location=Stockholm |language=Swedish |id={{LIBRIS|283647}} |page=43}}</ref> in [[Haga Palace]] in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], [[Stockholm County]].

During the winter 1966-1967 he took part in a round-the-world voyage with the mine-laying vessel ''[[\u00c4lvsnabben]]''. The Crown Prince received his commission as an officer in all three services in 1968, eventually rising to the rank of captain (in the army and air force) and lieutenant (in the navy), before his ascension to the throne.

Though the King was a near-autocrat on paper, the Riksdag's authority grew steadily into the early 20th century. \n\nThe new [[Constitution of Sweden|1974 Instrument of Government]] first took effect on 1 January 1975 and formally stripped the new king of most of his formal political powers, thus codifying actual practices dating from the definitive establishment of parliamentary government in 1917. The new document reduced the king a mostly representative and ceremonial role.  Previously, the King formally appointed the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]], though in practice he was almost always the leader of the majority party or coalition in the Riksdag.  Since the adoption of the current Instrument, a prospective prime minister is nominated by the [[Speaker of the Riksdag]], and if that candidate is elected by the Riksdag, the Speaker signs the commission ({{lang-sv|f\u00f6rordnande}}). Additionally, bills passed by the Riksdag do not need [[Royal assent]] to become law.\n\nHe is the foremost representative of Sweden and pays [[List of state visits made by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|state visits abroad]] and receives those to Sweden, he opens the annual session of the [[Riksdag]], chairs the Special Council held during a change of Government ({{lang-sv|skifteskonselj}}), holds regular Information Councils with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet ({{lang-sv|informationskonselj}}), chairs the meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council ({{lang-sv|Utrikesn\u00e4mnden}}), and receives [[Letters of Credence]] of foreign ambassadors to Sweden and signs those of Sweden to foreign nations.

Under the provisions of the [[Constitution of Sweden|Instrument of Government of 1974]], which became effective on 1 January 1975, the King no longer holds this constitutionally-mandated position, but he kept his ranks ''[[\u00e0 la suite]]'' since he no longer has any military command authority, except over [[His Majesty's Military Staff]].\n\nWorldwide, Carl XVI Gustaf is probably best known as the presenter of the [[Nobel Prize]]s each year; the first [[Nobel laureate]] who received the prize from his hands was [[Leo Esaki]].<ref>\u6c5f\u5d0e\u73b2\u65bc\u5948\u300e\u9650\u754c\u3078\u306e\u6311\u6226\u2015\u79c1\u306e\u5c65\u6b74\u66f8\u300f\uff08\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e\u51fa\u7248\u793e\uff092007\u5e74</ref> He also hands over the [[Polar Music Prize]].
