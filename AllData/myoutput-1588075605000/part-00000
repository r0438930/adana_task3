These adaptations produced Macanese variations of traditional Portuguese dishes including ''[[caldo verde]]'', [[minchee]], and ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]''. While many restaurants claim to serve traditional Portuguese or Macanese dishes, most serve a mix of Cantonese-Portuguese fusion cuisine. ''[[Galinha \u00e0 portuguesa]]'' is an example of a Chinese dish that draws from Macanese influences, but is not part of Macanese cuisine.<ref name=\"LongMacauFood\">{{harvnb|Long|2015|p=390}}.</ref> ''[[Cha chaan teng]]'', a type of fast casual diner originating in Hong Kong that serves that region's interpretation of Western food, are also prevalent in Macau.<ref>{{harvnb|Long|2015|p=391}}.</ref> ''[[Pastel de nata]]'', [[pork chop bun]]s, and [[almond biscuit]]s are popular street food items.<ref name=\"LongMacauFood\" />\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{main|Sport in Macau}}\n[[File:2008 Macau F3 GP.JPG|thumb|[[Formula Three]] racers in the 2008 [[Macau Grand Prix]]]]\n\nDespite its small area, Macau is home to a variety of sports and recreational facilities that have hosted a number of major international sporting events, including the [[2005 East Asian Games]], the [[2006 Lusophony Games]], and the [[2007 Asian Indoor Games]].\n\nThe territory regularly hosts the [[Macau Grand Prix]], one of the most significant annual motorsport competitions that uses city streets as the racetrack. It is the only [[street circuit]] that hosts [[Formula Three]], [[touring car]], and motorcycle races in the same event. The [[Guia Circuit]], with narrow corner clearance and a winding path, is considered an extremely challenging course and a serious milestone for prospective [[Formula One]] racers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=7 November 2013 |title=Macau Grand Prix: The final exam for racers |url=http://travel.cnn.com/macau-grand-prix-737446/ |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=27 February 2019 |df=dmy-all |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131107172825/http://travel.cnn.com/macau-grand-prix-737446/ |archive-date=7 November 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMacau represents itself separately from mainland China with its own sports teams in international competitions. The territory maintains its own [[Sports and Olympic Committee of Macau, China|National Olympic Committee]], but does not compete in the [[Olympic Games]]. Current [[International Olympic Committee]] rules specify that new NOCs can only be admitted if they represent sovereign states (Hong Kong has participated in the Olympics since before the regulation
