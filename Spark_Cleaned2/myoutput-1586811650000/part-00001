Preston was a top session keyboardist in the 1960s, during which he backed artists such as [[Little Richard]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Rev. James Cleveland]] and [[the Beatles]]. He went on to achieve fame as a solo artist, with hit singles such as \"[[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|That's the Way God Planned It]]\", the Grammy-winning \"[[Outa-Space]]\", \"[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]\", \"[[Space Race (Billy Preston song)|Space Race]]\", \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\" and \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\". Additionally, Preston co-wrote \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\", which became a number 5 hit for [[Joe Cocker]].\n\nPreston was one of five musicians<ref>{{Cite AV media notes | title=Revolver | title-link  = Revolver (Beatles album) | year =1966 | type = LP cover (back) | publisher = [[Parlophone Records]] | id = PCS7009 }} </ref> credited on a Beatles recording other than the group's four members.

With songs covering a broad spectrum of styles from country ('Born to Loose') to R&B ('Good News') to jazz ('God Bless The Child') with pop and blues undertones aplenty, ''16 Year Old Soul'' is a preserved-in-amber glimpse of an artist whose musical maturity belied his years.\"</ref> In 1965, he released the album ''[[The Most Exciting Organ Ever]]'' and performed on the rock and roll show ''[[Shindig!]]'' In 1967, he joined [[Ray Charles]]' band.{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=741}} Following this exposure, several musicians began asking Preston to contribute to their sessions.<ref name=nyt/>\n\n===Relationship with the Beatles===\nPreston first met [[the Beatles]] as a 16-year-old in 1962, while part of Little Richard's touring band, when their manager [[Brian Epstein]] organized a Liverpool show, at which the Beatles opened. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' explained their subsequent meeting:\n{{quote|They'd hook up again in 1969, when the Beatles were about to break up while recording the last album they released, ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' (they would later record ''[[Abbey Road]]'', which was released prior to ''Let It Be''). [[George Harrison]], a friend of Preston, had quit, walked out of the studio and gone to a Ray Charles concert in [[London]], where Preston was playing organ.

At one point during the [[Let It Be (Beatles album)#Recording and production|''Get Back'' sessions]], [[John Lennon]] proposed the idea of having him join the band (to which [[Paul McCartney]] countered that it was difficult enough reaching agreements with four).<ref>The Beatles - A/B Road: The Complete Get back Sessions, January 24th</ref> Preston played organ and electric piano for the Beatles during several of the ''Get Back'' sessions; some of these sessions appeared in the film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let it Be]]'' and on its companion album. Preston also accompanied the band on electric piano for [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|its rooftop concert]], the group's final public appearance.<ref name=\"WP Obit\"/> In April 1969, their single \"Get Back\" was credited to \"The Beatles with Billy Preston\", the only time such a joint credit had been given on an official Beatles-sanctioned release (as distinct from an unsanctioned reissue of some Hamburg-era recordings on which they were the backing group for [[Tony Sheridan]]). The credit was bestowed by the Beatles to reflect the extent of Preston's presence on the track; his electric piano is prominent throughout and he plays an extended solo. Preston also worked, in a more limited role, on the ''Abbey Road'' album, contributing organ to the tracks \"[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nIn 1978, he appeared as Sgt. Pepper in [[Robert Stigwood]]'s film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was based on the Beatles' [[Sgt.

His relationship with Harrison continued after the Beatles' break-up in 1970; Preston was the first artist to record Harrison's subsequent international hit \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", on his 1970 album ''[[Encouraging Words]]'', which Harrison co-produced with him. He appeared on several of Harrison's 1970s solo albums, starting with ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''; made a notable contribution to [[the Concert for Bangladesh]], the Harrison-organized 1971 charity benefit; performed with the ex-Beatle on his 1974 tour of [[North America]]; and played at the 2002 [[Concert for George]] tribute, held at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Preston also worked on solo releases by Lennon and [[Ringo Starr]].\n\nIn 1971, Preston left Apple and signed with [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]]. The previous year, he contributed to another hit single when [[Stephen Stills]] asked to use Preston's phrase \"if you can't be with the one you love, [[Love the One You're With|love the one you're with]]\", a song on Stills' [[Stephen Stills (album)|self-titled]] debut solo album.<ref>{{cite news|title=Song Stories: Love The One You're With|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/love-the-one-you-re-with-stephen-stills|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]'' on A&M, Preston's solo career peaked at this time, beginning with 1972's \"[[Outa-Space]]\", an [[instrumental]] track that further popularized the sound of the [[clavinet]] in [[funk]] music. The song reached number 2 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, before going on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]. \"Outa-Space\" sold over 1 million copies in America, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in June 1972.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/319 319, 334, and 349] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/319 }}</ref> Later that year, Preston contributed the title song to the hit [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Slaughter (1972 film)|Slaughter]]'' starring [[Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|url=|first=John|last=Tobler|title=[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]/[[Music Is My Life]]|others=Billy Preston|pp=4, 6|year=2011|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[BGO Records]]|id=}}</ref>\n\nOver the next two years, Preston followed up with the US chart-topping singles \"[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]\" (which displaced Harrison's \"[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]\" at the top on 7 July 1973) and \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\", and the number 4 hit \"[[Space Race (Billy Preston song)|Space Race]]\".

A [[Munich]] performance from this tour was documented on Preston's album ''[[Live European Tour 1973]]''. In 1974, along with [[Bruce Fisher]], one of his regular songwriting collaborators in the 1970s, he composed one of Joe Cocker's biggest hits, \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\". On October 11, 1975, he was the first musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s series premiere episode.<ref name=nyt/> Preston's 1973 song \"Do You Love Me\" was the basis for the Rolling Stones' track \"Melody\", released on ''Black and Blue'' in 1976. Although two of his songs were included in the band's 1975 and 1976 live sets, the Stones and Preston parted company in 1977, mainly due to a disagreement over money. He continued to play on solo records by Stones members like [[Mick Jagger]]'s ''[[Wandering Spirit (album)|Wandering Spirit]]'', and made appearances on the band's ''[[Tattoo You]]'' and ''[[Bridges to Babylon]]''.\n\nAfter seven years with A&M, he signed with [[Motown]]. In 1979, he duetted with [[Syreeta Wright]] on the ballad \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\",<ref name=nyt/> which reached number 4 on the charts in the US. Preston's career lost momentum in the 1980s due to his [[cocaine]] and alcohol addictions. He left Motown in 1984 and focused on session work, contributing to works by artists such as [[Luther Vandross]] (his organ solos were included on Vandross' 1985 hit \"Til My Baby Comes Home\"), [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Patti LaBelle]], among others.

The same year he sang and played synthesizer in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', as part of [[the Louisiana Gator Boys]] supergroup.\n\nOn November 29, 2001, while touring and fighting his own health problems, Preston received the news that George Harrison had died, having long suffered from [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. Preston, among many of Harrison's longtime friends, performed in the 2002 [[Concert for George]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. Preston's performance of \"My Sweet Lord\" received critical acclaim. Additionally, he sang \"[[Isn't It a Pity]]\", provided backing vocals on most of the other songs, and played the [[Hammond organ]] for the show.\n\nIn 2002, Preston appeared on the [[Johnny Cash]] album ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'', playing piano on \"[[Personal Jesus]]\" and \"[[Tear-Stained Letter]]\".\n\nIn 2004, Preston toured with [[the Funk Brothers]] and [[Steve Winwood]] in Europe, and then with Clapton in Europe and North America.

The same year, he recorded \"Go Where No One's Gone Before\", the main title song for the [[anime]] series ''[[L/R: Licensed by Royalty]]''.\n\nPreston played [[clavinet]] on the song \"Warlocks\" for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] album ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006).

J. Cale]].\n\nIn late 2005, Preston made his last public performance, in Los Angeles, to publicize the re-release of the 1972  documentary film ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]''. He played a set of three Harrison songs \u2013 \"Give Me Love\", \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"Isn't It a Pity\" \u2013 with [[Dhani Harrison]] and Starr joining on guitar and drums, respectively, for the last song.\n\n==Personal life==\nPreston lived in [[London]] for a time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulmusic.info/main.asp?S=3&T=36&ART=262|title=SoulMusic.com|website=Soulmusic.info|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> possibly around 1969\u20131971, but he moved back to the US sometime in the early 1970s.\n\n=== Religion ===\nBilly Preston was brought up in the African-American [[Gospel music|gospel]] tradition; he was a committed Christian throughout his life and he openly expressed his faith in works such as his 1970s hit \"[[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|That's the Way God Planned It]]\". However, his personal beliefs were sometimes at odds with the attitudes and musical expressions of the secular world of rock & roll in which he often worked; while he was apparently willing to put his religious views aside when working on tracks like [[John Lennon]]'s openly atheistic song \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\". Preston was also deeply attached to his mother, for whom he wrote the song that became his best-known composition, \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wqb5d ''Billy Preston: That's The Way God Planned It''], BBC Radio 4,  December 21, 2010.</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nAlthough the details did not become fully known to the general public until after his death, Preston struggled throughout his life to cope with his [[homosexuality]], and the lasting effects of the traumatic sexual abuse he suffered as a boy. Although his [[sexual orientation]] became known to friends and associates in the music world (such as [[Keith Richards]]), Preston did not publicly come out as gay until just before he died. This was reportedly partly because he felt that it conflicted with his deeply held religious beliefs and his lifelong association with the church, so he remained \"[[Coming out|in the closet]]\" until shortly before his death.

Preston told Moore that at about the age of nine, after he and his mother moved to Los Angeles from Houston to perform in a touring production of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', he was repeatedly abused by the touring company's pianist. When Preston told his mother about the abuse, she did not believe him, and failed to protect him.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" /> The abuse subsequently went on for the entire summer, and Preston stated that he was also later abused by a local pastor.\n\nAnother traumatic incident, which reportedly affected Preston deeply, occurred in the early 1970s, while he was engaged to actress/model Kathy Silva. At this time Preston had become close friends with musician [[Sly Stone]], and made many contributions to Stone's recordings of the period (including the landmark album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]''). According to Moore, Preston was devastated when he came home one day to find Stone in bed with Silva (who later famously married Stone on stage at Madison Square Garden). According to Moore, Silva's affair with Stone was the trigger that led Preston to stop having relationships with women.

June 6, 2006)<ref name=\"nyt\" /> was an American musician whose work encompassed [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. Preston was a top session keyboardist in the 1960s, during which he backed artists such as [[Little Richard]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Rev. James Cleveland]] and [[the Beatles]]. He went on to achieve fame as a solo artist, with hit singles such as \"[[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|That's the Way God Planned It]]\", the Grammy-winning \"[[Outa-Space]]\", \"[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]\", \"[[Space Race (Billy Preston song)|Space Race]]\", \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\" and \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\". Additionally, Preston co-wrote \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\", which became a number 5 hit for [[Joe Cocker]].\n\nPreston was one of five musicians<ref>{{Cite AV media notes | title=Revolver | title-link  = Revolver (Beatles album) | year =1966 | type = LP cover (back) | publisher = [[Parlophone Records]] | id = PCS7009 }} </ref> credited on a Beatles recording other than the group's four members. Preston continued to record and perform with other artists, notably [[George Harrison]] after the Beatles' breakup, and [[Eric Clapton]], and he played keyboards for [[the Rolling Stones]] on many of the group's albums and tours during the 1970s.\n\n==Life and career==\n\n=== Early life ===\nPreston was born September 2, 1946, in [[Houston]]{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=741}} and moved to [[Los Angeles]] as a child with his mother, Robbie Lee Williams.  Noted as a [[child prodigy]], Preston was entirely self-taught and never had a music lesson. By the age of ten, he was playing [[Organ_(music)|organ]] onstage backing several gospel singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]].<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/arts/07preston.html|title=Billy Preston, 59, Soul Musician, Is Dead; Renowned Keyboardist and Collaborator|last=|first=|date=June 7, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref> Aged 11, Preston appeared on an episode of [[Nat King Cole]]'s [[NBC]] network TV show singing the [[Fats Domino]] hit \"[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]\" with Cole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=billy+preston+blueberry+hill&FORM=VIRE1#view=detail&mid=C4C029AE7E4DA745633AC4C029AE7E4DA745633A|title=billy preston blueberry hill - Bing video|website=Bing.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> He also appeared in ''[[St. Louis Blues (1958 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', the 1958 [[W.

With songs covering a broad spectrum of styles from country ('Born to Loose') to R&B ('Good News') to jazz ('God Bless The Child') with pop and blues undertones aplenty, ''16 Year Old Soul'' is a preserved-in-amber glimpse of an artist whose musical maturity belied his years.\"</ref> In 1965, he released the album ''[[The Most Exciting Organ Ever]]'' and performed on the rock and roll show ''[[Shindig!]]'' In 1967, he joined [[Ray Charles]]' band.{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=741}} Following this exposure, several musicians began asking Preston to contribute to their sessions.<ref name=nyt/>\n\n===Relationship with the Beatles===\nPreston first met [[the Beatles]] as a 16-year-old in 1962, while part of Little Richard's touring band, when their manager [[Brian Epstein]] organized a Liverpool show, at which the Beatles opened. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' explained their subsequent meeting:\n{{quote|They'd hook up again in 1969, when the Beatles were about to break up while recording the last album they released, ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' (they would later record ''[[Abbey Road]]'', which was released prior to ''Let It Be''). [[George Harrison]], a friend of Preston, had quit, walked out of the studio and gone to a Ray Charles concert in [[London]], where Preston was playing organ.

At one point during the [[Let It Be (Beatles album)#Recording and production|''Get Back'' sessions]], [[John Lennon]] proposed the idea of having him join the band (to which [[Paul McCartney]] countered that it was difficult enough reaching agreements with four).<ref>The Beatles - A/B Road: The Complete Get back Sessions, January 24th</ref> Preston played organ and electric piano for the Beatles during several of the ''Get Back'' sessions; some of these sessions appeared in the film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let it Be]]'' and on its companion album. Preston also accompanied the band on electric piano for [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|its rooftop concert]], the group's final public appearance.<ref name=\"WP Obit\"/> In April 1969, their single \"Get Back\" was credited to \"The Beatles with Billy Preston\", the only time such a joint credit had been given on an official Beatles-sanctioned release (as distinct from an unsanctioned reissue of some Hamburg-era recordings on which they were the backing group for [[Tony Sheridan]]). The credit was bestowed by the Beatles to reflect the extent of Preston's presence on the track; his electric piano is prominent throughout and he plays an extended solo. Preston also worked, in a more limited role, on the ''Abbey Road'' album, contributing organ to the tracks \"[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".\n\nIn 1978, he appeared as Sgt. Pepper in [[Robert Stigwood]]'s film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was based on the Beatles' [[Sgt.

His relationship with Harrison continued after the Beatles' break-up in 1970; Preston was the first artist to record Harrison's subsequent international hit \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", on his 1970 album ''[[Encouraging Words]]'', which Harrison co-produced with him. He appeared on several of Harrison's 1970s solo albums, starting with ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''; made a notable contribution to [[the Concert for Bangladesh]], the Harrison-organized 1971 charity benefit; performed with the ex-Beatle on his 1974 tour of [[North America]]; and played at the 2002 [[Concert for George]] tribute, held at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Preston also worked on solo releases by Lennon and [[Ringo Starr]].\n\nIn 1971, Preston left Apple and signed with [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]]. The previous year, he contributed to another hit single when [[Stephen Stills]] asked to use Preston's phrase \"if you can't be with the one you love, [[Love the One You're With|love the one you're with]]\", a song on Stills' [[Stephen Stills (album)|self-titled]] debut solo album.<ref>{{cite news|title=Song Stories: Love The One You're With|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/love-the-one-you-re-with-stephen-stills|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]'' on A&M, Preston's solo career peaked at this time, beginning with 1972's \"[[Outa-Space]]\", an [[instrumental]] track that further popularized the sound of the [[clavinet]] in [[funk]] music. The song reached number 2 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, before going on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]. \"Outa-Space\" sold over 1 million copies in America, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in June 1972.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/319 319, 334, and 349] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/319 }}</ref> Later that year, Preston contributed the title song to the hit [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Slaughter (1972 film)|Slaughter]]'' starring [[Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|url=|first=John|last=Tobler|title=[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]/[[Music Is My Life]]|others=Billy Preston|pp=4, 6|year=2011|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[BGO Records]]|id=}}</ref>\n\nOver the next two years, Preston followed up with the US chart-topping singles \"[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]\" (which displaced Harrison's \"[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]\" at the top on 7 July 1973) and \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\", and the number 4 hit \"[[Space Race (Billy Preston song)|Space Race]]\". Each of the three singles sold in excess of 1 million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> ''[[American Bandstand]]'' host and executive producer [[Dick Clark]] enjoyed \"Space Race\" so much that he used the instrumental for the mid-show break for virtually the remainder of its run.\n\n[[File:The Rolling Stones with Billy Preston (1975).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Preston (seated behind grand piano in foreground) performing with the Rolling Stones in 1975]]\nFrom 1970, Preston played keyboards (including piano, organ, clavinet and various synthesizers) for [[the Rolling Stones]], sometimes alongside pianists [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], on their albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'', ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'', ''[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll]]'' and ''[[Black and Blue]]''. As the band's primary touring keyboardist from 1973 to 1977, he also performed as a support act with his own band (including [[Mick Taylor]] on guitar) on their [[The Rolling Stones 1973 European Tour|1973 European tour]]. A [[Munich]] performance from this tour was documented on Preston's album ''[[Live European Tour 1973]]''. In 1974, along with [[Bruce Fisher]], one of his regular songwriting collaborators in the 1970s, he composed one of Joe Cocker's biggest hits, \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\". On October 11, 1975, he was the first musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s series premiere episode.<ref name=nyt/> Preston's 1973 song \"Do You Love Me\" was the basis for the Rolling Stones' track \"Melody\", released on ''Black and Blue'' in 1976. Although two of his songs were included in the band's 1975 and 1976 live sets, the Stones and Preston parted company in 1977, mainly due to a disagreement over money. He continued to play on solo records by Stones members like [[Mick Jagger]]'s ''[[Wandering Spirit (album)|Wandering Spirit]]'', and made appearances on the band's ''[[Tattoo You]]'' and ''[[Bridges to Babylon]]''.\n\nAfter seven years with A&M, he signed with [[Motown]]. In 1979, he duetted with [[Syreeta Wright]] on the ballad \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\",<ref name=nyt/> which reached number 4 on the charts in the US. Preston's career lost momentum in the 1980s due to his [[cocaine]] and alcohol addictions. He left Motown in 1984 and focused on session work, contributing to works by artists such as [[Luther Vandross]] (his organ solos were included on Vandross' 1985 hit \"Til My Baby Comes Home\"), [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Patti LaBelle]], among others. He served as musical director for ''[[Nightlife (TV series)|Nightlife]]'', a late-night [[talk show]] hosted by [[David Brenner]] that lasted one season from 1986 to 1987.<ref name=\"Chase\">\n{{cite news\n| date=September 7, 1986\n| last=Chase\n| first=Donald\n| url=http://articles.philly.com/1986-09-07/entertainment/26074159_1_david-brenner-carson-s-tonight-show-joan-rivers\n| title=He's On His Own In Late-night TV\n| newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]\n| accessdate=September 16, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPreston toured with [[Eric Clapton]], recorded with Gary Walker, one of the vocalists in his Los Angeles-based band, and worked with a wide range of other artists.

The same year he sang and played synthesizer in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', as part of [[the Louisiana Gator Boys]] supergroup.\n\nOn November 29, 2001, while touring and fighting his own health problems, Preston received the news that George Harrison had died, having long suffered from [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. Preston, among many of Harrison's longtime friends, performed in the 2002 [[Concert for George]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. Preston's performance of \"My Sweet Lord\" received critical acclaim. Additionally, he sang \"[[Isn't It a Pity]]\", provided backing vocals on most of the other songs, and played the [[Hammond organ]] for the show.\n\nIn 2002, Preston appeared on the [[Johnny Cash]] album ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'', playing piano on \"[[Personal Jesus]]\" and \"[[Tear-Stained Letter]]\".\n\nIn 2004, Preston toured with [[the Funk Brothers]] and [[Steve Winwood]] in Europe, and then with Clapton in Europe and North America. After the Clapton tours, he went to France, where he was featured in one episode of the ''Legends Rock TV Show.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legends-rock.com/index.php/episodes/billy-preston |title=Guest Artist of the Legends Rock TV Show |publisher=Legends-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> His performance included a duet with [[Sam Moore]] on \"You Are So Beautiful\"; this was Preston's last filmed concert.\n\nIn 2004, Preston performed as a [[List of jazz organists|jazz organist]] on Ray Charles' ''[[Genius Loves Company]]'', an album of duets, on the song \"[[Here We Go Again (Ray Charles song)|Here We Go Again]]\" with Charles and [[Norah Jones]].\n\nIn March 2005, he appeared on the ''[[American Idol]]'' [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] finale. Playing piano, he performed \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\" with [[Vonzell Solomon]] (who finished the contest in third place). The same year, he recorded \"Go Where No One's Gone Before\", the main title song for the [[anime]] series ''[[L/R: Licensed by Royalty]]''.\n\nPreston played [[clavinet]] on the song \"Warlocks\" for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] album ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006). Although very ill by this point, he jumped out of his bed after hearing a tape of the song given to him by the band, recorded his part, and went back to bed.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/peppers%20get%20sick%20preston%20out%20of%20bed_14_03_2006 |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers - Peppers Get Sick Preston Out Of Bed |magazine=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> Preston's final recorded contributions were the gospel-tinged organ on the [[Neil Diamond]] album ''[[12 Songs (Neil Diamond album)|12 Songs]]'' (2005), and his keyboard work on ''[[The Road to Escondido]]'' (2006) by Eric Clapton and [[J. J. Cale]].\n\nIn late 2005, Preston made his last public performance, in Los Angeles, to publicize the re-release of the 1972  documentary film ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]''. He played a set of three Harrison songs \u2013 \"Give Me Love\", \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"Isn't It a Pity\" \u2013 with [[Dhani Harrison]] and Starr joining on guitar and drums, respectively, for the last song.\n\n==Personal life==\nPreston lived in [[London]] for a time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulmusic.info/main.asp?S=3&T=36&ART=262|title=SoulMusic.com|website=Soulmusic.info|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> possibly around 1969\u20131971, but he moved back to the US sometime in the early 1970s.\n\n=== Religion ===\nBilly Preston was brought up in the African-American [[Gospel music|gospel]] tradition; he was a committed Christian throughout his life and he openly expressed his faith in works such as his 1970s hit \"[[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|That's the Way God Planned It]]\". However, his personal beliefs were sometimes at odds with the attitudes and musical expressions of the secular world of rock & roll in which he often worked; while he was apparently willing to put his religious views aside when working on tracks like [[John Lennon]]'s openly atheistic song \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\". Preston was also deeply attached to his mother, for whom he wrote the song that became his best-known composition, \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wqb5d ''Billy Preston: That's The Way God Planned It''], BBC Radio 4,  December 21, 2010.</ref>\n\n=== Sexuality ===\nAlthough the details did not become fully known to the general public until after his death, Preston struggled throughout his life to cope with his [[homosexuality]], and the lasting effects of the traumatic sexual abuse he suffered as a boy. Although his [[sexual orientation]] became known to friends and associates in the music world (such as [[Keith Richards]]), Preston did not publicly come out as gay until just before he died. This was reportedly partly because he felt that it conflicted with his deeply held religious beliefs and his lifelong association with the church, so he remained \"[[Coming out|in the closet]]\" until shortly before his death.

Preston told Moore that at about the age of nine, after he and his mother moved to Los Angeles from Houston to perform in a touring production of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', he was repeatedly abused by the touring company's pianist. When Preston told his mother about the abuse, she did not believe him, and failed to protect him.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" /> The abuse subsequently went on for the entire summer, and Preston stated that he was also later abused by a local pastor.\n\nAnother traumatic incident, which reportedly affected Preston deeply, occurred in the early 1970s, while he was engaged to actress/model Kathy Silva. At this time Preston had become close friends with musician [[Sly Stone]], and made many contributions to Stone's recordings of the period (including the landmark album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]''). According to Moore, Preston was devastated when he came home one day to find Stone in bed with Silva (who later famously married Stone on stage at Madison Square Garden). According to Moore, Silva's affair with Stone was the trigger that led Preston to stop having relationships with women. It was after this incident that he began abusing [[cocaine]] and having sex with men, and Moore has stated that she saw his drug abuse as his way of coping with the internal conflicts he felt about his sexual urges.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/><ref>[http://www.houstonpress.com/music/the-bitter-battle-over-fifth-beatle-billy-prestons-estate-6779599 Nate Jackson, \"The Bitter Battle over 'Fifth Beatle' Billy Preston's Estate\", ''Houston Press'', March 11, 2015 (retrieved December 1, 2015)]</ref>\n\n=== Legal issues and drug addiction ===\nIn 1991, Preston checked into a drug rehabilitation program to treat his addictions.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=October 7, 1991|title=Singer Billy Preston To Seek Drug Treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AbwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65 |magazine=Jet|volume=Vol. 80, No. 25|pages=65|via=}}</ref> \n\nWhile on [[probation]] for a [[Drunk drivers|drunk driving]] conviction in August 1991,<ref name=\"Jet Sentenced\">{{Cite magazine|last=|first=|date=October 12, 1992|title=Billy Preston Sentenced To 30 Days In Jail|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vcEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28 |magazine=Jet|volume=Vol. 82, No. 25|pages=28|via=}}</ref> Preston was arrested for sexually assaulting a 16-year-old Mexican boy, after picking him up at a gathering point for day laborers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-08-19-me-736-story.html|title=Singer Billy Preston Arrested in Sex Case|last=Boyer|first=Edward J.|date=August 19, 1991|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=}}</ref> The boy told authorities that Preston took him to his Malibu home, smoked cocaine, showed him [[Pornography|pornographic]] pictures and tried to assault him before he escaped.<ref name=\"AP no contest\">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/dc8fc6cff9d57449f71301ad0f882b29|title=Musician Billy Preston Pleads No Contest to Assault and Drug Charges|last=|first=|date=September 4, 1992|publisher=Associated Press |url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref> Preston was also charged with [[Assault|assault with a deadly weapon]] involving a man he picked up to do work at his home, the day before his arrest in the case involving the boy.<ref name=\"AP no contest\" /> After submitting to a drug test, Preston tested positive for cocaine.
