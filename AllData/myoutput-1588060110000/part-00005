Later, in March 1935, an organization called the ''National Liberation Alliance'' ({{lang-pt|Alian\u00e7a Nacional Libertadora - ANL}}) was created in Brazil, inspired by some popular fronts that emerged in Europe to prevent Nazi-fascist political advance. It argued for nationalist proposals and had as one of its objects to struggle for [[land reform]]. Led by nationalists and leftists, it managed to bring together the various sectors of society and quickly became a mass movement. Many military, Catholics, socialists and liberals, most of them disillusioned with the direction of the political [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|process started in 1930]], when [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] assumed the presidency of the Republic, joined the movement. [[Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes]] was chosen as its honorary president due to his prestige, in the left in general, particular with communists and some military while [[Coluna Prestes|leading revolts]] during 1920s.\n\nDespite the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] being declared illegal once again in August 1927, it quickly became the most prominent leftist organization in the country, establishing branches in many different cities and with thousands of supporters. In July 1935, just months after its creation, the ANL was declared illegal by [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]. Although the difficulty of mobilization had increased, the ANL still continued organizing rallies and demonstrations and reporting news critical of the government. In August, the organization stepped up preparations for an armed movement aiming at the overthrow of Vargas from power and the installation of a Communist regime headed by [[Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes]]. The plan was to start military uprisings in several regions with the support of the working class, which would trigger strikes across the country.\n\nThe first military uprising broke out on November 23, 1935, in [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]]. The next day, another military uprising took place in [[Recife]]. On the 27th, a revolt broke out in [[Rio de Janeiro]], then capital of the country. Without the support of the working class, and restricted to the three cities, the rebellion was quickly and violently put down. From then on, intense persecution affected not only communists, but also all government opponents. Thousands of people were arrested across the country, including congressmen, senators and even the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, [[Pedro Ernesto Baptista]].\n\nDespite its failure, the Communist revolt had provided a justification or pretext for assigning more power to [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]. After November 1935, the Congress approved a series of laws that restricted its own power, while the executive gained almost unlimited powers of repression. This process culminated in the coup of November 10, 1937, which closed the Congress, canceled the upcoming 1938 presidential elections and made [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] rule as a dictator. This period of Vargas dictatorship is called the ''Estado Novo'', which lasted until 1945.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Vargas Era]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:1935 in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Communist rebellions]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1935]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in Brazil]]\n[[Category:Vargas Era]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n{{one source|date=November 2015}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict= Communist uprising of 1935\n|image= At Rio de Janeiro 2019 574.jpg\n|image_size= 200px\n|date= 23 November 1935 \u2013 27 November 1935 ({{Age in years, months, weeks and days|year1=1935|month1=11|day1=23|year2=1935|month2=11|day2=27}})\n|place= [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Recife]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]\n|result= Government victory\n|combatant1= '''{{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Brazil]]'''\n* [[File:Bras\u00e3o Nacional PPMM.PNG|15px]] [[Military Police of Paran\u00e1 State|Police Corps]]\n* [[File:Coat of arms of the Brazilian Army.svg|15px]] [[Brazilian Army]]\n|combatant2=  ''National Liberation Alliance''<br/>[[Brazilian Communist Party]]<br/>\n\n'''Supported by:''' \n[[Communist International]]\n|commander1=  {{flagicon|Brazil}} [[Get\u00falio Vargas]] \n|commander2=  [[Lu\u00eds Carlos Prestes]]\n|casualties1= At least 30 dead\n|casualties2= At least 120 dead\n}}\n\nThe '''Communist uprising of 1935''' ({{lang-pt|Intentona Comunista}}) was a military revolt by leftist low-rank military against [[Get\u00falio Vargas]]'s [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930|government]], in the name of the ''National Liberation Alliance'' and with the support of the [[Brazilian Communist Party]], which was back then called the '''Communist Party of Brazil''', the uprising also had the support of the [[Communist International|Comintern]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cpdoc.fgv.br/producao/dossies/FatosImagens/RevoltaComunista |access-date=2015-11-02 |title=A revolta comunista de 1935 |language=pt}}</ref> It was the last of a series of Brazilian military revolts which began on 1922 under the name of {{lang|pt|tenentismo}} or the [[Tenente revolts|lieutenants revolts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grabois.org.br/portal/cdm/noticia.php?id_sessao=72&id_noticia=4247 |access-date=2015-11-02 |title=A ANL e o Levante de 1935 \u2013 Entrevista com Marly Vianna |language=pt |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222163550/http://grabois.org.br/portal/cdm/noticia.php?id_sessao=72&id_noticia=4247 |archivedate=2015-12-22 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dhnet.org.br/memoria/1935/a_pdf/revista_novos_rumos_rebelioes_1935.pdf |access-date=2015-11-02 |title=As rebeli\u00f5es de novembro de 1935 |format=PDF |language=pt }}</ref> Later, Vargas used it as a pretext for the {{lang|pt|[[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]]}} establishment.\n\nIn 1932, the [[fascist]] [[Brazilian Integralism|Brazilian Integralist Action]] party was created.
