Through this Committee, Lapedatu connected with key political personalities in Romania and, thanks to the support from the French Ambassador, the Count of Saint-Aulaire, established contacts the [[Triple Entente]]'s representatives. On 6 / 19 October the Committee issued a Declaration, distributed to all political actors including [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand I]], contesting the manifesto of [[Charles I of Austria]] proclaiming the federalization of the Empire and demanding that all territories inhabited by Romanians be united with Romania. Experiencing the depressing installation of a German Mission in Ia\u0219i as a consequence of the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)]], Alexandru Lapedatu published the paper \u201c''Chestiunea transilvan\u0103''\" (\"The Transylvanian Issue\") in ''Neamul Rom\u00e2nesc'', stating that the solution will be found when the situation of all nationalities will be addressed in the peace negotiations at the end of the war, expected to happen soon.{{Sfn|Lapedatu|1998a|p=152-154; online:163-166}}{{Sfn|Lapedatu|1930|p=}}{{Sfn|Cr\u0103ciun|1932|p=XXV; online:15}} \n\nIn his letter from 28 June 1918 to the President of the National Liberal Party, [[Ion I.

In recognition to his competence, Alexandru Lapedatu was nominated between 1919 and 1922 as an expert in the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference (1918); the documents he authored were submitted by Romania to the Conference and were used by the Romanian Delegation as basis for the negotiations.{{Sfn|Ciupea|\u021a\u00e2r\u0103u|2007|p=197, 200\u2013201}}{{Sfn|Lapedatu|1919|p=}}\n\n=== The Cultural Policy in the United Romania ===\nAlexandru Lapedatu had cultural activities in various associations and foundations, such as in the [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n (ASTRA)]] (Transylvanian Association for the Romanian Literature and the Culture of the Romanian People) that proclaimed him honorific member (8/9 November 1924), then elected him member of the \"demographic and ethnology-politic section\" (14/15 September 1935).
