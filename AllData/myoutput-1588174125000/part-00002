It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Ranrestar\">{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Rrloageappabh\">{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].\n\nExtensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,390&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\n[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa.

This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (''belg'') rains occur from February to April and the big (''meher'') rains from mid-June to mid-September. The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&nbsp;\u00b0C and often surpassing 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]].

Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, the cave-dwelling Somali blind barb and the Somali [[cavefish]] can be found.\n\n[[File:Commiphora-myrrha-resin-myrrh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Myrrh]], a common resin in the Horn]]\n\nIt is estimated that about 5,000 species of [[vascular plant]]s are found in the Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.

The state also established its [[hegemony]] over the declining [[Kingdom of Kush]] and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the [[Arabian peninsula]], eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]]. Under [[Ezana]] (fl. 320\u2013360), the kingdom of Aksum became the first major empire to adopt [[Christianity]], and was named by [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] as one of the four great powers of his time, along with [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and [[Han Dynasty|China]].\n\n[[File:MapHymiariteKingdom.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Ancient trading centers in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian peninsula according to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'']]\n\nNorthern Somalia was an important link in the Horn, connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world. Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of [[frankincense]], [[myrrh]] and spices, all of which were valuable luxuries to the [[Ancient Egyptians]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaeans]], [[Babylonians]] and [[Roman Empire|Romans]].<ref>Phoenicia, pg. 199.</ref><ref>Rose, Jeanne, and John Hulburd, ''The Aromatherapy Book'', p. 94.</ref> The Romans consequently began to refer to the region as ''Regio Aromatica''.

It was centered in the former [[Shewa]] province in central Ethiopia. The polity was succeeded by the [[Sultanate of Ifat]] around 1285.

At its height, it controlled large parts of Somalia, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Eritrea. Many of the historic cities in the region, such as [[Amud]], [[Maduna]], [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]], [[Berbera]], [[Zeila]] and [[Harar]], flourished during the kingdom's golden age. This period that left behind numerous [[courtyard|courtyard houses]], [[mosque]]s, [[shrine]]s and [[defensive wall|walled enclosures]]. Under the leadership of rulers such as [[Sabr ad-Din II]], [[Mansur ad-Din of Adal|Mansur ad-Din]], [[Jamal ad-Din II]], [[Shams ad-Din ibn Muhammad|Shams ad-Din]], General [[Mahfuz]] and [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]], Adalite armies continued the struggle against the [[Solomonic dynasty]], a campaign historically known as the [[Abyssinian\u2013Adal War|Conquest of Abyssinia]] or ''Futuh al Habash''.\n\nThe [[Warsangali Sultanate]] was a kingdom centered in northeastern and in some parts of southeastern Somalia. It was one of the largest sultanates ever established in the territory, and, at the height of its power, included the [[Sanaag]] region and parts of the northeastern [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] region of the country, an area historically known as [[Maakhir]] or the ''[[Maakhir Coast]]''. The Sultanate was founded in the late 13th century in northern Somalia by a group of Somalis from the [[Warsangali]] branch of the [[Darod]] clan, and was ruled by the descendants of the [[Gerad Dhidhin]].\n\n[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|left|The [[citadel]] in [[Gondershe]], an important city in the medieval [[Ajuran Sultanate]]]]\n\nThrough a strong centralized administration and an aggressive military stance towards invaders, the [[Ajuran Sultanate]] successfully resisted an [[Oromo people|Oromo]] invasion from the west and a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] incursion from the east during the Gaal Madow and the [[Ajuran Sultanate#Ajuran-Portuguese wars|Ajuran-Portuguese wars]]. Trading routes dating from the ancient and early medieval periods of [[Maritime history of Somalia|Somali maritime enterprise]] were also strengthened or re-established, and the state left behind an extensive [[Somali architecture|architectural legacy]]. Many of the hundreds of ruined castles and fortresses that dot the landscape of Somalia today are attributed to Ajuran engineers,<ref>Shaping of Somali Society pg 101</ref> including a lot of the [[pillar tomb]] fields, [[necropolis]]es and ruined cities built during that era. The royal family, the House of Gareen, also expanded its territories and established its hegemonic rule through a skillful combination of warfare, trade linkages and alliances.<ref>Horn and Crescent: Cultural Change and Traditional Islam on the East African Coast, 800\u20131900 (African Studies) by Pouwels, Randall L.. pg 15</ref>\n\nThe [[Zagwe dynasty]] ruled many parts of modern Ethiopia and Eritrea from approximately 1137 to 1270. The name of the dynasty comes from the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]-speaking [[Agaw people]] of northern Ethiopia. From 1270 onwards for many centuries, the [[Solomonic dynasty]] ruled the [[Ethiopian Empire]].\n\n[[File:Lalibela_\u00c9glise_Bet_Giyorgis.JPG|thumb|The [[Lalibela]] churches carved by the [[Zagwe dynasty]] in the 12th century.]]\n\nIn the early 15th century, Ethiopia sought to make diplomatic contact with European kingdoms for the first time since Aksumite times.

It was established by the Ajuran soldier [[Ibrahim Adeer]], who had defeated various [[vassal]]s of the Ajuran Empire and established the ''House of Gobroon''. The [[dynasty]] reached its apex under the successive reigns of Sultan [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]], who successfully consolidated Gobroon power during the [[Bardera|Bardera wars]], and Sultan [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]], who forced regional powers such as the [[Oman|Omani Empire]] to submit [[tribute]].\n\nThe [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] (Migiurtinia) was another prominent Somali sultanate based in the Horn region. Ruled by [[Boqor|King]] [[Osman Mahamuud]] during its golden age, it controlled much of northeastern and central Somalia in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The polity had all of the organs of an integrated modern state and maintained a robust trading network.

Initially, Kenadid's goal was to seize control of the neighboring Majeerteen Sultanate, which was then ruled by his cousin Boqor Osman Mahamuud. However, he was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and was eventually forced into exile in [[Yemen]]. A decade later, in the 1870s, Kenadid returned from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] with a band of [[Hadhramaut|Hadhrami]] [[musketeer]]s and a group of devoted lieutenants.

On 1 January 1890, Eritrea officially became a colony of [[Italy]]. In 1896 further Italian incursion into the horn was decisively halted by Ethiopian forces. By 1936 however, Eritrea became a province of [[Italian East Africa]] (Africa Orientale Italiana), along with [[Ethiopia]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].

This was the culmination of a gradual process of takeover by the Ethiopian authorities, a process which included a 1959 edict establishing the compulsory teaching of [[Amharic]], the main language of Ethiopia, in all Eritrean schools. The lack of regard for the Eritrean population led to the formation of an independence movement in the early 1960s (1961), which erupted into a [[Eritrean War of Independence|30-year war]] against successive Ethiopian governments that ended in 1991.

It consists chiefly of mountains uplifted through the formation of the [[Great Rift Valley (geographical concept)|Great Rift Valley]], a fissure in the Earth's [[crust (geology)|crust]] extending from [[Turkey]] to [[Mozambique]] and marking the separation of the African and Arabian [[plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Mostly mountainous, the region arose through faults resulting from the Rift Valley.\n\nGeologically, the Horn and [[Yemen]] once formed a single landmass around 18 million years ago, before the [[Gulf of Aden]] rifted and separated the Horn region from the [[Arabian Peninsula]].<ref name=\"Ranrestar\">{{cite web|title=2007 Annual Report|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321194039/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/Financial_Reports/RRS_Annual_Report_2007__PRINTERS_FINAL_.pdf|archive-date=21 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"Rrloageappabh\">{{cite web|title=Oil and Gas Exploration and Production - Playing a Better Hand|url=http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|publisher=Range Resources|accessdate=14 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017183314/http://www.rangeresources.com.au/fileadmin/user_upload/research_Reports/lloydsEJ_feb12.pdf|archive-date=17 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The [[Somali Plate]] is bounded on the west by the East African Rift, which stretches south from the [[triple junction]] in the [[Afar Depression]], and an undersea continuation of the rift extending southward offshore. The northern boundary is the [[Aden Ridge]] along the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The eastern boundary is the [[Central Indian Ridge]], the northern portion of which is also known as the [[Carlsberg Ridge]]. The southern boundary is the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]].\n\nExtensive [[glacier]]s once covered the [[Simien Mountains|Simien]] and [[Bale Mountains]] but melted at the beginning of the [[Holocene]]. The mountains descend in a huge [[escarpment]] to the [[Red Sea]] and more steadily to the [[Indian Ocean]]. [[Socotra]] is a small island in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Somalia. Its size is 3,600&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (1,390&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi) and it is a territory of Yemen.\n\nThe [[lowland]]s of the Horn are generally arid in spite of their proximity to the equator. This is because the winds of the tropical [[monsoon]]s that give seasonal rains to the [[Sahel]] and the [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] blow from the west. Consequently, they lose their moisture before reaching Djibouti and Somalia, with the result that most of the Horn receives little rainfall during the monsoon season.\n\n[[File:Nasa Horn of Africa.JPG|thumb|left|The Horn of Africa. [[NASA]] image]]\n\nIn the mountains of Ethiopia, many areas receive over 2,000&nbsp;mm (80&nbsp;in) per year, and even [[Asmara]] receives an average of 570&nbsp;mm (23&nbsp;in). This rainfall is the sole source of water for many areas outside Ethiopia, including [[Egypt]]. In the winter, the northeasterly [[trade wind]]s do not provide any moisture except in mountainous areas of northern Somalia, where rainfall in late autumn can produce annual totals as high as 500&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;in). On the eastern coast, a strong [[upwelling]] and the fact that the winds blow parallel to the coast means annual rainfall can be as low as 50&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in).\n\nThe climate in Ethiopia varies considerably between regions. It is generally hotter in the lowlands and temperate on the plateau. At [[Addis Ababa]], which ranges from {{convert|2200|to|2600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum temperature is {{convert|26|C|F|1}} and minimum {{convert|4|C|F|1}}. The weather is usually sunny and dry, but the short (''belg'') rains occur from February to April and the big (''meher'') rains from mid-June to mid-September. The [[Danakil Desert]] stretches across 100,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of arid terrain in northeast Ethiopia, southern Eritrea, and northwestern Djibouti. The area is known for its volcanoes and extreme heat, with daily temperatures over 45&nbsp;\u00b0C and often surpassing 50&nbsp;\u00b0C. It has a number of lakes formed by lava flows that dammed up several valleys. Among are Lake Asale (116 m below sea level) and Lake Giuletti/Afrera (80 m below sea level), both of which possess cryptodepressions in the [[Danakil Depression]]. The Afrera contains many active volcanoes, including the Maraho, [[Dabbahu Volcano|Dabbahu]], [[Afdera (volcano)|Afdera]] and [[Erta Ale]].<ref name=\"Stobin\">{{cite book|last1=Marco Stoppato|first1=Alfredo Bini|title=Deserts|date=2003|publisher=Firefly Books|isbn=978-1552976692|pages=[https://archive.org/details/deserts00stop/page/160 160\u2013163]|url=https://archive.org/details/deserts00stop/page/160|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Etpame\">{{cite book|last1=Facts On File, Incorporated|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1438126760|page=7|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC|accessdate=17 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn Somalia, there is not much seasonal variation in climate.

Among endemic reptile genera, there are ''[[Haackgreerius]]'', ''[[Haemodracon]]'', ''Ditypophis'', ''Pachycalamus'' and ''Aeluroglena''. Half of these genera are uniquely found on Socotra. Unlike reptiles, [[amphibian]]s are poorly represented in the region.\n\nThere are about 100 species of [[freshwater]] [[fish]] in the Horn of Africa, about 10 of which are endemic. Among the endemic, the cave-dwelling Somali blind barb and the Somali [[cavefish]] can be found.\n\n[[File:Commiphora-myrrha-resin-myrrh.jpg|thumb|left|[[Myrrh]], a common resin in the Horn]]\n\nIt is estimated that about 5,000 species of [[vascular plant]]s are found in the Horn, about half of which are endemic. Endemism is most developed in Socotra and northern Somalia. The region has two endemic plant [[family (biology)|families]]: the [[Barbeyaceae]] and the [[Dirachmaceae]]. Among the other remarkable species, there are the cucumber tree found only on Socotra (''Dendrosicyos socotrana''), the Bankoual\u00e9 palm, the [[Cordeauxia edulis|yeheb nut]], and the Somali [[cyclamen]].\n\nDue to the Horn of Africa's [[semi-arid]] and [[arid]] climate, droughts are not uncommon. They are complicated by climate change and changes in agricultural practices. For centuries, the region's [[Pastoralism|pastoral groups]] have observed careful [[rangeland management]] practices to mitigate the effects of drought, such as avoiding overgrazing or setting aside land only for young or ill animals. However, population growth has put pressure on limited land and led to these practices no longer being maintained. Droughts in 1983\u201385, 1991\u201392, 1998\u201399 and 2011 have disrupted periods of gradual growth in herd numbers, leading to a decrease of between 37% and 62% of the cattle population.
