In 1937, ''The Hobbit'' was first illustrated by professional draughtsmen for the American edition. Tolkien was very critical of these, and in 1946 he rejected illustrations by [[Horus Engels]] for the German edition of the ''Hobbit'' as \"too '[[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]]'\".<ref>7 December 1946, ''The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien: A Selection'', ed. Humphrey Carpenter, with the assistance of Christopher Tolkien (London: Allen and Unwin, 1981), no. 107</ref>\n\nIn 1948, [[Milein Cosman]] was invited by Tolkien's publishers to submit illustrations for ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''. \nTolkien felt her impressionistic style did not suit the story, and she was replaced by [[Pauline Baynes]], who later also supplied the illustrations for ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' (1962) and ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' (1967). In 1968, Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of ''The Lord of the Rings'', mostly in coloured ink, by English artist [[Mary Fairburn]]; Tolkien said of her pictures: \"They ... show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me.... I am beginning to ... think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing.\" For various reasons the project went no further, and Fairburn's illustrations were unknown until 2012.<ref>Tankard, Paul, \"An Unknown Vision of Middle-earth: Mary Fairburn: Tolkien Illustrator\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 14 September 2012. http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1124297.ece</ref> Crown Princess Margrethe (now [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]]) of Denmark, an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter, was inspired to illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s.

Howe and Lee were also involved in the creation of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film trilogy]] as concept artists \u2013 Nasmith was also invited to take part in the films, but was forced to reluctantly decline due to a personal crisis at the time. In 2004, Lee won an Academy Award for Best Art Direction for his work on the film ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/76academyawards/nomswins.html| title=76th Academy Awards|work =Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|accessdate=29 May 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060219061720/http://www.oscars.org/76academyawards/nomswins.html |archivedate = 19 February 2006}}</ref>\n\nOther artists who have found inspiration in Tolkien's works include Catherine Karina Chmiel, [[Inger Edelfeldt]], [[Anke Ei\u00dfmann]], [[Roger Garland (artist)|Roger Garland]], [[Michael Hague]], [[Tove Jansson]] (of [[Moomin]] fame, illustrator of Swedish and Finnish translations of ''[[The Hobbit]]''), Jay Johnstone, [[Paul R Gregory|Paul Raymond Gregory]], [[Tim Kirk]], [[Angus McBride]], [[Jef Murray]], [[Kay Miner]], [[Billy Mosig]], [[Colleen Doran]], [[Jenny Dolfen]], [[Mat\u011bj \u010cadil]] and [[Peter Xavier Price]].\n\n==Film==\n[[File:Hobbiton.jpg|thumb|New Zealand's \"[[Hobbiton]]\" where ''The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy was filmed.]]\n[[File:Sir Peter Jackson.jpg|thumb|Peter Jackson, director of six Tolkien adaptations, at the site of filming of ''The Hobbit'' trilogy.]]\n{{Main|Middle-earth in film}}\nTolkien originally sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to [[United Artists]] in 1968, but they never made a film, and in 1976 the rights were sold to [[Tolkien Enterprises]], a division of the [[Saul Zaentz]] Company.\n\nIn the early seventies [[John Boorman]] was planning a film of ''The Lord of the Rings'', but the plans never went further because of movie studio politics. Some of the work done was resurrected for the film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' in 1981.\n\n[[Ralph Bakshi]] directed an animated movie adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1978 (partly made with the [[rotoscope]] technique), which covered only the first half of ''The Lord of the Rings''. [[Rankin-Bass]] covered the second half with a children's TV animation ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980); earlier they had made a TV animation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977).\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'' was adapted as a [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|trilogy of films]] (2001\u201303), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''The Hobbit'' was also adapted as a [[The Hobbit (film series)|trilogy]] (2012\u201314), with some elements adapted from ''The Return of the King'''s Appendices, resulting in noticeable divergences with the novel.\n\nThe split of Tolkien's works between [[Tolkien Enterprises]] and the [[Tolkien Estate]] means that none of the Tolkien Enterprises' products can include source material from outside ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', and therefore a film or stage version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is highly unlikely.\n\n[[Babylon 5#Influences|Comparisons]] have been made to the plot of the [[science fiction]] [[television show]] ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and Tolkien's works.\n\n==Games==\nThere are multiple model-based games, trading card games, board games and [[video game]]s that take place in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from ''The Lord of the Rings.''  In a broader sense, many fantasy [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' and ''[[DragonQuest]]'' were strongly influenced by Tolkien's works. Such games feature creatures such as Orcs, Trolls, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Ents which are common to Tolkien's mythos even if they do not take place in Middle-earth.\n\n===Video games===\n{{Main|Middle-earth in video games}}\nThe books have been reproduced in video game form a number of times during the 1980s and 2000s, including [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'', ''Shadows of Mordor'', ''[[War in Middle-earth]]''; [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 1'' and ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 2.''; [[Electronic Arts]]' action [[platformer]] adaptations of ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King'', [[real-time strategy game]]s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', and the [[role-playing game]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]],'' all based on the Jackson films; and [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s action platformer based on ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. There is also a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] Game titled ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]'' based on the Jackson films, a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] by [[Turbine Inc|Turbine]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online|The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. [[The Two Towers (MUD)]] is also set in Tolkien's world. [[Lego]]'s licensed theme game version had Japanese anime graphics.\n\n===Other games===\n[[Games Workshop]] have made a [[miniature wargame]] called ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'', which, while part of the film trilogy's merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films. Many of Games Workshop's other battle games that are not directly related to the books have had some key background based on it.\n\nSeveral other games have been based directly on ''The Lord of the Rings'' and related works, including, amongst many, [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' game (1982\u20131999) and ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'' (1995\u20131999), as well as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' ([[2001 in games|2001]]) made by [[Decipher, Inc.]] All of these predate Jackson's film trilogy except for Decipher's card game, which is part of the latter's merchandise.\n\nDecipher also created the ''[[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'', a role-playing game based on the Jackson films.\n\nBoard games include ''[[Risk: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition]]'' and another simply entitled ''[[Lord of the Rings (board game)|Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as the ''Middle Earth Games'' from [[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]  containing the games ''War of the Ring'' (strategic, covering all three books), ''Gondor'' (tactical, covering the siege of Minas Tirith) and ''Sauron'' (covering the decisive battle of the Second Age) in [[1977 in games|1977]]. A more recent strategic game covering all three books, called ''[[War of the Ring (board game)|War of the Ring]]'', was released in [[2004 in games|2004]]. There are also ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' editions based on ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as a ''The Lord of the Rings Trivia Game'' quiz game. Chess sets have also been created with the figures based on people and other characters from ''The Lord of the Rings''. there has also been a game on the Nintendo WII. It was \"The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn's Quest\" which is a third person game based on Aragon's role in the book.\n\n===Homages===\n{{original research|section|date=September 2010}}\nThe creators of the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]] were also strongly influenced by Tolkien. The game has (clearly Tolkien-influenced) dwarves and elves as playable characters, and formerly had hobbits as well. After being threatened with a lawsuit by the [[Saul Zaentz]] company, [[Tolkien Enterprises]], they replaced hobbits with the similar \"halflings\" \u2014 a term also used in ''The Lord of the Rings'', balrogs with 'balor-demons' and other genericized names. In most versions of the game, halflings were especially good at being thieves/rogues, a nod to Bilbo the thief in ''The Hobbit''. His works also indirectly inspired the [[Warcraft]] series via their use in [[Games Workshop]]'s battle games.\n\nEqually common is the use of the term [[orc]] for a variety of hobgoblin type creatures in later fantasy although Tolkien popularized this modern usage of the word. Even more removed genre games such as ''[[Shadowrun]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' use the term, therein spelt Ork, possibly to sidestep possible legal issues (though Tolkien actually preferred ''-k'' in late writings).\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Prose===\n[[File:Lucca Comics 2010 - Terry Brooks 03.jpg|thumb|Fantasy writer Terry Brooks, among others, was heavily influenced by Tolkien]]\nMany authors have found inspiration in Tolkien's work as well. Following the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the 1960s, publishers were quick to try to meet a new demand for literate fantasy in the American marketplace.<ref name=\"ts\">[[Tom Shippey]], \"Literature,Twentieth Century: Influence of Tolkien\", in Michael D.

The plot of Novelist [[Pat Murphy (writer)|Pat Murphy]]'s ''[[There and Back Again (novel)|There and Back Again]]'' intentionally mirrors that of ''The Hobbit'', but is transposed into a science-fiction setting involving space travel. [[J. K.

Some people have gone so far as to accuse Paolini of plagiarism.<ref>[http://aydee.wordpress.com/2006/12/17/eragon/ Eragon \u2013 Plagiarism Made Popular]</ref> S.M. Stirling's [[The Emberverse series|\"Emberverse\"]] series includes a character obsessed with ''The Lord of the Rings'' who creates a post-apocalyptic community based upon the Elves and D\u00fanedain of Middle-earth. The same plot point was used by the Russian writer [[Vladimir Berezin (writer)|Vladimir Berezin]] in his novel ''Road Signs'' (from the [[Universe of Metro 2033]]). Another Russian writer, [[Kirill Eskov]], wrote ''[[The Last Ringbearer]]'', about the events in ''Lord of the Rings'' from the perspective of Sauron. [[Stephen King]], best known for horror novels, has acknowledged Tolkien's influence on his novel ''[[The Stand]]'' as well as his fantasy series ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''. Several other prominent fantasy writers, including [[George R. R. Martin]], [[Michael Swanwick]], [[Raymond E. Feist]], [[Poul Anderson]], [[Karen Haber]], [[Harry Turtledove]], [[Charles De Lint]], and [[Orson Scott Card]], have all acknowledged Tolkien's work as an inspiration for their own fantasy work.<ref name=\"ts\" />\n\n===Poetry===\nSome people were inspired to compose poems in [[Quenya]] or [[Sindarin]], the two most developed of Tolkien's created languages. For example, [[Helge K\u00e5re Fauskanger]] translated the first two chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] into Quenya. ''[[Tyali\u00eb Tyelelli\u00e9va]]'' is a journal dedicated to poems in the Elvish languages.\n\n===Comics===\nCartoonist [[Jeff Smith (cartoonist)|Jeff Smith]] was influenced by Tolkien, and the mythologies that inspired his works.

In 1937, ''The Hobbit'' was first illustrated by professional draughtsmen for the American edition. Tolkien was very critical of these, and in 1946 he rejected illustrations by [[Horus Engels]] for the German edition of the ''Hobbit'' as \"too '[[The Walt Disney Company|Disnified]]'\".<ref>7 December 1946, ''The Letters of J.R.R.

In 1968, Tolkien was sent a number of a suite of illustrations of ''The Lord of the Rings'', mostly in coloured ink, by English artist [[Mary Fairburn]]; Tolkien said of her pictures: \"They ... show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me.... I am beginning to ... think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing.\" For various reasons the project went no further, and Fairburn's illustrations were unknown until 2012.<ref>Tankard, Paul, \"An Unknown Vision of Middle-earth: Mary Fairburn: Tolkien Illustrator\", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', 14 September 2012. http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1124297.ece</ref> Crown Princess Margrethe (now [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]]) of Denmark, an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter, was inspired to illustrations to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the early 1970s.

Some of the work done was resurrected for the film ''[[Excalibur (film)|Excalibur]]'' in 1981.\n\n[[Ralph Bakshi]] directed an animated movie adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1978 (partly made with the [[rotoscope]] technique), which covered only the first half of ''The Lord of the Rings''. [[Rankin-Bass]] covered the second half with a children's TV animation ''[[The Return of the King (1980 movie)|The Return of the King]]'' (1980); earlier they had made a TV animation of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' (1977).\n\n''The Lord of the Rings'' was adapted as a [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|trilogy of films]] (2001\u201303), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''The Hobbit'' was also adapted as a [[The Hobbit (film series)|trilogy]] (2012\u201314), with some elements adapted from ''The Return of the King'''s Appendices, resulting in noticeable divergences with the novel.\n\nThe split of Tolkien's works between [[Tolkien Enterprises]] and the [[Tolkien Estate]] means that none of the Tolkien Enterprises' products can include source material from outside ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', and therefore a film or stage version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is highly unlikely.\n\n[[Babylon 5#Influences|Comparisons]] have been made to the plot of the [[science fiction]] [[television show]] ''[[Babylon 5]]'' and Tolkien's works.\n\n==Games==\nThere are multiple model-based games, trading card games, board games and [[video game]]s that take place in Middle-earth, most depicting scenes and characters from ''The Lord of the Rings.''  In a broader sense, many fantasy [[role-playing games]] such as ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' and ''[[DragonQuest]]'' were strongly influenced by Tolkien's works. Such games feature creatures such as Orcs, Trolls, Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Ents which are common to Tolkien's mythos even if they do not take place in Middle-earth.\n\n===Video games===\n{{Main|Middle-earth in video games}}\nThe books have been reproduced in video game form a number of times during the 1980s and 2000s, including [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]]'s ''Lord of the Rings'', ''Shadows of Mordor'', ''[[War in Middle-earth]]''; [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]]'s ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 1'' and ''Lord of the Rings Vol. 2.''; [[Electronic Arts]]' action [[platformer]] adaptations of ''The Two Towers'' and ''The Return of the King'', [[real-time strategy game]]s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', and the [[role-playing game]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]],'' all based on the Jackson films; and [[Sierra Entertainment]]'s action platformer based on ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. There is also a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] Game titled ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tactics]]'' based on the Jackson films, a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] by [[Turbine Inc|Turbine]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online|The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]''. [[The Two Towers (MUD)]] is also set in Tolkien's world. [[Lego]]'s licensed theme game version had Japanese anime graphics.\n\n===Other games===\n[[Games Workshop]] have made a [[miniature wargame]] called ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'', which, while part of the film trilogy's merchandise, combines elements from both the books and films. Many of Games Workshop's other battle games that are not directly related to the books have had some key background based on it.\n\nSeveral other games have been based directly on ''The Lord of the Rings'' and related works, including, amongst many, [[Iron Crown Enterprises]]' ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' game (1982\u20131999) and ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'' (1995\u20131999), as well as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' ([[2001 in games|2001]]) made by [[Decipher, Inc.]] All of these predate Jackson's film trilogy except for Decipher's card game, which is part of the latter's merchandise.\n\nDecipher also created the ''[[Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'', a role-playing game based on the Jackson films.\n\nBoard games include ''[[Risk: Lord of the Rings Trilogy Edition]]'' and another simply entitled ''[[Lord of the Rings (board game)|Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as the ''Middle Earth Games'' from [[Simulations Publications, Inc.]]  containing the games ''War of the Ring'' (strategic, covering all three books), ''Gondor'' (tactical, covering the siege of Minas Tirith) and ''Sauron'' (covering the decisive battle of the Second Age) in [[1977 in games|1977]]. A more recent strategic game covering all three books, called ''[[War of the Ring (board game)|War of the Ring]]'', was released in [[2004 in games|2004]]. There are also ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'' and ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' editions based on ''The Lord of the Rings'', as well as a ''The Lord of the Rings Trivia Game'' quiz game. Chess sets have also been created with the figures based on people and other characters from ''The Lord of the Rings''. there has also been a game on the Nintendo WII. It was \"The Lord of the Rings, Aragorn's Quest\" which is a third person game based on Aragon's role in the book.\n\n===Homages===\n{{original research|section|date=September 2010}}\nThe creators of the ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]] were also strongly influenced by Tolkien. The game has (clearly Tolkien-influenced) dwarves and elves as playable characters, and formerly had hobbits as well. After being threatened with a lawsuit by the [[Saul Zaentz]] company, [[Tolkien Enterprises]], they replaced hobbits with the similar \"halflings\" \u2014 a term also used in ''The Lord of the Rings'', balrogs with 'balor-demons' and other genericized names. In most versions of the game, halflings were especially good at being thieves/rogues, a nod to Bilbo the thief in ''The Hobbit''. His works also indirectly inspired the [[Warcraft]] series via their use in [[Games Workshop]]'s battle games.\n\nEqually common is the use of the term [[orc]] for a variety of hobgoblin type creatures in later fantasy although Tolkien popularized this modern usage of the word. Even more removed genre games such as ''[[Shadowrun]]'' and ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' use the term, therein spelt Ork, possibly to sidestep possible legal issues (though Tolkien actually preferred ''-k'' in late writings).\n\n==Literature==\n\n===Prose===\n[[File:Lucca Comics 2010 - Terry Brooks 03.jpg|thumb|Fantasy writer Terry Brooks, among others, was heavily influenced by Tolkien]]\nMany authors have found inspiration in Tolkien's work as well.
