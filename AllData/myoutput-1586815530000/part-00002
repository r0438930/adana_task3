For example, on the real line, the Poisson process, both homogeneous  or inhomogeneous, is sometimes interpreted as a counting process, and the notation  <math>\\textstyle \\{N(t), t\\geq 0\\}</math> is used to represent the Poisson process.<ref name=\"Tijms2003page1\"/><ref name=\"Ross1996page59\"/>\n\nAnother reason for varying notation is due to the theory of point processes, which has a couple of mathematical interpretations. For example, a simple Poisson point process may be considered as a random set, which suggests the notation <math>\\textstyle x\\in {N}</math>, implying that <math>\\textstyle x</math> is a random point belonging to or being an element of the Poisson point process <math>\\textstyle {N}</math>. Another, more general, interpretation is to consider a Poisson or any other point process as a random counting measure,  so one can write the number of points of a Poisson point process <math>\\textstyle {N}</math> being found or located in some (Borel measurable) region <math>\\textstyle B</math>  as <math>\\textstyle {N}(B)</math>, which is a random variable. These different interpretations results in notation being used from mathematical fields such as measure theory and set theory.<ref name=\"ChiuStoyan2013page110\"/>\n\nFor general point processes, sometimes a subscript on the point symbol, for example <math>\\textstyle x</math>, is included so one writes (with set notation) <math>\\textstyle x_i\\in{N}</math> instead of <math>\\textstyle x\\in{N}</math>, and <math>\\textstyle x</math> can be used for the dummy variable in integral expressions such as Campbell's theorem, instead of denoting random points.<ref name=\"baccelli2009stochastic1\"/> Sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point <math>\\textstyle x</math> or <math>\\textstyle x_i</math> belongs to or is a point of the point process <math>\\textstyle X</math>, and be written with set notation as <math>\\textstyle x\\in X</math> or <math>\\textstyle x_i\\in X</math>.<ref name=\"MollerWaagepetersen2003page7\">{{cite book|author1=Jesper Moller|author2=Rasmus Plenge Waagepetersen|title=Statistical Inference and Simulation for Spatial Point Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBNOHvElXZ4C|date=25 September 2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-49693-0|page=7}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the set theory and integral or measure theory notation can be used interchangeably. For example, for a point process <math>\\textstyle N</math> defined on the Euclidean state space <math>\\textstyle {\\textbf{R}^d} </math> and a (measurable) function <math>\\textstyle f</math> on <math>\\textstyle \\textbf{R}^d</math> , the expression\n\n:<math> \\int_{\\textbf{R}^d} f(x)\\,\\mathrm dN(x)=\\sum\\limits_{x_i\\in N} f(x_i), </math>\n\ndemonstrates two different ways to write a summation over a point process (see also [[Campbell's theorem (probability)]]). More specifically, the integral notation on the left-hand side is interpreting the point process as a random counting measure while the sum on the right-hand side suggests a random set interpretation.<ref name=\"ChiuStoyan2013page110\"/>\n\n==Functionals and moment measures==\n\nIn probability theory, operations are applied to random variables for different purposes. Sometimes these operations are regular expectations that produce the average or variance of a random variable. Others, such as characteristic functions (or Laplace transforms) of a random variable can be used to uniquely identify or characterize random variables and prove results like the central limit theorem.<ref name=\"karr1993probability\">A. Karr. ''Probability''. Springer Texts in Statistics Series.

The overall aim is to approximate the both number of points of some point process and the location of each point by a Poisson point process.<ref name=\"chen2013approximating\">L. H. Chen, A.

Aldous. ''Poisson Clumping Heuristic''. Wiley Online Library, 1989.</ref>  The general  heuristic or principle involves using the Poisson point process (or Poisson distribution) to approximate events, which are considered rare or unlikely, of some stochastic process. In some cases these rare events are close to being independent, hence a Poisson point process can be used. When the events are not independent, but tend to occur in clusters or ''clumps'', then if these clumps are suitably defined such that they are approximately independent of each other, then the number of  clumps occurring will be close to a Poisson random variable <ref name=\"arratia1993review\"/> and the locations of the clumps will be close to a Poisson process.<ref name=\"aldous1989poisson\"/>\n\n===Stein's method===\n\n[[Stein's method]] is a mathematical technique originally developed for approximating random variables such as [[Gaussian]] and Poisson variables, which has also been applied to point processes.  Stein's method can be used to derive upper bounds on [[probability metric]]s, which give way to quantify how different two random mathematical objects vary stochastically.<ref name=\"chen2013approximating\"/><ref name=\"barbour1992stein\">A.

For example, if a point process, other than a Poisson, has its points randomly and independently displaced, then the process would not necessarily be a Poisson point process. However, under certain mathematical conditions for both the original point process and the random displacement, it has been shown via limit theorems that if the points of a point process are repeatedly displaced in a random and independent manner, then the finite-distribution of the point process will converge (weakly) to that of a Poisson point process.<ref name=\"DaleyVere-Jones2007page131\">{{cite book|author1=D.J.

For example, on the real line, the Poisson process, both homogeneous  or inhomogeneous, is sometimes interpreted as a counting process, and the notation  <math>\\textstyle \\{N(t), t\\geq 0\\}</math> is used to represent the Poisson process.<ref name=\"Tijms2003page1\"/><ref name=\"Ross1996page59\"/>\n\nAnother reason for varying notation is due to the theory of point processes, which has a couple of mathematical interpretations. For example, a simple Poisson point process may be considered as a random set, which suggests the notation <math>\\textstyle x\\in {N}</math>, implying that <math>\\textstyle x</math> is a random point belonging to or being an element of the Poisson point process <math>\\textstyle {N}</math>. Another, more general, interpretation is to consider a Poisson or any other point process as a random counting measure,  so one can write the number of points of a Poisson point process <math>\\textstyle {N}</math> being found or located in some (Borel measurable) region <math>\\textstyle B</math>  as <math>\\textstyle {N}(B)</math>, which is a random variable. These different interpretations results in notation being used from mathematical fields such as measure theory and set theory.<ref name=\"ChiuStoyan2013page110\"/>\n\nFor general point processes, sometimes a subscript on the point symbol, for example <math>\\textstyle x</math>, is included so one writes (with set notation) <math>\\textstyle x_i\\in{N}</math> instead of <math>\\textstyle x\\in{N}</math>, and <math>\\textstyle x</math> can be used for the dummy variable in integral expressions such as Campbell's theorem, instead of denoting random points.<ref name=\"baccelli2009stochastic1\"/> Sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point <math>\\textstyle x</math> or <math>\\textstyle x_i</math> belongs to or is a point of the point process <math>\\textstyle X</math>, and be written with set notation as <math>\\textstyle x\\in X</math> or <math>\\textstyle x_i\\in X</math>.<ref name=\"MollerWaagepetersen2003page7\">{{cite book|author1=Jesper Moller|author2=Rasmus Plenge Waagepetersen|title=Statistical Inference and Simulation for Spatial Point Processes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBNOHvElXZ4C|date=25 September 2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-203-49693-0|page=7}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the set theory and integral or measure theory notation can be used interchangeably. For example, for a point process <math>\\textstyle N</math> defined on the Euclidean state space <math>\\textstyle {\\textbf{R}^d} </math> and a (measurable) function <math>\\textstyle f</math> on <math>\\textstyle \\textbf{R}^d</math> , the expression\n\n:<math> \\int_{\\textbf{R}^d} f(x)\\,\\mathrm dN(x)=\\sum\\limits_{x_i\\in N} f(x_i), </math>\n\ndemonstrates two different ways to write a summation over a point process (see also [[Campbell's theorem (probability)]]). More specifically, the integral notation on the left-hand side is interpreting the point process as a random counting measure while the sum on the right-hand side suggests a random set interpretation.<ref name=\"ChiuStoyan2013page110\"/>\n\n==Functionals and moment measures==\n\nIn probability theory, operations are applied to random variables for different purposes. Sometimes these operations are regular expectations that produce the average or variance of a random variable. Others, such as characteristic functions (or Laplace transforms) of a random variable can be used to uniquely identify or characterize random variables and prove results like the central limit theorem.<ref name=\"karr1993probability\">A. Karr. ''Probability''. Springer Texts in Statistics Series.

The overall aim is to approximate the both number of points of some point process and the location of each point by a Poisson point process.<ref name=\"chen2013approximating\">L. H. Chen, A.

Aldous. ''Poisson Clumping Heuristic''. Wiley Online Library, 1989.</ref>  The general  heuristic or principle involves using the Poisson point process (or Poisson distribution) to approximate events, which are considered rare or unlikely, of some stochastic process. In some cases these rare events are close to being independent, hence a Poisson point process can be used. When the events are not independent, but tend to occur in clusters or ''clumps'', then if these clumps are suitably defined such that they are approximately independent of each other, then the number of  clumps occurring will be close to a Poisson random variable <ref name=\"arratia1993review\"/> and the locations of the clumps will be close to a Poisson process.<ref name=\"aldous1989poisson\"/>\n\n===Stein's method===\n\n[[Stein's method]] is a mathematical technique originally developed for approximating random variables such as [[Gaussian]] and Poisson variables, which has also been applied to point processes.  Stein's method can be used to derive upper bounds on [[probability metric]]s, which give way to quantify how different two random mathematical objects vary stochastically.<ref name=\"chen2013approximating\"/><ref name=\"barbour1992stein\">A.

For example, if a point process, other than a Poisson, has its points randomly and independently displaced, then the process would not necessarily be a Poisson point process. However, under certain mathematical conditions for both the original point process and the random displacement, it has been shown via limit theorems that if the points of a point process are repeatedly displaced in a random and independent manner, then the finite-distribution of the point process will converge (weakly) to that of a Poisson point process.<ref name=\"DaleyVere-Jones2007page131\">{{cite book|author1=D.J.
