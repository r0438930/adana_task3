The western species shares the same [[Nest|nesting biology]] as its fellow species, the eastern cicada killer (''[[Sphecius speciosus|S. speciosus]]''). ''S.&nbsp;grandis'', like all other species of the [[genus]] ''Sphecius'', mainly provides [[cicada]]s for its offspring. It forms nest aggregations and mates and [[Voltinism|broods once in a year]], in July and early August. The wasp is on average {{convert|3|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in length and is amber-yellow with yellow rings on its [[abdomen]].\n\nWasps in the genus ''Sphecius'' are not habitually aggressive and use their [[venom]] mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young. The females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning, place them in brood cells and lay eggs in the cells. ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Central America]], Mexico and the [[Western United States]], and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of ''Sphecius''. The western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females, but generally die after only a couple of days.\n\n''Sphecius grandis'' can be distinguished from ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral [[Tergum|tergites]]. Formerly, the two species were distinguished on the basis of the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' and three in ''S.&nbsp;convallis''), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they can be distinguished by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe western cicada killer was first described by American naturalist [[Thomas Say]] in 1824 in [[Madera Canyon (Arizona)|Madera Canyon]], Arizona, as ''Stizus grandis''. Its species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''grandis'' meaning \"large\". It is one of five species of the genus ''[[Sphecius]]'' in North America.<ref name=\"bionica\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.bio-nica.info/biblioteca/Holliday2006Sphecius.pdf | title=Improved Key to New World Species of Sphecius (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae |author1=Holliday, Charles W. |author2=Coelho, Joseph R. | journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America | year=2006 | volume=99 | pages=793\u2013798 | doi=10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99[793:IKTNWS]2.0.CO;2 | issue=5}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, it has been suspected that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (''S.&nbsp;speciosus'') and Pacific cicada killer (''S.&nbsp;convallis'') at [[Big Bend National Park]] in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent [[clade]]s, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the [[Rocky Mountains]], with one occurring mainly to the south and east, the other to the west.<ref name=\"zoot\">{{cite journal|author1=Hastings, Jon M. |author2=Schultheis, Patrick J. |author3=Whitson, Maggie |author4=Holliday, Charles W. |author5=Coelho, Joseph R. |author6=Mendell, Angela M. |year=2008|title=DNA barcoding of new world cicada killers (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae)|journal=[[Zootaxa]]|volume=1713|pages=27\u201338|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01713p038.pdf|hdl=10385/598}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nRanging in size from {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in length, the western cicada killer is very similar to its eastern cousin, ''[[Sphecius speciosus]]'', with a [[rufous]] black hue to the body, amber stripes and a yellow abdomen.<ref name=\"bionica\" /><ref>{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsVLAAAAYAAJ&q=sphecius+grandis&dq=sphecius+grandis | title=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia | journal=American Natural History | year=1901 | volume=53 | pages=788\u2013794 | author1=Philadelphia | first1=Academy of Natural Sciences of}}</ref><ref name=\"cdri\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cdri.org/fieldguides/wasps/taxonomy/robust-yellow-group.html | title=Wasps (Order: Hymenoptera) \u2013 Robust Yellow Group | publisher=[[Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center and Botanical Gardens]] | access-date=August 11, 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062046/http://www.cdri.org/fieldguides/wasps/taxonomy/robust-yellow-group.html | archive-date=September 27, 2011 | df= }}</ref> The western cicada killer has rufous spots on its first to second tergites and yellow markings can generally be found from first to fifth, although there is some variation.<ref name=\"bionica\" /> On average, female [[forewing]] length lies between {{convert|2.5|and|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"jstor\" /> Females are larger than males and live for a year, a time just long enough to produce a brood, whereas the males die in only a few days, just enough time to impregnate a female.<ref name=\"cdri\" /> In Steven J.

The female ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' was originally distinguished from the female ''S. grandis'' by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral [[Tergum|tergites]] on ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' and yellow marks on all tergites for ''S.&nbsp;grandis''. However, this was found to be insufficient for correct identification because the positions of the markings can vary among different wasps of the same species.<ref name=\"bionica\" />\n\nCharles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho devised a new key in 2004 to identify the ''Sphecius'' species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female ''S. convallis'' wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' that overlapped with ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' males were found to be the same as on females.<ref name=\"bionica\" />\n\n===Thermoregulation===\nIt has been found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of [[thermoregulation]] which enables them to maintain territories during the day.<ref name=\"sasi\" /> A study by Joseph R.

English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by [[natural selection]] to improve the chances of the male mating. The timing of the emergence of females has evolved to correspond with the similar emergence of the cicada species of the area, ''[[Tibicen|Tibicen duryi]]'' and ''T.&nbsp;parallela'', which they hunt for the provisioning of their nests.<ref name=\"jstor2\">{{cite journal |jstor=4600338 | title=Protandry in western cicada killer wasps (''Sphecius grandis'', Hymnoptera: Sphecidae) and empirical study of emergence time and mating opportunity | author=Hastings, Jon | journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology |date=April 1989 | volume=25 | issue=4 | pages=255\u2013260 |doi=10.1007/BF00300051}}</ref> Many have yellow markings located on their [[Tergum|tergites]] ([[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal portion]]), although some have been found only from the first to fifth tergites.<ref name=\"bionica\"/>\n\n[[File:Cicada Killer Wasp.jpg|thumb|''[[Sphecius speciosus]]'' (eastern cicada killer) shares many behavioral similarities with ''Sphecius grandis''.]]\nBecause males emerge earlier than females, the males compete for mating territories surrounding the nests in which the females are located.

The western species shares the same [[Nest|nesting biology]] as its fellow species, the eastern cicada killer (''[[Sphecius speciosus|S. speciosus]]''). ''S.&nbsp;grandis'', like all other species of the [[genus]] ''Sphecius'', mainly provides [[cicada]]s for its offspring. It forms nest aggregations and mates and [[Voltinism|broods once in a year]], in July and early August. The wasp is on average {{convert|3|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in length and is amber-yellow with yellow rings on its [[abdomen]].\n\nWasps in the genus ''Sphecius'' are not habitually aggressive and use their [[venom]] mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young. The females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning, place them in brood cells and lay eggs in the cells. ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Central America]], Mexico and the [[Western United States]], and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of ''Sphecius''. The western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females, but generally die after only a couple of days.\n\n''Sphecius grandis'' can be distinguished from ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' (the Pacific cicada killer wasp) by the coloration pattern of the gastral [[Tergum|tergites]]. Formerly, the two species were distinguished on the basis of the number of tergites with yellow markings (five in ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' and three in ''S.&nbsp;convallis''), but a more recent study showed that this character was insufficient to distinguish the two species. However, they can be distinguished by the density of the punctation on the first and second tergites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe western cicada killer was first described by American naturalist [[Thomas Say]] in 1824 in [[Madera Canyon]], Arizona, as ''Stizus grandis''. Its species name is the [[Latin]] adjective ''grandis'' meaning \"large\". It is one of five species of the genus ''[[Sphecius]]'' in North America.<ref name=\"bionica\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.bio-nica.info/biblioteca/Holliday2006Sphecius.pdf | title=Improved Key to New World Species of Sphecius (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae |author1=Holliday, Charles W. |author2=Coelho, Joseph R. | journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America | year=2006 | volume=99 | pages=793\u2013798 | doi=10.1603/0013-8746(2006)99[793:IKTNWS]2.0.CO;2 | issue=5}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, it has been suspected that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (''S.&nbsp;speciosus'') and Pacific cicada killer (''S.&nbsp;convallis'') at [[Big Bend National Park]] in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of [[mitochondrial DNA]] showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent [[clade]]s, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the [[Rocky Mountains]], with one occurring mainly to the south and east, the other to the west.<ref name=\"zoot\">{{cite journal|author1=Hastings, Jon M. |author2=Schultheis, Patrick J. |author3=Whitson, Maggie |author4=Holliday, Charles W. |author5=Coelho, Joseph R. |author6=Mendell, Angela M. |year=2008|title=DNA barcoding of new world cicada killers (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae)|journal=[[Zootaxa]]|volume=1713|pages=27\u201338|url=http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2008/f/zt01713p038.pdf|hdl=10385/598}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nRanging in size from {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in length, the western cicada killer is very similar to its eastern cousin, ''[[Sphecius speciosus]]'', with a [[rufous]] black hue to the body, amber stripes and a yellow abdomen.<ref name=\"bionica\" /><ref>{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsVLAAAAYAAJ&q=sphecius+grandis&dq=sphecius+grandis | title=Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia | journal=American Natural History | year=1901 | volume=53 | pages=788\u2013794 | author1=Philadelphia | first1=Academy of Natural Sciences of}}</ref><ref name=\"cdri\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cdri.org/fieldguides/wasps/taxonomy/robust-yellow-group.html | title=Wasps (Order: Hymenoptera) \u2013 Robust Yellow Group | publisher=[[Chihuahuan Desert Nature Center and Botanical Gardens]] | access-date=August 11, 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062046/http://www.cdri.org/fieldguides/wasps/taxonomy/robust-yellow-group.html | archive-date=September 27, 2011 | df= }}</ref> The western cicada killer has rufous spots on its first to second tergites and yellow markings can generally be found from first to fifth, although there is some variation.<ref name=\"bionica\" /> On average, female [[forewing]] length lies between {{convert|2.5|and|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"jstor\" /> Females are larger than males and live for a year, a time just long enough to produce a brood, whereas the males die in only a few days, just enough time to impregnate a female.<ref name=\"cdri\" /> In Steven J.

The female ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' was originally distinguished from the female ''S. grandis'' by the yellow marks from the first to third gastral [[Tergum|tergites]] on ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' and yellow marks on all tergites for ''S.&nbsp;grandis''. However, this was found to be insufficient for correct identification because the positions of the markings can vary among different wasps of the same species.<ref name=\"bionica\" />\n\nCharles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho devised a new key in 2004 to identify the ''Sphecius'' species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female ''S. convallis'' wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' had 98% yellow markings from tergites one to five (or more). The 2% percent of ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' that overlapped with ''S.&nbsp;convallis'' were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on ''S.&nbsp;grandis'' males were found to be the same as on females.<ref name=\"bionica\" />\n\n===Thermoregulation===\nIt has been found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of [[thermoregulation]] which enables them to maintain territories during the day.<ref name=\"sasi\" /> A study by Joseph R.

English naturalist [[Charles Darwin]] postulated that the pattern of male emergence before females evolved by [[natural selection]] to improve the chances of the male mating.
