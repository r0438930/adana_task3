[[Estadio Azteca]], the nation's largest sports venue, served as their home venue until 1996, when they moved to the [[Estadio Azul]]. After 22 years the team returned to the ''Azteca'' at the conclusion of the [[2017-18 Liga MX season]]. Its headquarters are in La Noria, a suburb within [[Xochimilco]] in the southern part of Mexico City.<ref>http://stadiumdb.com/news/2017/04/mexico_city_cruz_azul_to_relocate_to_azteca</ref>\n\nCruz Azul has been the [[Liga MX|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] champion eight times, trailing [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]]'s 10, [[C.D. Guadalajara]]'s 12, and [[Club Am\u00e9rica]]'s 13. Cruz Azul's six titles makes it the second-most successful club in the history of the [[CONCACAF Champions League]], the most prestigious international club competition in North American football, trailing intracity rival Club America. Cruz Azul was also the first [[CONCACAF#Top clubs|CONCACAF]] team to reach the final of the [[Copa Libertadores]], the most prestigious club competition in South American football (which invited top Liga MX clubs from 1998 to 2017), losing on penalties to Argentine football giants [[Boca Juniors]] in [[2001 Copa Libertadores|2001]]. In the 1968\u201369 season, Cruz Azul was the first CONCACAF club (and third worldwide) to complete a rare [[Treble (association football)#Continental trebles|Continental Treble]], winning the Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n championship, the [[Copa MX|Copa M\u00e9xico]] national tournament, and the CONCACAF Champions League.\n\nThe [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics]], in its Club World Ranking for year ending December 31, 2014, places Cruz Azul as the 99th-best club in the world and the third-best club in CONCACAF.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iffhs.de/club-world-ranking-2014/ |title=World Club Ranking 2014 |publisher=[[International Federation of Football History & Statistics]] |date=2015-01-13 |accessdate=2015-03-25}}</ref> According to several polls published, Cruz Azul is the third-most popular team in Mexico, behind only C.D.

The founders were the workers of cement maker [[Cemento Cruz Azul]]; the team played in the town of Jasso (now part of the \"city cooperative\" [[:es:Ciudad Cooperativa Cruz Azul|Ciudad Cooperativa Cruz Azul]]) in the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. Cemento Cruz Azul was the only official sponsor until 1997, and remains a primary sponsor today.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Segundadiv.jpg|thumb|right|300px|the club playing in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] 1932|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 20 September 2009}}]] -->\nGuillermo \u00c1lvarez Marcia and [[Carlos Garc\u00e9s (Mexican footballer)|Carlos Garc\u00e9s]] were the main force behind the effort to organize the club, and the quick success of the team led to frequently representing the state of Hidalgo in national amateur tournaments.\n\n===1927\u20131960===\n\nFrom 1927 to 1960, the amateur team played many times in Mexico City against the reserve squads of established professional teams such as the Am\u00e9rica, the [[Necaxa]], the [[Atlante F.C.]], the [[Asturias F.C.]] and the [[Club Deportivo Marte]]. The Cemento Cruz Azul changed its name to the \"Cooperativa Cruz Azul\", and in 1960 the consistent success of the team caused the new administration of the cement company to build the [[Estadio 10 de Diciembre]] in Jasso. The team entered professional competition in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] for the 1960\u201361 season.\n\n===1960s\u20132000===\n\nHungarian coach Jorge Marik guided the team to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n championship for the 1963\u201364 season, elevating them to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n the following season. That season ended with an eighth-place finish. Four years later, the Cruz Azul won its first Primera Divisi\u00f3n league tournament, under coach [[Ra\u00fal C\u00e1rdenas]].\n\nBetween 1970\u20131980, the Cruz Azul led the Primera Divisi\u00f3n with six league tournament championships; four under C\u00e1rdenas and the last two under [[Ignacio Trelles]]. This powerful version of the team earned the nickname ''La M\u00e1quina Celeste'' (The Blue Machine), which continues as one of the unofficial nicknames of the team.\n\nThe team earned its eighth and most recent championship in [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Invierno 1997|1997]] under coach [[Luis Fernando Tena]], beating the [[Club Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] 2\u20131 on a last minute penalty kick scored by [[Carlos Hermosillo]]. This was still the quickest a Primera Divisi\u00f3n club had ever won eight championships, achieving the feat within 33 years of entering the Primera Divisi\u00f3n.\n\n===2000\u20132009===\n====Copa Libertadores 2001====\n{{Main|2001 Copa Libertadores|2001 Copa Libertadores Finals}}\nIn 2001, the Cruz Azul was invited to a tournament between select Mexican and Venezuelan teams that would then compete in the Copa Libertadores, a tournament of the best South American teams. The two best teams of this qualifying tournament earned immediate placement on the roster.\n\nThe Cruz Azul was one of the seeded teams and reached the 2001 Copa Libertadores final match. The Cruz Azul started the tournament in Group 7 along with teams such as the Sao Caetano, the Defensor Sporting, and Olmedo. The Cruz Azul finished as leader of the group with 13 points. In round 16 the Cruz Azul faced the [[Cerro Porte\u00f1o]]. The first leg was played in Asunci\u00f3n and the Cruz Azul lost 2\u20131. The second leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won the game 3\u20131. The aggregate score was 4\u20133 in favor of the Cruz Azul and they moved on to the quarterfinals.\n\nIn the quarterfinals the Cruz Azul faced [[CA River Plate]] of Argentina. The first leg of the match was played in [[Buenos Aires]] and ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The second leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won 3\u20130. The Cruz Azul was having a great run and played the [[Rosario Central]] in the semifinals. The first leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won the game 2\u20130. The second leg was played in Rosario in a very exciting match that ended in a 3\u20133 draw in favor of the Cruz Azul due to the 2\u20130 victory in the first leg.\n\nIn the final match The Cruz Azul played against the Argentinian club  the Boca Juniors, the Cruz Azul lost at home the first leg 1\u20130, but came back to win the second leg with the same score, at Boca's [[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|La Bombonera]] stadium with [[Paco Palencia]] scoring the goal. Until then, no team had ever won a Copa Libertadores final match there. After the overtime due to the tie, the championship was decided by penalty kicks, where the more experienced Boca Juniors prevailed. Still, Cruz Azul surprised everybody with the unprecedented feat of reaching the final and defeating established Argentinian teams such as Rosario Central and CA River Plate.\n\n====2006\u20132007====\n\nIn the 2006 Apertura, the team started off great but in the middle of the season, they had a hard time adding points on the board. Cruz Azul recovered and finished the regular season as the points leader. They have not won a title since the championship they won against Leon in 1997. For the Apertura 2006, Cruz Azul made it to the quarterfinals and faced Chivas in the [[Estadio Jalisco]]. In the first leg, Cruz Azul played a very poor game and lost 2\u20130. On November 25, 2006 Cruz Azul played the second leg at Estadio Azul and played a brilliant game. Cruz Azul started off strong and put Chivas keeper [[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez]] to the test on many occasions. In the middle of the first half, defender [[Salvador Carmona]] pushed a Chivas player in the penalty area and cost Cruz Azul a penalty.[[Ram\u00f3n Morales]] had no problem and put the score 1\u20130 in favor of Chivas in the 39th minute. Cruz Azul kept creating opportunities and at the end of the first half, [[C\u00e9sar Delgado]] made a great play that [[Richard N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] finished with a goal to tie the game right before halftime in the 45th minute. In the second half, Chivas scored thanks to Ram\u00f3n Morales again to put the score 2\u20131 in favor of Chivas. Cruz Azul did not give up and Miguel Sabah tied the game 2\u20132 in the 62nd minute. Cruz Azul played a great game and ended up tying the game 2\u20132 but losing 4\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nIn the 2007 Clausura the team had a great start, finishing among the first 8 teams in the league that went to playoffs. The team had a great quarterfinal series against the Tecos of the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guadalajara]], thanks to two magnificent goals from striker [[Richard N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] and moved to semifinals against Pachuca FC, the top team in the league. Pachuca beat Cruz Azul in the Estadio Azul in the first leg of the series with a strong 3\u20131. Cruz Azul still had a chance to overcome the adverse score, but on that same evening, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] communicated that team captain [[Salvador Carmona]] was declared ineligible with immediate and lifetime effect, because of a repeated doping indiscipline that occurred back in January 2006. The sanction was dated May 18, 2007, the very day of the first match against Pachuca. Arguing that player Salvador Carmona did play on that day for Cruz Azul, the Mexican Football Federation, aka Federacion Mexicana de Futbol sanctioned Cruz Azul by suspending the team one game from competition, under the argument of aligning an ineligible player. Many legal arguments have been raised by both the player's lawyer and Cruz Azul, but the sanction stood and Cruz Azul lost its opportunity to overcome the 3\u20131 and go to the final series against America. Cruz Azul had one of the best seasons of their victory against Mexiel.\n\n====Clausura 2008====\n\nIn the Clausura the team played a great tournament, finishing in second place. The team won 9 games, had 4 draws and lost only 4 times. In quarterfinals they played against Jaguares losing 1\u20130 in the first leg and winning 2\u20131 in the second leg with goals of [[Pablo Zeballos]] and [[Miguel Sabah]]. They moved to semifinals against San Luis, the first leg was played in San Luis and Cruz Azul won 0\u20131 with a goal of [[Miguel Sabah]]. In the second leg, Cruz Azul and San Luis played a formidable match that ended 1\u20131 with goals of [[Eduardo Coudet]] and [[Pablo Zeballos]]. In the final, Cruz Azul played against Santos Laguna, second place in the tournament. The first leg ended 1\u20132 with a victory for Santos, and in the second leg a 1\u20131 make Laguna team champions.\n\n====Apertura 2008====\n\nIn the Apertura the team had a good tournament, finishing in 5th place on the Mexican league. The team won 7 games, drew 5 times and lost only 5 times. In the quarterfinals they played against Pumas UNAM with a 0\u20130 scoreline in the first leg in the \"Estadio Azul\", and won 3\u20131 in the second leg, in the \"Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Universitario 1968\" leaving Pumas on the way. They moved to semifinals against Atlante, the first leg was played in Mexico City, and Cruz Azul won 3\u20131. In the second leg, Cruz Azul and Atlante played a regular match in Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo, that ended 1\u20131, resulting in Cruz Azul reaching the Final for the second consecutive time in 2008. In the final, Cruz Azul played against Toluca, both teams tied on winning Mexican titles (at that time with 8 each). The first leg played in Mexico City, and ended with a dramatic 0\u20132 with a victory for visitors, Toluca, and in the second leg, which was played at \"Estadio Nemesio D\u00edez\". Cruz Azul won 0\u20132, making the tie on aggregate \"2\u20132\", as the match was tied, they played \"extra time\" and the draw continued until going to the \"Penalty&nbsp;\u2013 Shoot out\", where Toluca won 7\u20136 over Cruz Azul, Alejandro Vela was the Cruz Azul \"villain\" because he failed the last \"penalty shoot-out\", another incident before the match went to \"extra time\", was a clear foul suffered by Villaluz on the Goal area, the toluca player \"Jose Manuel Cruz Alta\" crashed with the Cruz Azul player, making him unconscious, but the referee didn't mark the foul even though the Cruz Azul player was knocked out, he didn't even take a red card on the toluca player, (unfortunately Cruz Azul had made his 3 substitutions, so they ended the match playing with only 10 players, an unfair situation, that interfered directly on the final result of the match) this made the Toluca team becoming champions winning their 9th Mexican title, becoming the 3rd most successful of Mexican title winning teams.\n(1.-America  \"12 titles\", 2 . Guadalajara  \"11 titles\", 3.-Toluca \"10 titles\", 4.-Cruz Azul \"8 titles\", .- Pumas UNAM \"6 titles\", 6.- Club Le\u00f3n 7 titles, Club Pachuca \"5 titles\").\n\n====Clausura 2009====\n\n[[File:Cruz Azul Team l\u00e4uft auf.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Running the team of Cruz Azul before the game against Atlante on 28 February 2009.]]\nIn the Clausura 2009, the team had the worst tournament in club history en route to a last place finish. They accumulated just 13 points in 17 games, winning only two games, with seven draws and eight losses. The Club sacked their manager [[Benjam\u00edn Galindo]] with one game left in the Clausura. He was replaced for the remainder of the season by [[Robert Siboldi]] who was then coaching Cruz Azul's affiliate in Hidalgo.\n\n==== 2008\u201309 CONCACAF Champions League ====\n[[File:Cruz Azul vs Atlante 2009-04-22.svg|right|200px]]\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 CONCACAF Champions League, the team had a good tournament. In the first stage, they finished second in Group A, qualifying to the knockout stage. In the quarter-finals, they defeated Pumas UNAM, by 2\u20130; in the semi-finals, they defeated the Puerto Rico team of Islanders on penalties. In the final against Atlante, they lost the first game 0\u20132 and tied the second 0\u20130, losing on aggregate.\n\n====Apertura 2009====\n[[File:Monterrey vs CruzAzul 2009Apertura.svg|right|200px]]\n\nIn the Apertura 2009, the team had signed Javier Cambranis to manage the team, and signed several players, including the best goalkeeper on the previous Mexican tournament Jose de Jesus Corona, the Derby County Striker Emanuel \"Tito\" Villa, Ramon Nu\u00f1ez, and Emilio Hernandez. The team finished the regular season in second place with 33 points, winning 11 games of 17 played, and qualifying for the playoffs; Villa was the top scorer of the tournament with 17 goals.

Over the years, the concept is extended not only to those who worked in the cooperative, but the construction workers in general.\n* Liebres ([[hares]]): When the team was promoted to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n in the mid-1960s, the club played a fast and physical game.  These characteristics, coupled with their mostly white uniforms, led fans to compare the players of those years with the hares which abound in the town.  The nickname took hold, and an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] hare is often used as a mascot and icon to represent Cruz Azul. While some modern fans believe that the mascot is a rabbit, the club's board has officially declared that it is a hare.\n* La M\u00e1quina (the machine, the [[locomotive]]): This nickname is fed by several sources of inspiration.  One is based on a railway that brought the cement from the Cruz Azul plant, in the former village of Jasso (south of [[Tula de Allende]]), to Mexico City. After moving to Mexico City, Cruz Azul was the most dominant club in Mexico during the 1970s, reinforcing the nickname as a comparison to the image of a locomotive sweeping through their opponents. The name may have been borrowed from the similarly nicknamed [[History of Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate#1940s: \"La M\u00e1quina\"|River Plate]] club that motored through its opponents in the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] in the 1940s. It has been suggested that reporter Rugama Angel Fernandez was the first to publish an article with the name La M\u00e1quina for Cruz Azul. The nickname has some variations, including The Celestial Machine, The Blue Machine and The Cement Machine.\n\n==The Cheerleaders (Las Celestes)==\nThe club has its official cheerleading club, which were included as part of the institution since 2004, since then, act as [[cheerleader]]s in the proceedings of the club in their home games before and at halftime.\nFrom its appearance of \"Las Celestes\" have formed part of the tradition of the club.

Cruz Azul's six titles makes it the second-most successful club in the history of the [[CONCACAF Champions League]], the most prestigious international club competition in North American football, trailing intracity rival Club America. Cruz Azul was also the first [[CONCACAF#Top clubs|CONCACAF]] team to reach the final of the [[Copa Libertadores]], the most prestigious club competition in South American football (which invited top Liga MX clubs from 1998 to 2017), losing on penalties to Argentine football giants [[Boca Juniors]] in [[2001 Copa Libertadores|2001]].

The founders were the workers of cement maker [[Cemento Cruz Azul]]; the team played in the town of Jasso (now part of the \"city cooperative\" [[:es:Ciudad Cooperativa Cruz Azul|Ciudad Cooperativa Cruz Azul]]) in the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. Cemento Cruz Azul was the only official sponsor until 1997, and remains a primary sponsor today.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Segundadiv.jpg|thumb|right|300px|the club playing in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] 1932|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 20 September 2009}}]] -->\nGuillermo \u00c1lvarez Marcia and [[Carlos Garc\u00e9s (Mexican footballer)|Carlos Garc\u00e9s]] were the main force behind the effort to organize the club, and the quick success of the team led to frequently representing the state of Hidalgo in national amateur tournaments.\n\n===1927\u20131960===\n\nFrom 1927 to 1960, the amateur team played many times in Mexico City against the reserve squads of established professional teams such as the Am\u00e9rica, the [[Necaxa]], the [[Atlante F.C.]], the [[Asturias F.C.]] and the [[Club Deportivo Marte]]. The Cemento Cruz Azul changed its name to the \"Cooperativa Cruz Azul\", and in 1960 the consistent success of the team caused the new administration of the cement company to build the [[Estadio 10 de Diciembre]] in Jasso. The team entered professional competition in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] for the 1960\u201361 season.\n\n===1960s\u20132000===\n\nHungarian coach Jorge Marik guided the team to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n championship for the 1963\u201364 season, elevating them to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n the following season. That season ended with an eighth-place finish. Four years later, the Cruz Azul won its first Primera Divisi\u00f3n league tournament, under coach [[Ra\u00fal C\u00e1rdenas]].\n\nBetween 1970\u20131980, the Cruz Azul led the Primera Divisi\u00f3n with six league tournament championships; four under C\u00e1rdenas and the last two under [[Ignacio Trelles]]. This powerful version of the team earned the nickname ''La M\u00e1quina Celeste'' (The Blue Machine), which continues as one of the unofficial nicknames of the team.\n\nThe team earned its eighth and most recent championship in [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico Invierno 1997|1997]] under coach [[Luis Fernando Tena]], beating the [[Club Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] 2\u20131 on a last minute penalty kick scored by [[Carlos Hermosillo]]. This was still the quickest a Primera Divisi\u00f3n club had ever won eight championships, achieving the feat within 33 years of entering the Primera Divisi\u00f3n.\n\n===2000\u20132009===\n====Copa Libertadores 2001====\n{{Main|2001 Copa Libertadores|2001 Copa Libertadores Finals}}\nIn 2001, the Cruz Azul was invited to a tournament between select Mexican and Venezuelan teams that would then compete in the Copa Libertadores, a tournament of the best South American teams. The two best teams of this qualifying tournament earned immediate placement on the roster.\n\nThe Cruz Azul was one of the seeded teams and reached the 2001 Copa Libertadores final match. The Cruz Azul started the tournament in Group 7 along with teams such as the Sao Caetano, the Defensor Sporting, and Olmedo. The Cruz Azul finished as leader of the group with 13 points. In round 16 the Cruz Azul faced the [[Cerro Porte\u00f1o]]. The first leg was played in Asunci\u00f3n and the Cruz Azul lost 2\u20131. The second leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won the game 3\u20131. The aggregate score was 4\u20133 in favor of the Cruz Azul and they moved on to the quarterfinals.\n\nIn the quarterfinals the Cruz Azul faced [[CA River Plate]] of Argentina. The first leg of the match was played in [[Buenos Aires]] and ended in a 0\u20130 draw. The second leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won 3\u20130. The Cruz Azul was having a great run and played the [[Rosario Central]] in the semifinals. The first leg was played in Mexico and the Cruz Azul won the game 2\u20130. The second leg was played in Rosario in a very exciting match that ended in a 3\u20133 draw in favor of the Cruz Azul due to the 2\u20130 victory in the first leg.\n\nIn the final match The Cruz Azul played against the Argentinian club  the Boca Juniors, Cruz Azul lost at home the first leg 1\u20130, but came back to win the second leg with the same score, at Boca's [[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|La Bombonera]] stadium with [[Paco Palencia]] scoring the goal. Until then, no team had ever won a Copa Libertadores final match there. After the overtime due to the tie, the championship was decided by penalty kicks, where the more experienced Boca Juniors prevailed. Still, Cruz Azul surprised everybody with the unprecedented feat of reaching the final and defeating established Argentinian teams such as Rosario Central and CA River Plate.\n\n====2006\u20132007====\n\nIn the 2006 Apertura, the team started off great but in the middle of the season, they had a hard time adding points on the board. Cruz Azul recovered and finished the regular season as the points leader. They have not won a title since the championship they won against Leon in 1997. For the Apertura 2006, Cruz Azul made it to the quarterfinals and faced Chivas in the [[Estadio Jalisco]]. In the first leg, Cruz Azul played a very poor game and lost 2\u20130. On November 25, 2006 Cruz Azul played the second leg at Estadio Azul and played a brilliant game. Cruz Azul started off strong and put Chivas keeper [[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez]] to the test on many occasions. In the middle of the first half, defender [[Salvador Carmona]] pushed a Chivas player in the penalty area and cost Cruz Azul a penalty.[[Ram\u00f3n Morales]] had no problem and put the score 1\u20130 in favor of Chivas in the 39th minute. Cruz Azul kept creating opportunities and at the end of the first half, [[C\u00e9sar Delgado]] made a great play that [[Richard N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] finished with a goal to tie the game right before halftime in the 45th minute. In the second half, Chivas scored thanks to Ram\u00f3n Morales again to put the score 2\u20131 in favor of Chivas. Cruz Azul did not give up and Miguel Sabah tied the game 2\u20132 in the 62nd minute. Cruz Azul played a great game and ended up tying the game 2\u20132 but losing 4\u20132 on aggregate.\n\nIn the 2007 Clausura the team had a great start, finishing among the first 8 teams in the league that went to playoffs. The team had a great quarterfinal series against the Tecos of the [[Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Guadalajara]], thanks to two magnificent goals from striker [[Richard N\u00fa\u00f1ez]] and moved to semifinals against Pachuca FC, the top team in the league. Pachuca beat Cruz Azul in the Estadio Azul in the first leg of the series with a strong 3\u20131. Cruz Azul still had a chance to overcome the adverse score, but on that same evening, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] communicated that team captain [[Salvador Carmona]] was declared ineligible with immediate and lifetime effect, because of a repeated doping indiscipline that occurred back in January 2006. The sanction was dated May 18, 2007, the very day of the first match against Pachuca. Arguing that player Salvador Carmona did play on that day for Cruz Azul, the Mexican Football Federation, aka Federacion Mexicana de Futbol sanctioned Cruz Azul by suspending the team one game from competition, under the argument of aligning an ineligible player. Many legal arguments have been raised by both the player's lawyer and Cruz Azul, but the sanction stood and Cruz Azul lost its opportunity to overcome the 3\u20131 and go to the final series against America. Cruz Azul had one of the best seasons of their victory against Mexiel.\n\n====Clausura 2008====\n\nIn the Clausura the team played a great tournament, finishing in second place. The team won 9 games, had 4 draws and lost only 4 times. In quarterfinals they played against Jaguares losing 1\u20130 in the first leg and winning 2\u20131 in the second leg with goals of [[Pablo Zeballos]] and [[Miguel Sabah]]. They moved to semifinals against San Luis, the first leg was played in San Luis and Cruz Azul won 0\u20131 with a goal of [[Miguel Sabah]]. In the second leg, Cruz Azul and San Luis played a formidable match that ended 1\u20131 with goals of [[Eduardo Coudet]] and [[Pablo Zeballos]]. In the final, Cruz Azul played against Santos Laguna, second place in the tournament. The first leg ended 1\u20132 with a victory for Santos, and in the second leg a 1\u20131 make Laguna team champions.\n\n====Apertura 2008====\n\nIn the Apertura the team had a good tournament, finishing in 5th place on the Mexican league. The team won 7 games, drew 5 times and lost only 5 times. In the quarterfinals they played against Pumas UNAM with a 0\u20130 scoreline in the first leg in the \"Estadio Azul\", and won 3\u20131 in the second leg, in the \"Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Universitario 1968\" leaving Pumas on the way. They moved to semifinals against Atlante, the first leg was played in Mexico City, and Cruz Azul won 3\u20131. In the second leg, Cruz Azul and Atlante played a regular match in Canc\u00fan, Quintana Roo, that ended 1\u20131, resulting in Cruz Azul reaching the Final for the second consecutive time in 2008. In the final, Cruz Azul played against Toluca, both teams tied on winning Mexican titles (at that time with 8 each). The first leg played in Mexico City, and ended with a dramatic 0\u20132 with a victory for visitors, Toluca, and in the second leg, which was played at \"Estadio Nemesio D\u00edez\". Cruz Azul won 0\u20132, making the tie on aggregate \"2\u20132\", as the match was tied, they played \"extra time\" and the draw continued until going to the \"Penalty&nbsp;\u2013 Shoot out\", where Toluca won 7\u20136 over Cruz Azul, Alejandro Vela was the Cruz Azul \"villain\" because he failed the last \"penalty shoot-out\", another incident before the match went to \"extra time\", was a clear foul suffered by Villaluz on the Goal area, the toluca player \"Jose Manuel Cruz Alta\" crashed with the Cruz Azul player, making him unconscious, but the referee didn't mark the foul even though the Cruz Azul player was knocked out, he didn't even take a red card on the toluca player, (unfortunately Cruz Azul had made his 3 substitutions, so they ended the match playing with only 10 players, an unfair situation, that interfered directly on the final result of the match) this made the Toluca team becoming champions winning their 9th Mexican title, becoming the 3rd most successful of Mexican title winning teams.\n(1.-America  \"12 titles\", 2 . Guadalajara  \"11 titles\", 3.-Toluca \"10 titles\", 4.-Cruz Azul \"8 titles\", .- Pumas UNAM \"6 titles\", 6.- Club Le\u00f3n 7 titles, Club Pachuca \"5 titles\").\n\n====Clausura 2009====\n\n[[File:Cruz Azul Team l\u00e4uft auf.JPG|200px|thumb|right|Running the team of Cruz Azul before the game against Atlante on 28 February 2009.]]\nIn the Clausura 2009, the team had the worst tournament in club history en route to a last place finish. They accumulated just 13 points in 17 games, winning only two games, with seven draws and eight losses. The Club sacked their manager [[Benjam\u00edn Galindo]] with one game left in the Clausura. He was replaced for the remainder of the season by [[Robert Siboldi]] who was then coaching Cruz Azul's affiliate in Hidalgo.\n\n==== 2008\u201309 CONCACAF Champions League ====\n[[File:Cruz Azul vs Atlante 2009-04-22.svg|right|200px]]\n\nIn the 2008\u201309 CONCACAF Champions League, the team had a good tournament. In the first stage, they finished second in Group A, qualifying to the knockout stage. In the quarter-finals, they defeated Pumas UNAM, by 2\u20130; in the semi-finals, they defeated the Puerto Rico team of Islanders on penalties. In the final against Atlante, they lost the first game 0\u20132 and tied the second 0\u20130, losing on aggregate.\n\n====Apertura 2009====\n[[File:Monterrey vs CruzAzul 2009Apertura.svg|right|200px]]\n\nIn the Apertura 2009, the team had signed Javier Cambranis to manage the team, and signed several players, including the best goalkeeper on the previous Mexican tournament Jose de Jesus Corona, the Derby County Striker Emanuel \"Tito\" Villa, Ramon Nu\u00f1ez, and Emilio Hernandez. The team finished the regular season in second place with 33 points, winning 11 games of 17 played, and qualifying for the playoffs; Villa was the top scorer of the tournament with 17 goals.

Over the years, the concept is extended not only to those who worked in the cooperative, but the construction workers in general.\n* Liebres ([[hares]]): When the team was promoted to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n in the mid-1960s, the club played a fast and physical game.  These characteristics, coupled with their mostly white uniforms, led fans to compare the players of those years with the hares which abound in the town.  The nickname took hold, and an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] hare is often used as a mascot and icon to represent Cruz Azul. While some modern fans believe that the mascot is a rabbit, the club's board has officially declared that it is a hare.\n* La M\u00e1quina (the machine, the [[locomotive]]): This nickname is fed by several sources of inspiration.  One is based on a railway that brought the cement from the Cruz Azul plant, in the former village of Jasso (south of [[Tula de Allende]]), to Mexico City. After moving to Mexico City, Cruz Azul was the most dominant club in Mexico during the 1970s, reinforcing the nickname as a comparison to the image of a locomotive sweeping through their opponents. The name may have been borrowed from the similarly nicknamed [[History of Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate#1940s: \"La M\u00e1quina\"|River Plate]] club that motored through its opponents in the [[Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] in the 1940s. It has been suggested that reporter Rugama Angel Fernandez was the first to publish an article with the name La M\u00e1quina for Cruz Azul. The nickname has some variations, including The Celestial Machine, The Blue Machine and The Cement Machine.\n\n==The Cheerleaders (Las Celestes)==\nThe club has its official cheerleading club, which were included as part of the institution since 2004, since then, act as [[cheerleader]]s in the proceedings of the club in their home games before and at halftime.\nFrom its appearance of \"Las Celestes\" have formed part of the tradition of the club.
