The windmill is located at [[Thelnetham]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. It was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour. Thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until 1924, latterly on two sails, after which it became derelict.\n\nIn 1979, a group of enthusiasts purchased Thelnetham windmill for restoration. Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight-year period. The mill is open to the public, and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site.\n\nThe mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and winded by a fantail. It drives two pairs of millstones, with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine.\n\n==History==\n{{for|an explanation of the various items of machinery mentioned in the text|Mill machinery}}\nThe earliest record of a windmill in Thelnetham was a [[post mill]] which was shown of Joseph Hodgkinson's map of Suffolk of 1778.<ref name=SBPThistory>{{cite web |url=https://thelnethamwindmill.org.uk/history/ |title=History |publisher=Suffolk Building Preservation Trust |accessdate=15 July 2019}}</ref> In 1818, the post mill was moved to [[List of windmills in Norfolk#D|Sandy Lane]], [[Diss]], [[Norfolk]]<ref name=Rest1>{{cite book | first = | last = (Compilers Peter Dolman and Mark Barnard)|date=January 1981| title = Thelnetham Windmill, Report on the Restoration Programme Nov.1979-Dec.1980| pages = | publisher = Suffolk Mills Group| location = Ipswich}}</ref><ref name=Diss>{{cite web|url=http://www.norfolkmills.co.uk/Windmills/diss-sandy-lane-postmill.html |title=Diss Sandy Lane postmill |author= Jonathan Neville| publisher=Norfolk Mills |accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe post mill was replaced by a tower mill, which was built by [[millwright]] George Bloomfield for William Button in 1819.

William Button died on 11 February 1837. The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard.<ref name=Guide/>  Richard Button worked the mill until 1860, at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William, who sold it to Richard Peverett from [[Kenninghall]], Norfolk in 1862.<ref name=Rest1/>\n\nThe mill was worked by Stephen Peverett, Richard's son. He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879. In 1884, the mill was sold by auction, and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold.<ref name=Rest1/> Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill. From 1892, a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power, driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor. This was replaced in 1914 by a [[Richard Hornsby & Sons|Hornsby]] oil engine. Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to Alphonso Vincent, a retired millwright from [[Garboldisham]], Norfolk. The Hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s. The mill was tailwinded c1920, and as a result one pair of sails was removed. Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924. One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded.<ref name=Guide/><ref name=Tail>If the wind is blowing from the opposite direction to that which the mill it is facing, the mill is tailwinded.

Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill.\n\n===1979\u20131980===\n\nThe consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979. The first priority was to make the mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. [[Scaffolding]] was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.<ref name=Rest1/>\n\nA two-week work-in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980.<ref name=EADT040880/> Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the work-in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of [[Pitch Pine|pitch pine]] which had previously been in a [[Malthouse|maltings]] at [[Bury St Edmunds]].<ref name=Rest1/> On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections.<ref name=EADT040880>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Dreamers watch a mill take shape |url= |work= East Anglian Daily Times|publisher= Eastern Counties Newspapers|date=4 August 1980}}</ref>\n\nNew [[oak]] [[joist]]s were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was repairable. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a [[windmill sail|Common sail]]. Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the [[Eastbridge Windpump]], which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977,<ref name=Dolman2/> had been re-erected at the [[Museum of East Anglian Life]], [[Stowmarket]].<ref name=Rest1/>  The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows. A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed.<ref name=Rest1/>\n\nThe work was financed by grants of \u00a3500 from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex,<ref name=Thanks>In recognition of the work carried out by the Suffolk Mills Group between 1974 and 1978 on [[Ramsey Windmill, Essex|Ramsey Windmill]], [[Essex]]</ref> \u00a3250 from [[St Edmundsbury Borough Council]], \u00a3200 from the Scarfe Trust, and \u00a3200 from the Suffolk Mills Group. Other donations and income amounted to \u00a365, with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners.<ref name=Rest1/>\n\nThe \"work-in\" was reported in both local and national media, including [[BBC Look East|BBC ''Look East'']],<ref name=Rest1/>  ''Bury Free Press'',<ref name=BFP090580>''Bury Free Press'', 9 May 1980</ref><ref name=BFP150880>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=No trouble at mill |url= |work= Bury Free Press|publisher= |date= 15 August 1980}}</ref> ''[[Eastern Daily Press]]'',<ref name=EDP020880>{{cite news |first= |last= |title= Old mill will one day turn again|url= |work= Eastern Daily Press|publisher= Eastern Counties Newspapers|date= 2 August 1980}}</ref> ''[[East Anglian Daily Times]]'',<ref name=EADT040880/> ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'',<ref name=DT110880>{{cite news |first= |last= |title= MILL RENOVATION|url= |work= Daily Telegraph|publisher= Hollinger International|date=11 August 1980 }}</ref> and [[Radio Orwell]].<ref name=Rest1/>\n\n===1981===\n\nIn the 1981 season two separate work-ins were held, the first from 25 July to 2 August and the second from 22 August to 30 August. A total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks.<ref name=Rest2>{{cite book | first = | last = (Compiler Peter Dolman)|date=February 1982| title = Thelnetham Windmill, Report on the Restoration Programme 1981| pages = | publisher = Suffolk Mills Group| location = Ipswich}}</ref>\n\nThe [[millstone]]s were removed from the stone floor, which was then repaired. One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by [[Death Watch Beetle|Death Watch beetles]], and over a third of the [[elm]] beam was replaced with oak. The six supports for the hurst frame were repaired one at a time, as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above. One post required replacement. It had rotted and the floor had sunk by {{convert|4|in|mm}} causing the second main floor beam to fracture. When this work had been completed, the stone floor was removed, including the second main floor beam, which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed.<ref name=Rest2/>\n\nThe new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was concreted. The stone floor was reconstructed, reusing the old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse. Other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine. New floorboards were laid in the dust floor, the {{convert|1+1/4|in|mm}} thick elm boards being double-grooved with a metal tongue between them. Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration. The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them, aided by a [[beam compass|trammel]] attached to the upright shaft.<ref name=Rest2/>\n\nDuring the second work-in, the remainder of the stone floor was boarded, again using double-grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint. A new [[finial]] for the cap was made from a piece of oak {{convert|3|ft|mm}} long by {{convert|16|in|mm}} diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar.<ref name=Rest2/>\n\nAfter the work-in had finished, the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost \u00a33,250. Donations received were \u00a32,000 from Rank Xerox, \u00a31,704 from the [[Historic Buildings Council]] and \u00a3130 from [[St Edmundsbury Borough Council]]. Other donations and income received amounted to \u00a370. The project received further coverage in local media, the ''Eastern Daily Press'',<ref name=EDP270881/> and ''South Norfolk News''.<ref name=SNN280881>{{cite news |first= |last= |title= Neglected mill gets a new life|url= |work=South Norfolk News |publisher= |date=28 August 1981 }}</ref>\n\n===1982===\n\nThe 1982 work-ins took place from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows.<ref name=Rest2/> The cap frame was constructed,<ref name=Rest5/> incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.<ref name=Video/>\n\n===1983===\n\nWork in the early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of the various parts of the fantail drivetrain and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails. The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits, including one from the Wind and Watermill Section of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]]. Other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the {{convert|4|ft|7|in|m|2}} stones, including dismantling the stone nut and replacement of three cogs in [[beech]].<ref name=Rest4>{{cite book| first = | last = (No compiler stated)|date=March 1984| title = Thelnetham Windmill, Report on the Restoration Programme 1983| pages = | publisher = Thelnetham Mill Partnership and Suffolk Mills Group| location = Ipswich}}</ref>\n\nWhen the weather improved, work commenced outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermediate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a [[windlass]]. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and [[dwang|noggings]]. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.<ref name=Rest4/>\n\nBetween the two work-ins, the rear dormer was completed and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work-in. The boards for the cap are \u00bd inch (13&nbsp;mm) thick and {{convert|9|in|mm}} wide at the petticoat, tapering towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft, not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass, and the [[Galvanization|galvanised]] [[steel]] reinforcing band screwed into position, producing a sturdy structure. The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position. Repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work-in.<ref name=Rest4/>\n\nAfter the work-ins had ended, work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but the application of a modern [[Microporous material|microporous]] paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from [[Adnams Brewery]], [[Southwold]].<ref name=Rest4/>\n\nRestoration work in 1983 cost \u00a31,408. Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums, [[Blo' Norton]] [[Women's Institutes|Women's Institute]], Ipswich Historical Transport Society, the [[National Association for Gifted Children]], Mr D. Porter and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]]. Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by Wilf Foreman.<ref name=Rest2/><ref name=Rest4/>\n\n===1984===\n\nFour work-ins were held during 1984. The first two were by apprentices from [[Eastern Electricity Board]]. Thelnetham Windmill was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person's Development Project for that year. [[Pakenham, Suffolk|Pakenham]] [[Watermill]] had previously benefited from the project, and its owners, the Suffolk Preservation Trust, had suggested that Thelnetham Windmill would be a good candidate for the scheme. Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill. A mains [[electricity]] supply was provided. An underground cable was laid with assistance from [[British Telecom]] who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their [[BT Labs|research facility]] at [[Martlesham Heath]]. The thrust borer laid {{convert|25|yd|m}} of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position. The mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor.<ref name=Rest5>{{cite book| first = | last = (No compiler stated)| year = 1985| month = | title = Thelnetham Windmill, Report on the Restoration 1984| pages = | publisher = Thelnetham Mill Partnership and Suffolk Mills Group| location = Ipswich}}</ref>\n\nOther work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A [[French drain]] was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A {{convert|21|hp|kW}} [[Ruston & Hornsby]] 4YHR [[diesel engine]] had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nOff-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel {{convert|7|ft|2|in|m|2}} in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nThe fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from [[Douglas Fir|Douglas fir]]. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nThe stocks and sails were made during the two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or [[laminate]]d stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nThe {{convert|52|ft|m|2}} long stocks were made from Douglas fir.<ref name=Video/> All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was {{convert|1+1/2|in|mm}} thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work-in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use.<ref name=Rest5/> The stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs.<ref name=Video/>\n\nThe four sails were made. The originals being slightly different pairs. Those on the inner stock having bays of {{convert|3|ft|mm}} pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of {{convert|3|ft|2|in|mm}} pitch. It was decided that the new sails would be identical, at the larger pitch. Four {{convert|27|ft|m|2}} long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at Bury St Edmunds.<!--the same one? then \"the\" would indicate it--> The whips are  {{convert|6|in|mm}} square at their inner end. Sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine, selected for quality. The mortices for the sail bars were cut. That at the heel of the sail being at 27\u00b0 and that at the tip being 15\u00b0, decreasing by 1\u00bd\u00b0 at each sail bar. Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nThe fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill. At the end of the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] on the upright shaft by \u00bd inch (13&nbsp;mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> th of an inch (less than 1&nbsp;mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork.<ref name=Rest5/> The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.<ref name=Video/>\n\nWork later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nRestoration work in 1984 cost \u00a32,918. Grants received were \u00a31,209 from [[English Heritage]], \u00a3500 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council, Other donations amounted to \u00a352. Income from open days at the mill came to \u00a3151. A boost to the funds was \u00a32,000 from [[Hervey Benham]]. This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a [[Creeting St Mary Windmill|derelict post mill buck]] to Thelnetham. In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr Benham allowed the donation to remain with the Thelnetham Mill Preservation Trust. The project received further support in local media, including the ''East Anglian Daily Times'', one of the work-ins being featured on [[Anglia Television]]'s ''[[About Anglia]]'' programme.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\n===1985\u201387===\n\nWork planned for 1985 included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails.

The windmill is located at [[Thelnetham]], [[Suffolk]], [[England]]. It was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour. Thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until 1924, latterly on two sails, after which it became derelict.\n\nIn 1979, a group of enthusiasts purchased Thelnetham windmill for restoration. Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight-year period. The mill is open to the public, and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site.\n\nThe mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and winded by a fantail.

William Button died on 11 February 1837. The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard.<ref name=Guide/>  Richard Button worked the mill until 1860, at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William, who sold it to Richard Peverett from [[Kenninghall]], Norfolk in 1862.<ref name=Rest1/>\n\nThe mill was worked by Stephen Peverett, Richard's son. He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879. In 1884, the mill was sold by auction, and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold.<ref name=Rest1/> Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill. From 1892, a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power, driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor. This was replaced in 1914 by a [[Richard Hornsby & Sons|Hornsby]] oil engine. Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to Alphonso Vincent, a retired millwright from [[Garboldisham]], Norfolk. The Hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s. The mill was tailwinded c1920, and as a result one pair of sails was removed. Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924. One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded.<ref name=Guide/><ref name=Tail>If the wind is blowing from the opposite direction to that which the mill it is facing, the mill is tailwinded.

Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill.\n\n===1979\u20131980===\n\nThe consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979. The first priority was to make the mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. [[Scaffolding]] was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame.<ref name=Rest1/>\n\nA two-week work-in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980.<ref name=EADT040880/> Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the work-in.

The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was repairable. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a [[windmill sail|Common sail]]. Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the [[Eastbridge Windpump]], which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977,<ref name=Dolman2/> had been re-erected at the [[Museum of East Anglian Life]], [[Stowmarket]].<ref name=Rest1/>  The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows. A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed.<ref name=Rest1/>\n\nThe work was financed by grants of \u00a3500 from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex,<ref name=Thanks>In recognition of the work carried out by the Suffolk Mills Group between 1974 and 1978 on [[Ramsey Windmill, Essex|Ramsey Windmill]], [[Essex]]</ref> \u00a3250 from [[St Edmundsbury Borough Council]], \u00a3200 from the Scarfe Trust, and \u00a3200 from the Suffolk Mills Group.

One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by [[Death Watch Beetle|Death Watch beetles]], and over a third of the [[elm]] beam was replaced with oak. The six supports for the hurst frame were repaired one at a time, as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above. One post required replacement. It had rotted and the floor had sunk by {{convert|4|in|mm}} causing the second main floor beam to fracture. When this work had been completed, the stone floor was removed, including the second main floor beam, which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed.<ref name=Rest2/>\n\nThe new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was concreted. The stone floor was reconstructed, reusing the old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse. Other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine. New floorboards were laid in the dust floor, the {{convert|1+1/4|in|mm}} thick elm boards being double-grooved with a metal tongue between them. Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration. The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them, aided by a [[beam compass|trammel]] attached to the upright shaft.<ref name=Rest2/>\n\nDuring the second work-in, the remainder of the stone floor was boarded, again using double-grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint. A new [[finial]] for the cap was made from a piece of oak {{convert|3|ft|mm}} long by {{convert|16|in|mm}} diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar.<ref name=Rest2/>\n\nAfter the work-in had finished, the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost \u00a33,250. Donations received were \u00a32,000 from Rank Xerox, \u00a31,704 from the [[Historic Buildings Council]] and \u00a3130 from [[St Edmundsbury Borough Council]]. Other donations and income received amounted to \u00a370. The project received further coverage in local media, the ''Eastern Daily Press'',<ref name=EDP270881/> and ''South Norfolk News''.<ref name=SNN280881>{{cite news |first= |last= |title= Neglected mill gets a new life|url= |work=South Norfolk News |publisher= |date=28 August 1981 }}</ref>\n\n===1982===\n\nThe 1982 work-ins took place from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows.<ref name=Rest2/> The cap frame was constructed,<ref name=Rest5/> incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.<ref name=Video/>\n\n===1983===\n\nWork in the early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of the various parts of the fantail drivetrain and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails. The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits, including one from the Wind and Watermill Section of the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]]. Other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the {{convert|4|ft|7|in|m|2}} stones, including dismantling the stone nut and replacement of three cogs in [[beech]].<ref name=Rest4>{{cite book| first = | last = (No compiler stated)|date=March 1984| title = Thelnetham Windmill, Report on the Restoration Programme 1983| pages = | publisher = Thelnetham Mill Partnership and Suffolk Mills Group| location = Ipswich}}</ref>\n\nWhen the weather improved, work commenced outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a [[windlass]]. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and [[dwang|noggings]]. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.<ref name=Rest4/>\n\nBetween the two work-ins, the rear dormer was completed and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work-in. The boards for the cap are \u00bd inch (13&nbsp;mm) thick and {{convert|9|in|mm}} wide at the petticoat, tapering towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft, not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass, and the [[Galvanization|galvanised]] [[steel]] reinforcing band screwed into position, producing a sturdy structure. The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position. Repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work-in.<ref name=Rest4/>\n\nAfter the work-ins had ended, work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but the application of a modern [[Microporous material|microporous]] paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from [[Adnams Brewery]], [[Southwold]].<ref name=Rest4/>\n\nRestoration work in 1983 cost \u00a31,408. Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums, [[Blo' Norton]] [[Women's Institutes|Women's Institute]], Ipswich Historical Transport Society, the [[National Association for Gifted Children]], Mr D. Porter and the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]]. Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by Wilf Foreman.<ref name=Rest2/><ref name=Rest4/>\n\n===1984===\n\nFour work-ins were held during 1984. The first two were by apprentices from [[Eastern Electricity Board]]. Thelnetham Windmill was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person's Development Project for that year. [[Pakenham, Suffolk|Pakenham]] [[Watermill]] had previously benefited from the project, and its owners, the Suffolk Preservation Trust, had suggested that Thelnetham Windmill would be a good candidate for the scheme. Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill. A mains [[electricity]] supply was provided. An underground cable was laid with assistance from [[British Telecom]] who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their [[BT Labs|research facility]] at [[Martlesham Heath]]. The thrust borer laid {{convert|25|yd|m}} of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position. The mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor.<ref name=Rest5>{{cite book| first = | last = (No compiler stated)| year = 1985| month = | title = Thelnetham Windmill, Report on the Restoration 1984| pages = | publisher = Thelnetham Mill Partnership and Suffolk Mills Group| location = Ipswich}}</ref>\n\nOther work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A [[French drain]] was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A {{convert|21|hp|kW}} [[Ruston & Hornsby]] 4YHR [[diesel engine]] had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nOff-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel {{convert|7|ft|2|in|m|2}} in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nThe fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from [[Douglas Fir|Douglas fir]]. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nThe stocks and sails were made during the two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or [[laminate]]d stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nThe {{convert|52|ft|m|2}} long stocks were made from Douglas fir.<ref name=Video/> All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was {{convert|1+1/2|in|mm}} thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work-in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use.<ref name=Rest5/> The stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs.<ref name=Video/>\n\nThe four sails were made. The originals being slightly different pairs. Those on the inner stock having bays of {{convert|3|ft|mm}} pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of {{convert|3|ft|2|in|mm}} pitch. It was decided that the new sails would be identical, at the larger pitch. Four {{convert|27|ft|m|2}} long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at Bury St Edmunds.<!--the same one? then \"the\" would indicate it--> The whips are  {{convert|6|in|mm}} square at their inner end. Sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine, selected for quality. The mortices for the sail bars were cut. That at the heel of the sail being at 27\u00b0 and that at the tip being 15\u00b0, decreasing by 1\u00bd\u00b0 at each sail bar. Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nThe fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill. At the end of the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was [[Eccentric (mechanism)|eccentric]] on the upright shaft by \u00bd inch (13&nbsp;mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> th of an inch (less than 1&nbsp;mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork.<ref name=Rest5/> The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.<ref name=Video/>\n\nWork later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\nRestoration work in 1984 cost \u00a32,918. Grants received were \u00a31,209 from [[English Heritage]], \u00a3500 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council, Other donations amounted to \u00a352. Income from open days at the mill came to \u00a3151. A boost to the funds was \u00a32,000 from [[Hervey Benham]]. This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a [[Creeting St Mary Windmill|derelict post mill buck]] to Thelnetham. In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr Benham allowed the donation to remain with the Thelnetham Mill Preservation Trust. The project received further support in local media, including the ''East Anglian Daily Times'', one of the work-ins being featured on [[Anglia Television]]'s ''[[About Anglia]]'' programme.<ref name=Rest5/>\n\n===1985\u201387===\n\nWork planned for 1985 included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails. The external walls of the mill were tarred and internal walls plastered. Two work-ins were held, from 20 July to 28 July and 17 August to 26 August.<ref name=Rest5/> Further work over the next two years saw the restoration completed in 1987.<ref name=Guide/>\n\n===Restoration team===\n\nThe restoration of ''Thelnetham Windmill'' was made possible by the efforts of 135 individuals and 61 organisations. This was achieved by the donation of labour, plant, materials or grants of money, or by giving discounts for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project.<ref name=Rest1/><ref name=Video>{{cite video |people= Viv Codd|date= |title= Second Time Around|url= |format= |medium= motion picture|publisher= Viv Codd|location= Barham, Kent|accessdate= |time= |quote= }}</ref><ref name=Rest2/><ref name=Rest5/><ref name=Rest4/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Thelnetham 1989.jpg|thumb|The restored mill, May 1989]]\n''Terms explained in the [[Mill machinery]] article are in italics''\n;As built in 1819\nA four-storey tower mill with ''[[windmill sail#Common sails|Common sails]]'' carried on a wooden ''windshaft'', driving two pairs of ''overdrift [[millstone]]s''.
