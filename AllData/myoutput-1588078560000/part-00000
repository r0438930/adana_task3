Within a server, depending on access controls, users can create channels within a category framework, with the visibility and access on the channels also customizable to the server. One such customization is the ability to mark channels \"NSFW\" ([[Not safe for work]]), which forces first-time channel viewers to confirm that they are over 18 and willing to see such content. In addition to normal text-based channels, Discord servers can create voice-chat channels.\n\nEvery Discord user has a unique four-digit [[personal identification number]] discriminator, with a \"[[number sign|#]]\" after their username. This allows for multiple users to have the same username and for users to find friends easily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/217674288-Friends-List-101|title=Friends List 101|website=discordapp.com}}</ref>\n\nBoth at the server and the user level, Discord allows users to connect these to their [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or other gaming service account. These integrations provide unique messaging tools within the app: for example, Discord can determine the game a user is presently playing on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] if they have connected their account.\n\nThe Discord client is built on the [[Electron (software framework)|Electron]] framework using web technologies,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://electron.atom.io/apps/?q=discord|title=Apps Built on Electron|website=electron.atom.io|date=February 3, 2016|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref> which allows it to be multi-platform and operate on the web and as an installed application on personal computers.

Within a server, depending on access controls, users can create channels within a category framework, with the visibility and access on the channels also customizable to the server. One such customization is the ability to mark channels \"NSFW\" ([[Not safe for work]]), which forces first-time channel viewers to confirm that they are over 18 and willing to see such content. In addition to normal text-based channels, Discord servers can create voice-chat channels.\n\nEvery Discord user has a unique four-digit [[personal identification number]] discriminator, with a \"[[number sign|#]]\" after their username. This allows for multiple users to have the same username and for users to find friends easily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/217674288-Friends-List-101|title=Friends List 101|website=discordapp.com}}</ref>\n\nBoth at the server and the user level, Discord allows users to connect these to their [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or other gaming service account. These integrations provide unique messaging tools within the app: for example, Discord can determine the game a user is presently playing on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] if they have connected their account.\n\nThe Discord client is built on the [[Electron (software framework)|Electron]] framework using web technologies,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://electron.atom.io/apps/?q=discord|title=Apps Built on Electron|website=electron.atom.io|date=February 3, 2016|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref> which allows it to be multi-platform and operate on the web and as an installed application on personal computers.
