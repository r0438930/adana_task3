Opinion among the public was divided. The upper classes (the aristocracy and the rich bourgeoisie), the Catholic Church and the [[Spanish Army]] generally favoured the [[Central Powers]], usually identified with [[German Empire|Germany]]. Among political parties, the Germanophile tendency was represented among the reactionary [[Carlists]] and the conservative ''[[Mauristas]]'', followers of [[Antonio Maura]], who himself favoured closer ties with the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] because of Spain's [[Pact of Cartagena|1907 pact with Britain and France]], which was designed to head off German colonialism in north Africa. Pro-Allied sentiment, which was generally Francophile, was most common among the middle and professional classes and intellectuals. It was common among [[Catalan nationalists]], [[Radical Republican Party|Republicans]] and [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|Socialists]]. A few [[Liberal Party (Spain, 1880)|Liberals]], including [[\u00c1lvaro de Figueroa]], leader of the opposition in the ''Cortes'', were also pro-Allied.{{sfn|Romero|1999|pp=32\u201334}}\n\nAs early as August 1914, some Spaniards were volunteering in the [[French Army]], mainly the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]. In 1915, they founded their own magazine, ''Iberia'', to defend and propagate their cause. In February 1916, the ''Comit\u00e8 de Germanor'' (Committee of Brotherhood) was set up in Barcelona to recruit for the Legion. Over 2,000 Spaniards ultimately served in the Legion.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=35}} King Alfonso XIII also tried to help in the war by creating the [[European War Office]].\n\nIn 1916, the Fernando Po Affair threatened the Spanish neutrality.{{sfn|Strachan|2003|pp=612}}{{sfn|Murphy|2014}}\n\n==Effects of war==\nThough it remained one of few neutral countries in mainland Europe, Spain was still affected by the conflict in a variety of ways. Spain had believed that by remaining neutral, the nation would potentially benefit by the end of the war and hoped to emerge with significantly-enhanced prestige and power in a postwar Europe.{{sfn|Lowry|2009|p=ii}} The conflict had some positive effects for the Spanish, particularly in its economy. The Spanish economy, which had previously begun to industrialise, benefited from increased exporting of goods to the belligerent nations, including products such as steel and foodstuffs.{{sfn|McEvoy|2003}} Moreover, Spain's gold reserves more than tripled over the course of the war, allowing the government to significantly reduce its debts.{{sfn|McEvoy|2003}}  \n\nHowever, Spain also experienced negative impacts resulting from the war. With regard to its economy, the Spanish maritime trade was significantly impacted by German U-Boat campaigns, with an estimated 100 lives and 66 ships lost to the submarines.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}} Though Spanish industry in the north and the east of the country, expanded as demand rose among the warring powers for Spanish goods, the inflow of capital produced inflation and imports dropped, exacerbating the poverty of the rural areas and the south. The growing poverty intensified internal migration to the industrial areas, and the railway system was unable to bear the increased demand. The shortage of basic commodities became known as the ''crisis de subsistencias''. In 1915, food riots erupted in some cities, and in December 1915, the government resigned, to be replaced by a Liberal government under Figueroa.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=36}}\n\nIn July 1916, the two main trade unions, the socialist [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]] and the [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarchosyndicalist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]], joined forces to put pressure on the Liberal government. In March 1917, they even threatened to start a [[general strike]]. Their example inspired military officers to form unions of their own, the ''juntas de defensa''. The officers' goal was to prevent the passage of the Bill of Military Reform tabled in the ''Cortes'' in 1916, that sought to professionalise the military by introducing intellectual and physical tests as prerequisites for promotions; the ultimate goal being a reduction in the size of the bloated officers corps. The ''juntas de defensa'' demanded promotions and pay increases based strictly on seniority.{{sfn|Romero|1999|p=37}}\n\nThe war also had a significant impact on the construction program of the [[Spanish Navy]]. The second and third {{sclass-|Espa\u00f1a|battleship}}s, built in Spain between 1910 and 1919, were delayed significantly because of material shortages from Britain.{{sfn|Fitzsimons|1979|p=856}} Most importantly, the [[main battery]] guns for {{ship|Spanish battleship|Jaime I||2}} did not arrive until 1919, after the war had ended.{{sfn|Fern\u00e1ndez|Mitiukov|Crawford|2007|p=73}} The projected {{sclass-|Reina Victoria Eugenia|battleship|1}}s, which also would have relied heavily on imported guns and armour plate, were cancelled outright after the war started.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1985|p=438}}\n\nAlso significant were the social impacts of the war. Though Spain as a whole was neutral throughout the war, the conflict split the country into groups of 'Francophiles' and 'Germanophiles' who each sympathised with the opposing Entente and Central Powers, the rift being only deepened by the ongoing U-Boat campaign which continued to impact Spanish ships.{{sfn|Lowry|2009|p=4}} The Spanish public also became aware of the harsh realities of the war itself by contact with a migratory influx of approximately 10,000 Spanish workers who returned home from Belgium, France and Germany.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}}\n\nSpanish journalists also acted as war correspondents near the battlefront, keeping the public informed with regard to the conflict and conditions, with opposing viewpoints in these reports often also contributing to the varying sympathies of the country and the divide as a whole.{{sfn|Sanz|2018}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n==External Links==\n* Articles relating to [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/regions/Spain Spain] at the International Encyclopedia of the First World War.\n* Ponce, Javier: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/spain Spain] , in: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/home/ 1914-1918-online.
