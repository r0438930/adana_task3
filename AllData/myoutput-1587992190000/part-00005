They were usurped by the [[British East India Company]] between early and mid 19th century, following the British victory in the [[Anglo-Sikh wars]].\n\n==Historiography==\nModern historical works written on Medieval India have received some criticism from scholars studying the [[historiography]] of the period. E. Sreedharan argues that, after [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Indian independence]] up until the 1960s, Indian historians were often motivated by [[Indian nationalism]].<ref>[https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/A_Textbook_of_Historiography_500_B_C_to.html?id=jJVoi3PIejwC&redir_esc=y ''A Textbook of Historiography, 500 B.C. to A.D. 2000''] by E.

He argues that there is no clear sharp distinction between when the ancient period ended and when the medieval period began, noting dates ranging from the 7th century to the 13th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sharma |first1=Ram Sharan |title=Early Medieval Indian Society (pb) |date=2003 |publisher=[[Orient Blackswan]] |isbn=9788125025238 |pages=17\u201318 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_sIE1sO5kwC&pg=PA17}}</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Avari, Burjor, ''India: The Ancient Past: A History of the Indian Subcontinent from C. 7000 BCE to CE 1200'', 2016 (2nd edn), Routledge, {{ISBN|1317236734}}, 9781317236733, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WTaTDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover google books]\n*Farooqui, Salma Ahmed, ''A Comprehensive History of Medieval India: From Twelfth to the Mid-Eighteenth Century'', 2011, Pearson Education India, {{ISBN|8131732029}}, 9788131732021, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sxhAtCflwOMC&printsec=frontcover google books]\n*Harle, J.C., ''The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent'', 2nd edn. 1994, Yale University Press Pelican History of Art, {{ISBN|0300062176}} \n*[[John Keay|Keay, John]], ''India: A History'', 2000, HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0002557177}}\n*Michell, George, (1977) ''The Hindu Temple: An Introduction to its Meaning and Forms'', 1977, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0-226-53230-1}}\n*Rowland, Benjamin, ''The Art and Architecture of India: Buddhist, Hindu, Jain'', 1967 (3rd edn.), Pelican History of Art, Penguin, {{ISBN|0140561021}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin|40em}} \n* Satish Chandra; Historiography, Religion and State in Medieval India, Har-Anand Publications, 2010.\n* Elliot and Dowson: [[The History of India as told by its own Historians]], New Delhi reprint, 1990.\n* Elliot, Sir H.
