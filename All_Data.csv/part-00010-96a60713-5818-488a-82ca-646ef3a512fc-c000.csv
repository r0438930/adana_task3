The '''Siachen conflict''', sometimes referred to as the '''Siachen War''', was a military conflict between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] over the disputed [[Siachen Glacier]] region in [[Kashmir]].

==Causes==

[[File:Un-kashmir-jammu.png|thumb|right|UN map of Siachen]]

The Siachen Glacier is the highest battleground on earth,<ref>VAUSE, Mikel.  Peering Over the Edge: The Philosophy of Mountaineering, p. 194.</ref><ref>CHILD, Greg.  Mixed Emotions: Mountaineering Writings, p. 147.</ref> where [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have fought intermittently since 13 April 1984. Both countries maintain a permanent military presence in the region at a height of over {{convert|6000|m}}. More than 2000 people have died in this inhospitable terrain, mostly due to weather extremes and the natural hazards of [[mountain warfare]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The conflict in Siachen stems from the incompletely demarcated territory on the map beyond the map coordinate known as [[NJ9842]] ({{Coord|35.008371|77.008805}}). The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>

===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===
Following the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,<ref name=\":0\" /> but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

Paragraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:
{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease-fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}

Later, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the \"Line of Control\" extending from the \"''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''\"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers.\"'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.<ref name=\":0\" />  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:<blockquote>''\"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842\"''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&lpg=PA61&dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2 September 2003}}</ref></blockquote> The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL – UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

=== Oropolitics ===
In 1949, a Cease-Fire Line Agreement (CFL) was signed and ratified by India, Pakistan and the UN Military Observer Group that delineated the entire CFL. In 1956–58, a scientific team led by the [[Geological Survey of India]] recorded its findings publicly including information about the Siachen and other glaciers.<ref name=\"tribune\" />

After Pakistan ceded the {{cvt|5180|sqkm|adj=on}} [[Shaksgam Valley]] to China in a boundary agreement in 1963, Pakistan started giving approval to western expeditions to the east of [[K2|mountain K2]].<ref name=tribune>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm Facts vs bluff on Siachen, Kayani's suggestion worth pursuing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422175121/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm |date=22 April 2012 }}, B.G. Verghese, Saturday, 21 April 2012, Chandigarh, India</ref> In 1957 Pakistan permitted a British expedition under [[Eric Shipton]] to approach the Siachen glacier through the Bilafond La, and recce [[Saltoro Kangri]].<ref>Himalayan Journal Vol. 21</ref> Five years later a Japanese-Pakistani expedition put two Japanese and a Pakistani Army climber on top of [[Saltoro Kangri]].<ref>Himalayan Journal Vol. 25</ref> These were early moves in this particular game of [[oropolitics]].

In the 1970s and early 1980s several [[mountaineering]] expeditions applied to Pakistan to climb high peaks in the Siachen area due in part to US Defense Mapping Agency and most other maps and atlases showing it on the Pakistani side of the line. Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H. Katayama, which approached through Pakistan via the Bilafond La.<ref>SANGAKU 71</ref>

In 1978 a German Siachen-Kondus Expedition under the leadership of Jaroslav Poncar (further members Volker Stallbohm and Wolfgang Kohl, liaison officer major Asad Raza) entered Siachen via Bilafond La and established the base camp on the confluence of Siachen and Teram Shehr. The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.

Prior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>

The first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph – Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>

==Military expeditions==

In 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.

==Major combat operations==

At army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits—twice as many as we had—and rushed their men up to Siachen\". The acquisition of key supplies needed for operations in glaciated zones marked the start of major combat operations on the glacier.<ref name=\"story\"/> [[File:Dogra Siachen.jpg|thumb|right|A memorial at the headquarters of the [[Dogra Regiment]] of the Indian Army in remembrance of members of the regiment who died or served in the Siachen Conflict.]]

April 1984 [[Operation Meghdoot]]: Indian Army under the leadership of Lt. Gen. [[Manohar Lal Chibber]], Maj. Gen. Shiv Sharma, and Lt. Gen. [[Prem Nath Hoon|P. N. Hoon]] learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian Army launched an operation to preempt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army.  Men of the Ladakh Scouts and [[Kumaon Regiment]] occupy Bilafond La on 13 April and Sia La on 17 April 1984 with the help of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes. This operation led by the Pakistan Army led to the first armed clash on the glacier on 25 April 1984.<ref name=\"India Defence Review D.P.

June – July 1987: [[Operation Rajiv]]: Over the next three years, with Indian troops positioned at the critical passes, Pakistan Army attempted to seize heights overlooking the passes. One of the biggest successes achieved by Pakistan in this period was the seizure of a feature overlooking Bilafond La. This feature was named \"Qaid Post\" and for three years it dominated Indian positions on the glacier.

In the book ''Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia: The Causes and Consequences of the Kargil Conflict'', Khan, Lavoy and Clary wrote: <blockquote>The Pakistan army sees India's 1984 occupation of the Siachen Glacier as a major scar, outweighed only by Dhaka's fall in 1971. The event underscored the dilution of the Simla Agreement and became a domestic issue as political parties, led by Benazir Bhutto's Peoples Party, blamed an incompetent military government under Zia ul-Haq for failing to defend Pakistani-held territory — while Zia downplayed the significance of the loss.{{sfn|Lavoy|2009|p=75}}</blockquote>

General [[Ved Prakash Malik]], in his book ''Kargil from Surprise to Victory'', wrote: <blockquote>Siachen is considered a military setback by the Pakistan Army. That the Indians dominate the area from the Saltoro Ridge and Pakistani troops are nowhere near the Siachen Glacier is a fact never mentioned in public. The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army. [[Pervez Musharraf]] had himself once commanded the [[Special Services Group]] (SSG) troops in this area and made several futile attempts to capture Indian posts.{{sfn|Malik|2006|p=54}}</blockquote>

==Severe conditions==
A cease-fire went into effect in 2003.  Even before then, every year more soldiers were killed because of severe weather than enemy firing. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200&nbsp;million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>

The '''Siachen conflict''', sometimes referred to as the '''Siachen War''', was a military conflict between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] over the disputed [[Siachen Glacier]] region in [[Kashmir]].

[[File:Un-kashmir-jammu.png|thumb|right|UN map of Siachen]]

The Siachen Glacier is the highest battleground on earth,<ref>VAUSE, Mikel.  Peering Over the Edge: The Philosophy of Mountaineering, p. 194.</ref><ref>CHILD, Greg.  Mixed Emotions: Mountaineering Writings, p. 147.</ref> where [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have fought intermittently since 13 April 1984. Both countries maintain a permanent military presence in the region at a height of over {{convert|6000|m}}. More than 2000 people have died in this inhospitable terrain, mostly due to weather extremes and the natural hazards of [[mountain warfare]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

The conflict in Siachen stems from the incompletely demarcated territory on the map beyond the map coordinate known as [[NJ9842]] ({{Coord|35.008371|77.008805}}). The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>

===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===
Following the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier. The largely inaccessible terrain beyond this point was not demarcated,<ref name=\":0\" /> but delimited as '''thence north to the glaciers''' in paragraph B 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

Paragraph B 2 (d) of 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] states:
{{quotation| (d) From Dalunang eastwards the cease-fire line will follow the general line point 15495, Ishman, Manus, Gangam, Gunderman, Point 13620, Funkar (Point 17628), Marmak, Natsara, Shangruti (Point 1,531), Chorbat La (Point 16700), Chalunka (on the Shyok River), Khor, '''thence north to the glaciers'''. This portion of the cease-fire line shall be demarcated in detail on the basis of the factual position as of 27 July 1949, by the local commanders assisted by United Nations military observers.}}

Later, following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and the [[Simla Agreement]] in July 1972, the ceasefire line was converted into the \"Line of Control\" extending from the \"''Chhamb sector on the international border [to] the Turtok-Partapur sector in the north.''\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The detailed description of its northern end stated that from Chimbatia in the Turtok sector ''\"the line of control runs north-eastwards to Thang (inclusive to India), thence eastwards joining the glaciers.\"'' This vague formulation further sowed the seed for the bitter dispute to follow.<ref name=\":0\" />  The general description of CFL given in Section 1 of Karachi Agreement is further explained at Page 38 where it states:<blockquote>''\"thence northwards along the boundary line going through Point 18402 up to NJ-9842\"''<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|author1=P R Chari|author2=Pervaiz Iqbal Cheema|author3=Stephen P Cohen|title=Perception, Politics and Security in South Asia: The Compound Crisis of 1990 (2003)|publisher=Routledge (London); 1 edition (May 16, 2003)|isbn=978-0415307970|page=53|edition=2003|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AW3zXB85gNoC&lpg=PA61&dq=none+of+these+explanations+are+mutually+exclusive+and+none+seem+to+fully+explain+the+onset&pg=PA53#v=onepage&q&f=true|accessdate=4 June 2015|date=2 September 2003}}</ref></blockquote> The [[United Nations|U.N.]] document number S/1430/Add.2.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Map showing CFL – UN document number S/1430/Add.2|url=http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|website=Dag Digital Library|accessdate=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://repository.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/87063/S_1430_Add.2-EN.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y|archive-date=18 January 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the second [[addendum]] to the 1949 Karachi Agreement, and shows the CFL marked on the Map of the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as per the explanation of CFL in paragraph 'B' 2 (d) of the Karachi Agreement.

=== Oropolitics ===
In 1949, a Cease-Fire Line Agreement (CFL) was signed and ratified by India, Pakistan and the UN Military Observer Group that delineated the entire CFL. In 1956–58, a scientific team led by the [[Geological Survey of India]] recorded its findings publicly including information about the Siachen and other glaciers.<ref name=\"tribune\" />

After Pakistan ceded the {{cvt|5180|sqkm|adj=on}} [[Shaksgam Valley]] to China in a boundary agreement in 1963, Pakistan started giving approval to western expeditions to the east of [[K2|mountain K2]].<ref name=tribune>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm Facts vs bluff on Siachen, Kayani's suggestion worth pursuing] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422175121/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2012/20120421/edit.htm |date=22 April 2012 }}, B.G. Verghese, Saturday, 21 April 2012, Chandigarh, India</ref> In 1957 Pakistan permitted a British expedition under [[Eric Shipton]] to approach the Siachen glacier through the Bilafond La, and recce [[Saltoro Kangri]].<ref>Himalayan Journal Vol. 21</ref> Five years later a Japanese-Pakistani expedition put two Japanese and a Pakistani Army climber on top of [[Saltoro Kangri]].<ref>Himalayan Journal Vol. 25</ref> These were early moves in this particular game of [[oropolitics]].

In the 1970s and early 1980s several [[mountaineering]] expeditions applied to Pakistan to climb high peaks in the Siachen area due in part to US Defense Mapping Agency and most other maps and atlases showing it on the Pakistani side of the line. Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H. Katayama, which approached through Pakistan via the Bilafond La.<ref>SANGAKU 71</ref>

In 1978 a German Siachen-Kondus Expedition under the leadership of Jaroslav Poncar (further members Volker Stallbohm and Wolfgang Kohl, liaison officer major Asad Raza) entered Siachen via Bilafond La and established the base camp on the confluence of Siachen and Teram Shehr. The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.

Prior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>

The first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph – Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>

==Military expeditions==

In 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.

==Major combat operations==

At army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits—twice as many as we had—and rushed their men up to Siachen\". The acquisition of key supplies needed for operations in glaciated zones marked the start of major combat operations on the glacier.<ref name=\"story\"/> [[File:Dogra Siachen.jpg|thumb|right|A memorial at the headquarters of the [[Dogra Regiment]] of the Indian Army in remembrance of members of the regiment who died or served in the Siachen Conflict.]]

April 1984 [[Operation Meghdoot]]: Indian Army under the leadership of Lt. Gen. [[Manohar Lal Chibber]], Maj. Gen. Shiv Sharma, and Lt. Gen. [[Prem Nath Hoon|P. N. Hoon]] learned of the plan by Pakistan Army to seize Sia La, and Bilafond La, on the glacier. Indian Army launched an operation to preempt the seizure of the passes by the Pakistan Army.  Men of the Ladakh Scouts and [[Kumaon Regiment]] occupy Bilafond La on 13 April and Sia La on 17 April 1984 with the help of the [[Indian Air Force]]. Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes. This operation led by the Pakistan Army led to the first armed clash on the glacier on 25 April 1984.<ref name=\"India Defence Review D.P.

June – July 1987: [[Operation Rajiv]]: Over the next three years, with Indian troops positioned at the critical passes, Pakistan Army attempted to seize heights overlooking the passes. One of the biggest successes achieved by Pakistan in this period was the seizure of a feature overlooking Bilafond La. This feature was named \"Qaid Post\" and for three years it dominated Indian positions on the glacier. Pakistani Army held Qaid post overlooked Bilafond La area and offered an excellent vantage point to view Indian Army activities. On 25 June 1987 Indian Army under the leadership of Brig. Gen. Chandan Nugyal, Major Varinder Singh, Lt.

American observers say that the military conflict between India and Pakistan over the Siachen Glacier \"made no military or political sense\".<ref name=\"India Changes Course\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8p19H4UwE_AC&pg=PA109 |title=India Changes Course: Golden Jubilee to Millennium |last=Dettman |first=Paul R.  |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2001 |isbn=9780275973087 |edition=illustrated |page=109}}</ref> 
An article in the [[Minneapolis Star Tribune]] stated: \"Their combat over a barren, uninhabited world of questionable value is a forbidding symbol of their lingering, irreconcilability.\"<ref name=\"India Changes Course\" /> [[Stephen P. Cohen]] compared the conflict to \"a struggle between two bald men over a comb. Siachen is a symbol of the worst aspects of their relationship.\"<ref name=\"India Changes Course\" />

In the book ''Asymmetric Warfare in South Asia: The Causes and Consequences of the Kargil Conflict'', Khan, Lavoy and Clary wrote: <blockquote>The Pakistan army sees India's 1984 occupation of the Siachen Glacier as a major scar, outweighed only by Dhaka's fall in 1971. The event underscored the dilution of the Simla Agreement and became a domestic issue as political parties, led by Benazir Bhutto's Peoples Party, blamed an incompetent military government under Zia ul-Haq for failing to defend Pakistani-held territory — while Zia downplayed the significance of the loss.{{sfn|Lavoy|2009|p=75}}</blockquote>

General [[Ved Prakash Malik]], in his book ''Kargil from Surprise to Victory'', wrote: <blockquote>Siachen is considered a military setback by the Pakistan Army. That the Indians dominate the area from the Saltoro Ridge and Pakistani troops are nowhere near the Siachen Glacier is a fact never mentioned in public. The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army. [[Pervez Musharraf]] had himself once commanded the [[Special Services Group]] (SSG) troops in this area and made several futile attempts to capture Indian posts.{{sfn|Malik|2006|p=54}}</blockquote>

==Severe conditions==
A cease-fire went into effect in 2003.  Even before then, every year more soldiers were killed because of severe weather than enemy firing. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200&nbsp;million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>

The Reverend [[Mark R.

In December 1863, [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto, \"In God We Trust,\" to engrave on U.S. coins. Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.<ref>According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted \"doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval\".
</ref>

A version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the [[Interest bearing note#Denominational set of interest bearing notes|twenty dollar interest bearing note]] issued in 1864 along with the motto \"God and our Right\".

As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837, prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the [[Coinage Act of 1864]] on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.<ref name=\"history\" />

An Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that \"shall admit the inscription thereon\".<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=CR1956p13917>[http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf ''Congressional Record'', 1956, p. 13917] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106115209/http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}, via NonBeliever.org</ref> In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury \"may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto\".

A similar phrase, 'In God is our Trust', appears in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the song adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931. Written by [[Francis Scott Key]] during the [[War of 1812]], the fourth stanza includes the words, \"And this be our motto: 'In God is our Trust'\".<!--, which was adapted as the national motto.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://time.com/4179685/in-god-we-trust-currency-history/ |title=How 'In God We Trust' Got on the Currency in the First Place |first=Sarah |last=Begley |magazine=Time |date=January 13, 2016 |access-date=February 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302112901/http://time.com/4179685/in-god-we-trust-currency-history/ |archive-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live |quote=Congress passed his act requesting the addition of “In God We Trust,” adapted from a lesser-known verse of Francis Scott Key’s “Star-Spangled Banner,” and the first two-cent coin with the phrase was minted in 1864.}}</ref>{{better source|reason=We have one 2016 article that mentions this supposed concious adaptation, but are there any other secondary sources that make this claim?

After use of the motto on coins began during the 1860's, there have been some coins on which the motto did not appear. The motto disappeared from the five-cent coin in 1883, and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938.<ref name=\"history\"/> However, at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} including the [[Morgan dollar]] and the [[United States Seated Liberty coinage|Seated Liberty half dollar]]. The omission of the motto \"In God We Trust\" on the [[Indian Head eagle]] coin caused public outrage, and prompted [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a bill mandating its inclusion.  Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design. In 1908, Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on all coins upon which it had previously appeared. This decision was motivated after a public outcry following the release of a $20 coin which did not bear the motto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.republicanpresidents.net/10-interesting-facts-about-theodore-roosevelt/ |title=10 Interesting Facts About Theodore Roosevelt |publisher=Republicanpresidents.net |date= 2009-03-04|accessdate=2014-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217130709/http://www.republicanpresidents.net/10-interesting-facts-about-theodore-roosevelt/ |archive-date=2014-02-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> The motto has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, and on the ten-cent coin since 1916.

Celador allowed Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife retry the show after the company claimed that the last question \"didn't meet their standards\".

==Criticism==
The constitutionality of the phrase \"In God We Trust\" has been upheld according to the judicial interpretation of [[accommodationism]], whose adherents state that this entrenched practice has not historically presented any constitutional difficulty, is not coercive, and does not prefer one religious denomination over another.<ref name=\"Views\" />  In ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'' (1952), the Supreme Court also wrote that the nation's \"institutions presuppose a Supreme Being\" and that government recognition of [[God]] does not constitute the establishment of a state church as the Constitution's authors intended to prohibit.<ref name=ABA>{{cite book|title=ABA Journal Sep 1962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gymQ6vWfA3QC&pg=PA817&dq=Zorach+v.+Clauson+++In+God+We+Trust#v=onepage&q=Zorach%20v.%20Clauson%20%20%20In%20God%20We%20Trust&f=false|quote=Much more recently, in 1952, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas in ''Zorach v.

Mr. Justice Brewer in the ''Holy Trinity'' case, ''supra'', mentioned many of these evidences of religion, and Mr. Justice Douglas in the ''Zorach'' case referred to&nbsp;...

To this list may be added tax exemption of churches, chaplaincies in the armed forces, the \"Pray for Peace\" postmark, the widespread observance of Christmas holidays, and, in classrooms, singing the fourth stanza of ''America'' which is prayer invoking the protection of God, and the words \"in God is our trust\" as found in the National Anthem, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, modified by an Act of Congress of June 14, 1954, to include the words \"under God.|access-date=September 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119065015/https://books.google.com/books?id=gymQ6vWfA3QC&pg=PA817&dq=Zorach+v.+Clauson+++In+God+We+Trust#v=onepage&q=Zorach%20v.%20Clauson%20%20%20In%20God%20We%20Trust&f=false|archive-date=November 19, 2016|url-status=live|date = September 1962}}</ref>

Newdow stated that he would appeal the ruling,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199211,00.html | title=Federal Judge Nixes 'In God We Trust' Lawsuit | publisher=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=2006-06-12 | access-date=2018-02-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021151309/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199211,00.html | archive-date=2012-10-21 | url-status=dead }}</ref> although ''Aronow'' was decided on the same grounds in the Ninth Circuit and the lower court was required to return the same ruling, likewise the Ninth Circuit does not traditionally overrule previous Ninth Circuit rulings.

Chase]] acted on this proposal and directed the then-Philadelphia [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]], [[James Pollock]], to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase. Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to Congress for the new designs in late 1863.<ref>Duncan, Ann W. (2008).

In December 1863, [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto, \"In God We Trust,\" to engrave on U.S. coins. Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.<ref>According to The ''Congressional Record'' (1908, House), p. 3387, the motto was adopted \"doubtless with his [Lincoln's] knowledge and approval\".
</ref>

A version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the [[Interest bearing note#Denominational set of interest bearing notes|twenty dollar interest bearing note]] issued in 1864 along with the motto \"God and our Right\".

As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837, prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the [[Coinage Act of 1864]] on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.<ref name=\"history\" />

An Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that \"shall admit the inscription thereon\".<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=CR1956p13917>[http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf ''Congressional Record'', 1956, p. 13917] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106115209/http://www.nonbeliever.org/images/CR102-13917.pdf |date=2009-01-06 }}, via NonBeliever.org</ref> In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury \"may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto\".

A similar phrase, 'In God is our Trust', appears in \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", the song adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931. Written by [[Francis Scott Key]] during the [[War of 1812]], the fourth stanza includes the words, \"And this be our motto: 'In God is our Trust'\".<!--, which was adapted as the national motto.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://time.com/4179685/in-god-we-trust-currency-history/ |title=How 'In God We Trust' Got on the Currency in the First Place |first=Sarah |last=Begley |magazine=Time |date=January 13, 2016 |access-date=February 24, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180302112901/http://time.com/4179685/in-god-we-trust-currency-history/ |archive-date=March 2, 2018 |url-status=live |quote=Congress passed his act requesting the addition of “In God We Trust,” adapted from a lesser-known verse of Francis Scott Key’s “Star-Spangled Banner,” and the first two-cent coin with the phrase was minted in 1864.}}</ref>{{better source|reason=We have one 2016 article that mentions this supposed concious adaptation, but are there any other secondary sources that make this claim?

After use of the motto on coins began during the 1860's, there have been some coins on which the motto did not appear. The motto disappeared from the five-cent coin in 1883, and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938.<ref name=\"history\"/> However, at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} including the [[Morgan dollar]] and the [[United States Seated Liberty coinage|Seated Liberty half dollar]]. The omission of the motto \"In God We Trust\" on the [[Indian Head eagle]] coin caused public outrage, and prompted [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass a bill mandating its inclusion.  Mint Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] added the words and made minor modifications to the design. In 1908, Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on all coins upon which it had previously appeared. This decision was motivated after a public outcry following the release of a $20 coin which did not bear the motto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.republicanpresidents.net/10-interesting-facts-about-theodore-roosevelt/ |title=10 Interesting Facts About Theodore Roosevelt |publisher=Republicanpresidents.net |date= 2009-03-04|accessdate=2014-02-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140217130709/http://www.republicanpresidents.net/10-interesting-facts-about-theodore-roosevelt/ |archive-date=2014-02-17 |url-status=live }}</ref> The motto has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, and on the ten-cent coin since 1916.

Celador allowed Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife retry the show after the company claimed that the last question \"didn't meet their standards\".

==Criticism==
The constitutionality of the phrase \"In God We Trust\" has been upheld according to the judicial interpretation of [[accommodationism]], whose adherents state that this entrenched practice has not historically presented any constitutional difficulty, is not coercive, and does not prefer one religious denomination over another.<ref name=\"Views\" />  In ''[[Zorach v. Clauson]]'' (1952), the Supreme Court also wrote that the nation's \"institutions presuppose a Supreme Being\" and that government recognition of [[God]] does not constitute the establishment of a state church as the Constitution's authors intended to prohibit.<ref name=ABA>{{cite book|title=ABA Journal Sep 1962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gymQ6vWfA3QC&pg=PA817&dq=Zorach+v.+Clauson+++In+God+We+Trust#v=onepage&q=Zorach%20v.%20Clauson%20%20%20In%20God%20We%20Trust&f=false|quote=Much more recently, in 1952, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas in ''Zorach v.

Mr. Justice Brewer in the ''Holy Trinity'' case, ''supra'', mentioned many of these evidences of religion, and Mr. Justice Douglas in the ''Zorach'' case referred to&nbsp;...

To this list may be added tax exemption of churches, chaplaincies in the armed forces, the \"Pray for Peace\" postmark, the widespread observance of Christmas holidays, and, in classrooms, singing the fourth stanza of ''America'' which is prayer invoking the protection of God, and the words \"in God is our trust\" as found in the National Anthem, and the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, modified by an Act of Congress of June 14, 1954, to include the words \"under God.|access-date=September 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119065015/https://books.google.com/books?id=gymQ6vWfA3QC&pg=PA817&dq=Zorach+v.+Clauson+++In+God+We+Trust#v=onepage&q=Zorach%20v.%20Clauson%20%20%20In%20God%20We%20Trust&f=false|archive-date=November 19, 2016|url-status=live|date = September 1962}}</ref>

In [[mathematics]], the '''Laplace transform''' is an [[integral transform]] named after its inventor [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|p|l|ɑ:|s}}).  It transforms a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time) to a function of a [[complex analysis|complex variable]] {{mvar|s}} ([[complex frequency]]). The transform has many applications in science and engineering.

The Laplace transform is similar to the [[Fourier transform]].  While the Fourier transform of a function is a [[complex function]] of a ''real'' variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a ''complex'' variable. The Laplace transform is usually restricted to transformation of functions of {{math|''t''}} with {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}}.  A consequence of this restriction is that the Laplace transform of a function is a [[holomorphic function]] of the variable {{math|''s''}}.  Unlike the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] is generally a [[well-behaved]] function.  Techniques of complex variables can also be used to  directly study Laplace transforms.  As a holomorphic function, the Laplace transform has a [[power series]] representation.  This power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the function.  This perspective has applications in [[probability theory]].

The Laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions. The inverse Laplace transform takes a function of a complex variable {{math|''s''}} (often frequency) and yields a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time).  Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a [[system]], the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|loc=§8.1}}</ref>  So, for example, the Laplace transformation from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] transforms [[Differential equation|differential equations]] into algebraic equations and [[convolution]] into multiplication.

Laplace wrote extensively about the use of [[Generating function|generating functions]] in ''Essai philosophique sur les probabilités'' (1814) and the integral form of the Laplace transform evolved naturally as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Probability theory : the logic of science|last=Jaynes, E.

The advantages of the Laplace transform had been emphasized by [[Gustav Doetsch]]<ref>{{citation |first=Gustav |last=Doetsch |title=Theorie und Anwendung der Laplacesche Transformation |location=Berlin |date=1937 |publisher=Springer |language=de |trans-title=Theory and Application of the Laplace Transform}} translation 1943</ref> to whom the name Laplace Transform is apparently due.  

From 1744, [[Leonhard Euler]] investigated integrals of the form
: <math> z = \\int X(x) e^{ax}\\, dx \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad z = \\int X(x) x^A \\, dx</math>
as solutions of differential equations but did not pursue the matter very far.<ref>{{harvnb|Euler|1744}}, {{harvnb|Euler|1753}}, {{harvnb|Euler|1769}}</ref> [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] was an admirer of Euler and, in his work on integrating [[probability density function]]s, investigated expressions of the form
: <math> \\int X(x) e^{- a x } a^x\\, dx,</math>
which some modern historians have interpreted within modern Laplace transform theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Lagrange|1773}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness| 1997|p=260}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

These types of integrals seem first to have attracted Laplace's attention in 1782 where he was following in the spirit of Euler in using the integrals themselves as solutions of equations.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|p=261}}</ref> However, in 1785, Laplace took the critical step forward when, rather than just looking for a solution in the form of an integral, he started to apply the transforms in the sense that was later to become popular. He used an integral of the form
: <math> \\int x^s \\varphi (x)\\, dx,</math>
akin to a [[Mellin transform]], to transform the whole of a [[difference equation]], in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=261–262}}</ref>

Laplace also recognised that [[Joseph Fourier]]'s method of [[Fourier series]] for solving the [[diffusion equation]] could only apply to a limited region of space because those solutions were [[Periodic function|periodic]]. In 1809, Laplace applied his transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=262&ndash;266}}</ref>

== Formal definition ==
The Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by
{{Equation box 1
|indent =
|title=
|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) =\\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter
: <math>s = \\sigma + i \\omega</math>, with real numbers {{math|''σ''}} and {{math|''ω''}}.

An alternate notation for the Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}</math> instead of {{math|''F''}}.

The meaning of the integral depends on types of functions of interest.  A necessary condition for existence of the integral is that {{math|''f''}} must be [[locally integrable]] on {{closed-open|0, ∞}}.  For locally integrable functions that decay at infinity or are of [[exponential type]], the integral can be understood to be a (proper) [[Lebesgue integral]]. However, for many applications it is necessary to regard it as a [[conditionally convergent]] [[improper integral]] at {{math|∞}}.  Still more generally, the integral can be understood in a [[distribution (mathematics)|weak sense]], and this is dealt with below.

One can define the Laplace transform of a finite [[Borel measure]] {{math|''μ''}} by the Lebesgue integral<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=§XIII.1}}</ref>
: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{\\mu\\}(s) = \\int_{[0,\\infty)} e^{-st}\\, d\\mu(t).</math>

An important special case is where {{math|''μ''}} is a [[probability measure]], for example, the [[Dirac delta function]]. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a probability density function {{math|''f''}}.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes
: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_{0^-}^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt,</math>
where the lower limit of {{math|0<sup>−</sup>}} is shorthand notation for
: <math>\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0^+}\\int_{-\\varepsilon}^\\infty.</math>

This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at {{math|0}} is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace–Stieltjes transform]].

=== Bilateral Laplace transform ===
{{Main article|Two-sided Laplace transform}}

When one says \"the Laplace transform\" without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is normally intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the ''bilateral Laplace transform'' or [[two-sided Laplace transform]] by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis.  If that is done the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the [[Heaviside step function]].
The bilateral Laplace transform is defined as follows:
{{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a bilateral transform defined by
{{Equation box 1
|indent =
|title=
|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
An alternate notation for the bilateral Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{B}\\{f\\}</math> instead of <math>F</math>.

=== Inverse Laplace transform ===
{{Main article|Inverse Laplace transform}}
Two integrable functions have the same Laplace transform only if they differ on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. This means that, on the range of the transform, there is an inverse transform. In fact, besides integrable functions, the Laplace transform is a [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] mapping from one function space into another in many other function spaces as well, although there is usually no easy characterization of the range. Typical function spaces in which this is true include the spaces of bounded continuous functions, the space [[Lp space|{{math|''L''<sup>&infin;</sup>(0, &infin;)}}]], or more generally [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]] on {{open-open|0, &infin;}}.  The Laplace transform is also defined and injective for suitable spaces of tempered distributions.

In these cases, the image of the Laplace transform lives in a space of [[analytic function]]s in the [[#Region of convergence|region of convergence]].  The [[inverse Laplace transform]] is given by the following complex integral, which is known by various names (the '''Bromwich integral''', the '''Fourier–Mellin integral''', and '''Mellin's inverse formula'''):
{{Equation box 1
|indent =
|title=
|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F\\}(t) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\oint_{\\gamma - i T}^{\\gamma + i T} e^{st} F(s)\\, ds</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where {{math|''γ''}} is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of {{math|''F''(''s'')}}. An alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform is given by [[Post's inversion formula]]. The limit here is interpreted in the [[weak-* topology#Weak-* topology|weak-* topology]].

In practice, it is typically more convenient to decompose a Laplace transform into known transforms of functions obtained from a table, and construct the inverse by inspection.

=== Probability theory ===
In [[probability theory|pure]] and [[applied probability]], the Laplace transform is defined as an [[expected value]]. If {{math|''X''}} is a [[random variable]] with probability density function {{math|''f''}}, then the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} is given by the expectation
: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\operatorname{E}\\! \\left[e^{-sX} \\right]\\! .</math>

By [[abuse of notation|convention]], this is referred to as the Laplace transform of the random variable {{math|''X''}} itself. Replacing {{math|''s''}} by {{math|−''t''}} gives the [[moment generating function]] of {{math|''X''}}. The Laplace transform has applications throughout probability theory, including [[first passage time]]s of [[stochastic processes]] such as [[Markov chain]]s, and [[renewal theory]].

Of particular use is the ability to recover the [[cumulative distribution function]] of a continuous random variable {{math|''X''}} by means of the Laplace transform as follows<ref>The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function.</ref>
: <math>F_X(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{-sX}\\right]\\right\\}\\! (x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\right\\}\\! (x).</math>

== Region of convergence ==
If {{math|''f''}} is a locally integrable function (or more generally a Borel measure locally of bounded variation), then the Laplace transform {{math|''F''(''s'')}} of {{math|''f''}} converges provided that the limit
: <math>\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\int_0^R f(t)e^{-st}\\,dt</math>
exists.

The Laplace transform converges absolutely if the integral
: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\left|f(t)e^{-st}\\right|\\,dt</math>
exists (as a proper Lebesgue integral).  The Laplace transform is usually understood as conditionally convergent, meaning that it converges in the former instead of the latter sense.

The set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges absolutely is either of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}} or else {{math|Re(''s'') ≥ ''a''}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an [[extended real number|extended real constant]], {{math|−∞ ≤ ''a'' ≤ ∞}}.  (This follows from the [[dominated convergence theorem]].) The constant {{math|''a''}} is known as the abscissa of absolute convergence, and depends on the growth behavior of {{math|''f''(''t'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter II, §1}}</ref> Analogously, the two-sided transform converges absolutely in a strip of the form  {{math|''a'' < Re(''s'') < ''b''}}, and possibly including the lines {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}} or {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''b''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter VI, §2}}</ref>  The subset of values of {{math|''s''}} for which the Laplace transform converges absolutely is called the region of absolute convergence or the domain of absolute convergence.  In the two-sided case, it is sometimes called the strip of absolute convergence. The Laplace transform is analytic in the region of absolute convergence: this is a consequence of [[Fubini's theorem]] and [[Morera's theorem]]. 

Similarly, the set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges (conditionally or absolutely) is known as the region of conditional convergence, or simply the '''region of convergence''' (ROC).  If the Laplace transform converges (conditionally) at {{math|1=''s'' = ''s''<sub>0</sub>}}, then it automatically converges for all {{math|''s''}} with {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}.  Therefore, the region of convergence is a half-plane of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}}, possibly including some points of the boundary line {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}}.

In the region of convergence {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}, the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} can be expressed by [[integration by parts|integrating by parts]] as the integral
: <math>F(s) = (s-s_0)\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-s_0)t}\\beta(t)\\,dt,\\quad \\beta(u) = \\int_0^u e^{-s_0t}f(t)\\,dt.</math>

That is, in the region of convergence {{math|''F''(''s'')}} can effectively be expressed as the absolutely convergent Laplace transform of some other function.  In particular, it is analytic.

There are several [[Paley–Wiener theorem]]s concerning the relationship between the decay properties of {{math|''f''}} and the properties of the Laplace transform within the region of convergence.

In engineering applications, a function corresponding to a [[LTI system|linear time-invariant (LTI) system]] is ''stable'' if every bounded input produces a bounded output.  This is equivalent to the absolute convergence of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function in the region {{math|Re(''s'') ≥ 0}}.  As a result, LTI systems are stable provided the poles of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function have negative real part.

This ROC is used in knowing about the causality and stability of a system.

== Properties and theorems ==
The Laplace transform has a number of properties that make it useful for analyzing linear [[dynamical system]]s. The most significant advantage is that [[derivative|differentiation]] becomes multiplication, and [[integral|integration]] becomes division, by  {{math|''s''}} (similarly to [[logarithm]]s changing multiplication of numbers to addition of their logarithms).

Because of this property, the Laplace variable {{math|''s''}} is also known as ''operator variable'' in the {{math|''L''}} domain: either ''derivative operator'' or (for {{math|''s''<sup>−1</sup>)}} ''integration operator''. The transform turns [[integral equation]]s and [[differential equation]]s to [[polynomial equation]]s, which are much easier to solve.  Once solved, use of the inverse Laplace transform reverts to the original domain.

Given the functions {{math|''f''(''t'')}} and {{math|''g''(''t'')}}, and their respective Laplace transforms {{math|''F''(''s'')}} and {{math|''G''(''s'')}},
: <math>\\begin{align}
f(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\},\\\\
g(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\},
\\end{align}</math>

: The final value theorem is useful because it gives the long-term behaviour without having to perform [[partial fraction]] decompositions or other difficult algebra. If {{math|''F''(''s'')}} has a pole in the right-hand plane or poles on the imaginary axis (e.g., if <math>f(t) = e^t</math> or <math>f(t) = \\sin(t)</math>), the behaviour of this formula is undefined.

=== Relation to power series ===
The Laplace transform can be viewed as a [[continuous function|continuous]] analogue of a [[power series]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mattuck |first1=Arthur |title=Where the Laplace Transform comes from |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvbdoSeGAgI}}</ref> If  {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is a discrete function of a positive integer {{math|''n''}}, then the power series associated to  {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is the series
:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a(n) x^n</math>
where  {{math|''x''}} is a real variable (see [[Z transform]]). Replacing summation over {{math|''n''}} with integration over  {{math|''t''}}, a continuous version of the power series becomes
:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) x^t\\, dt</math>
where the discrete function {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is replaced by the continuous one {{math|''f''(''t'')}}. 

Changing the base of the power from {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''e''}} gives
:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) \\left(e^{\\ln{x}}\\right)^t\\, dt</math>

For this to converge for, say, all bounded functions {{math|''f''}}, it is necessary to require that {{math|ln ''x'' < 0}}. Making the substitution {{math|1=&minus;''s'' = ln ''x''}} gives just the Laplace transform:
:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-st}\\, dt</math>

In other words, the Laplace transform is a continuous analog of a power series in which the discrete parameter {{math|''n''}} is replaced by the continuous parameter {{math|''t''}}, and {{math|''x''}} is replaced by {{math|''e''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>}}.

=== Relation to moments ===
{{main article|Moment generating function}}
The quantities
:<math>\\mu_n = \\int_0^\\infty t^nf(t)\\, dt</math>

are the ''moments'' of the function {{math|''f''}}.  If the first {{math|''n''}} moments of {{math|''f''}} converge absolutely, then by repeated [[differentiation under the integral]], 
:<math>(-1)^n(\\mathcal L f)^{(n)}(0) = \\mu_n .</math>
This is of special significance in probability theory, where the moments of a random variable {{math|''X''}} are given by the expectation values <math>\\mu_n=\\operatorname{E}[X^n]</math>.  Then, the relation holds
:<math>\\mu_n = (-1)^n\\frac{d^n}{ds^n}\\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{-sX}\\right](0).</math>

=== Computation of the Laplace transform of a function's derivative ===
It is often convenient to use the differentiation property of the Laplace transform to find the transform of a function's derivative.  This can be derived from the basic expression for a Laplace transform as follows:

: <math>\\begin{align}
  \\mathcal{L} \\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt \\\\[6pt]
                                  &= \\left[\\frac{f(t)e^{-st}}{-s} \\right]_{0^-}^\\infty -
                                       \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-st}}{-s} f'(t) \\, dt\\quad \\text{(by parts)} \\\\[6pt]
                                  &= \\left[-\\frac{f(0^+)}{-s}\\right] + \\frac 1 s \\mathcal{L} \\left\\{f'(t)\\right\\},
\\end{align}</math>

yielding

: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\{ f'(t) \\} = s\\cdot\\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\}-f(0^+), </math>

and in the bilateral case,

: <math> \\mathcal{L} \\{ f'(t) \\} = s \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\,dt  = s \\cdot \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\}. </math>

The general result

: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{ f^{(n)}(t) \\right\\} = s^n \\cdot \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} - s^{n - 1} f(0^+) - \\cdots - f^{(n - 1)}(0^+),</math>

where <math>f^{(n)}</math> denotes the {{math|''n''}}<sup>th</sup> derivative of {{math|''f''}}, can then be established with an inductive argument.

=== Evaluating integrals over the positive real axis ===
A useful property of the Laplace transform is the following:

: <math>\\int_0^\\infty f(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(s)\\cdot(\\mathcal{L}^{-1}g)(s)\\,ds </math>

under suitable assumptions on the behaviour of <math>f,g</math> in a right neighbourhood of <math>0</math> and on the decay rate of <math>f,g</math> in a left neighbourhood of <math>\\infty</math>. The above formula is a variation of integration by parts, with the operators 
<math>\\frac{d}{dx}</math> and <math>\\int \\,dx</math> being replaced by <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{L}^{-1}</math>. Let us prove the equivalent formulation:

: <math>\\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty f(s)(\\mathcal{L}g)(s)\\,ds. </math>

By plugging in <math>(\\mathcal{L}f)(x)=\\int_0^\\infty f(s)e^{-sx}\\,ds</math> the left-hand side turns into:

: <math>\\int_0^\\infty\\int_0^\\infty f(s)g(x) e^{-sx}\\,ds\\,dx, </math>

but assuming Fubini's theorem holds, by reversing the order of integration we get the wanted right-hand side.

=== Relationship to other transforms ===

==== Laplace–Stieltjes transform ====
The (unilateral) Laplace–Stieltjes transform of a function {{math|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} is defined by the [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]]

: <math>\\{\\mathcal{L}^*g\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} \\, dg(t).</math>

The function {{math|''g''}} is assumed to be of [[bounded variation]].  If {{math|''g''}} is the [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}:

: <math>g(x) = \\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>

then the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of {{math|''g''}} and the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} coincide.  In general, the Laplace–Stieltjes transform is the Laplace transform of the [[Stieltjes measure]] associated to {{math|''g''}}.  So in practice, the only distinction between the two transforms is that the Laplace transform is thought of as operating on the density function of the measure, whereas the Laplace–Stieltjes transform is thought of as operating on its [[cumulative distribution function]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|p=432}}</ref>

==== Fourier transform ====
{{Main|Fourier transform}}
The continuous Fourier transform is equivalent to evaluating the bilateral Laplace transform with imaginary argument {{math|1=''s'' = ''iω''}} or {{math|1=''s'' = 2''πfi''}}<ref>{{harvnb|Takacs|1953|p=93}}</ref> when the condition explained below is fulfilled, 
:<math>\\begin{align}
  \\widehat{f}(\\omega) &= \\mathcal{F}\\{f(t)\\} \\\\[4pt]
                  &= \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}|_{s = i\\omega}  =  F(s)|_{s = i \\omega} \\\\[4pt]
                  &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\omega t} f(t)\\,dt~.
\\end{align}</math>

This definition of the Fourier transform requires a prefactor of {{math|1/(2''π'')}} on the reverse Fourier transform. This relationship between the Laplace and Fourier transforms is often used to determine the [[frequency spectrum]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or dynamical system.

The above relation is valid as stated if and only if the region of convergence (ROC) of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}} contains the imaginary axis,  {{math|1=''σ'' = 0}}.

For example, the function {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = cos(''ω''<sub>0</sub>''t'')}} has a Laplace transform  {{math|1=''F''(''s'') =  ''s''/(''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''ω''<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)}} whose ROC is {{math|Re(''s'') > 0}}. As {{math|1=''s'' = ''iω''}} is a pole of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, substituting  {{math|1=''s'' = ''iω''}} in {{math|''F''(''s'')}} does not yield the Fourier transform of  {{math|''f''(''t'')''u''(''t'')}}, which is proportional to the [[Dirac delta-function]] {{math|''δ''(''ω'' − ''ω''<sub>0</sub>)}}.

However, a relation of the form
: <math>\\lim_{\\sigma\\to 0^+} F(\\sigma+i\\omega) = \\widehat{f}(\\omega)</math>
holds under much weaker conditions.  For instance, this holds for the above example provided that the limit is understood as a [[weak limit]] of measures (see [[vague topology]]).  General conditions relating the limit of the Laplace transform of a function on the boundary to the Fourier transform take the form of [[Paley–Wiener theorem]]s.

==== Mellin transform ====
{{Main|Mellin transform}}
The Mellin transform and its inverse are related to the two-sided Laplace transform by a simple change of variables.

If in the Mellin transform
: <math>G(s) = \\mathcal{M}\\{g(\\theta)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\theta^s g(\\theta) \\, \\frac{d\\theta} \\theta </math>
we set {{math|1=''θ'' = ''e''<sup>−''t''</sup>}} we get a two-sided Laplace transform.

==== Z-transform ====
{{Main|Z-transform}}
The unilateral or one-sided Z-transform is simply the Laplace transform of an ideally sampled signal with the substitution of
: <math> z \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} e^{sT} ,</math>
where {{math|1=''T'' = 1/''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[Sampling theorem|sampling]] period (in units of time e.g., seconds) and  {{math|''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[sampling rate]] (in [[sample (signal)|samples per second]] or [[hertz]]).

Let
: <math> \\Delta_T(t) \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) </math>
be a sampling impulse train (also called a [[Dirac comb]]) and
:<math>\\begin{align}
  x_q(t) \\  &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  x(t) \\Delta_T(t) = x(t) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) \\\\
            &= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x(n T) \\delta(t - n T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] \\delta(t - n T)
\\end{align}</math>
be the sampled representation of the continuous-time {{math|''x''(''t'')}}
: <math> x[n] \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}}  x(nT) ~.</math>

The Laplace transform of the sampled signal {{math|''x''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'') }} is
: <math>\\begin{align}
  X_q(s) &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty x_q(t) e^{-s t} \\,dt \\\\
         &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\
         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\
         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] e^{-n s T}~.
\\end{align}</math>

This is the precise definition of the unilateral Z-transform of the discrete function {{math|''x''[''n'']}}

: <math> X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n} </math>
with the substitution of {{math|''z'' → e<sup>''sT''</sup>}}.

Comparing the last two equations, we find the relationship between the unilateral Z-transform and the Laplace transform of the sampled signal,
: <math>X_q(s) =  X(z) \\Big|_{z=e^{sT}}.</math>

The similarity between the {{math|''Z''}} and Laplace transforms is expanded upon in the theory of [[time scale calculus]].

==== Borel transform ====
The integral form of the [[Borel summation|Borel transform]]

: <math>F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(z)e^{-sz}\\, dz</math>

is a special case of the Laplace transform for {{math|''f''}} an [[entire function]] of exponential type, meaning that

: <math>|f(z)|\\le Ae^{B|z|}</math>

for some constants {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.  The generalized Borel transform allows a different weighting function to be used, rather than the exponential function, to transform functions not of exponential type. [[Nachbin's theorem]] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Borel transform to be well defined.

==== Fundamental relationships ====
Since an ordinary Laplace transform can be written as a special case of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as the sum of two one-sided transforms, the theory of the Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject. However, a different point of view and different characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.

== Table of selected Laplace transforms ==
{{main article|List of Laplace transforms}}

The following table provides Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable.<ref>{{Citation |edition=3rd |page=455 |first1=K. F. |last1=Riley |first2=M. P. |last2=Hobson |first3=S. J. |last3=Bence |title=Mathematical methods for physics and engineering |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-86153-3}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first1=J.

Because the Laplace transform is a linear operator,

* The Laplace transform of a sum is the sum of Laplace transforms of each term.

:: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t) + g(t)\\}  = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{ g(t)\\}  </math>

* The Laplace transform of a multiple of a function is that multiple times the Laplace transformation of that function.

:: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{a f(t)\\}  = a \\mathcal{L}\\{ f(t)\\}</math>

Using this linearity, and various [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric]], [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]], and complex number (etc.) properties and/or identities, some Laplace transforms can be obtained from others more quickly than by using the definition directly.

The unilateral Laplace transform takes as input a function whose time domain is the [[non-negative]] reals, which is why all of the time domain functions in the table below are multiples of the Heaviside step function, {{math|''u''(''t'')}}.

The entries of the table that involve a time delay {{math|''τ''}} are required to be [[causal system|causal]] (meaning that {{math|''τ'' > 0}}).  A causal system is a system where the [[impulse response]] {{math|''h''(''t'')}} is zero for all time {{mvar|t}} prior to {{math|1=''t'' = 0}}. In general, the region of convergence for causal systems is not the same as that of [[anticausal system]]s.

== ''s''-domain equivalent circuits and impedances ==
The Laplace transform is often used in circuit analysis, and simple conversions to the {{math|''s''}}-domain of circuit elements can be made. Circuit elements can be transformed into [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, very similar to [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] impedances.

Here is a summary of equivalents:

: [[File:S-Domain circuit equivalents.svg|alt={{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits|centre|frameless|400x400px|{{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits]]

Note that the resistor is exactly the same in the time domain and the {{math|''s''}}-domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the {{math|''s''}}-domain account for that.

The equivalents for current and voltage sources are simply derived from the transformations in the table above.

== Examples and applications ==
<!--A few worked examples are provided here to enable the reader to assess comprehension of the factual presentation.  Elaboration beyond the role of supporting factual comprehension belongs at [[v:|Wikiversity]] or [[b:|Wikibooks]].-->

The Laplace transform is used frequently in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]; the output of a [[linear time-invariant]] system can be calculated by convolving its unit impulse response with the input signal. Performing this calculation in Laplace space turns the convolution into a multiplication; the latter being easier to solve because of its algebraic form. For more information, see [[control theory]].

The Laplace transform can also be used to solve differential equations and is used extensively in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].  The Laplace transform reduces a linear differential equation to an algebraic equation, which can then be solved by the formal rules of algebra.  The original differential equation can then be solved by applying the inverse Laplace transform.  The English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside first proposed a similar scheme, although without using the Laplace transform; and the resulting operational calculus is credited as the Heaviside calculus.

=== Evaluating improper integrals ===
Let <math>\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} = F(s)</math>. Then (see the table above)

:<math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{\\frac{f(t)} t \\right\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)}{t}e^{-st}\\, dt = \\int_s^\\infty F(p)\\, dp.</math>

In the limit <math>s \\rightarrow 0</math>, one gets

:<math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)} t \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty F(p)\\, dp,</math>

provided that the interchange of limits can be justified. Even when the interchange cannot be justified the calculation can be suggestive. For example, with ''a''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''b'', proceeding formally one has

:<math>
\\begin{align}
\\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{ \\cos(at) - \\cos(bt) }{t} \\, dt 
&= \\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac p {p^2 + a^2} - \\frac{p}{p^2 + b^2}\\right)\\, dp \\\\[6pt]
&= \\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\Biggl[ \\frac 1 2 \\left. \\ln\\frac{p^2 + a^2}{p^2 + b^2} \\right|_{0}^\\infty \\Biggl] = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \\ln \\Biggl| \\frac {a}{b} \\Biggl|.
\\end{align}
</math>

The validity of this identity can be proved by other means. It is an example of a [[Frullani integral]].

Another example is [[Dirichlet integral]].

=== Complex impedance of a capacitor ===
In the theory of [[electrical circuit]]s, the current flow in a [[capacitor]] is proportional to the capacitance and rate of change in the electrical potential (in [[International System of Units|SI]] units). Symbolically, this is expressed by the differential equation

: <math>i = C { dv \\over dt} ,</math>

where {{math|''C''}} is the capacitance (in [[farad]]s) of the capacitor, {{math|1=''i'' = ''i''(''t'')}} is the [[electric current]] (in [[ampere]]s) through the capacitor as a function of time, and {{math|1=''v'' = ''v''(''t'')}} is the [[electrostatic potential|voltage]] (in [[volt]]s) across the terminals of the capacitor, also as a function of time.

Taking the Laplace transform of this equation, we obtain

: <math>I(s) = C(s V(s) - V_0),</math>

where

: <math>\\begin{align}
  I(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ i(t) \\},\\\\
  V(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\},
\\end{align}</math>

and

: <math>V_0 = v(t)\\Big|_{t=0}. \\, </math>

Solving for {{math|''V''(''s'')}} we have

: <math>V(s) = { I(s) \\over sC } + { V_0 \\over s }.</math>

The definition of the complex impedance {{math|''Z''}} (in [[ohm]]s) is the ratio of the complex voltage {{math|''V''}} divided by the complex current {{math|''I''}} while holding the initial state {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} at zero:

: <math>Z(s) = \\left. { V(s) \\over I(s) } \\right|_{V_0 = 0}.</math>

Using this definition and the previous equation, we find:

: <math>Z(s) = \\frac{1}{sC}, </math>

which is the correct expression for the complex impedance of a capacitor. 
In addition, the Laplace transform has large applications in control theory.

=== Partial fraction expansion ===
<!-- [[Partial fractions in Laplace transforms]] redirect here -->
Consider a linear time-invariant system with [[transfer function]]
: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)}.</math>

The [[impulse response]] is simply the inverse Laplace transform of this transfer function:
: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\}.</math>

To evaluate this inverse transform, we begin by expanding {{math|''H''(''s'')}} using the method of partial fraction expansion,

: <math>\\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)} = { P \\over s + \\alpha } + { R \\over s+\\beta }.</math>

The unknown constants {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''R''}} are the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s located at the corresponding poles of the transfer function. Each residue represents the relative contribution of that [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] to the transfer function's overall shape.

By the [[residue theorem]], the inverse Laplace transform depends only upon the poles and their residues. To find the residue {{math|''P''}}, we multiply both sides of the equation by {{math|''s'' + ''α''}} to get
: <math>\\frac{1}{s + \\beta} = P  + { R (s + \\alpha) \\over s + \\beta }.</math>

Then by letting {{math|1=''s'' = −''α''}}, the contribution from {{math|''R''}} vanishes and all that is left is
: <math>P = \\left.{1 \\over s+\\beta}\\right|_{s=-\\alpha} = {1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha}.</math>

Similarly, the residue {{math|''R''}} is given by
: <math>R = \\left.{1 \\over s + \\alpha}\\right|_{s=-\\beta} = {1 \\over \\alpha - \\beta}.</math>

Note that
: <math>R = {-1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha} = - P</math>
and so the substitution of {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''P''}} into the expanded expression for {{math|''H''(''s'')}} gives
: <math>H(s)  = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha} \\right) \\cdot \\left(  { 1 \\over s + \\alpha } - { 1  \\over s + \\beta }  \\right).</math>

Finally, using the linearity property and the known transform for exponential decay (see ''Item'' #''3'' in the ''Table of Laplace Transforms'', above), we can take the inverse Laplace transform of {{math|''H''(''s'')}} to obtain
: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t} - e^{-\\beta t}\\right),</math>
which is the impulse response of the system.

;Convolution
The same result can be achieved using the [[Convolution theorem|convolution property]] as if the system is a series of filters with transfer functions of {{math|1/(''s'' + ''a'')}} and {{math|1/(''s'' + ''b'')}}. That is, the inverse of

: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + a)(s + b)} = \\frac{1}{s+a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s + b}</math>

is

: <math> \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s + a} \\right\\} * \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s + b} \\right\\} = e^{-at} * e^{-bt} = \\int_0^t e^{-ax}e^{-b(t - x)}\\, dx = \\frac{e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}}{b - a}.</math>

=== Phase delay ===

| <math>\\sin{(\\omega t + \\varphi)}</math>
| <math>\\frac{s\\sin(\\varphi) + \\omega \\cos(\\varphi)}{s^2 + \\omega^2}</math>
|-
| <math>\\cos{(\\omega t + \\varphi)}</math>
| <math>\\frac{s\\cos(\\varphi) - \\omega \\sin(\\varphi)}{s^2 + \\omega^2}.</math>
|}

Starting with the Laplace transform,

: <math>X(s) = \\frac{s\\sin(\\varphi) + \\omega \\cos(\\varphi)}{s^2 + \\omega^2}</math>

we find the inverse by first rearranging terms in the fraction:

: <math>\\begin{align}
  X(s) &= \\frac{s \\sin(\\varphi)}{s^2 + \\omega^2} + \\frac{\\omega \\cos(\\varphi)}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\
       &= \\sin(\\varphi) \\left(\\frac{s}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right) + \\cos(\\varphi) \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right).
\\end{align}</math>

We are now able to take the inverse Laplace transform of our terms:

: <math>\\begin{align}
  x(t) &= \\sin(\\varphi) \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{s}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right\\} + \\cos(\\varphi) \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right\\} \\\\
       &= \\sin(\\varphi)\\cos(\\omega t) + \\sin(\\omega t)\\cos(\\varphi).
\\end{align}</math>

This is just the [[Trigonometric identity#Angle sum and difference identities|sine of the sum]] of the arguments, yielding:

:<math>x(t) = \\sin (\\omega t + \\varphi).</math>

We can apply similar logic to find that

: <math>\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{s\\cos\\varphi - \\omega \\sin\\varphi}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right\\} = \\cos{(\\omega t + \\varphi)}.</math>

=== {{Anchor|Inferring spatial structure from spectrum}}Determining structure of astronomical object from spectrum ===
The wide and general applicability of the Laplace transform and its inverse is illustrated by an application in astronomy which provides some information on the ''spatial distribution'' of matter of an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] source of [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] [[thermal radiation]] too distant to [[Angular resolution|resolve]] as more than a point, given its [[flux density]] [[spectrum]], rather than relating the ''time'' domain with the spectrum (frequency domain).

Assuming certain properties of the object, e.g. spherical shape and constant temperature, calculations based on carrying out an inverse Laplace transformation on the spectrum of the object can produce the only possible [[Mathematical model|model]] of the distribution of matter in it (density as a function of distance from the center) consistent with the spectrum.<ref>{{citation |first1=M. |last1=Salem |first2=M.

and the inverse is given by

In [[mathematics]], the '''Laplace transform''' is an [[integral transform]] named after its inventor [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|p|l|ɑ:|s}}).  It transforms a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time) to a function of a [[complex analysis|complex variable]] {{mvar|s}} ([[complex frequency]]). The transform has many applications in science and engineering.

The Laplace transform is similar to the [[Fourier transform]].  While the Fourier transform of a function is a [[complex function]] of a ''real'' variable (frequency), the Laplace transform of a function is a complex function of a ''complex'' variable. The Laplace transform is usually restricted to transformation of functions of {{math|''t''}} with {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}}.  A consequence of this restriction is that the Laplace transform of a function is a [[holomorphic function]] of the variable {{math|''s''}}.  Unlike the Fourier transform, the Laplace transform of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] is generally a [[well-behaved]] function.  Techniques of complex variables can also be used to  directly study Laplace transforms.  As a holomorphic function, the Laplace transform has a [[power series]] representation.  This power series expresses a function as a linear superposition of [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of the function.  This perspective has applications in [[probability theory]].

The Laplace transform is invertible on a large class of functions. The inverse Laplace transform takes a function of a complex variable {{math|''s''}} (often frequency) and yields a function of a real variable {{math|''t''}} (often time).  Given a simple mathematical or functional description of an input or output to a [[system]], the Laplace transform provides an alternative functional description that often simplifies the process of analyzing the behavior of the system, or in synthesizing a new system based on a set of specifications.<ref>{{harvnb|Korn|Korn|1967|loc=§8.1}}</ref>  So, for example, the Laplace transformation from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] transforms [[Differential equation|differential equations]] into algebraic equations and [[convolution]] into multiplication.

Laplace wrote extensively about the use of [[Generating function|generating functions]] in ''Essai philosophique sur les probabilités'' (1814) and the integral form of the Laplace transform evolved naturally as a result.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Probability theory : the logic of science|last=Jaynes, E.

== History ==
The Laplace transform is named after mathematician and astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace, who used a similar transform in his work on probability theory.<ref>{{citation |url=https://archive.org/details/thorieanalytiqu01laplgoog |title=Théorie analytique des Probabilités |location=Paris |date=1814 |edition=2nd |at=chap.I sect.2-20 |chapter=Des Fonctions génératrices |trans-title=Analytical Probability Theory |trans-chapter=On generating functions |language=fr}}</ref> Laplace's use of generating functions was similar to what is now known as the [[z-transform]] and he gave little attention to the continuous variable case which was discussed by [[Niels Henrik Abel]].<ref>{{citation |first=Niels H. |last=Abel|authorlink=Niels Henrik Abel |chapter=Sur les fonctions génératrices et leurs déterminantes |date=1820 |title=Œuvres Complètes |language=fr |publication-date=1839 |volume=II |pages=77–88}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=6FtDAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA67&lpg=RA2-PA67 1881 edition]</ref> The theory was further developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries by [[Mathias Lerch]],<ref>{{citation |first=Mathias |last=Lerch |author-link=Mathias Lerch |title=Sur un point de la théorie des fonctions génératrices d'Abel |journal=[[Acta Mathematica]] |volume=27 |date=1903 |pages=339–351 |doi=10.1007/BF02421315 |trans-title=Proof of the inversion formula |language=fr}}</ref> [[Oliver Heaviside]],<ref>{{citation |first=Oliver |last=Heaviside |author-link=Oliver Heaviside |chapter=The solution of definite integrals by differential transformation |title=Electromagnetic Theory |location=London |at=section 526 |volume=III |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9auR0L6ZRcC&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234|isbn=9781605206189 |date=January 2008 }}</ref> and [[Thomas John I'Anson Bromwich|Thomas Bromwich]].<ref>{{citation |first=Thomas J. |last=Bromwich |author-link=Thomas John I'Anson Bromwich |title=Normal coordinates in dynamical systems |journal=[[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]] |volume=15 |pages=401–448 |date=1916 |doi=10.1112/plms/s2-15.1.401|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2319588 }}</ref> The current widespread use of the transform (mainly in engineering) came about during and soon after World War II<ref>An influential book was: {{citation |first=Murray F. |last=Gardner |first2=John L. |last2=Barnes |title=Transients in Linear Systems studied by the Laplace Transform |date=1942 |location=New York |publisher=Wiley}}</ref> replacing the earlier Heaviside operational calculus. The advantages of the Laplace transform had been emphasized by [[Gustav Doetsch]]<ref>{{citation |first=Gustav |last=Doetsch |title=Theorie und Anwendung der Laplacesche Transformation |location=Berlin |date=1937 |publisher=Springer |language=de |trans-title=Theory and Application of the Laplace Transform}} translation 1943</ref> to whom the name Laplace Transform is apparently due.  

From 1744, [[Leonhard Euler]] investigated integrals of the form
: <math> z = \\int X(x) e^{ax}\\, dx \\quad\\text{ and }\\quad z = \\int X(x) x^A \\, dx</math>
as solutions of differential equations but did not pursue the matter very far.<ref>{{harvnb|Euler|1744}}, {{harvnb|Euler|1753}}, {{harvnb|Euler|1769}}</ref> [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] was an admirer of Euler and, in his work on integrating [[probability density function]]s, investigated expressions of the form
: <math> \\int X(x) e^{- a x } a^x\\, dx,</math>
which some modern historians have interpreted within modern Laplace transform theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Lagrange|1773}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness| 1997|p=260}}</ref>{{Clarify|date=May 2010}}

These types of integrals seem first to have attracted Laplace's attention in 1782 where he was following in the spirit of Euler in using the integrals themselves as solutions of equations.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|p=261}}</ref> However, in 1785, Laplace took the critical step forward when, rather than just looking for a solution in the form of an integral, he started to apply the transforms in the sense that was later to become popular. He used an integral of the form
: <math> \\int x^s \\varphi (x)\\, dx,</math>
akin to a [[Mellin transform]], to transform the whole of a [[difference equation]], in order to look for solutions of the transformed equation. He then went on to apply the Laplace transform in the same way and started to derive some of its properties, beginning to appreciate its potential power.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=261–262}}</ref>

Laplace also recognised that [[Joseph Fourier]]'s method of [[Fourier series]] for solving the [[diffusion equation]] could only apply to a limited region of space because those solutions were [[Periodic function|periodic]]. In 1809, Laplace applied his transform to find solutions that diffused indefinitely in space.<ref>{{harvnb|Grattan-Guinness|1997|pp=262&ndash;266}}</ref>

== Formal definition ==
The Laplace transform of a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f''(''t'')}}, defined for all [[real number]]s {{math|''t'' ≥ 0}}, is the function {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a unilateral transform defined by
{{Equation box 1
|indent =
|title=
|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) =\\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where ''s'' is a [[complex number]] frequency parameter
: <math>s = \\sigma + i \\omega</math>, with real numbers {{math|''σ''}} and {{math|''ω''}}.

An alternate notation for the Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}</math> instead of {{math|''F''}}.

The meaning of the integral depends on types of functions of interest.  A necessary condition for existence of the integral is that {{math|''f''}} must be [[locally integrable]] on {{closed-open|0, ∞}}.  For locally integrable functions that decay at infinity or are of [[exponential type]], the integral can be understood to be a (proper) [[Lebesgue integral]]. However, for many applications it is necessary to regard it as a [[conditionally convergent]] [[improper integral]] at {{math|∞}}.  Still more generally, the integral can be understood in a [[distribution (mathematics)|weak sense]], and this is dealt with below.

One can define the Laplace transform of a finite [[Borel measure]] {{math|''μ''}} by the Lebesgue integral<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=§XIII.1}}</ref>
: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{\\mu\\}(s) = \\int_{[0,\\infty)} e^{-st}\\, d\\mu(t).</math>

An important special case is where {{math|''μ''}} is a [[probability measure]], for example, the [[Dirac delta function]]. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a probability density function {{math|''f''}}.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes
: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_{0^-}^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} \\, dt,</math>
where the lower limit of {{math|0<sup>−</sup>}} is shorthand notation for
: <math>\\lim_{\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0^+}\\int_{-\\varepsilon}^\\infty.</math>

This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at {{math|0}} is entirely captured by the Laplace transform. Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace–Stieltjes transform]].

=== Bilateral Laplace transform ===
{{Main article|Two-sided Laplace transform}}

When one says \"the Laplace transform\" without qualification, the unilateral or one-sided transform is normally intended. The Laplace transform can be alternatively defined as the ''bilateral Laplace transform'' or [[two-sided Laplace transform]] by extending the limits of integration to be the entire real axis.  If that is done the common unilateral transform simply becomes a special case of the bilateral transform where the definition of the function being transformed is multiplied by the [[Heaviside step function]].
The bilateral Laplace transform is defined as follows:
{{math|''F''(''s'')}}, which is a bilateral transform defined by
{{Equation box 1
|indent =
|title=
|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>F(s) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
An alternate notation for the bilateral Laplace transform is <math>\\mathcal{B}\\{f\\}</math> instead of <math>F</math>.

=== Inverse Laplace transform ===
{{Main article|Inverse Laplace transform}}
Two integrable functions have the same Laplace transform only if they differ on a set of [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. This means that, on the range of the transform, there is an inverse transform. In fact, besides integrable functions, the Laplace transform is a [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]] mapping from one function space into another in many other function spaces as well, although there is usually no easy characterization of the range. Typical function spaces in which this is true include the spaces of bounded continuous functions, the space [[Lp space|{{math|''L''<sup>&infin;</sup>(0, &infin;)}}]], or more generally [[Distribution (mathematics)#Tempered distributions and Fourier transform|tempered distributions]] on {{open-open|0, &infin;}}.  The Laplace transform is also defined and injective for suitable spaces of tempered distributions.

In these cases, the image of the Laplace transform lives in a space of [[analytic function]]s in the [[#Region of convergence|region of convergence]].  The [[inverse Laplace transform]] is given by the following complex integral, which is known by various names (the '''Bromwich integral''', the '''Fourier–Mellin integral''', and '''Mellin's inverse formula'''):
{{Equation box 1
|indent =
|title=
|equation = {{NumBlk||<math>f(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F\\}(t) = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\oint_{\\gamma - i T}^{\\gamma + i T} e^{st} F(s)\\, ds</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.3}}}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}
where {{math|''γ''}} is a real number so that the contour path of integration is in the region of convergence of {{math|''F''(''s'')}}. An alternative formula for the inverse Laplace transform is given by [[Post's inversion formula]]. The limit here is interpreted in the [[weak-* topology#Weak-* topology|weak-* topology]].

In practice, it is typically more convenient to decompose a Laplace transform into known transforms of functions obtained from a table, and construct the inverse by inspection.

=== Probability theory ===
In [[probability theory|pure]] and [[applied probability]], the Laplace transform is defined as an [[expected value]]. If {{math|''X''}} is a [[random variable]] with probability density function {{math|''f''}}, then the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} is given by the expectation
: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s) = \\operatorname{E}\\! \\left[e^{-sX} \\right]\\! .</math>

By [[abuse of notation|convention]], this is referred to as the Laplace transform of the random variable {{math|''X''}} itself. Replacing {{math|''s''}} by {{math|−''t''}} gives the [[moment generating function]] of {{math|''X''}}. The Laplace transform has applications throughout probability theory, including [[first passage time]]s of [[stochastic processes]] such as [[Markov chain]]s, and [[renewal theory]].

Of particular use is the ability to recover the [[cumulative distribution function]] of a continuous random variable {{math|''X''}} by means of the Laplace transform as follows<ref>The cumulative distribution function is the integral of the probability density function.</ref>
: <math>F_X(x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{-sX}\\right]\\right\\}\\! (x) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s}\\mathcal{L}\\{f\\}(s)\\right\\}\\! (x).</math>

== Region of convergence ==
If {{math|''f''}} is a locally integrable function (or more generally a Borel measure locally of bounded variation), then the Laplace transform {{math|''F''(''s'')}} of {{math|''f''}} converges provided that the limit
: <math>\\lim_{R\\to\\infty}\\int_0^R f(t)e^{-st}\\,dt</math>
exists.

The Laplace transform converges absolutely if the integral
: <math>\\int_0^\\infty \\left|f(t)e^{-st}\\right|\\,dt</math>
exists (as a proper Lebesgue integral).  The Laplace transform is usually understood as conditionally convergent, meaning that it converges in the former instead of the latter sense.

The set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges absolutely is either of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}} or else {{math|Re(''s'') ≥ ''a''}}, where {{math|''a''}} is an [[extended real number|extended real constant]], {{math|−∞ ≤ ''a'' ≤ ∞}}.  (This follows from the [[dominated convergence theorem]].) The constant {{math|''a''}} is known as the abscissa of absolute convergence, and depends on the growth behavior of {{math|''f''(''t'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter II, §1}}</ref> Analogously, the two-sided transform converges absolutely in a strip of the form  {{math|''a'' < Re(''s'') < ''b''}}, and possibly including the lines {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}} or {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''b''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Widder|1941|loc=Chapter VI, §2}}</ref>  The subset of values of {{math|''s''}} for which the Laplace transform converges absolutely is called the region of absolute convergence or the domain of absolute convergence.  In the two-sided case, it is sometimes called the strip of absolute convergence. The Laplace transform is analytic in the region of absolute convergence: this is a consequence of [[Fubini's theorem]] and [[Morera's theorem]]. 

Similarly, the set of values for which {{math|''F''(''s'')}} converges (conditionally or absolutely) is known as the region of conditional convergence, or simply the '''region of convergence''' (ROC).  If the Laplace transform converges (conditionally) at {{math|1=''s'' = ''s''<sub>0</sub>}}, then it automatically converges for all {{math|''s''}} with {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}.  Therefore, the region of convergence is a half-plane of the form {{math|Re(''s'') > ''a''}}, possibly including some points of the boundary line {{math|1=Re(''s'') = ''a''}}.

In the region of convergence {{math|Re(''s'') > Re(''s''<sub>0</sub>)}}, the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} can be expressed by [[integration by parts|integrating by parts]] as the integral
: <math>F(s) = (s-s_0)\\int_0^\\infty e^{-(s-s_0)t}\\beta(t)\\,dt,\\quad \\beta(u) = \\int_0^u e^{-s_0t}f(t)\\,dt.</math>

That is, in the region of convergence {{math|''F''(''s'')}} can effectively be expressed as the absolutely convergent Laplace transform of some other function.  In particular, it is analytic.

There are several [[Paley–Wiener theorem]]s concerning the relationship between the decay properties of {{math|''f''}} and the properties of the Laplace transform within the region of convergence.

In engineering applications, a function corresponding to a [[LTI system|linear time-invariant (LTI) system]] is ''stable'' if every bounded input produces a bounded output.  This is equivalent to the absolute convergence of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function in the region {{math|Re(''s'') ≥ 0}}.  As a result, LTI systems are stable provided the poles of the Laplace transform of the impulse response function have negative real part.

This ROC is used in knowing about the causality and stability of a system.

== Properties and theorems ==
The Laplace transform has a number of properties that make it useful for analyzing linear [[dynamical system]]s. The most significant advantage is that [[derivative|differentiation]] becomes multiplication, and [[integral|integration]] becomes division, by  {{math|''s''}} (similarly to [[logarithm]]s changing multiplication of numbers to addition of their logarithms).

Because of this property, the Laplace variable {{math|''s''}} is also known as ''operator variable'' in the {{math|''L''}} domain: either ''derivative operator'' or (for {{math|''s''<sup>−1</sup>)}} ''integration operator''. The transform turns [[integral equation]]s and [[differential equation]]s to [[polynomial equation]]s, which are much easier to solve.  Once solved, use of the inverse Laplace transform reverts to the original domain.

Given the functions {{math|''f''(''t'')}} and {{math|''g''(''t'')}}, and their respective Laplace transforms {{math|''F''(''s'')}} and {{math|''G''(''s'')}},
: <math>\\begin{align}
f(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{F(s)\\},\\\\
g(t) &= \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{G(s)\\},
\\end{align}</math>

=== Relation to power series ===
The Laplace transform can be viewed as a [[continuous function|continuous]] analogue of a [[power series]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mattuck |first1=Arthur |title=Where the Laplace Transform comes from |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zvbdoSeGAgI}}</ref> If  {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is a discrete function of a positive integer {{math|''n''}}, then the power series associated to  {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is the series
:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a(n) x^n</math>
where  {{math|''x''}} is a real variable (see [[Z transform]]). Replacing summation over {{math|''n''}} with integration over  {{math|''t''}}, a continuous version of the power series becomes
:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) x^t\\, dt</math>
where the discrete function {{math|''a''(''n'')}} is replaced by the continuous one {{math|''f''(''t'')}}. 

Changing the base of the power from {{math|''x''}} to {{math|''e''}} gives
:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) \\left(e^{\\ln{x}}\\right)^t\\, dt</math>

For this to converge for, say, all bounded functions {{math|''f''}}, it is necessary to require that {{math|ln ''x'' < 0}}. Making the substitution {{math|1=&minus;''s'' = ln ''x''}} gives just the Laplace transform:
:<math>\\int_{0}^{\\infty} f(t) e^{-st}\\, dt</math>

In other words, the Laplace transform is a continuous analog of a power series in which the discrete parameter {{math|''n''}} is replaced by the continuous parameter {{math|''t''}}, and {{math|''x''}} is replaced by {{math|''e''<sup>&minus;''s''</sup>}}.

=== Relation to moments ===
{{main article|Moment generating function}}
The quantities
:<math>\\mu_n = \\int_0^\\infty t^nf(t)\\, dt</math>

are the ''moments'' of the function {{math|''f''}}.  If the first {{math|''n''}} moments of {{math|''f''}} converge absolutely, then by repeated [[differentiation under the integral]], 
:<math>(-1)^n(\\mathcal L f)^{(n)}(0) = \\mu_n .</math>
This is of special significance in probability theory, where the moments of a random variable {{math|''X''}} are given by the expectation values <math>\\mu_n=\\operatorname{E}[X^n]</math>.  Then, the relation holds
:<math>\\mu_n = (-1)^n\\frac{d^n}{ds^n}\\operatorname{E}\\left[e^{-sX}\\right](0).</math>

=== Computation of the Laplace transform of a function's derivative ===
It is often convenient to use the differentiation property of the Laplace transform to find the transform of a function's derivative.  This can be derived from the basic expression for a Laplace transform as follows:

: <math>\\begin{align}
  \\mathcal{L} \\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\, dt \\\\[6pt]
                                  &= \\left[\\frac{f(t)e^{-st}}{-s} \\right]_{0^-}^\\infty -
                                       \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\frac{e^{-st}}{-s} f'(t) \\, dt\\quad \\text{(by parts)} \\\\[6pt]
                                  &= \\left[-\\frac{f(0^+)}{-s}\\right] + \\frac 1 s \\mathcal{L} \\left\\{f'(t)\\right\\},
\\end{align}</math>

yielding

: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\{ f'(t) \\} = s\\cdot\\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\}-f(0^+), </math>

and in the bilateral case,

: <math> \\mathcal{L} \\{ f'(t) \\} = s \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-st} f(t)\\,dt  = s \\cdot \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\}. </math>

The general result

: <math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{ f^{(n)}(t) \\right\\} = s^n \\cdot \\mathcal{L} \\{ f(t) \\} - s^{n - 1} f(0^+) - \\cdots - f^{(n - 1)}(0^+),</math>

where <math>f^{(n)}</math> denotes the {{math|''n''}}<sup>th</sup> derivative of {{math|''f''}}, can then be established with an inductive argument.

=== Evaluating integrals over the positive real axis ===
A useful property of the Laplace transform is the following:

: <math>\\int_0^\\infty f(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(s)\\cdot(\\mathcal{L}^{-1}g)(s)\\,ds </math>

under suitable assumptions on the behaviour of <math>f,g</math> in a right neighbourhood of <math>0</math> and on the decay rate of <math>f,g</math> in a left neighbourhood of <math>\\infty</math>. The above formula is a variation of integration by parts, with the operators 
<math>\\frac{d}{dx}</math> and <math>\\int \\,dx</math> being replaced by <math>\\mathcal{L}</math> and <math>\\mathcal{L}^{-1}</math>. Let us prove the equivalent formulation:

: <math>\\int_0^\\infty(\\mathcal{L} f)(x)g(x)\\,dx = \\int_0^\\infty f(s)(\\mathcal{L}g)(s)\\,ds. </math>

By plugging in <math>(\\mathcal{L}f)(x)=\\int_0^\\infty f(s)e^{-sx}\\,ds</math> the left-hand side turns into:

: <math>\\int_0^\\infty\\int_0^\\infty f(s)g(x) e^{-sx}\\,ds\\,dx, </math>

but assuming Fubini's theorem holds, by reversing the order of integration we get the wanted right-hand side.

=== Relationship to other transforms ===

==== Laplace–Stieltjes transform ====
The (unilateral) Laplace–Stieltjes transform of a function {{math|''g'' : '''R''' → '''R'''}} is defined by the [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]]

: <math>\\{\\mathcal{L}^*g\\}(s) = \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} \\, dg(t).</math>

The function {{math|''g''}} is assumed to be of [[bounded variation]].  If {{math|''g''}} is the [[antiderivative]] of {{math|''f''}}:

: <math>g(x) = \\int_0^x f(t)\\,dt</math>

then the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of {{math|''g''}} and the Laplace transform of {{math|''f''}} coincide.  In general, the Laplace–Stieltjes transform is the Laplace transform of the [[Stieltjes measure]] associated to {{math|''g''}}.  So in practice, the only distinction between the two transforms is that the Laplace transform is thought of as operating on the density function of the measure, whereas the Laplace–Stieltjes transform is thought of as operating on its [[cumulative distribution function]].<ref>{{harvnb|Feller|1971|p=432}}</ref>

==== Fourier transform ====
{{Main|Fourier transform}}
The continuous Fourier transform is equivalent to evaluating the bilateral Laplace transform with imaginary argument {{math|1=''s'' = ''iω''}} or {{math|1=''s'' = 2''πfi''}}<ref>{{harvnb|Takacs|1953|p=93}}</ref> when the condition explained below is fulfilled, 
:<math>\\begin{align}
  \\widehat{f}(\\omega) &= \\mathcal{F}\\{f(t)\\} \\\\[4pt]
                  &= \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\}|_{s = i\\omega}  =  F(s)|_{s = i \\omega} \\\\[4pt]
                  &= \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i \\omega t} f(t)\\,dt~.
\\end{align}</math>

This definition of the Fourier transform requires a prefactor of {{math|1/(2''π'')}} on the reverse Fourier transform. This relationship between the Laplace and Fourier transforms is often used to determine the [[frequency spectrum]] of a [[signal (information theory)|signal]] or dynamical system.

The above relation is valid as stated if and only if the region of convergence (ROC) of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}} contains the imaginary axis,  {{math|1=''σ'' = 0}}.

For example, the function {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = cos(''ω''<sub>0</sub>''t'')}} has a Laplace transform  {{math|1=''F''(''s'') =  ''s''/(''s''<sup>2</sup> + ''ω''<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>)}} whose ROC is {{math|Re(''s'') > 0}}. As {{math|1=''s'' = ''iω''}} is a pole of  {{math|''F''(''s'')}}, substituting  {{math|1=''s'' = ''iω''}} in {{math|''F''(''s'')}} does not yield the Fourier transform of  {{math|''f''(''t'')''u''(''t'')}}, which is proportional to the [[Dirac delta-function]] {{math|''δ''(''ω'' − ''ω''<sub>0</sub>)}}.

However, a relation of the form
: <math>\\lim_{\\sigma\\to 0^+} F(\\sigma+i\\omega) = \\widehat{f}(\\omega)</math>
holds under much weaker conditions.  For instance, this holds for the above example provided that the limit is understood as a [[weak limit]] of measures (see [[vague topology]]).  General conditions relating the limit of the Laplace transform of a function on the boundary to the Fourier transform take the form of [[Paley–Wiener theorem]]s.

==== Mellin transform ====
{{Main|Mellin transform}}
The Mellin transform and its inverse are related to the two-sided Laplace transform by a simple change of variables.

If in the Mellin transform
: <math>G(s) = \\mathcal{M}\\{g(\\theta)\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\theta^s g(\\theta) \\, \\frac{d\\theta} \\theta </math>
we set {{math|1=''θ'' = ''e''<sup>−''t''</sup>}} we get a two-sided Laplace transform.

==== Z-transform ====
{{Main|Z-transform}}
The unilateral or one-sided Z-transform is simply the Laplace transform of an ideally sampled signal with the substitution of
: <math> z \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}} e^{sT} ,</math>
where {{math|1=''T'' = 1/''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[Sampling theorem|sampling]] period (in units of time e.g., seconds) and  {{math|''f<sub>s</sub>''}} is the [[sampling rate]] (in [[sample (signal)|samples per second]] or [[hertz]]).

Let
: <math> \\Delta_T(t) \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) </math>
be a sampling impulse train (also called a [[Dirac comb]]) and
:<math>\\begin{align}
  x_q(t) \\  &\\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  x(t) \\Delta_T(t) = x(t) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}  \\delta(t - n T) \\\\
            &= \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x(n T) \\delta(t - n T) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] \\delta(t - n T)
\\end{align}</math>
be the sampled representation of the continuous-time {{math|''x''(''t'')}}
: <math> x[n] \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{{}={}}  x(nT) ~.</math>

The Laplace transform of the sampled signal {{math|''x''<sub>''q''</sub>(''t'') }} is
: <math>\\begin{align}
  X_q(s) &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty x_q(t) e^{-s t} \\,dt \\\\
         &= \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\
         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] \\int_{0^-}^\\infty \\delta(t - n T) e^{-s t} \\, dt \\\\
         &= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty x[n] e^{-n s T}~.
\\end{align}</math>

This is the precise definition of the unilateral Z-transform of the discrete function {{math|''x''[''n'']}}

: <math> X(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} x[n] z^{-n} </math>
with the substitution of {{math|''z'' → e<sup>''sT''</sup>}}.

Comparing the last two equations, we find the relationship between the unilateral Z-transform and the Laplace transform of the sampled signal,
: <math>X_q(s) =  X(z) \\Big|_{z=e^{sT}}.</math>

The similarity between the {{math|''Z''}} and Laplace transforms is expanded upon in the theory of [[time scale calculus]].

==== Borel transform ====
The integral form of the [[Borel summation|Borel transform]]

: <math>F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(z)e^{-sz}\\, dz</math>

is a special case of the Laplace transform for {{math|''f''}} an [[entire function]] of exponential type, meaning that

: <math>|f(z)|\\le Ae^{B|z|}</math>

for some constants {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.  The generalized Borel transform allows a different weighting function to be used, rather than the exponential function, to transform functions not of exponential type. [[Nachbin's theorem]] gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the Borel transform to be well defined.

==== Fundamental relationships ====
Since an ordinary Laplace transform can be written as a special case of a two-sided transform, and since the two-sided transform can be written as the sum of two one-sided transforms, the theory of the Laplace-, Fourier-, Mellin-, and Z-transforms are at bottom the same subject. However, a different point of view and different characteristic problems are associated with each of these four major integral transforms.

== Table of selected Laplace transforms ==
{{main article|List of Laplace transforms}}

The following table provides Laplace transforms for many common functions of a single variable.<ref>{{Citation |edition=3rd |page=455 |first1=K. F. |last1=Riley |first2=M. P. |last2=Hobson |first3=S. J. |last3=Bence |title=Mathematical methods for physics and engineering |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-86153-3}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |first1=J. J. |last1=Distefano |first2=A. R. |last2=Stubberud |first3=I.

Because the Laplace transform is a linear operator,

* The Laplace transform of a sum is the sum of Laplace transforms of each term.

:: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t) + g(t)\\}  = \\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} + \\mathcal{L}\\{ g(t)\\}  </math>

* The Laplace transform of a multiple of a function is that multiple times the Laplace transformation of that function.

:: <math>\\mathcal{L}\\{a f(t)\\}  = a \\mathcal{L}\\{ f(t)\\}</math>

Using this linearity, and various [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric]], [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic]], and complex number (etc.) properties and/or identities, some Laplace transforms can be obtained from others more quickly than by using the definition directly.

The unilateral Laplace transform takes as input a function whose time domain is the [[non-negative]] reals, which is why all of the time domain functions in the table below are multiples of the Heaviside step function, {{math|''u''(''t'')}}.

The entries of the table that involve a time delay {{math|''τ''}} are required to be [[causal system|causal]] (meaning that {{math|''τ'' > 0}}).  A causal system is a system where the [[impulse response]] {{math|''h''(''t'')}} is zero for all time {{mvar|t}} prior to {{math|1=''t'' = 0}}. In general, the region of convergence for causal systems is not the same as that of [[anticausal system]]s.

== ''s''-domain equivalent circuits and impedances ==
The Laplace transform is often used in circuit analysis, and simple conversions to the {{math|''s''}}-domain of circuit elements can be made. Circuit elements can be transformed into [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]s, very similar to [[Phasor (sine waves)|phasor]] impedances.

Here is a summary of equivalents:

: [[File:S-Domain circuit equivalents.svg|alt={{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits|centre|frameless|400x400px|{{math|''s''}}-domain equivalent circuits]]

Note that the resistor is exactly the same in the time domain and the {{math|''s''}}-domain. The sources are put in if there are initial conditions on the circuit elements. For example, if a capacitor has an initial voltage across it, or if the inductor has an initial current through it, the sources inserted in the {{math|''s''}}-domain account for that.

The equivalents for current and voltage sources are simply derived from the transformations in the table above.

== Examples and applications ==
<!--A few worked examples are provided here to enable the reader to assess comprehension of the factual presentation.  Elaboration beyond the role of supporting factual comprehension belongs at [[v:|Wikiversity]] or [[b:|Wikibooks]].-->

The Laplace transform is used frequently in [[engineering]] and [[physics]]; the output of a [[linear time-invariant]] system can be calculated by convolving its unit impulse response with the input signal. Performing this calculation in Laplace space turns the convolution into a multiplication; the latter being easier to solve because of its algebraic form. For more information, see [[control theory]].

The Laplace transform can also be used to solve differential equations and is used extensively in [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].  The Laplace transform reduces a linear differential equation to an algebraic equation, which can then be solved by the formal rules of algebra.  The original differential equation can then be solved by applying the inverse Laplace transform.  The English electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside first proposed a similar scheme, although without using the Laplace transform; and the resulting operational calculus is credited as the Heaviside calculus.

=== Evaluating improper integrals ===
Let <math>\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{f(t)\\right\\} = F(s)</math>. Then (see the table above)

:<math>\\mathcal{L} \\left\\{\\frac{f(t)} t \\right\\} = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)}{t}e^{-st}\\, dt = \\int_s^\\infty F(p)\\, dp.</math>

In the limit <math>s \\rightarrow 0</math>, one gets

:<math>\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{f(t)} t \\, dt = \\int_0^\\infty F(p)\\, dp,</math>

provided that the interchange of limits can be justified. Even when the interchange cannot be justified the calculation can be suggestive. For example, with ''a''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''b'', proceeding formally one has

:<math>
\\begin{align}
\\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{ \\cos(at) - \\cos(bt) }{t} \\, dt 
&= \\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\int_0^\\infty \\left(\\frac p {p^2 + a^2} - \\frac{p}{p^2 + b^2}\\right)\\, dp \\\\[6pt]
&= \\lim_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\Biggl[ \\frac 1 2 \\left. \\ln\\frac{p^2 + a^2}{p^2 + b^2} \\right|_{0}^\\infty \\Biggl] = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \\ln \\Biggl| \\frac {a}{b} \\Biggl|.
\\end{align}
</math>

The validity of this identity can be proved by other means. It is an example of a [[Frullani integral]].

Another example is [[Dirichlet integral]].

=== Complex impedance of a capacitor ===
In the theory of [[electrical circuit]]s, the current flow in a [[capacitor]] is proportional to the capacitance and rate of change in the electrical potential (in [[International System of Units|SI]] units). Symbolically, this is expressed by the differential equation

: <math>i = C { dv \\over dt} ,</math>

where {{math|''C''}} is the capacitance (in [[farad]]s) of the capacitor, {{math|1=''i'' = ''i''(''t'')}} is the [[electric current]] (in [[ampere]]s) through the capacitor as a function of time, and {{math|1=''v'' = ''v''(''t'')}} is the [[electrostatic potential|voltage]] (in [[volt]]s) across the terminals of the capacitor, also as a function of time.

Taking the Laplace transform of this equation, we obtain

: <math>I(s) = C(s V(s) - V_0),</math>

where

: <math>\\begin{align}
  I(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ i(t) \\},\\\\
  V(s) &= \\mathcal{L} \\{ v(t) \\},
\\end{align}</math>

and

: <math>V_0 = v(t)\\Big|_{t=0}. \\, </math>

Solving for {{math|''V''(''s'')}} we have

: <math>V(s) = { I(s) \\over sC } + { V_0 \\over s }.</math>

The definition of the complex impedance {{math|''Z''}} (in [[ohm]]s) is the ratio of the complex voltage {{math|''V''}} divided by the complex current {{math|''I''}} while holding the initial state {{math|''V''<sub>0</sub>}} at zero:

: <math>Z(s) = \\left. { V(s) \\over I(s) } \\right|_{V_0 = 0}.</math>

Using this definition and the previous equation, we find:

: <math>Z(s) = \\frac{1}{sC}, </math>

which is the correct expression for the complex impedance of a capacitor. 
In addition, the Laplace transform has large applications in control theory.

=== Partial fraction expansion ===
<!-- [[Partial fractions in Laplace transforms]] redirect here -->
Consider a linear time-invariant system with [[transfer function]]
: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)}.</math>

The [[impulse response]] is simply the inverse Laplace transform of this transfer function:
: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\}.</math>

To evaluate this inverse transform, we begin by expanding {{math|''H''(''s'')}} using the method of partial fraction expansion,

: <math>\\frac{1}{(s + \\alpha)(s + \\beta)} = { P \\over s + \\alpha } + { R \\over s+\\beta }.</math>

The unknown constants {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''R''}} are the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s located at the corresponding poles of the transfer function. Each residue represents the relative contribution of that [[mathematical singularity|singularity]] to the transfer function's overall shape.

By the [[residue theorem]], the inverse Laplace transform depends only upon the poles and their residues. To find the residue {{math|''P''}}, we multiply both sides of the equation by {{math|''s'' + ''α''}} to get
: <math>\\frac{1}{s + \\beta} = P  + { R (s + \\alpha) \\over s + \\beta }.</math>

Then by letting {{math|1=''s'' = −''α''}}, the contribution from {{math|''R''}} vanishes and all that is left is
: <math>P = \\left.{1 \\over s+\\beta}\\right|_{s=-\\alpha} = {1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha}.</math>

Similarly, the residue {{math|''R''}} is given by
: <math>R = \\left.{1 \\over s + \\alpha}\\right|_{s=-\\beta} = {1 \\over \\alpha - \\beta}.</math>

Note that
: <math>R = {-1 \\over \\beta - \\alpha} = - P</math>
and so the substitution of {{math|''R''}} and {{math|''P''}} into the expanded expression for {{math|''H''(''s'')}} gives
: <math>H(s)  = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha} \\right) \\cdot \\left(  { 1 \\over s + \\alpha } - { 1  \\over s + \\beta }  \\right).</math>

Finally, using the linearity property and the known transform for exponential decay (see ''Item'' #''3'' in the ''Table of Laplace Transforms'', above), we can take the inverse Laplace transform of {{math|''H''(''s'')}} to obtain
: <math>h(t) = \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\{H(s)\\} = \\frac{1}{\\beta - \\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t} - e^{-\\beta t}\\right),</math>
which is the impulse response of the system.

;Convolution
The same result can be achieved using the [[Convolution theorem|convolution property]] as if the system is a series of filters with transfer functions of {{math|1/(''s'' + ''a'')}} and {{math|1/(''s'' + ''b'')}}. That is, the inverse of

: <math>H(s) = \\frac{1}{(s + a)(s + b)} = \\frac{1}{s+a} \\cdot \\frac{1}{s + b}</math>

is

: <math> \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{s + a} \\right\\} * \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\! \\left\\{\\frac{1}{s + b} \\right\\} = e^{-at} * e^{-bt} = \\int_0^t e^{-ax}e^{-b(t - x)}\\, dx = \\frac{e^{-a t}-e^{-b t}}{b - a}.</math>

Starting with the Laplace transform,

: <math>X(s) = \\frac{s\\sin(\\varphi) + \\omega \\cos(\\varphi)}{s^2 + \\omega^2}</math>

we find the inverse by first rearranging terms in the fraction:

: <math>\\begin{align}
  X(s) &= \\frac{s \\sin(\\varphi)}{s^2 + \\omega^2} + \\frac{\\omega \\cos(\\varphi)}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\\\
       &= \\sin(\\varphi) \\left(\\frac{s}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right) + \\cos(\\varphi) \\left(\\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right).
\\end{align}</math>

We are now able to take the inverse Laplace transform of our terms:

: <math>\\begin{align}
  x(t) &= \\sin(\\varphi) \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{s}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right\\} + \\cos(\\varphi) \\mathcal{L}^{-1}\\left\\{\\frac{\\omega}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right\\} \\\\
       &= \\sin(\\varphi)\\cos(\\omega t) + \\sin(\\omega t)\\cos(\\varphi).
\\end{align}</math>

This is just the [[Trigonometric identity#Angle sum and difference identities|sine of the sum]] of the arguments, yielding:

:<math>x(t) = \\sin (\\omega t + \\varphi).</math>

We can apply similar logic to find that

: <math>\\mathcal{L}^{-1} \\left\\{ \\frac{s\\cos\\varphi - \\omega \\sin\\varphi}{s^2 + \\omega^2} \\right\\} = \\cos{(\\omega t + \\varphi)}.</math>

=== {{Anchor|Inferring spatial structure from spectrum}}Determining structure of astronomical object from spectrum ===
The wide and general applicability of the Laplace transform and its inverse is illustrated by an application in astronomy which provides some information on the ''spatial distribution'' of matter of an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] source of [[Radio frequency|radio-frequency]] [[thermal radiation]] too distant to [[Angular resolution|resolve]] as more than a point, given its [[flux density]] [[spectrum]], rather than relating the ''time'' domain with the spectrum (frequency domain).

Assuming certain properties of the object, e.g. spherical shape and constant temperature, calculations based on carrying out an inverse Laplace transformation on the spectrum of the object can produce the only possible [[Mathematical model|model]] of the distribution of matter in it (density as a function of distance from the center) consistent with the spectrum.<ref>{{citation |first1=M. |last1=Salem |first2=M.

The '''Buick LeSabre''' was a [[full-size]] car made by General Motors from 1959 to 2005.  Prior to 1959, this position had been retained by the full-size [[Buick Special]] model (1936–58). The name originated with the 1951 GM [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] show car designed by [[Harley Earl]]; that car is often mistakenly attributed to the [[Buick]] division but in fact it was presented as a GM vehicle without reference to a specific GM division.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Buick closely related their 1956-1957 models to the GM LeSabre by replicating the top section of the rear wing into their design.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. ''LeSabre'' is French for \"the [[sabre]]\".

==History of model==
The LeSabre nameplate made its first appearance on the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|show car]],<ref>Flory,  J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1021.</ref> which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the [[Buick Special]]. The '''Buick LeSabre''' was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its [[station wagon]] variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.

In addition to being Buick's entry level vehicle, the LeSabre was consistently Buick's best selling full-size car. Of the four nameplates introduced in 1959 (LeSabre, Invicta, Electra, Electra 225), the LeSabre nameplate lasted the longest.

[[File:Shobuza 2 LeSabre.jpg|thumb|1959 Buick LeSabre, formerly owned by the late king of [[Swaziland]], [[Sobhuza II]]. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in [[Lobamba]].]]
From 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was powered by a 364 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]], which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more expensive Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at {{convert|250|hp}} in standard form with an \"economy\" {{convert|235|hp}} version offered as a \"no cost\" option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at {{convert|300|hp}}. For 1962-63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at {{convert|280|hp}}, or a no-cost \"economy\" low-compression version rated at {{convert|260|hp}}.  Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models' smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment for the next few years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964–65), 340 (1966–67) and 350 (1968–76). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick's 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch)V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the rear-drive LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.

For most years from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was moved back to the option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new automatic transmissions, the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300]] and the three-speed [[Super Turbine 400]]. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but only a small number of cars were so equipped. Automatic transmissions would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line's demise after 2005.

LeSabres were rear-drive six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction along with a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.

'''1959'''

LeSabre and all other 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, adopting the new GM B- and C-body used on all of the corporation's full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959–60). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chromey square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and \"Delta-wing\" fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and the top model [[Buick Electra|Electra]]. 
[[File:Buick Le Sabre Convertible ar.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Buick LeSabre convertible]]
While Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with Dynaflow transmission; manual transmission cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed \"Triple Turbine\" Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.

'''1960'''
[[File:Buick Le Sabre 1960 at Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Buick LeSabre Two-Door Hardtop]]
The 1960 LeSabre received a major facelift, the new body design sharing only the roof and trunk lid with the 1959 model. The new Buick now sported a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick's then-new \"Tri-Shield\" logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome \"[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPort]]\" portholes first introduced in 1940 and last seen in 1957.  LeSabre and Invicta models had three portholes while Electras and Electra 225s were \"four-holers\".

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured a \"Mirromatic\" speedometer for which the lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time-honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.

'''1961'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre (1).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Buick LeSabre]]
LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}} but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design.

Inside were revised instrument panels retaining the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer and new upholstery trims. The Station Wagons received an all-vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/vinyl combination interior available as an option.<ref name=\"buick\">{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 (3rd ed.) | author = John Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | pages = 106–107 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}</ref>

Engines were unchanged from previous years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres and all other full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available.<ref name=\"buick\"/>

'''1962'''

The 1962 Buick LeSabre was only moderately changed from the previous year with bodies taking on a few extra inches to give them a longer look along with new grilles and taillights. Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows.

Under the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was replaced by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] coupe.

Inside, interiors were mildly revised with the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer replaced by a conventional horizontal sweep unit.

'''1963'''
[[File:1963 Buick Le Sabre 4469.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Buick LeSabre four-door sedan]]
The 1963 LeSabre received a major facelift with even boxier body contours than 1961-62 models and revised rooflines on four-door hardtop sedans.

Inside was a new instrument panel with round instruments shared with other big Buicks and the new personal-luxury Riviera coupe. New options this year included a seven-position tilt steering wheel/column, AM/FM radio and Electro-Cruise control.

The same assortment of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option this year was a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.

{{clear_left}}
'''1964'''

[[File:1964 Buick LeSabre Custom hb.jpg|thumb|left|1964 LeSabre Custom Sedan, rear view]]
Minor facelifting with new grille and horizontal taillights replacing the 1963's vertical units highlighted the 1964 LeSabre. A somewhat better equipped \"Custom\" version also joined the lineup this year, easily identifiable by its full length chrome side molding with a brushed metal insert. The regular LeSabre had a narrow trim piece on the rear third of the body.<ref>Gunnell, p. 113</ref>

Under the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was replaced in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 designed for the upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower version of the same engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.

Replacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.

Inside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.

'''1965'''

LeSabre and other full-sized Buicks were completely restyled for the 1965 model year, featuring more rounded bodylines and Coke-bottle profiles with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtop coupes. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}, but a new perimeter frame shared with other GM B-body cars replaced the \"X\" frame used since 1961. Body styles were unchanged from 1964 except for the station wagon, which was dropped in favor of the stretched intermediate Special-based [[Buick Sport Wagon]] which featured a raised rear roof and glass skylight over the back seat similar to the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]].

Starting in 1965, the LeSabre was available in two [[trim package|trim levels]], the base LeSabre and the LeSabre Custom, which featured a more luxurious interior trim and also included the convertible body style not available in the base LeSabre line.

[[File:1965 Buick LeSabre convertible in blue, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]
Interiors were also new for 1965 with a revised instrument panel featuring two round dials nearly identical with the Riviera for speedometer and other instruments much like the 1963–64 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls.

Drivetrains were unchanged from 1964 with the 250-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre \"400\" package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine \"400\" three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick's higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models.

Buick's engine–transmission practice was similar to that of GM's Chevrolet Division, which at that time only offered  the two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic with most of its engine offerings in full-sized vehicles, requiring buyers who preferred the similar three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (basically the same transmission under a different name) to order one of the larger V8 engines. Both Pontiac and Oldsmobile offered the Turbo Hydra-Matic on all of their full-sized cars with any engine offering, and three-speed automatics were also the norm on big cars from GM's medium-priced competitors such as the [[Chrysler Newport]] and [[Mercury Monterey]], which offered the [[TorqueFlite]] and [[Cruise-O-Matic]] transmissions, respectively.

'''1966'''
[[File:3rd Buick LeSabre sedan front -- 08-29-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Buick LeSabre 4-Door Hardtop]]
New grilles and four-segmented taillights highlighted the facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side rear view mirror and backup lights.

Under the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was replaced by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.

'''1967'''
[[File:'67 Buick LeSabre Coupe (A&W St-Léonard '10).JPG|thumb|left|1967 Buick LeSabre Sport Coupe]]

Somewhat more rounded sheet metal and a swoopier fastback roofline for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued.

New options for 1967 included front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.

Engine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1966.
{{-}}
'''1968'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre 1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]
The 1968 LeSabre received a minor facelift including new grilles and taillights along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models.

A new 350-cubic-inch V8 replaced the previous 340. In standard form the 350 V8 delivered 230 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio and came with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. The \"LeSabre 400\" option package included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 with 10.25 to 1 compression and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission. The \"Switch-Pitch\" torque converter used in conjunction with the Super Turbine automatic transmission was discontinued in favor of a standard torque converter.
{{-}}
'''1969'''
[[File:'69 Buick LeSabre (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick LeSabre Custom 4-door Hardtop]]
The 1969 LeSabre received new sheetmetal with more squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new sheetmetal, the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, along with the roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}.
Interiors were mildly revised with minor changes to the instrument panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of the steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.

Also new was a variable-ratio power steering unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles) for improved side impact protection as was the case with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.

Powertrains were unchanged from 1968 with the 230-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 standard and available with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] or the two-speed Super Turbine 300 [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] while the LeSabre \"400\" package once again included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel engine and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic.

'''1970'''
[[File:'70 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Auto classique Pièces auto Jarry Laval '12).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]
Only minor detail changes including grille and taillight revisions were made to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to {{Convert|124|in|mm}}, matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport.

Both base and Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the standard 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.

Transmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift for the base 350 two-barrel or optional three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic, which was standard equipment with the two 350 four-barrel engines. This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400. Buick now joined other GM divisions in marketing the automatic transmission under the Turbo Hydra-matic trade name rather than the \"Super Turbine\" designation used since 1964.

At the start of the model year, variable-ratio power steering and power drum brakes were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.

For the first time since 1964, Buick offered a full-sized station wagon for 1970 under the '''Estate Wagon''' nameplate. Though it used the LeSabre's B-body, it rode on the C-body Electra 225's {{Convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase chassis. The Estate Wagon came standard with the 455 V8 and interior trims were similar to the LeSabre Custom and Wildcat.

The 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].

'''1971'''

Like the other GM divisions, Buick completely restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, similar to that of Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.

[[File:LeSabre71.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Buick LeSabre Sedan]]
The same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications in order to enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline as a result of a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate's final year in 2005.

The new body also featured a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents mounted in the trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.

However, within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, Buick and all other GM dealers received multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up and could not be turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972.

Also new for the 1971 was an optional MaxTrac computerized traction control system.

Inside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel that placed all controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver, along with easier serviceability with instruments and switches accessible from the front when the faceplate was removed. The seats of a new full-foam design with headrests more squared off than 1969-70. Again, base and Custom model LeSabres were offered in the same sedan and coupe bodystyles while the convertible was a Custom-only offering. The LeSabre 455 model line was dropped for 1971 with the larger engine now being offered as an option on the regular base and Custom-series models. LeSabre Customs equipped with the optional 455 engine got a \"455\" badge underneath the LeSabre nameplates on the front fenders instead of the \"Custom\" badge normally used.

'''1972'''
[[File:1972-1973 Buick LeSabre sedan -- 12-22-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Buick LeSabre]]
A revised grille and taillights lenses were among the styling changes for 1972. Out back, a small \"BUICK\" nameplate was located above the right side taillight replacing the larger block letters spelling \"B&nbsp;U&nbsp;I&nbsp;C&nbsp;K\" across the lower trunk lid between the taillights in 1971. Also new for '72 was a one-year only 2 1/2-mph front bumper. All B, C, and E body (large) GM cars received such a bumper for '72.

Interior trims received only slight revisions from 1971. A revised flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents.

Both the 350 and 455 V8s were carried over from 1971 with horsepower ratings switched the new SAE net figures based on an engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a [[dynamometer]] rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.

Inside, the instrument panel featured a new \"FASTEN SEAT BELTS\" light due to a new federal safety regulation and the buzzer which sounded when the key was left in the ignition also sounded upon starting the car to remind the driver and passengers to buckle up.

'''1973'''
[[File:1973 Buick LeSabre 4-door hardtop sedan front.jpg|thumb|1973 LeSabre hardtop sedan, showing the new bigger 5&nbsp;mph bumpers]]
A larger federally mandated \"5&nbsp;mph\" front bumper and new vertical bar grille highlighted the 1973 LeSabre along with revised taillights set in the somewhat larger rear bumper. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were revised with EGR valves used on both federal and California-emission equipped cars.

The LeSabre Custom convertible was dropped this year leaving the short-lived [[Buick Centurion|Centurion]] as Buick's only ragtop that year as the intermediate Skylark (replaced by the Century for 1973) lost its ragtop completely after the 1972 model year. The engine options continued largely unchanged.

'''1974'''
[[File:1974 Buick Lesabre Luxus.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Buick LeSabre Luxus 4-door sedan hardtop.]]
New grilles and taillights along with a 5&nbsp;mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear opera windows.

Inside, the instrument panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an \"Air Cushion Restraint System\" which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique four-spoke steering wheel. This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year.

New integrated seat and shoulder belts were introduced this year along with a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right front passenger to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it.

With the Centurion line discontinued after 1973, LeSabre was now Buick's only B-body full-sized car. The base LeSabre was continued, but a new LeSabre Luxus series replaced both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion. The Luxus convertible also returned the ragtop to the LeSabre line after a one-year absence and was Buick's only ragtop.

Engine offerings were revised for 1974. The 350 two-barrel remained standard on all models with optional engines including a 350 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8s, both carried over from 1973 with revisions to meet the 1974 emission standards. New engine options for 1974 included a 455 two-barrel and the Stage 1 455 \"performance package\" which added dual exhausts, suspension upgrades and other equipment.

New options for 1974 included radial-ply tires, GM's High Energy Ignition and a \"low fuel\" warning light that illuminated when the fuel tank was down to four gallons. This would be the final year for the MaxTrac electronic traction control system as an option.

'''1975'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre Custom convertible silver-black fl-r.jpg|thumb|1975 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]
The upscale LeSabre Luxus designation was dropped and replaced by the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was the first year of the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM's Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.

Engine offerings were reduced to just two: the standard 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a four-barrel carburetor or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel.

Bodylines on the 1975 were somewhat softer than the 1974 model featuring round headlights side-by-side and a cross-hatched patterned grille that flowed across the front of the car and under the headlights. Turn signals were located in the front bumper. A Buick tri-shield hood ornament was standard on the Custom Series and optional on the base series. The three-hole 'ventiports' were moved from the hood to the front fenders. Slightly larger taillamps than the 74 draped the back of the car with back-up lights positioned in the center broken up by the license plate. Four-door pillared sedans received a new small third windows to emulate the six-window \"Colonnade\" styling of GM intermediates while four-door hardtop sedans had new opera windows.

Inside, a new flat instrument panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100&nbsp;mph compared to 120&nbsp;mph in previous years and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.

Convertible production for both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion convertibles were not very abundant in the years 1971 to 1975. The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume and the end of the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion Convertibles quite collectable - depending on the vehicles' overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the 'scissor top' that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size convertibles from 1971 to 1976.

'''1976'''

Only minor styling changes highlighted the 1976 Buick LeSabre, which was the final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below the headlights.

The '76 LeSabre was the only American full-size car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick's brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the [[V6 engine]] was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the base engine on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre.

'''1977'''
[[File:1977 Buick LeSabre sedan, brown.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Buick LeSabre sedan]]

The '''1977 Buick LeSabre''' and other GM B-body full-sized cars were considerably smaller and lighter than their predecessors to the tune of losing 700-800 pounds of weight and overall length of 10 to {{convert|15|in|mm}}. The full-sized cars were the beginning of a \"corporate-wide\" downsizing of vehicles in order to improve fuel economy ratings following the 1973-74 energy crisis that would filter down to intermediates in 1978, personal-luxury cars in 1979 and compacts in 1980 with subsequent downsizings of each line of vehicles scheduled in subsequent years.

Although the '77 Buick LeSabre was considerably smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space were increased over the much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built [[V6]] and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.

[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]
'''1978'''
Following a major downsizing and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre received only minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now powered by a turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a four-barrel carburetor producing 165 BHP (SAE Net) at 4000 RPM and a rather useful 285&nbsp;lb-ft at 2,800 rpm.

'''1979'''
[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]
Only minor changes including new grille and rear taillight patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre aside from the top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.

'''1980'''
[[File:'80 Buick LeSabre Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Buick LeSabre coupe]]
New sheet metal highlighted by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines were among the changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977–79 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.

Engine offerings were shuffled a bit for 1980 with the standard Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, but the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera.

Following the demise of the Buick 350 V8 after this year, Buick would only build V6 engines as a result of GM's emerging corporate engine policy dictating types of engines built by various divisions for use throughout the corporate lineup. According to the plan, Buick would build V6 engines, Pontiac would manufacture four-cylinder powerplants, Chevrolet would build four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines, and V8s for larger and higher-priced cars would be sourced from Oldsmobile and Cadillac. This meant that from 1981 onward, V8-powered Buicks would feature Oldsmobile engines, both gasoline and diesel.

'''1981'''
[[File:'81 Buick LeSabre (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|thumb|left|1981 Buick LeSabre]]
Only minor grille and trim changes highlighted the 1981 LeSabre, still offered in base and Limited models. The modified grille now had five (rather than four) rows of openings.<ref>Gunnell, pp. 199-200</ref> Engine offerings included the 231 cubic-inch normally aspirated Buick V6 (standard on sedans and coupes although decidedly underpowered for a car weighing in at around 4,000&nbsp;lbs.), or optional Olds 307 cubic-inch V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and the 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile-built diesel V8 (optional on all models). All gasoline engines received GM's \"Computer Command Control\" system to control fuel mixture, spark advance, and emissions controls.

The three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was standard equipment with the V6 and the diesel V8. New this year was a Turbo Hydra-Matic 200 4-R four-speed automatic overdrive transmission paired with the gasoline V8 engine for improved highway fuel economy.

LeSabre and other GM cars for 1981 received new 35 PSI radial tires for improved rolling resistance and fuel economy.

'''1982-83'''
[[File:1982 Buick LeSabre Limited diesel sedan front.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan (diesel)]]

Few changes were made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the entry-level model and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years included the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.

'''1984'''
[[File:'84 Buick LeSabre (Les chauds vendredis '12).jpg|thumb|left|1984 Buick LeSabre sedan]]
New grilles and wider and lower taillights were among the appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all other engines returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).

'''1985'''

This would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992–96 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe. Engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 (which came as standard in the wagons) and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8 (available in all models). 1985 307s received roller lifters for reduced friction. Meanwhile, the Estate Wagon continued on largely unchanged through 1990.

The 1986 LeSabre was introduced on the new [[front wheel drive]] [[GM H platform|H platform]], after departing from [[rear wheel drive]] on the [[GM B platform]].  Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and the 1987 [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a [[mid-size]] on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]].  One of the features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was a reverse clamshell hood - one that is hinged at the front (in the same fashion as that of the [[Buick Electra]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] of that era) instead of at the back near the cowl and windshield.  The all new styling and implementation of front wheel drive ushered in a new era for the LeSabre, being of a flush aerodynamic design.  The most radical change may have been the removal of Buick's long standing [[Ventiport]]s from the front fenders.

Most Buick LeSabre models from this generation were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine.  It started out with {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It added balance shafts to become the famous \"3800\" V6 for 1988, with {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This engine increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1991 with the addition of Tuned Port Injection.  The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard.  Each year yielded slightly different design changes.  1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substitution of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts.  In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank).  For 1990 there was a change in the design of the front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were largely identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.

In 1986, a LeSabre Grand National model was built to qualify the coupe body-style for NASCAR competition. The LeSabre Grand National is among the rarest of all Buicks ever made, with production numbers of less than 120 units.  It was only available in black with gray interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|title=1986 LeSabre Grand National Page|accessdate=2012-01-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083727/http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> After the end of production of the Grand National, a new sporting LeSabre appeared in form of the LeSabre T-Type, which was offered from 1987 until 1989.  The LeSabre T-Type had many unique options that were styled after the Regal Grand National and Regal T-Type models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesabret.com/thecar.html |title=The Buick Lesabre T-type |publisher=Lesabret.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> Some of those options included blacked-out trim, gray-on-black seats (1987 only), gray-on-black door panels, gray dash and trim, and T-Type specific front and rear spoilers.  For 1990, the T-Type trim package was dropped due to slow sales and Buick's repositioning within the GM hierarchy as a maker of \"Premium American Motorcars\" rather than sporty/performance models.

Beginning in 1989 and continuing for several years, the Buick LeSabre received accolades from J.D. Power as one of the highest rated automobiles in customer satisfaction based on factors such as quality and reliability.

This LeSabre was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, and was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year's [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]]. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door (\"[[family]]-style\") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.

[[File:'94-'96 Buick LeSabre.jpg|left|thumb|1994-96 Buick LeSabre with aftermarket vinyl roof]]
The LeSabre's engine from 1992-1995 was the [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (L27), which produced {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 225 [[lb·ft]] (305 [[N·m]]) The 3513&nbsp;lb (1593&nbsp;kg) car got 18&nbsp;mpg (13.1&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) in the city and 28&nbsp;mpg (8.4&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) on the highway, which was slightly better than the 1991 model. The car accelerated to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 8.9 seconds and could cover the quarter mile in 16.9 seconds at 80&nbsp;mph (129&nbsp;km/h). Top speed was electronically limited to 108&nbsp;mph (173&nbsp;km/h).

The LeSabre was offered in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. The Limited was the premium trim level featuring alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels in the rear seat to access the trunk.  The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, [[Anti-lock brakes]], and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator.  Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.

In 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick's 90th anniversary.  In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, this model included \"90th Anniversary\" badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear window defogger, power driver's seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.

For 1996, the LeSabre received the [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] powerplant, with a gain of {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The engine increased fuel economy ratings over its predecessor, 19&nbsp;MPG city and 30&nbsp;MPG highway [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates.

[[File:1998 Buick LeSabre Limited, Emerald Green, front right.jpg|left|thumb|Facelift Buick LeSabre Limited (1998)]]
[[File:LeSabre Dash.JPG|thumb|Late '90s LeSabre dashboard]]
The LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, moving the turn signal indicators to the front bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. The front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was \"1970-something\" meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In 1999, Flint, Michigan's Buick City assembly plant, which built the LeSabre as well as the Pontiac Bonneville was shut down and LeSabre production moved to Hamtramck.  The last 1999 LeSabre left Buick City's final line as the last Buick City-built car in June 1999.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The 2000 LeSabre was introduced in March 1999. It was now built on [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; however GM chose to continue to refer to it as the H platform.<ref name=\"Frame\"/>  The LeSabre was manufactured at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] factory in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] and Lake Orion Assembly, in Lake Orion, Michigan.

Some of the changes with the redesign included a new grille that did not open with the hood, and slightly smaller exterior dimensions.  Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model.  A [[Air filter#Automotive cabin air filters|pollen filter]] was installed with this generation, and was accessed from inside the engine compartment on the passenger side against the firewall.  Custom and Limited trim levels continued to be offered.

In 2003, a Celebration Edition package was added in recognition of Buick's centennial. The Celebration Edition featured all the standard equipment of the Limited with a choice pearlescent White Diamond or Crimson Pearl tricoat paint schemes, a blacked-out grille, 16\" chrome wheels, and special badging. Other features optional or standard on the LeSabre included Stabilitrak, [[OnStar]], EyeCue heads-up display, all-weather traction control, automatic load-leveling, side airbags, tire pressure monitoring system, heated seats, dual-zone climate control, and RainSense automatic windshield wipers.  Although created to commemorate Buick's centennial in 2003, the package remained available in 2004 and 2005.

Among other packages offered on LeSabre included a Platinum Edition package on 2004 Customs.

The standard, and only available, engine for the eighth-generation LeSabre was the 3.8 L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|Series II Buick 3800]] [[V6]] providing:
* Power: 205 [[horsepower|hp]] (153 [[kilowatt|kW]])
* Torque: 230 [[lb·ft]] (312 [[N·m]])

==Discontinuation==
The LeSabre was America's best-selling full- size car when it was discontinued at the end of the 2005 model year. It was replaced in 2006 by the [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]], Buick's newly designed flagship. The last LeSabre rolled off the [[Lake Orion, Michigan]] assembly line on June 18, 2004 (retooling the plant to build the [[Pontiac G6]]) and the last [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] LeSabre rolled off the assembly line in mid-August, 2005.

The '''Buick LeSabre''' was a [[full-size]] car made by General Motors from 1959 to 2005.  Prior to 1959, this position had been retained by the full-size [[Buick Special]] model (1936–58). The name originated with the 1951 GM [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] show car designed by [[Harley Earl]]; that car is often mistakenly attributed to the [[Buick]] division but in fact it was presented as a GM vehicle without reference to a specific GM division.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}  Buick closely related their 1956-1957 models to the GM LeSabre by replicating the top section of the rear wing into their design.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}. ''LeSabre'' is French for \"the [[sabre]]\".

==History of model==
The LeSabre nameplate made its first appearance on the 1951 [[Le Sabre concept car|Le Sabre]] [[Concept vehicle|show car]],<ref>Flory,  J. \"Kelly\", Jr. ''American Cars 1946-1959'' (Jefferson, NC:  McFarland & Coy, 2008), p.1021.</ref> which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker for what had previously been known as the [[Buick Special]]. The '''Buick LeSabre''' was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its [[station wagon]] variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.

In addition to being Buick's entry level vehicle, the LeSabre was consistently Buick's best selling full-size car. Of the four nameplates introduced in 1959 (LeSabre, Invicta, Electra, Electra 225), the LeSabre nameplate lasted the longest.

[[File:Shobuza 2 LeSabre.jpg|thumb|1959 Buick LeSabre, formerly owned by the late king of [[Swaziland]], [[Sobhuza II]]. Photographed at the Sobhuza II Memorial Park in [[Lobamba]].]]
From 1959 to 1961, the LeSabre was powered by a 364 cubic-inch [[V8 engine|V8]], which was smaller than the 401 cubic-inch V8 used in the more expensive Invicta and Electra models. The 364, which was previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958, was rated at {{convert|250|hp}} in standard form with an \"economy\" {{convert|235|hp}} version offered as a \"no cost\" option in 1960-61 and an optional power-pack version with four-barrel carburetor and dual exhausts that was rated at {{convert|300|hp}}. For 1962-63, the LeSabre came standard with a two-barrel carbureted version of the 401 V8 rated at {{convert|280|hp}}, or a no-cost \"economy\" low-compression version rated at {{convert|260|hp}}.  Starting in 1964, all LeSabre models except the Estate Wagon shared their drivetrains with the midsize Buick models by switching to those models' smaller-displacement V8s at least as standard equipment for the next few years with cubic-inch displacements of 300 (1964–65), 340 (1966–67) and 350 (1968–76). A large-displacement would not reappear in a LeSabre until 1970 when a 455 cubic-inch V8 was introduced as an option and was offered through 1976. Beginning with the downsized 1977 models and continuing through three subsequent generations of front-drive LeSabres introduced in 1986, 1992 and 2000, Buick's 3.8-liter (231 cubic-inch)V6 would become the standard engine for most LeSabre models and V8 engines were dropped (except in station wagons) after the last of the rear-drive LeSabre sedans and coupes came off the line in 1985.

For most years from 1959 to 1971, a three-speed manual transmission was standard equipment on all LeSabres but rarely ordered. Far more popular was the Turbine Drive automatic transmission (previously known as Dynaflow) along with power steering and power brakes. For 1961 and 1962, the automatic transmission was standard on the LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks but in 1963 was moved back to the option list on LeSabres. For 1964, the Dynaflow-based Turbine Drive was replaced by two new automatic transmissions, the two-speed [[Super Turbine 300]] and the three-speed [[Super Turbine 400]]. A four-speed [[manual transmission]] was offered as a LeSabre option from 1963 to 1965 but only a small number of cars were so equipped. Automatic transmissions would once again reappear as standard equipment on LeSabres in mid-1971 and continue in such form until the model line's demise after 2005.

LeSabres were rear-drive six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction along with a longitudinally mounted front engine. The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.

'''1959'''

LeSabre and all other 1959 Buicks not only got new names, but all-new styling as well, adopting the new GM B- and C-body used on all of the corporation's full-sized cars (the larger C-body used in the Electra as well as the Oldsmobile 98 and all Cadillacs was basically a stretched out B-body rather than a distinct body and chassis for 1959–60). Wheelbases increased by one inch on all models. The new styling included slanted headlights in front along with a chromey square grille somewhat similar to the 1958 Buick and \"Delta-wing\" fins back along with round taillights. The appearance was shared with two other Buick models, the mid-level [[Buick Invicta|Invicta]] and the top model [[Buick Electra|Electra]]. 
[[File:Buick Le Sabre Convertible ar.jpg|thumb|left|1959 Buick LeSabre convertible]]
While Invicta and Electra/225 models were powered by Buick's new 401-cubic-inch V8, LeSabre continued with the 364-cubic-inch V8 previously used in all Buicks in 1957 and 1958. In standard form, the engine delivered 250 horsepower with a two-barrel carburetor and 10.25 to 1 compression ratio (with Dynaflow transmission; manual transmission cars had a lower 8.5 to 1 compression ratio but horsepower was still rated at 250). Optionally available was a four-barrel version of the 364 rated at 300 horsepower. A three-speed manual transmission was standard on LeSabre but most cars were built with the optional two-speed Dynaflow automatic transmission that was standard equipment on the Invicta and Electra/225. A three-speed \"Triple Turbine\" Dynaflow variant was also available. Power steering and power brakes were optional and all 1959 Buicks used the unique 12-inch finned aluminum brake drums for improved stopping power that were originally introduced on the 1957 Roadmaster.

'''1960'''
[[File:Buick Le Sabre 1960 at Schaffen-Diest.JPG|thumb|left|1960 Buick LeSabre Two-Door Hardtop]]
The 1960 LeSabre received a major facelift, the new body design sharing only the roof and trunk lid with the 1959 model. The new Buick now sported a concave grille and horizontal headlights centered by Buick's then-new \"Tri-Shield\" logo, which is still in use today. Reintroduced to Electras and other Buicks for 1960 were the chrome \"[[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPort]]\" portholes first introduced in 1940 and last seen in 1957.  LeSabre and Invicta models had three portholes while Electras and Electra 225s were \"four-holers\".

Inside, a revised instrument panel featured a \"Mirromatic\" speedometer for which the lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time-honored horn ring then still common to most automobiles. The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.

'''1961'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre (1).jpg|thumb|left|1961 Buick LeSabre]]
LeSabre and all other full-sized Buicks (joined by the compact Special this year) were completely restyled for 1961 featuring finless rear ends, more restrained use of chrome, and boxier sheetmetal. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}} but the new cars were slightly downsized in both length and width, and rode on a new X-frame chassis which included a conventional rear axle and driveshaft replacing the decades-old torque tube design.

Inside were revised instrument panels retaining the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer and new upholstery trims. The Station Wagons received an all-vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/vinyl combination interior available as an option.<ref name=\"buick\">{{Cite book | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 (3rd ed.) | author = John Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | pages = 106–107 | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}</ref>

Engines were unchanged from previous years including the standard 250-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8, no-cost regular fuel 235-horsepower 364 or the four-barrel 300-horsepower option of same engine available at extra cost. The two-speed Turbine Drive Dynaflow automatic transmission was standard equipment on LeSabres and all other full-sized Buicks this year, although a manual transmission was also available.<ref name=\"buick\"/>

'''1962'''

The 1962 Buick LeSabre was only moderately changed from the previous year with bodies taking on a few extra inches to give them a longer look along with new grilles and taillights. Two-door hardtop coupes received a new convertible-like roofline complete with simulated bows.

Under the hood, the 364 cubic-inch V8 was replaced by the larger 401 cubic-inch V8 used in Invictas and Electra 225s. LeSabres came standard with a two-barrel high-compression (10.25 to 1) version rated at 280 horsepower with a low-compression regular fuel version of that same engine rated at 265 horsepower offered as a no-cost option. Optional at extra cost was the four-barrel 325-horsepower 401 which was standard on the Invicta, Electra 225 and the mid-year Invicta-based [[Buick Wildcat|Wildcat]] coupe.

Inside, interiors were mildly revised with the \"Mirrormatic\" speedometer replaced by a conventional horizontal sweep unit.

'''1963'''
[[File:1963 Buick Le Sabre 4469.jpg|thumb|left|1963 Buick LeSabre four-door sedan]]
The 1963 LeSabre received a major facelift with even boxier body contours than 1961-62 models and revised rooflines on four-door hardtop sedans.

Inside was a new instrument panel with round instruments shared with other big Buicks and the new personal-luxury Riviera coupe. New options this year included a seven-position tilt steering wheel/column, AM/FM radio and Electro-Cruise control.

The same assortment of 401-cubic-inch V8s was carried over from 1962 but the three-speed manual transmission returned as standard equipment with the two-speed Turbine Drive automatic reverted to the option list. A new and rarely ordered option this year was a floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission.

{{clear_left}}
'''1964'''

[[File:1964 Buick LeSabre Custom hb.jpg|thumb|left|1964 LeSabre Custom Sedan, rear view]]
Minor facelifting with new grille and horizontal taillights replacing the 1963's vertical units highlighted the 1964 LeSabre. A somewhat better equipped \"Custom\" version also joined the lineup this year, easily identifiable by its full length chrome side molding with a brushed metal insert. The regular LeSabre had a narrow trim piece on the rear third of the body.<ref>Gunnell, p. 113</ref>

Under the hood, the 401-cubic-inch V8 was replaced in LeSabre sedans and coupes by a smaller 300-cubic-inch V8 designed for the upsized Special/Skylark intermediates that replaced the aluminum V8 in those vehicles. In standard form, the 300 was rated at 210 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio for use of regular fuel. Optionally available was a 250-horsepower version of the same engine with four-barrel carburetor and higher 11 to 1 compression ratio mandating the use of premium fuel. The LeSabre Estate Wagon came standard with the larger 325-horsepower 401 V8 from the Wildcat and Electra 225 models.

Replacing the old Dynaflow-based two-speed automatic transmission were two new Super Turbine automatics. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 (shared with the intermediate-sized cars) was available with the standard two-barrel 300 V8 while the three-speed Super Turbine 400 (shared with other big Buicks and Rivieras) was standard with the 300 four-barrel and optional with the standard engine as well as the 401 in the Estate Wagon. The standard transmission with the base 300 two-barrel V8 was a three-speed column shift manual and a four-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] was available as an option with either engine. The new ST300 transmission carried over the variable pitch torque converter from the Dynaflow that had been used since the mid-1950s, while the first year for the ST400 featured a fixed-pitch converter.

Inside, only minor trim/upholstery revisions were made.

'''1965'''

LeSabre and other full-sized Buicks were completely restyled for the 1965 model year, featuring more rounded bodylines and Coke-bottle profiles with semi-fastback rooflines on two-door hardtop coupes. Wheelbases remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}, but a new perimeter frame shared with other GM B-body cars replaced the \"X\" frame used since 1961. Body styles were unchanged from 1964 except for the station wagon, which was dropped in favor of the stretched intermediate Special-based [[Buick Sport Wagon]] which featured a raised rear roof and glass skylight over the back seat similar to the [[Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser]].

Starting in 1965, the LeSabre was available in two [[trim package|trim levels]], the base LeSabre and the LeSabre Custom, which featured a more luxurious interior trim and also included the convertible body style not available in the base LeSabre line.

[[File:1965 Buick LeSabre convertible in blue, front left.jpg|thumb|left|1965 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]
Interiors were also new for 1965 with a revised instrument panel featuring two round dials nearly identical with the Riviera for speedometer and other instruments much like the 1963–64 models along with new heating/air conditioning controls.

Drivetrains were unchanged from 1964 with the 250-horsepower two-barrel carbureted 300-cubic-inch V8 the standard powerplant on all models with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed manual or two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. Available at extra cost with the new LeSabre \"400\" package was the 250-horsepower 300-cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetion and 10.25 to 1 compression which required premium fuel, compared to the standard two-barrel engine that used regular fuel. The 400 package also included the more desirable Super Turbine \"400\" three-speed automatic transmission also found in Buick's higher-priced Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera models.

Buick's engine–transmission practice was similar to that of GM's Chevrolet Division, which at that time only offered  the two-speed [[Powerglide]] automatic with most of its engine offerings in full-sized vehicles, requiring buyers who preferred the similar three-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic]] (basically the same transmission under a different name) to order one of the larger V8 engines. Both Pontiac and Oldsmobile offered the Turbo Hydra-Matic on all of their full-sized cars with any engine offering, and three-speed automatics were also the norm on big cars from GM's medium-priced competitors such as the [[Chrysler Newport]] and [[Mercury Monterey]], which offered the [[TorqueFlite]] and [[Cruise-O-Matic]] transmissions, respectively.

'''1966'''
[[File:3rd Buick LeSabre sedan front -- 08-29-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1966 Buick LeSabre 4-Door Hardtop]]
New grilles and four-segmented taillights highlighted the facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side rear view mirror and backup lights.

Under the hood, the 300-cubic-inch V8 was replaced by a larger 340-cubic-inch V8 rated at 220 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and available with either a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed automatic, but the four-speed manual was dropped from the option list. Ordering the LeSabre 400 option upgraded the buyer to a 260-horsepower 340 with four-barrel carburetor and higher 10.25 to 1 compression ratio along with the three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic found in the larger engine Wildcat, Electra 225 and Riviera.

'''1967'''
[[File:'67 Buick LeSabre Coupe (A&W St-Léonard '10).JPG|thumb|left|1967 Buick LeSabre Sport Coupe]]

Somewhat more rounded sheet metal and a swoopier fastback roofline for the two-door hardtop highlighted the 1967 LeSabre but chassis and inner body were unchanged along with drivetrains. Both base and Custom-level LeSabres were continued.

New options for 1967 included front disc brakes and a stereo 8-track tape player. The standard drum brakes were upgraded with more cooling fins and a dual-master cylinder system was introduced.

Engine and transmission offerings were unchanged from 1966.
{{-}}
'''1968'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre 1.jpg|thumb|left|1968 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]
The 1968 LeSabre received a minor facelift including new grilles and taillights along with concealed windshield wipers. Inside was a revised instrument panel with square speedometer surrounded by other instruments with minor trim revisions for both base and Custom models.

A new 350-cubic-inch V8 replaced the previous 340. In standard form the 350 V8 delivered 230 horsepower with two-barrel carburetor and 9 to 1 compression ratio and came with a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional two-speed Super Turbine 300 automatic. The \"LeSabre 400\" option package included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 with 10.25 to 1 compression and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission. The \"Switch-Pitch\" torque converter used in conjunction with the Super Turbine automatic transmission was discontinued in favor of a standard torque converter.
{{-}}
'''1969'''
[[File:'69 Buick LeSabre (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '10).jpg|thumb|left|1969 Buick LeSabre Custom 4-door Hardtop]]
The 1969 LeSabre received new sheetmetal with more squared off styling than the 1965-68 models including a formal roofline on coupes replacing the semi-fastback of previous years. Though the 1969 model was extensively restyled with new sheetmetal, the basic 1965 chassis and inner body structure were retained, along with the roofline of the four-door pillared sedans though vent windows were dropped on all models. Wheelbase remained at {{Convert|123|in|mm}}.
Interiors were mildly revised with minor changes to the instrument panel including the movement of the heating/air conditioning controls to the left of the steering wheel, which was new this year. Headrests, previously optional, were now standard equipment due to a federal safety mandate. The 1969 LeSabre and other Buicks also received a new steering column mounted ignition switch (relocated from the instrument panel) that also locked the steering wheel when the transmission was in Park. The ignition/locking steering column appeared on all 1969 General Motors cars one year ahead of the federal mandate requiring all cars to be so equipped.

Also new was a variable-ratio power steering unit along with revised front suspension geometry for improved ride and handling under Buick's tradename of Accu-Drive. Steel rails were also built into the doors (and rear quarter panels on coupes and convertibles) for improved side impact protection as was the case with all 1969 GM B- and C-body cars.

Powertrains were unchanged from 1968 with the 230-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8 standard and available with a three-speed [[manual transmission]] or the two-speed Super Turbine 300 [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] while the LeSabre \"400\" package once again included a 280-horsepower 350 four-barrel engine and three-speed Super Turbine 400 automatic.

'''1970'''
[[File:'70 Buick LeSabre Convertible (Auto classique Pièces auto Jarry Laval '12).jpg|thumb|left|1970 Buick LeSabre Convertible]]
Only minor detail changes including grille and taillight revisions were made to the 1970 LeSabre. New features this year included a hidden radio antenna which amounted to two wires embedded in the windshield. Wheelbase was increased by one inch to {{Convert|124|in|mm}}, matching direct competitors such as Oldsmobile Delta 88, Mercury Monterey and Chrysler Newport.

Both base and Custom models were again offered. Engines were revised with the standard 350 two-barrel V8 increased in horsepower from 230 to 260. A new option for 1970 was a low-compression regular-fuel version of the 350 four-barrel rated at 285 horsepower and the high-compression premium fuel 350 four-barrel V8 was reworked with horsepower upped to 315 on a 10.25 to 1 compression ratio. Added to the lineup was a new LeSabre 455 line which shared interior and exterior trimmings with the LeSabre Custom and was powered by Buick's new 455 cubic-inch V8 with four-barrel carburetor, 10.25 to 1 compression and 370 horsepower, which also required premium fuel.

Transmission offerings included a standard three-speed manual with column shift for the base 350 two-barrel or optional three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 350 automatic, which was standard equipment with the two 350 four-barrel engines. This transmission completely replaced the old two-speed automatic offered with the smaller base engines in past years, while the 455 was paired with the Turbo Hydra-matic 400. Buick now joined other GM divisions in marketing the automatic transmission under the Turbo Hydra-matic trade name rather than the \"Super Turbine\" designation used since 1964.

At the start of the model year, variable-ratio power steering and power drum brakes were optional equipment. Those items were made standard equipment on all LeSabres (and Wildcats) effective January 1, 1970. Power front disc brakes remained an extra-cost option.

For the first time since 1964, Buick offered a full-sized station wagon for 1970 under the '''Estate Wagon''' nameplate. Though it used the LeSabre's B-body, it rode on the C-body Electra 225's {{Convert|127|in|mm|adj=on}} wheelbase chassis. The Estate Wagon came standard with the 455 V8 and interior trims were similar to the LeSabre Custom and Wildcat.

The 1965-70 [[GM B platform]] is the fourth best selling automobile platform in history after the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], [[Ford Model T]] and the [[Lada Riva]].

'''1971'''

Like the other GM divisions, Buick completely restyled its B- and C-body cars for 1971. The full-size cars emerged larger and heavier than before and also ever after. The styling featured curved bodysides, long hoods and wide expanses of glass, similar to that of Chrysler Corporation's 1969 full-sized cars, but with a lower beltline than the Chrysler products. Semi-fastback rooflines were utilized on two-door hardtop coupes and convertibles had a new top design to permit a full-width rear seat.

[[File:LeSabre71.JPG|thumb|left|1971 Buick LeSabre Sedan]]
The same assortment of 350 and 455 cubic-inch V8s were carried over but featured lowered compression ratios and other modifications in order to enable the use of lower-octane low-lead or unleaded gasoline as a result of a General Motors corporate mandate. Variable-ratio power steering and power front disc brakes were made standard equipment on all LeSabres at the start of the 1971 model year. In March, the [[Turbo Hydramatic]] transmission became standard equipment, and all Buick LeSabres would remain so equipped in base form until the nameplate's final year in 2005.

The new body also featured a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents mounted in the trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.

However, within weeks of the 1971 models' debut, Buick and all other GM dealers received multiple complaints from drivers who complained that the ventilation system pulled cold air into the car before the heater could warm up and could not be turned off. The ventilation system was extensively modified for 1972.

Also new for the 1971 was an optional MaxTrac computerized traction control system.

Inside was a new wrap-around cockpit style instrument panel that placed all controls and instruments within easy reach of the driver, along with easier serviceability with instruments and switches accessible from the front when the faceplate was removed. The seats of a new full-foam design with headrests more squared off than 1969-70. Again, base and Custom model LeSabres were offered in the same sedan and coupe bodystyles while the convertible was a Custom-only offering. The LeSabre 455 model line was dropped for 1971 with the larger engine now being offered as an option on the regular base and Custom-series models. LeSabre Customs equipped with the optional 455 engine got a \"455\" badge underneath the LeSabre nameplates on the front fenders instead of the \"Custom\" badge normally used.

'''1972'''
[[File:1972-1973 Buick LeSabre sedan -- 12-22-2011.jpg|thumb|left|1972 Buick LeSabre]]
A revised grille and taillights lenses were among the styling changes for 1972. Out back, a small \"BUICK\" nameplate was located above the right side taillight replacing the larger block letters spelling \"B&nbsp;U&nbsp;I&nbsp;C&nbsp;K\" across the lower trunk lid between the taillights in 1971. Also new for '72 was a one-year only 2 1/2-mph front bumper. All B, C, and E body (large) GM cars received such a bumper for '72.

Interior trims received only slight revisions from 1971. A revised flow-through ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents.

Both the 350 and 455 V8s were carried over from 1971 with horsepower ratings switched the new SAE net figures based on an engine as installed in an automobile with accessories and emission controls hooked up, rather than the gross horsepower method of past years based upon a [[dynamometer]] rating from an engine not installed in a vehicle. With that, the standard 350 two-barrel V8 was rated at 160 net horsepower compared to 230 gross horsepower in 1971 while the top 455 V8 was rated at 250 net horsepower in 1972 compared to 315 in 1971. Engines were also revised to meet the 1972 federal and California emission standards with California-bound cars receiving EGR valves, which would be installed on engines of virtually all automobiles for nationwide sales in 1973.

Inside, the instrument panel featured a new \"FASTEN SEAT BELTS\" light due to a new federal safety regulation and the buzzer which sounded when the key was left in the ignition also sounded upon starting the car to remind the driver and passengers to buckle up.

'''1973'''
[[File:1973 Buick LeSabre 4-door hardtop sedan front.jpg|thumb|1973 LeSabre hardtop sedan, showing the new bigger 5&nbsp;mph bumpers]]
A larger federally mandated \"5&nbsp;mph\" front bumper and new vertical bar grille highlighted the 1973 LeSabre along with revised taillights set in the somewhat larger rear bumper. Both the 350 and 455 V8s were revised with EGR valves used on both federal and California-emission equipped cars.

The LeSabre Custom convertible was dropped this year leaving the short-lived [[Buick Centurion|Centurion]] as Buick's only ragtop that year as the intermediate Skylark (replaced by the Century for 1973) lost its ragtop completely after the 1972 model year. The engine options continued largely unchanged.

'''1974'''
[[File:1974 Buick Lesabre Luxus.jpg|thumb|left|1974 Buick LeSabre Luxus 4-door sedan hardtop.]]
New grilles and taillights along with a 5&nbsp;mph rear bumper highlighted the 1974 Buick LeSabre. Four-door pillared and hardtop sedans retained the same rooflines as 1973 but the two-door hardtop coupe featured a new roofline with a side rear opera windows.

Inside, the instrument panel was substantially revised but retained the wrap-around theme. A new (and seldom ordered) option was an \"Air Cushion Restraint System\" which included driver- and passenger-side airbags along with a unique four-spoke steering wheel. This option, also available on Electra 225s and Rivieras as well as full-sized Oldsmobiles and Cadillacs, was not very popular and was dropped after the 1976 model year.

New integrated seat and shoulder belts were introduced this year along with a federally mandated interlock system that required the driver and right front passenger to buckle their seat belts in order to start the vehicle. The interlock was met with such a major public outcry that Congress rescinded the interlock regulation in late 1974 after a few early 1975 models were so equipped, permitting owners of all 1974 and the early 1975 models equipped with the interlock system to legally disconnect it.

With the Centurion line discontinued after 1973, LeSabre was now Buick's only B-body full-sized car. The base LeSabre was continued, but a new LeSabre Luxus series replaced both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion. The Luxus convertible also returned the ragtop to the LeSabre line after a one-year absence and was Buick's only ragtop.

Engine offerings were revised for 1974. The 350 two-barrel remained standard on all models with optional engines including a 350 four-barrel and 455 four-barrel V8s, both carried over from 1973 with revisions to meet the 1974 emission standards. New engine options for 1974 included a 455 two-barrel and the Stage 1 455 \"performance package\" which added dual exhausts, suspension upgrades and other equipment.

New options for 1974 included radial-ply tires, GM's High Energy Ignition and a \"low fuel\" warning light that illuminated when the fuel tank was down to four gallons. This would be the final year for the MaxTrac electronic traction control system as an option.

'''1975'''
[[File:Buick LeSabre Custom convertible silver-black fl-r.jpg|thumb|1975 Buick LeSabre Custom Convertible]]
The upscale LeSabre Luxus designation was dropped and replaced by the LeSabre Custom nameplate. 1975 also was the first year of the catalytic converter, and standard high energy ignition which was part of GM's Maximum Mileage System at the time Introduced in September 1974. The 1975 LeSabre was the first to require use of unleaded gasoline, due to the advent of the catalytic converter. The LeSabre lineup offered a coupe and two sedans while the LeSabre Custom lineup offered the coupe, two sedans, and the only convertible in the Buick lineup. 1975 would be the final year for the LeSabre Custom Convertible with around 5,300 examples rolling off the assembly lines.

Engine offerings were reduced to just two: the standard 5.7-litre V8 (350 CID) and a four-barrel carburetor or optional 7.5-litre V8 (455 CID) with a four barrel.

Bodylines on the 1975 were somewhat softer than the 1974 model featuring round headlights side-by-side and a cross-hatched patterned grille that flowed across the front of the car and under the headlights. Turn signals were located in the front bumper. A Buick tri-shield hood ornament was standard on the Custom Series and optional on the base series. The three-hole 'ventiports' were moved from the hood to the front fenders. Slightly larger taillamps than the 74 draped the back of the car with back-up lights positioned in the center broken up by the license plate. Four-door pillared sedans received a new small third windows to emulate the six-window \"Colonnade\" styling of GM intermediates while four-door hardtop sedans had new opera windows.

Inside, a new flat instrument panel shared with Electra and Riviera replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and featured a horizontal sweep speedometer that read to only 100&nbsp;mph compared to 120&nbsp;mph in previous years and also included kilometer readings. Otherwise, interior trimmings received only minor revisions.

Convertible production for both the LeSabre Custom and the Centurion convertibles were not very abundant in the years 1971 to 1975. The rarest production in that time was the 1971 LeSabre Custom with just over 1,800 units built, and the most produced was the 1973 Centurion with slightly over 5,700 units built. Due to this very low production volume and the end of the full-size convertible era, this may make this series of ragtop LeSabre Custom and Centurion Convertibles quite collectable - depending on the vehicles' overall condition. The convertible mechanism used was called the 'scissor top' that folded inward on itself, instead of straight back. This was featured on all GM full-size convertibles from 1971 to 1976.

'''1976'''

Only minor styling changes highlighted the 1976 Buick LeSabre, which was the final year for the 1971-vintage bodyshell, the unpopular and rarely-ordered driver- and passenger-side airbag option, the 455 V8 and hardtop bodystyles. Changes amounted to rectangular quad headlights, eggcrate grille and turn signals located just below the headlights.

The '76 LeSabre was the only American full-size car with a standard V6 engine, which was Buick's brand-new 3.8-litre (231 CID) V6 engine. The V6 was only offered on the base-level LeSabre and not mentioned in initial 1976 Buick literature issued in September 1975 because the [[V6 engine]] was a last-minute addition to the line. The 350-cubic-inch V8 was the base engine on the LeSabre Custom and the 455-cubic-inch V8 was optional. Both V8s were optional on the base LeSabre.

'''1977'''
[[File:1977 Buick LeSabre sedan, brown.jpg|thumb|left|1977 Buick LeSabre sedan]]

The '''1977 Buick LeSabre''' and other GM B-body full-sized cars were considerably smaller and lighter than their predecessors to the tune of losing 700-800 pounds of weight and overall length of 10 to {{convert|15|in|mm}}. The full-sized cars were the beginning of a \"corporate-wide\" downsizing of vehicles in order to improve fuel economy ratings following the 1973-74 energy crisis that would filter down to intermediates in 1978, personal-luxury cars in 1979 and compacts in 1980 with subsequent downsizings of each line of vehicles scheduled in subsequent years.

Although the '77 Buick LeSabre was considerably smaller on the outside, headroom, rear seat legroom and trunk space were increased over the much larger 1976 model. The engine lineup consisted of an assortment of engines including the standard 231 cubic-inch Buick-built [[V6]] and various optional powerplants including a Pontiac-built 301 cubic-inch V8, 350 cubic-inch V8s built by both Buick and Oldsmobile, and an Oldsmobile 403 cubic-inch V8. The V6 was standard in base and Custom coupes and sedans, the 301 V8 on the new LeSabre Sport Coupe and the 350 V8 on the Estate Wagon.

[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Front.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]
'''1978'''
Following a major downsizing and redesign, the 1978 Buick LeSabre received only minor changes including new grillework. Engine offerings were unchanged from 1977 on most models, but the LeSabre Sport Coupe was now powered by a turbocharged 231 cubic-inch V6 with a four-barrel carburetor producing 165 BHP (SAE Net) at 4000 RPM and a rather useful 285&nbsp;lb-ft at 2,800 rpm.

'''1979'''
[[File:1979 Buick LeSabre Coupe Rear.jpg|thumb|left|1979 Buick LeSabre \"Palm Beach Edition\" Coupe]]
Only minor changes including new grille and rear taillight patterns highlighted the 1979 LeSabre aside from the top-level LeSabre Custom of previous years being renamed the LeSabre Limited. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the turbocharged V6 as standard equipment and a new option for this model only were Strato bucket seats with center console. This would be the final year for the Pontiac 301 and Oldsmobile 403 V8s on the option list.

'''1980'''
[[File:'80 Buick LeSabre Coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1980 Buick LeSabre coupe]]
New sheet metal highlighted by new swept back grilles/headlights, new taillights and revised coupe rooflines were among the changes to the 1980 Buick LeSabre aside from the complete disappearance of Buick's traditional portholes (the C-body Electra would retain them until 1984). The cars were also a bit lighter in weight for improved fuel economy along with the slightly more aerodynamic sheet metal which made the 1980 models look a little bigger than their 1977–79 counterparts but overall dimensions changed very little.

Engine offerings were shuffled a bit for 1980 with the standard Buick 231 V6 and optional 350 V8 carried over from 1979, with the Buick 350 making its last appearance this year. New options included a larger Buick-built 252 V6, an Oldsmobile-built 307 V8 and a 350 Diesel V8, also built by Oldsmobile. The LeSabre Sport Coupe continued with the four-barrel turbocharged 231 V6 as its standard and only available powerplant. The Sport Coupe was dropped from the line after 1980 along with the Turbo V6 engine due to slow sales, but the Turbo V6 continued on the Regal and Riviera.

Following the demise of the Buick 350 V8 after this year, Buick would only build V6 engines as a result of GM's emerging corporate engine policy dictating types of engines built by various divisions for use throughout the corporate lineup. According to the plan, Buick would build V6 engines, Pontiac would manufacture four-cylinder powerplants, Chevrolet would build four-cylinder, V6 and V8 engines, and V8s for larger and higher-priced cars would be sourced from Oldsmobile and Cadillac. This meant that from 1981 onward, V8-powered Buicks would feature Oldsmobile engines, both gasoline and diesel.

'''1981'''
[[File:'81 Buick LeSabre (Auto classique Bellepros Vaudreuil-Dorion '11).JPG|thumb|left|1981 Buick LeSabre]]
Only minor grille and trim changes highlighted the 1981 LeSabre, still offered in base and Limited models. The modified grille now had five (rather than four) rows of openings.<ref>Gunnell, pp. 199-200</ref> Engine offerings included the 231 cubic-inch normally aspirated Buick V6 (standard on sedans and coupes although decidedly underpowered for a car weighing in at around 4,000&nbsp;lbs.), or optional Olds 307 cubic-inch V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and the 350 cubic-inch Oldsmobile-built diesel V8 (optional on all models). All gasoline engines received GM's \"Computer Command Control\" system to control fuel mixture, spark advance, and emissions controls.

The three-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic transmission was standard equipment with the V6 and the diesel V8. New this year was a Turbo Hydra-Matic 200 4-R four-speed automatic overdrive transmission paired with the gasoline V8 engine for improved highway fuel economy.

LeSabre and other GM cars for 1981 received new 35 PSI radial tires for improved rolling resistance and fuel economy.

'''1982-83'''
[[File:1982 Buick LeSabre Limited diesel sedan front.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Buick LeSabre Limited sedan (diesel)]]

Few changes were made for the Buick LeSabre for 1982-83 other than revised grilles and trim items. The base LeSabre sedan and coupe models were dropped for 1983 with the LeSabre Custom now the entry-level model and paired with the upscale LeSabre Limited models in both coupe and sedan models. Engine offerings in these two years included the standard Buick 231 V6 or optional 252 V6, or optional Oldsmobile 307 (gasoline) or 350 (Diesel) V8s.

'''1984'''
[[File:'84 Buick LeSabre (Les chauds vendredis '12).jpg|thumb|left|1984 Buick LeSabre sedan]]
New grilles and wider and lower taillights were among the appearance changes for the 1984 Buick LeSabre, still offered in Custom and Limited models. The 252 V6 was dropped from the option list but all other engines returned including the 231 V6 (standard on coupes and sedans), or optional Oldsmobile 307 gasoline V8 (standard on wagons, optional on sedans and coupes) and Oldsmobile 350 Diesel V8 (optional all models).

'''1985'''

This would be the final year for the rear-drive LeSabre before another downsizing and conversion to front-wheel-drive for 1986 (sedans and coupes only; the rear-drive LeSabre Estate Wagon would soldier on unchanged a few more years). It was also the last LeSabre sedan and coupe to feature body-on-frame construction, V8 power and Buick's traditional all-coil suspension (the 1992–96 Roadmaster sedans would also be similarly built). The top-line LeSabre Limited became the LeSabre Limited Collectors Edition to mark the end of an era for the rear-drive sedan and coupe. Engine offerings included the standard 231 V6 (sedans and coupes) or optional Olds 307 V8 (which came as standard in the wagons) and Oldsmobile 350 diesel V8 (available in all models). 1985 307s received roller lifters for reduced friction. Meanwhile, the Estate Wagon continued on largely unchanged through 1990.

The 1986 LeSabre was introduced on the new [[front wheel drive]] [[GM H platform|H platform]], after departing from [[rear wheel drive]] on the [[GM B platform]].  Joining the LeSabre on the H-body included the [[Oldsmobile 88|Oldsmobile Delta 88]] and the 1987 [[Pontiac Bonneville]], which returned to full-size after a short-lived run as a [[mid-size]] on the [[GM G platform (RWD)|G platform]].  One of the features of the LeSabre version of the H-body was a reverse clamshell hood - one that is hinged at the front (in the same fashion as that of the [[Buick Electra]] and [[Chevrolet Corvette]] of that era) instead of at the back near the cowl and windshield.  The all new styling and implementation of front wheel drive ushered in a new era for the LeSabre, being of a flush aerodynamic design.  The most radical change may have been the removal of Buick's long standing [[Ventiport]]s from the front fenders.

Most Buick LeSabre models from this generation were powered by Buick's 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 engine.  It started out with {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. It added balance shafts to become the famous \"3800\" V6 for 1988, with {{convert|165|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. This engine increased to {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in 1991 with the addition of Tuned Port Injection.  The 1986 model, however, featured the 3.0 liter (181 cubic-inch) V6 as standard.  Each year yielded slightly different design changes.  1986 is notable for its sealed-beam headlights, 1987 for the substitution of more modern headlights with exchangeable bulbs as well as the introduction of door-mounted seat-belts.  In 1988 the 3.8 engine was changed over to the 3800 (vin code C) motor, while 1989 saw slight changes in the layout of the engine bay accessories (notably the position of the battery, washer fluid tank, and coolant overflow tank).  For 1990 there was a change in the design of the front bumper/grille assembly and different tail light design, while the 1991s were largely identical to the 1990 model cars aside from a small power increase.

In 1986, a LeSabre Grand National model was built to qualify the coupe body-style for NASCAR competition. The LeSabre Grand National is among the rarest of all Buicks ever made, with production numbers of less than 120 units.  It was only available in black with gray interior.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|title=1986 LeSabre Grand National Page|accessdate=2012-01-08|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083727/http://lesabret-type.com/LeSabreGN.html|archivedate=2012-02-11}}</ref> After the end of production of the Grand National, a new sporting LeSabre appeared in form of the LeSabre T-Type, which was offered from 1987 until 1989.  The LeSabre T-Type had many unique options that were styled after the Regal Grand National and Regal T-Type models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lesabret.com/thecar.html |title=The Buick Lesabre T-type |publisher=Lesabret.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref> Some of those options included blacked-out trim, gray-on-black seats (1987 only), gray-on-black door panels, gray dash and trim, and T-Type specific front and rear spoilers.  For 1990, the T-Type trim package was dropped due to slow sales and Buick's repositioning within the GM hierarchy as a maker of \"Premium American Motorcars\" rather than sporty/performance models.

Beginning in 1989 and continuing for several years, the Buick LeSabre received accolades from J.D. Power as one of the highest rated automobiles in customer satisfaction based on factors such as quality and reliability.

This LeSabre was introduced in 1991 for the 1992 model year, and was redesigned along the same lines as the previous year's [[Buick Park Avenue|Park Avenue]]. The LeSabre was available only as a four-door (\"[[family]]-style\") sedan from this point forward until the car was discontinued in 2005. The headlights were streamlined with a separated amber turn signal strip wrapping around the lower front fascia. The rear fascia featured a wider trunk mouth and lower lift over height to ease loading baggage while the front was smoothed with simplified chrome molding and absent bumperettes. The LeSabre also featured GM's plastic body technologies, with high-stress plastic replacing traditional steel in the front fenders.

[[File:'94-'96 Buick LeSabre.jpg|left|thumb|1994-96 Buick LeSabre with aftermarket vinyl roof]]
The LeSabre's engine from 1992-1995 was the [[Buick V6 engine#Series I|3800]] [[V6 engine|V6]] (L27), which produced {{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and 225 [[lb·ft]] (305 [[N·m]]) The 3513&nbsp;lb (1593&nbsp;kg) car got 18&nbsp;mpg (13.1&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) in the city and 28&nbsp;mpg (8.4&nbsp;L/100&nbsp;km) on the highway, which was slightly better than the 1991 model. The car accelerated to 60&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) in 8.9 seconds and could cover the quarter mile in 16.9 seconds at 80&nbsp;mph (129&nbsp;km/h). Top speed was electronically limited to 108&nbsp;mph (173&nbsp;km/h).

The LeSabre was offered in two trim levels. The Custom trim level was the base level. The Limited was the premium trim level featuring alloy wheels, front hood ornament, and fold down access panels in the rear seat to access the trunk.  The car had an 18-gallon fuel tank, [[Anti-lock brakes]], and a power radio antenna located in the rear passenger side quarter panel. Instrumentation included gas gauge, speedometer, and gear indicator.  Optional instrumentation included a tachometer and temperature, oil pressure, and charging voltage gauges.

In 1993, a special edition LeSabre was sold to commemorate Buick's 90th anniversary.  In addition to Custom trim level standard equipment, this model included \"90th Anniversary\" badging, cassette player, cruise control, rear window defogger, power driver's seat, carpeted floor mats, exterior pinstripes, and choice of wire or aluminum wheel covers.

For 1996, the LeSabre received the [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] powerplant, with a gain of {{convert|35|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The engine increased fuel economy ratings over its predecessor, 19&nbsp;MPG city and 30&nbsp;MPG highway [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] estimates.

The LeSabre was facelifted for 1997, moving the turn signal indicators to the front bumper instead of the headlamp assembly. A new gauge cluster with a tachometer appeared. The front fenders switched from the composite material to a more conventional galvanized steel substrate. Other minor changes also took effect, including a different grille, different rear backup lights and different trim. The overall effect of these changes was that the 1997-99 models looked a little slimmer than their predecessors. Despite the redesign of the exterior, one automotive magazine article around 1996-97 said the interior was \"1970-something\" meaning it was rather old-fashioned for a car from the mid-late 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

In 1999, Flint, Michigan's Buick City assembly plant, which built the LeSabre as well as the Pontiac Bonneville was shut down and LeSabre production moved to Hamtramck.  The last 1999 LeSabre left Buick City's final line as the last Buick City-built car in June 1999.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The 2000 LeSabre was introduced in March 1999. It was now built on [[General Motors|GM's]] [[GM G platform (FWD)|G platform]]; however GM chose to continue to refer to it as the H platform.<ref name=\"Frame\"/>  The LeSabre was manufactured at GM's [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly]] factory in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] and Lake Orion Assembly, in Lake Orion, Michigan.

Some of the changes with the redesign included a new grille that did not open with the hood, and slightly smaller exterior dimensions.  Despite its somewhat smaller exterior size, it still offered similar interior room and more trunk space than the previous model.  A [[Air filter#Automotive cabin air filters|pollen filter]] was installed with this generation, and was accessed from inside the engine compartment on the passenger side against the firewall.  Custom and Limited trim levels continued to be offered.

In 2003, a Celebration Edition package was added in recognition of Buick's centennial. The Celebration Edition featured all the standard equipment of the Limited with a choice pearlescent White Diamond or Crimson Pearl tricoat paint schemes, a blacked-out grille, 16\" chrome wheels, and special badging. Other features optional or standard on the LeSabre included Stabilitrak, [[OnStar]], EyeCue heads-up display, all-weather traction control, automatic load-leveling, side airbags, tire pressure monitoring system, heated seats, dual-zone climate control, and RainSense automatic windshield wipers.  Although created to commemorate Buick's centennial in 2003, the package remained available in 2004 and 2005.

Among other packages offered on LeSabre included a Platinum Edition package on 2004 Customs.

The standard, and only available, engine for the eighth-generation LeSabre was the 3.8 L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|Series II Buick 3800]] [[V6]] providing:
* Power: 205 [[horsepower|hp]] (153 [[kilowatt|kW]])
* Torque: 230 [[lb·ft]] (312 [[N·m]])

==Discontinuation==
The LeSabre was America's best-selling full- size car when it was discontinued at the end of the 2005 model year. It was replaced in 2006 by the [[Buick Lucerne|Lucerne]], Buick's newly designed flagship. The last LeSabre rolled off the [[Lake Orion, Michigan]] assembly line on June 18, 2004 (retooling the plant to build the [[Pontiac G6]]) and the last [[Hamtramck, Michigan]] LeSabre rolled off the assembly line in mid-August, 2005.

The '''1st Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteers''' later the '''9th (Dumbartonshire) Btn, Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders''' was an infantry later artillery unit of Britain's part-time force, the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. The battalion was formed in 1860 as a battalion and later consolidated as a corps in 1880 before being transferred to the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]. In 1938 the battalion was transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]], served in [[World War II]], and was later absorbed into the 402nd (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Regiment, Royal Artillery. Although the regiment and battalion lineage was ended in 1955, the location of the original unit and highland links were continued through [[102 (Clyde) Field Squadron, Royal Engineers]].

== Origins ==

=== First Volunteers ===
In 1793, much before the first rifle volunteer corps of [[Dumbartonshire]] were formed, the county managed many local units which included; [[Highland Fencible Corps#Dumbarton Fencibles (1794)|Dumbartonshire Fencibles]], [[Dumbartonshire Fencible Cavalry]] (later the Dumbartonshire Yeomanry Cavalry), [[Stirling, Dumbarton, Clackmannan and Kinross Militia]], as well as many local militias.<ref name=\":02\">Vale of Leven, Preface</ref><ref name=\":32\">Vale of Leven, Sons of the Rock</ref><ref name=\":12\">T.F.

In 1859 the threat of another war with [[France]] led to the creation of local volunteer forces under the direction of the [[War Office]]. 7th May 1860 saw the formation of the Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteers (the “DRV”), who had their first head-quarters at [[Balloch, West Dunbartonshire|Balloch]]. All corps raised within [[Dumbartonshire]] joined the 1st Administrative Battalion which eventually became consolidated in 1880 as the 1st corps of that county.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":32\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":52\">T.F.

==== Localisation ====

The [[Cardwell Reforms]] were a series of reforms of the British Army undertaken by [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Edward Cardwell]] between 1868 and 1874 with the support of Liberal prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. Gladstone paid little attention to military affairs but he was keen on efficiency. In 1870, he pushed through Parliament major changes in Army organisation. [[Germany|Germany's]] stunning triumph over [[France Télévisions|France]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] proved that the Prussian system of professional soldiers with up-to-date weapons was far superior to the traditional system of gentlemen-soldiers that Britain used. Under Cardwell's localisation scheme, the country was divided into 66 Brigade Districts (later renamed Regimental Districts), based on county boundaries and population density. But, there were limitations to the extent that localisation could be implemented.

One of these 'brigade districts' was No.58 which maintained a brigade depot in [[Stirling]] which covered the counties of; [[Kinross-shire]], [[Clackmannanshire]], [[Stirlingshire]], '''[[Dumbartonshire]]''', [[Argyllshire]], [[Buteshire]], and [[Renfrewshire]]. No.58 brigade district was linked with two well known Scottish regiments; [[72nd (Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]] and the [[91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]]. Within this brigade, the militia and volunteers of these counties were grouped as to provide a simple 'organisational system' of control.<ref name=\":62\" /><ref>T.F. Mills, ''[http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/depot/1873.htm Training Depots (Territorialisation of British Infantry) 1873-1881]'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20071218194948/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/depot/1873.htm Archived] on 18 December 2007 at the [https://web.archive.org Wayback Machine]. Retrieved 19 February 2020.</ref>

on 28 April 1880, the mass consolidations of the Rifle Volunteers occurred, as a result of these changes, all of the former corps were moved under command of the '''1st Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps''' based in [[Helensburgh]] which was expanded to battalion size, and subsequently organised as;<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":32\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

* Corps Headquarters in [[Helensburgh]] (from former 1st Corps HQ)
* A Company in [[Helensburgh]] (former 1st Corps)
* B Company in [[Cardross]] (former 7th)
* C Company in [[Dumbarton]] (former 6th)
* D Company in [[Bonhill]] (former 3rd)
* E Company in [[Jamestown, West Dunbartonshire|Jamestown]] (former 4th)
* F Company in [[Alexandria, Scotland|Alexandria]] (former 5th)
* G Company in [[Clydebank]] (former 14th)
* H Company in [[Maryhill]] (former 2nd)
* I Company in [[Milngavie]] (former 13th)
* K Company in [[Kirkintilloch]] (former 10th)
* L Company in [[Cumbernauld]] (former 11th)
* M Company in [[Luss]] (former 9th, dressed in kilts and discriminated against due to this, therefore placed at 'end of the line') — ''disbanded 1882 due to reluctance to change dress and discrimination (see Uniform notes)''

==== Royal Review ====
Many times throughout the 9th Corps (later M co.) history, discrimination occurred. For some time, the new commanding officer of the corps in 1881 ([[Lieutenant Colonel]] Commandant, H. Currier) was not satisfied with the conduct of the 'Luss Volunteers'. When the 1st Dumbartonshire RVC was called upon for the royal review in 1881, the company was not invited and told to 'remain at home' due to their dress because the commandant thought they 'spoilt the corp's reputation and style'. In typical Scottish style, the corps instead embarked for [[Edinburgh]] to arrive and march with another corps right next to the Dumbartonshire RVC in direct defiance of the commandant. This is one of the reasons why this company was later disbanded and reformed in [[Renton, West Dunbartonshire|Renton]] on 12 February 1882. ''(see uniform notes)''<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

==== Regimentation ====
On 7 January 1881 following the [[Cardwell Reforms]], the corps was attached to [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Princess Louises's Regiment (The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)]], due to location of recruitment, of which [[Dunbartonshire]] fell within. The battalion (as it was now referred to as) was entitled to wear the uniform and badges of the regiment, although it insisted in retaining the elephant and castle emblem in the Argyll badge. After moving under control of the Argylls, the battalion was in-fact ''not'' re-titled as the 6th (Dumbartonshire) Volunteer Btn, but instead referred to as the ''[6th Volunteer Btn]'' 1st Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps. In 1884, 'L' company based in [[Cumbernauld]] was reduced to a detachment in 'K' Company, and a new 'L' company was raised on 1 April 1884 in [[Yoker]]. In 1900 just before the battalion sent volunteers to [[South Africa]], the battalion formed two specialist companies 'O' (Mounted) in [[Maryhill]] and 'Q' (Cyclists) in [[Dumbarton]]. In 1891, the corps had a small name to change to become the '''1st Dumbartonshire Volunteer Rifle Corps'''. The years 1881-1908 saw a marked improvement in the organisation, training and equipment of the local volunteers as the government attempted to increase the fighting value of these forces. Funding in the form of grants to the units was considerably improved as well as the financial position of the volunteers.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

==== South African War ====
[[File:Boer_War_Memorial,_Stirling_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_192295.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Boer_War_Memorial,_Stirling_Castle_-_geograph.org.uk_-_192295.jpg|alt=|thumb|The Argyll and Sutherland's Boer War Memorial at Stirling Castle]]
During the [[South African War]] the battalion contributed 98 of its members to the various new formations. Of these, [[Lieutenant]] R. L.

==== End of the Force ====
By 1905 the battalion strength was 50 officers and 1,271 other ranks in the 14 companies which made up the battalion. In 1906 the battalion was placed in the 31st Field Army Brigade, 16th Division, and attended camp for 15 days. The battalion had a central rife-range at [[Auchin-carroch]], in the [[Vale of Leven]], up to 900 yards, and A, I, and K Companies had also ranged near their headquarters, that of the latter being held in conjunction with E Company, 4th Volunteer Battalion. In 1908, the battalion was reduced and transferred to the [[Territorial Force]] (see below).<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

=== Background ===
Under the army reforms introduced by [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Richard Haldane]] in 1907, the existing auxiliary forces (the [[Imperial Yeomanry]] and [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer Forces]]) were to be combined (with effect from 1 April 1908) as a new organisation to be known as the [[Territorial Force]] (TF). In his 'Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill', Mr Haldane set up an establishment of fourteen divisions (infantry), fourteen mounted brigades (yeomanry), army troops, and troops for coastal defence. These to be raised and administered locally by a number of Territorial Force Associations. Under these reforms, the structure of infantry units were also altered, with each containing a peace establishment of 1,009 of all ranks in 8 companies 'A' to 'H', all under command of a [[Lieutenant Colonel]].<ref>Westlake, The Territorials, Introduction and p. 2.</ref><ref>Westlake, Men-at-Arms, p. 3.</ref>

When the [[Territorial Force]] was formed, the corps was transferred and redesignated as the '''9th Battalion, Princess Louise's Regiment (The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)''' but in March 1909 it was renamed to represent the county designation to become the '''9th (The Dumbartonshire) Btn'''. Following their movement to the new TF the battalion was reduced in size by relegating 17 officers to the supernumerary list and struck 640 other ranks off the strength and went into the new Territorial Force with 29 officers and 840 men in 8 companies. When the battalion was transferred they adopted the kilt, hose, and sporran took the place of trews.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref>The London Gazette, ''[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28121/supplement/2155 Published by Authority Friday, March 20, 1908].''

After transferring to the TF, great efforts were made to stimulate recruitment helped by eminent people such as [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|John George Edward Henry Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll]] speaking at public meetings in support of the new battalion throughout the county. New colours, paid for by Lady Inverclyde wife of the Lord Lieutenant, were presented by [[Louise, Princess Royal|HRH Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife]], Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment, in the grounds of Ardencaple House. Two years later these colours were brought back to [[Dumbarton]] and placed in the County Council buildings.<ref name=\":02\" />

In July 1914 as the international situation worsened, the [[British Armed Forces]] were on high alert as the [[Imperial German Army]] moving towards the neutral nation of the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], of which the UK protected. When German forces crossed into [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]] declared war on [[Germany]] and later the rest of the [[Central Powers]]. During this period, the battalion along with the 6th (Renfrewshire), 7th, and 8th (The Argyllshire) Btns was part of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Brigade]] in the [[Highland Division]].<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\">Chris Baker, ''[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/princess-louises-argyll-sutherland-highlanders/ Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)]'' at [http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk Long, Long Trail].

=== 1/9th (The Dumbartonshire) Btn ===
The declaration of war in 1914 found the local TF at camp in [[Kintyre]], and the battalion was embodied on 4 August 1914. The Battalion assembled at [[Dumbarton]] and many were billeted in local schools. On the morning of Tuesday 11th August the Battalion mustered on the Common before leaving for [[Bedford]] by train. The men took with them a number of carts and repainted them in military colours, as well as some horses which they had commandeered in the district. The CO, Colonel Leith-Buchanan was not passed fit for service overseas and was replaced by Lt Colonel James Clark. On 22 October the [[Highland Division]] was given a visit by the [[George V|King]] and inspected there before departing to [[France]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\">Westlake, Men-at-Arms, p. 23-4.</ref><ref>Chris Baker, [http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/51st-highland-division/ 51st (Highland) Division] at [http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk The Long, Long Trail].

In early 1915 the Highland Division was broken up mostly with many battalions moving independently to [[France]] in the coming months. On 19/20 February the battalion landed in [[Le Havre]] (north [[France]]) and on 23 February 1915 the battalion came under orders of the newly formed [[81st Brigade (United Kingdom)|81st Brigade]] within the also newly formed [[27th Division (United Kingdom)|27th Division]]. By 14 March 1915 the battalion was in [[St Eloi]] and on the front line, just east of the town. During this period the battalion saw constant attack and subsequent counter-attacks.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\">[https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/maps/units/380/argyll-and-sutherland-highlanders WW1 Troop Movement and ORBATS for Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders] ([https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/maps/units/380/argyll-and-sutherland-highlanders?battalionName=9th-the-dumbartonshire-battalion 9th (The Dumbartonshire) Battalion]) at [https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk Forces War Records].</ref>

==== Second Battle of Ypres ====
''Main Article: [[Second Battle of Ypres]]''

On 21 May the battalion was transferred to the [[10th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|10th Brigade]] of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]]. On 22 May 1915 the battalion participated in the famed, although not for good reason, [[Second Battle of Ypres]], this would be the first engagement where poison gas was used in warfare. When the battalion arrived in the [[Ypres]] area, German forces attacked the north flank of the solient using poison gas and forced the defending French forces to retire 3-4km. During this retreat, British forces advancing behind them were required to shoot those who failed to turn around, leading to many allied deaths. As a result of the rapid German advance, many men of the battalion were killed, which caused the battalion to be reduced to just company strength of 2 officers and 85 men, these men would later be transferred to the 8th Btn.<ref name=\":32\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />

==== Disbandment ====
Because of the massive losses inflicted during the recent battle, the battalion was instructed to amalgamate with the 6th Btn who also suffered heavy losses, this new unit was designated as '''The Composite Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders'''. The amalgamation was intended as a temporary measure and would exist until such times as reinforcements could come from 2/9th Battalion. Six months after the terrible losses of May 1915, the Battalion had been brought up to a strength of 25 Officers and 461 other ranks.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />

But the Battalion could not be brought up to its required strength. Because of the great demands of industry in the county, the problem of obtaining new recruits in Dumbartonshire was apparent to all. Eventually the Battalion had to be disbanded. Everything was done to preserve the local identity of the Dumbartonshire Territorials but sentimental feelings could not be allowed to stand in the way of the efficiency of the Army as a whole.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />

The Battalion no longer existed but the Officers and Men of the 1/9th continued to serve in other battalions and other regiments. In its short time in [[France]] it was mentioned in dispatches 3 times and personally complimented by [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Field Marshall Sir John French]]. By July 1917 the 2/9th and the 3/9th ceased to exist as well.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />

=== 2/9th (The Dumbartonshire) Btn ===
When the [[Territorial Force]] was mobilised and embodied in August 1914, there was a quick movement to form a 'second line' of which those not volunteering for overseas duties could join. The second line also had the task of taking over the role of home defence while at the same time providing and training reinforcements for the original units (1st line). The second line battalion later had the role of providing coastal defence.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":14\">Westlake, Men-at-Arms, pp. 17-8.</ref>

On 21 September 1914 the 2nd line battalion was formed in [[Dumbarton]] (Temporarily re-designated for period from 11 August 1915-11 January 1916 as No.12 Btn, [[62nd Division (United Kingdom)|62nd Division]]). The battalion was later disbanded on 10 May 1917 at [[Farnham]].<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":9\" />

In Mid-1915 more duplicates were added, which were designated as 'Third line' units, most of these being absorbed into the senior 3rd line battalions as 'Reserve battalions'.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":14\" />

In April 1915 the 3rd line battalion was raised in [[Dumbarton]] and on 8 April 1916 was re-designated as a reserve battalion before being absorbed into the [[5th (Renfrewshire) (Reserve) Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] on 1 September 1916.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":9\" />

By 10 May 1917 all of the former battalions were either disbanded or merged into other units, placing it in an unofficial suspended animation. When the [[Territorial Force]] was disbanded in 1919, [[Dumbartonshire]] was left with no TF affiliation at all due to their battalion (9th) being disbanded during the middle of the last war.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" />

On 1 January 1920 the new [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) was designated as the successor to the former TF, and most of the units of the later were reformed. Just a year before, the [[War Office]] informed the Dumbartonshire Territorial Force Association that a cadre was to be sponsored in [[Dumbarton]]. When the TA was reformed, the cadre was expanded to form the nucleus of the new '''9th (The Dumbartonshire) Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)''' which was reconstituted on 7 February 1920. When the new battalion was formed, it was not grouped as eight companies, but rather the new 'four company establishment' of which all infantry were now based on. A small name change of the battalion occurred in August 1937 when it became the '''9th (Dumbartonshire) Btn''', dropping 'The' from the sub-title.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" /> By 1938 (just before their change in role) the battalion was organised as;<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" /><ref>[http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_org/div_inf_inf.html Infantry Brigade, Infantry Division] at [http://niehorster.org World War II Armed Forces - Orders of Battle and Organizations].</ref>

{{Main|Munich Crisis}}
In 1938, Hitler's [[Third Reich]] was in the process of expanding, first the annex of [[Memel, East Prussia|Memel]], then the annexation and takeover of [[Austria]] during the [[Anschluss]]. The last step of this was the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] which was has a strong German presence through the local Nazi party. On 30 September 1938 the 'four great powers' ([[Kingdom of Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], and [[Third French Republic]]) of Europe signed the '[[Munich Agreement]]' which gave the [[Sudetenland]] (without the consent of the Czechs) to Germany.<ref group=\"Notes\">No ref needed, basic historical knowledge.</ref> Following the [[Munich Crisis]], the anti-aircraft (AA) branch of the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) was rapidly expanded following a report which presented the need for more modern AA defences. The majority, in-fact almost all, AA units were provided by the TA and covered [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref group=\"Notes\">Units in [[Northern Ireland]] were not designated as TA units, but rather designated as SR ([[Supplementary Reserve (United Kingdom)|Supplementary Reserve]]) units while maintaining the same roles, tasks, and uniforms.</ref>

By 1938 the Government was sufficiently sensitive to the air dangers to give the R.A.F., and, to some extent, the anti-aircraft defences, the first claim on available resources. This meant rejecting the earlier doctrine of a 'balanced' allocation of resources between the three Services<sup>6</sup> and allowing a clear priority to the air arm. The priority was becoming more pronounced as the crisis over Czechoslovakia approached, and at the time of Munich, all obstacles to air defences were swept away and nothing but industrial capacity limited the rate of rearmament in the air.<ref>Postan, p. 14.</ref>

Due to this expansion, the battalion was transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]], re-organised into three batteries, and renamed as the '''54th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''', this was started on 28 November 1938. When the battalion was converted, unlike their other AA counterparts, the regiment was assigned directly to 'Home Forces', which meant it could be deployed at short notice, much like the later TAVR I formed in 1967.

=== Mobilisation ===
When the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] was mobilised on 3 September 1939, the regiment was brought up to strength and moved to [[Manchester]], later joining the [[44th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|44th Anti-Aircraft Brigade]]. In October as the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) began forming, and the regiment prepared to move to [[France]] and join the [[1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade]]. Before moving to [[France]], the regiment controlled 12 [[40 mm Bofors|40mm Bofors]] which was well below their establishment. Therefore, like other regiments, of which this would prove fatal for these units, the regiment was equipped with a further 24 [[Lewis machine gun|AA Machine-guns]].<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\">Alan Philson, [http://niehorster.org/017_britain/40-05_bef/corps_03_arty.html IIIrd Corps Artillery Assets, British Expeditionary Force] at [http://niehorster.org World War II Armed Forces - Orders of Battle and Organizations].</ref><ref name=\":1\">Routledge, p. 125-6.</ref>

=== Battle of France ===
{{Main|Battle of France}}
When the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) began to come up to strength in November 1939, the regiment was based in [[Arras]], [[France]] where it was placed under command of the [[1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade]] which was headquartered there. Although the regiment was based in [[Arras]], 162 LAA Bty was detached to [[3rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade]] in [[Le Havre]], which was a strategically important supply port for the BEF. To make matters worse, by this time the only AA guns the regiment had were now stuck in [[Le Havre]], while the rest of the regiment only manned 12 machine-guns in each battery.<ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":1\" />

Shortly thereafter, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] had formed up in [[France]], and the regiment was reassigned to Commander Corps RA, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]]. After joining IIIrd corps, the regiment was joined by the 162nd LAA bty again which had been detached for a short time. Following the beginning of the [[Battle of Belgium]], the BEF and many allied forces moved into [[Belgium]], to take defensive positions near the [[Scheldt|Scheldt river]] ('Escaut' in French). As part of this new 'Escaut Front', the II and III Corps were assigned to defend the area, and the regiment became III Corps' 'Escaut LAA regiment'.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, p. 70.</ref><ref name=\":2\">Joslen, p. 462.</ref><ref name=\":3\">[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bef/page5.html 3 Corps] at [http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk Royal Artillery 1939-45], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928015820/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bef/page5.html Archived] on 28 September 2008 at the [https://web.archive.org Wayback Machine].</ref>

By the 25th, the corps was tasked with defending the 'Canal Line' which oversaw the [[Scheldt–Rhine Canal]], which was by this time coming under heavy attack by the Germans. When the Germans made their surprise attack through the [[Ardennes]], the entire BEF along with the [[Belgian Army]] and two French armies were cut off from France, and forced to retreat towards [[Calais]]. This operation had in-fact been planned by the British high command, and was to be a last resort move, this operation was code-named '[[Operation Dynamo]]'. When the operation was announced to commence, the regiment began to turn towards Calais in support of the III Corps which was now tasked to guard the routes for the final withdrawal to [[Dunkirk]].<ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, pp. 139, 168.</ref>

As the regiment started to move towards [[Dunkirk]] they were forced to leave behind much of their heavy equipment including many AA guns and ammunition stores. As the III Corps retreated, the new commanded [[Major General]] S. R. Watson was appointed as command of III Corps and began making quick arrangements for the British withdrawal in the midst of the German onslaught. Finally, on 28 May 1940 the III corps was ordered to evacuate, and was the first to do so.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, p. 175.</ref>

=== Home Defence ===
During the retreat from [[Dunkirk]], the regiment was forced to leave behind some of their heavy equipment including trucks, tractors, and some guns. When the rest of the regiment, or at-least what was left of it, returned, the BEF lost or had to leave almost 500 [[Anti-aircraft gun|Anti-aircraft guns]] behind, not to mention a lot of ammunition and supplies.<ref>Collier, p. 127.</ref>

Between the outbreak of war in September 1939 to late 1942, the [[British Army]] started to create experimental 'armoured formations', which later became known as 'armoured divisions'. One of these new divisions was the [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Division]] which started to form up on 1 December 1940. On 14 April 1940, the HQ Staff of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] published order 20/RAC/44 SD7 which expanded the size and roles of the new armoured divisions. For the [[Royal Artillery]], very little was changed though. On 12 June 1941, the regiment joined the [[9th Support Group (United Kingdom)|9th Support Group]] which, as the name suggests, was the supporting group of the [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Division]]. During this period, the regiment was designated as the 'divisional LAA regiment'. On 11 June 1942 the support group was disbanded, and the regiment was moved under command of CRA, 9th Armoured Division in the same role.<ref>Joslen, p. 4.</ref><ref>Joslen, p. 220.</ref>

By 3 February 1944, the regiment was moved out of the 9th Armoured Division and un brigaded for a short time before joining the Major General Royal Artillery, [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]]. When [[Operation Overlord]] was launched on 6 June 1944, the regiment was placed under the command of the 106th Air Field Defence Brigade, which was tasked with defending the RAF bases which were to be quickly constructed in [[France]] after the initial invasion.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref>Joslen, p. 23.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/44-06-06_Neptune/Land/_army_02_artillery.htm|title=Major General, Royal Artillery, 2nd British Army, 06.06.44|website=niehorster.org|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">Joslen, p. 463.</ref><ref name=\":21\">Ellis, Battle of Normandy, Location 10198.</ref>

On D+4, the regiment with the brigade landed in [[France]] to undertake airfield defence tasks in support of the [[2nd Tactical Air Force|(RAF) 2nd Tactical Air Force]]. Until late 1944, the regiment didn't see any front-line combat. In late 1944, the regiment moved to an area around [[Antwerp]], and with four troops (units, not soldiers) with support of an armoured car regiment, and some mortar teams were able to hold off attacks on a six-mile front on the [[Antwerp]]-[[Turnhout]] Canal.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":21\" />

=== Scheldt South 'X' Deployment ===

==== Background ====
AA Command had plenty of warning that the Germans were developing V-1 flying bombs to use against the UK, and had detailed plans in place ([[Operation Diver]]), these plans also covered the strategically important ports of [[Antwerp]] ([[Netherlands]]) and [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]]). These cities provided rear lines of communication and maintained the supply depôts for the [[21st Army Group]] which was preparing to cross the [[Rhine]] into the [[Rhineland]] and [[Westphalia]]. As a result of these increasing threats from the [[V1 (missile)|V-1]], [[Operation Diver]] was put into effect. As far as the mainland Europe theatre was concerned, the allies were to try and take over all, or most, of the launch sites or air bases from which they were launched. Once [[21st Army Group]] had captured [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]], these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within [[Germany]], and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established.<ref name=\":23\">[[General]] Sir Frederick A.

To deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (code-named 'Divers'), the planners envisaged a large Gun Defence Area (GDA) integrated into a system ('Brussels X' ) of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. On 21 October the first bombs were launched against [[Brussels]].<ref name=\":5\">Routledge, p. 336-8.</ref> The organisation of these posts and lines were organised into three 'lines';<ref name=\":5\" />

* (1st) Wireless Observation Units (WOUs) line; sited 40 to 50 miles in front of the guns to give eight minutes' warning by radio of a missile's<ref group=\"Notes\">At this point the term 'missile' wasn't being used, but will be said for simplicity.</ref> approach. At first, these covered south-east to east but were extended round to north. WOUs were grouped in fives and each groups had a LW radar manned by the [[RAF]].
* (2nd) Local Warning Stations (LWS) line; in an intermediate zone at about half the distance of the WOUs, each containing one Radar No.4 Mark V and two No.4 Mark IIIs, working in mutual support to track individual missile courses which could be passed to gun positions by way of an AAOR. Four such stations formed a troops, and missile tracks given a code number to identify them for engagement.
* (3rd) An inner belt of observation posts, about 20,000 yards in front of the guns, to give visual confirmation that the tracked target was a missile. Up to 12 such posts were groups as a troop.

As the [[21st Army Group]] began moving farther east into [[Germany]], the regiment continued to move east towards the [[Scheldt]]. On 20 September 1944, the regiment was placed under command of the 74th AA Bde which had been tasked with covering Schledt South along with the 76th AA Bde in the north. On this day, the regiment began to replace the 106th AA Bde. The regiment was then deployed in the area and saw constant action against both the [[Luftwaffe]] and V-1s. By mid-December, the regiment was moved under command of the 105th AA Bde, but remained in their position and role.<ref>Joslen, pp. 334–5.</ref><ref>Joslen, Table LVII, p. 366.</ref>

As the V-1 threat diminished, the regiment moved across the [[Rhine]] and into [[Germany]] where it remained on garrison duty until 4 February 1946 when it began the process of being placed into [[Suspended Animation (military)|suspended animation]] (S/A) in the [[British Army of the Rhine]], on 15 March this process was complete.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":18\" />

== Postwar ==
Following the end of hostilities, by 1946 most territorial artillery regiments had been either disbanded or placed in suspended animation. On 1 January 1947 many of these regiments were reconstituted and many new regiments were formed as part of the reformed and re-organised [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), with new numbers according to the renumbering plan for the complete re-designation of all [[Royal Artillery]] units, both regular and territorial. There were at that time several territorial artillery units still on operational deployments in various theatres overseas. Following reformation the TA regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] adopted a 'standard' organisation which consisted of; RHQ, P, Q, and R Batteries all of which were based in [[Dumbarton]].<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":6\">Litchfield, pp. 5-6.</ref>

Following the [[Royal Artillery|Royal Artillery's]] renumbering system, light anti-aircraft regiments were granted numbers between 512 and 558, and granted '''554th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''' as a result. On 1 April 1947, the TA was reformed, and subsequently moved under command of the local [[68th Anti-Aircraft Brigade|68th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (TA)]], headquartered in [[Glasgow]]. Finally on 10 March 1955, [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] was disbanded and the regiment was absorbed into the 402nd (5th/6th Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Regiment, Royal Artillery in [[Greenock]]. The regiment's successors can be traced to the modern [[102 (Clyde) Field Squadron, Royal Engineers]] which is based in [[Clydebank]], [[Scotland]] under the [[71 Engineer Regiment (United Kingdom)|71st Engineer Regiment]].<ref name=\":52\" /><ref>Litchfield, Appendix 5, p. 333.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/520-563-regiments.html|title=British Army units from 1945 on - 520 - 563 Regiments 1947-67|website=british-army-units1945on.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>

== Uniform ==
'''As a Rifle Corps'''

The uniforms of the first twelve corps were all slate grey, and shortly after the formation of the battalion they were dressed uniformly in tunics, trousers, and skaos of that colour with scarlet facings and piping, grey-and-scarlet diced band and scarlet ball-tuft on the shakos, and brown waist and pouch belts. This uniform was worn till 1864, when it was replaced by a rifle-green one with scarlet collars and piping, and black braid on the cuffs, green shakos with black ball-tuft and red-and-black diced band, and black belts. Busbies with black and light green plumes replaced the shakos in 1874 (when also a double red piping was added to the cuffs) and were worn till 17 November 1881, when helmets with bronze ornaments took their place. The 9th Corps in [[Luss]] (later M Company) was in 1864 clothed in green doublets and Colquhoun tartan kilts, and continued to wear this uniform till its disbandment in 1882.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

'''Under the Argylls'''

On 8 March 1887, sanction was given for the battalion to adopt the scarlet doublet with yellow facings and the glengarry with red-and-white diced border of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], to be worn with [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Sutherland]] trews. The belts were changed to white. Officers and staff-serjeants wore blackcocks' tails in the glengarries in review order, and all ranks white spats in review and black leggings in marching order. Sashes were not worn. On 29 March 1904, a drab service dress with red piping on the trousers was authorised, and this was the sole uniform of the mounted and cyclist companies, which worse brown felt hats with it.<ref name=\":42\" />

'''Under the Royal Artillery'''

Upon conversion to artillery, the regiment retained the right to wear the Argyll's bonnet and cap badge. They also wore the regimental flash like the converted 5th and 6th Btns. This custom was carried on after 1947 in the 554th LAA Rgt.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref>Brayley, p. 21.</ref>

The regiment along with all other regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] wore the grenade collar badge and [[Royal Artillery]] cannon cap badge on a dark blue beret. While the members of the regiment wore the Royal Artillery's 'gun' cap badge, but in addition they wore the RA's 'grenade' collar badge as a special badge above the left breast pocket of the tunic. Also wearing the white RA [[Lanyard#Uniform accessories|lanyard]] on the right shoulder.<ref name=\":72\">North, pp. 38-9.</ref><ref>Sainsbury, Plate 9, p. 7.</ref>

'''Rifle Volunteers Era Cap-badge'''

The cap badge of the Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteer Corp(s) featured an elephant with a castle on its back. This device was taken from the civic arms of the county, the elephant being chosen, it is said, because its shape resembled that of the massive [[Dumbarton Rock|Dumbarton Rock (Dumbarton Castle)]], which towers over the [[Firth of Clyde]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

The '''1st Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteers''' later the '''9th (Dumbartonshire) Btn, Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders''' was an infantry later artillery unit of Britain's part-time force, the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]]. The battalion was formed in 1860 as a battalion and later consolidated as a corps in 1880 before being transferred to the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]. In 1938 the battalion was transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]], served in [[World War II]], and was later absorbed into the 402nd (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Regiment, Royal Artillery. Although the regiment and battalion lineage was ended in 1955, the location of the original unit and highland links were continued through [[102 (Clyde) Field Squadron, Royal Engineers]].

In 1793, much before the first rifle volunteer corps of [[Dumbartonshire]] were formed, the county managed many local units which included; [[Highland Fencible Corps#Dumbarton Fencibles (1794)|Dumbartonshire Fencibles]], [[Dumbartonshire Fencible Cavalry]] (later the Dumbartonshire Yeomanry Cavalry), [[Stirling, Dumbarton, Clackmannan and Kinross Militia]], as well as many local militias.<ref name=\":02\">Vale of Leven, Preface</ref><ref name=\":32\">Vale of Leven, Sons of the Rock</ref><ref name=\":12\">T.F.

In 1859 the threat of another war with [[France]] led to the creation of local volunteer forces under the direction of the [[War Office]]. 7th May 1860 saw the formation of the Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteers (the “DRV”), who had their first head-quarters at [[Balloch, West Dunbartonshire|Balloch]].

The [[Cardwell Reforms]] were a series of reforms of the British Army undertaken by [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Edward Cardwell]] between 1868 and 1874 with the support of Liberal prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. Gladstone paid little attention to military affairs but he was keen on efficiency. In 1870, he pushed through Parliament major changes in Army organisation. [[Germany|Germany's]] stunning triumph over [[France Télévisions|France]] in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] proved that the Prussian system of professional soldiers with up-to-date weapons was far superior to the traditional system of gentlemen-soldiers that Britain used. Under Cardwell's localisation scheme, the country was divided into 66 Brigade Districts (later renamed Regimental Districts), based on county boundaries and population density. But, there were limitations to the extent that localisation could be implemented.

One of these 'brigade districts' was No.58 which maintained a brigade depot in [[Stirling]] which covered the counties of; [[Kinross-shire]], [[Clackmannanshire]], [[Stirlingshire]], '''[[Dumbartonshire]]''', [[Argyllshire]], [[Buteshire]], and [[Renfrewshire]]. No.58 brigade district was linked with two well known Scottish regiments; [[72nd (Duke of Albany's Own Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]] and the [[91st (Argyllshire Highlanders) Regiment of Foot]]. Within this brigade, the militia and volunteers of these counties were grouped as to provide a simple 'organisational system' of control.<ref name=\":62\" /><ref>T.F. Mills, ''[http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/depot/1873.htm Training Depots (Territorialisation of British Infantry) 1873-1881]'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20071218194948/http://www.regiments.org/regiments/uk/depot/1873.htm Archived] on 18 December 2007 at the [https://web.archive.org Wayback Machine]. Retrieved 19 February 2020.</ref>

on 28 April 1880, the mass consolidations of the Rifle Volunteers occurred, as a result of these changes, all of the former corps were moved under command of the '''1st Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps''' based in [[Helensburgh]] which was expanded to battalion size, and subsequently organised as;<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":32\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

* Corps Headquarters in [[Helensburgh]] (from former 1st Corps HQ)

* C Company in [[Dumbarton]] (former 6th)
* D Company in [[Bonhill]] (former 3rd)

* L Company in [[Cumbernauld]] (former 11th)
* M Company in [[Luss]] (former 9th, dressed in kilts and discriminated against due to this, therefore placed at 'end of the line') — ''disbanded 1882 due to reluctance to change dress and discrimination (see Uniform notes)''

==== Royal Review ====
Many times throughout the 9th Corps (later M co.) history, discrimination occurred. For some time, the new commanding officer of the corps in 1881 ([[Lieutenant Colonel]] Commandant, H. Currier) was not satisfied with the conduct of the 'Luss Volunteers'. When the 1st Dumbartonshire RVC was called upon for the royal review in 1881, the company was not invited and told to 'remain at home' due to their dress because the commandant thought they 'spoilt the corp's reputation and style'. In typical Scottish style, the corps instead embarked for [[Edinburgh]] to arrive and march with another corps right next to the Dumbartonshire RVC in direct defiance of the commandant. This is one of the reasons why this company was later disbanded and reformed in [[Renton, West Dunbartonshire|Renton]] on 12 February 1882. ''(see uniform notes)''<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

==== Regimentation ====
On 7 January 1881 following the [[Cardwell Reforms]], the corps was attached to [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Princess Louises's Regiment (The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)]], due to location of recruitment, of which [[Dunbartonshire]] fell within. The battalion (as it was now referred to as) was entitled to wear the uniform and badges of the regiment, although it insisted in retaining the elephant and castle emblem in the Argyll badge. After moving under control of the Argylls, the battalion was in-fact ''not'' re-titled as the 6th (Dumbartonshire) Volunteer Btn, but instead referred to as the ''[6th Volunteer Btn]'' 1st Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps. In 1884, 'L' company based in [[Cumbernauld]] was reduced to a detachment in 'K' Company, and a new 'L' company was raised on 1 April 1884 in [[Yoker]]. In 1900 just before the battalion sent volunteers to [[South Africa]], the battalion formed two specialist companies 'O' (Mounted) in [[Maryhill]] and 'Q' (Cyclists) in [[Dumbarton]]. In 1891, the corps had a small name to change to become the '''1st Dumbartonshire Volunteer Rifle Corps'''. The years 1881-1908 saw a marked improvement in the organisation, training and equipment of the local volunteers as the government attempted to increase the fighting value of these forces. Funding in the form of grants to the units was considerably improved as well as the financial position of the volunteers.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

During the [[South African War]] the battalion contributed 98 of its members to the various new formations. Of these, [[Lieutenant]] R. L. Stevenson and 24 non-commissioned officers and men served in the 1st Service Company, 24 men in the 2nd Service Co, and 19 men in 3rd Volunteer Service Company, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]]. Of the 1st company, [[Private (rank)|privates]] J. C. Morrison, W. R. Kelly, and D. W. Moore died of disease in [[South Africa]], and [[Lance Corporal]] W. L. L. Fitzwilliam and Private R. M. Duncan after being invalided home, and of the 2nd company, [[Lance Corporal]] T. Stevenson died of disease in [[South Africa]]. One man joined the [[Scottish Cyclist Company]], and 29 men the [[Imperial Yeomanry]], of whom private Nielson died of disease [[Captain]] R. L. Stevenson also served a second period with the [[Imperial Yeomanry]]. 107 men of the battalion, in addition, joined the regular army and militia during the war, and 28 non-commissioned officers and men (including [[Staff Serjeant]] Cumming, who was [[Mentioned in Despatches]]) of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Brigade Bearer Company, attached to the battalion, served with the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in [[South Africa]]. As a reward for their service, the battalion was granted the battle honour, '''''\"South Africa 1900-2\"'''''.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":52\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" /><ref>T.F.

==== End of the Force ====
By 1905 the battalion strength was 50 officers and 1,271 other ranks in the 14 companies which made up the battalion. In 1906 the battalion was placed in the 31st Field Army Brigade, 16th Division, and attended camp for 15 days. The battalion had a central rife-range at [[Auchin-carroch]], in the [[Vale of Leven]], up to 900 yards, and A, I, and K Companies had also ranged near their headquarters, that of the latter being held in conjunction with E Company, 4th Volunteer Battalion. In 1908, the battalion was reduced and transferred to the [[Territorial Force]] (see below).<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

=== Background ===
Under the army reforms introduced by [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Richard Haldane]] in 1907, the existing auxiliary forces (the [[Imperial Yeomanry]] and [[Volunteer Force|Volunteer Forces]]) were to be combined (with effect from 1 April 1908) as a new organisation to be known as the [[Territorial Force]] (TF). In his 'Territorial and Reserve Forces Bill', Mr Haldane set up an establishment of fourteen divisions (infantry), fourteen mounted brigades (yeomanry), army troops, and troops for coastal defence. These to be raised and administered locally by a number of Territorial Force Associations. Under these reforms, the structure of infantry units were also altered, with each containing a peace establishment of 1,009 of all ranks in 8 companies 'A' to 'H', all under command of a [[Lieutenant Colonel]].<ref>Westlake, The Territorials, Introduction and p. 2.</ref><ref>Westlake, Men-at-Arms, p. 3.</ref>

When the [[Territorial Force]] was formed, the corps was transferred and redesignated as the '''9th Battalion, Princess Louise's Regiment (The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)''' but in March 1909 it was renamed to represent the county designation to become the '''9th (The Dumbartonshire) Btn'''. Following their movement to the new TF the battalion was reduced in size by relegating 17 officers to the supernumerary list and struck 640 other ranks off the strength and went into the new Territorial Force with 29 officers and 840 men in 8 companies.

After transferring to the TF, great efforts were made to stimulate recruitment helped by eminent people such as [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|John George Edward Henry Douglas Sutherland Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll]] speaking at public meetings in support of the new battalion throughout the county. New colours, paid for by Lady Inverclyde wife of the Lord Lieutenant, were presented by [[Louise, Princess Royal|HRH Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife]], Colonel-in-Chief of the Regiment, in the grounds of Ardencaple House. Two years later these colours were brought back to [[Dumbarton]] and placed in the County Council buildings.<ref name=\":02\" />

In July 1914 as the international situation worsened, the [[British Armed Forces]] were on high alert as the [[Imperial German Army]] moving towards the neutral nation of the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], of which the UK protected. When German forces crossed into [[Belgium]], the [[United Kingdom]] declared war on [[Germany]] and later the rest of the [[Central Powers]]. During this period, the battalion along with the 6th (Renfrewshire), 7th, and 8th (The Argyllshire) Btns was part of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Brigade]] in the [[Highland Division]].<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\">Chris Baker, ''[http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/regiments-and-corps/the-british-infantry-regiments-of-1914-1918/princess-louises-argyll-sutherland-highlanders/ Princess Louise's (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders)]'' at [http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk Long, Long Trail].

=== 1/9th (The Dumbartonshire) Btn ===
The declaration of war in 1914 found the local TF at camp in [[Kintyre]], and the battalion was embodied on 4 August 1914. The Battalion assembled at [[Dumbarton]] and many were billeted in local schools. On the morning of Tuesday 11th August the Battalion mustered on the Common before leaving for [[Bedford]] by train. The men took with them a number of carts and repainted them in military colours, as well as some horses which they had commandeered in the district. The CO, Colonel Leith-Buchanan was not passed fit for service overseas and was replaced by Lt Colonel James Clark. On 22 October the [[Highland Division]] was given a visit by the [[George V|King]] and inspected there before departing to [[France]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\">Westlake, Men-at-Arms, p. 23-4.</ref><ref>Chris Baker, [http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/army/order-of-battle-of-divisions/51st-highland-division/ 51st (Highland) Division] at [http://www.longlongtrail.co.uk The Long, Long Trail].

In early 1915 the Highland Division was broken up mostly with many battalions moving independently to [[France]] in the coming months. On 19/20 February the battalion landed in [[Le Havre]] (north [[France]]) and on 23 February 1915 the battalion came under orders of the newly formed [[81st Brigade (United Kingdom)|81st Brigade]] within the also newly formed [[27th Division (United Kingdom)|27th Division]]. By 14 March 1915 the battalion was in [[St Eloi]] and on the front line, just east of the town.

==== Second Battle of Ypres ====
''Main Article: [[Second Battle of Ypres]]''

On 21 May the battalion was transferred to the [[10th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|10th Brigade]] of the [[4th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|4th Division]]. On 22 May 1915 the battalion participated in the famed, although not for good reason, [[Second Battle of Ypres]], this would be the first engagement where poison gas was used in warfare. When the battalion arrived in the [[Ypres]] area, German forces attacked the north flank of the solient using poison gas and forced the defending French forces to retire 3-4km. During this retreat, British forces advancing behind them were required to shoot those who failed to turn around, leading to many allied deaths. As a result of the rapid German advance, many men of the battalion were killed, which caused the battalion to be reduced to just company strength of 2 officers and 85 men, these men would later be transferred to the 8th Btn.<ref name=\":32\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />

==== Disbandment ====
Because of the massive losses inflicted during the recent battle, the battalion was instructed to amalgamate with the 6th Btn who also suffered heavy losses, this new unit was designated as '''The Composite Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders'''. The amalgamation was intended as a temporary measure and would exist until such times as reinforcements could come from 2/9th Battalion. Six months after the terrible losses of May 1915, the Battalion had been brought up to a strength of 25 Officers and 461 other ranks.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />

But the Battalion could not be brought up to its required strength. Because of the great demands of industry in the county, the problem of obtaining new recruits in Dumbartonshire was apparent to all. Eventually the Battalion had to be disbanded. Everything was done to preserve the local identity of the Dumbartonshire Territorials but sentimental feelings could not be allowed to stand in the way of the efficiency of the Army as a whole.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />

The Battalion no longer existed but the Officers and Men of the 1/9th continued to serve in other battalions and other regiments. In its short time in [[France]] it was mentioned in dispatches 3 times and personally complimented by [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Field Marshall Sir John French]]. By July 1917 the 2/9th and the 3/9th ceased to exist as well.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":13\" />

=== 2/9th (The Dumbartonshire) Btn ===
When the [[Territorial Force]] was mobilised and embodied in August 1914, there was a quick movement to form a 'second line' of which those not volunteering for overseas duties could join. The second line also had the task of taking over the role of home defence while at the same time providing and training reinforcements for the original units (1st line). The second line battalion later had the role of providing coastal defence.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":14\">Westlake, Men-at-Arms, pp. 17-8.</ref>

On 21 September 1914 the 2nd line battalion was formed in [[Dumbarton]] (Temporarily re-designated for period from 11 August 1915-11 January 1916 as No.12 Btn, [[62nd Division (United Kingdom)|62nd Division]]). The battalion was later disbanded on 10 May 1917 at [[Farnham]].<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":9\" />

=== 9th (The Dumbartonshire) (Reserve) Btn ===
In Mid-1915 more duplicates were added, which were designated as 'Third line' units, most of these being absorbed into the senior 3rd line battalions as 'Reserve battalions'.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":14\" />

In April 1915 the 3rd line battalion was raised in [[Dumbarton]] and on 8 April 1916 was re-designated as a reserve battalion before being absorbed into the [[5th (Renfrewshire) (Reserve) Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]] on 1 September 1916.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":9\" />

By 10 May 1917 all of the former battalions were either disbanded or merged into other units, placing it in an unofficial suspended animation. When the [[Territorial Force]] was disbanded in 1919, [[Dumbartonshire]] was left with no TF affiliation at all due to their battalion (9th) being disbanded during the middle of the last war.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":52\" />

On 1 January 1920 the new [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA) was designated as the successor to the former TF, and most of the units of the later were reformed. Just a year before, the [[War Office]] informed the Dumbartonshire Territorial Force Association that a cadre was to be sponsored in [[Dumbarton]]. When the TA was reformed, the cadre was expanded to form the nucleus of the new '''9th (The Dumbartonshire) Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)''' which was reconstituted on 7 February 1920. When the new battalion was formed, it was not grouped as eight companies, but rather the new 'four company establishment' of which all infantry were now based on.

In 1938, Hitler's [[Third Reich]] was in the process of expanding, first the annex of [[Memel, East Prussia|Memel]], then the annexation and takeover of [[Austria]] during the [[Anschluss]]. The last step of this was the annexation of the [[Sudetenland]] which was has a strong German presence through the local Nazi party. On 30 September 1938 the 'four great powers' ([[Kingdom of Italy]], [[Nazi Germany]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], and [[Third French Republic]]) of Europe signed the '[[Munich Agreement]]' which gave the [[Sudetenland]] (without the consent of the Czechs) to Germany.<ref group=\"Notes\">No ref needed, basic historical knowledge.</ref> Following the [[Munich Crisis]], the anti-aircraft (AA) branch of the [[Royal Artillery]] (RA) was rapidly expanded following a report which presented the need for more modern AA defences. The majority, in-fact almost all, AA units were provided by the TA and covered [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref group=\"Notes\">Units in [[Northern Ireland]] were not designated as TA units, but rather designated as SR ([[Supplementary Reserve (United Kingdom)|Supplementary Reserve]]) units while maintaining the same roles, tasks, and uniforms.</ref>

By 1938 the Government was sufficiently sensitive to the air dangers to give the R.A.F., and, to some extent, the anti-aircraft defences, the first claim on available resources. This meant rejecting the earlier doctrine of a 'balanced' allocation of resources between the three Services<sup>6</sup> and allowing a clear priority to the air arm. The priority was becoming more pronounced as the crisis over Czechoslovakia approached, and at the time of Munich, all obstacles to air defences were swept away and nothing but industrial capacity limited the rate of rearmament in the air.<ref>Postan, p. 14.</ref>

Due to this expansion, the battalion was transferred to the [[Royal Artillery]], re-organised into three batteries, and re-named as the '''54th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''', this was started on 28 November 1938. When the battalion was converted, unlike their other AA counterparts, the regiment was assigned directly to 'Home Forces', which meant it could be deployed at short notice, much like the later TAVR I formed in 1967. As a result of this organisational change, the regiment's new command was [[Highland Area, Scottish Command]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref>Routledge, Table XIII, p.69.</ref><ref>Routledge, Appendix VIII, p. 339.</ref><ref name=\":15\">Litchfield, p. 281.</ref><ref name=\":16\">[http://niehorster.org/017_britain/39_commands/scottish_highland.html Highland Area, Scottish Command] at [http://niehorster.org World War II Armed Forces - Orders of Battle and Organizations].</ref><ref name=\":17\">Rob Palmer, [https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/124/2019/05/Highland-Area-1939-1.pdf Highland Area Order of Battle (1939)] at [https://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk British Military History].</ref><ref name=\":18\">Frederick, Volume II, pp. 800-19, 828-9.</ref><ref name=\":19\">[http://www.patriotfiles.com/index.php?name=Sections&req=viewarticle&artid=6693&page=1 British Scottish Command on 3 September 1939] at the [http://www.patriotfiles.com Patriot Files].</ref><ref name=\":20\">[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/laa/page48.html 54 (Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders) LAA Rgt RA (TA)] at [http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk Royal Artillery 1939-45], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080110025854/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/laa/page48.html Archived] on 10 January 2008 at the [https://web.archive.org Wayback Machine].

=== Mobilisation ===
When the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] was mobilised on 3 September 1939, the regiment was brought up to strength and moved to [[Manchester]], later joining the [[44th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|44th Anti-Aircraft Brigade]]. In October as the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) began forming, and the regiment prepared to move to [[France]] and join the [[1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade]]. Before moving to [[France]], the regiment controlled 12 [[40 mm Bofors|40mm Bofors]] which was well below their establishment. Therefore like other regiments, of which this would prove fatal for these units, the regiment was equipped with a further 24 [[Lewis machine gun|AA Machine-guns]].<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\">Alan Philson, [http://niehorster.org/017_britain/40-05_bef/corps_03_arty.html IIIrd Corps Artillery Assets, British Expeditionary Force] at [http://niehorster.org World War II Armed Forces - Orders of Battle and Organizations].</ref><ref name=\":1\">Routledge, p. 125-6.</ref>

=== Battle of France ===
{{Main|Battle of France}}
When the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) began to come up to strength in November 1939, the regiment was based in [[Arras]], [[France]] where it was placed under command of the [[1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Anti-Aircraft Brigade]] which was headquartered there. Although the regiment was based in [[Arras]], 162 LAA Bty was detached to [[3rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|3rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade]] in [[Le Havre]], which was a strategically important supply port for the BEF. To make matters worse, by this time the only AA guns the regiment had were now stuck in [[Le Havre]], while the rest of the regiment only manned 12 machine-guns in each battery.<ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":1\" />

Shortly thereafter, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]] had formed up in [[France]], and the regiment was re-assigned to Commander Corps RA, [[III Corps (United Kingdom)|III Corps]]. After joining IIIrd corps, the regiment was joined by the 162nd LAA bty again which had been detached for a short time. Following the beginning of the [[Battle of Belgium]], the BEF and many allied forces moved into [[Belgium]], to take defensive positions near the [[Scheldt|Scheldt river]] ('Escaut' in french). As part of this new 'Escaut Front', the II and III Corps were assigned to defend the area, and the regiment became III Corps' 'Escaut LAA regiment'.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, p. 70.</ref><ref name=\":2\">Joslen, p. 462.</ref><ref name=\":3\">[http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bef/page5.html 3 Corps] at [http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk Royal Artillery 1939-45], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110928015820/http://www.ra39-45.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/bef/page5.html Archived] on 28 September 2008 at the [https://web.archive.org Wayback Machine].</ref>

By the 25th, the corps was tasked with defending the 'Canal Line' which oversaw the [[Scheldt–Rhine Canal]], which was by this time coming under heavy attack by the Germans. When the Germans made their surprise attack through the [[Ardennes]], the entire BEF along with the [[Belgian Army]] and two french armies were cut off from France, and forced to retreat towards [[Calais]]. This operation had in-fact been planned by the British high command, and was to be a last resort move, this operation was code-named '[[Operation Dynamo]]'. When the operation was announced to commence, the regiment began to turn towards Calais in support of the III Corps which was now tasked to guard the routes for the final withdrawal to [[Dunkirk]].<ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, pp. 139, 168.</ref>

As the regiment started to move towards [[Dunkirk]] they were forced to leave behind much of their heavy equipment including many AA guns and ammunition stores. As the III Corps retreated, the new commanded [[Major General]] S. R. Watson was appointed as command of III Corps and began making quick arrangements for the British withdrawal in the midst of the German onslaught. Finally, on 28 May 1940 the III corps was ordered to evacuate, and was the first to do so.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":17\" /><ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref>Ellis, The War in Flanders, p. 175.</ref>

=== Home Defence ===
During the retreat from [[Dunkirk]], the regiment was forced to leave behind some of their heavy equipment including trucks, tractors, and some guns. When the rest of the regiment, or at-least what was left of it, returned, the BEF lost or had to leave almost 500 [[Anti-aircraft gun|Anti-aircraft guns]] behind, not to mention a lot of ammunition and supplies.<ref>Collier, p. 127.</ref>

Between the outbreak of war in September 1939 to late 1942, the [[British Army]] started to create experimental 'armoured formations', which later became known as 'armoured divisions'. One of these new divisions was the [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Division]] which started to form up on 1 December 1940. On 14 April 1940, the HQ Staff of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]] published order 20/RAC/44 SD7 which expanded the size and roles of the new armoured divisions. For the [[Royal Artillery]], very little was changed though. On 12 June 1941, the regiment joined the [[9th Support Group (United Kingdom)|9th Support Group]] which, as the name suggests, was the supporting group of the [[9th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|9th Armoured Division]]. During this period, the regiment was designated as the 'divisional LAA regiment'. On 11 June 1942 the support group was disbanded, and the regiment was moved under command of CRA, 9th Armoured Division in the same role.<ref>Joslen, p. 4.</ref><ref>Joslen, p. 220.</ref>

=== Battle of Normandy ===

By 3 February 1944, the regiment was moved out of the 9th Armoured Division and un brigaded for a short time before joining the Major General Royal Artillery, [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]]. When [[Operation Overlord]] was launched on 6 June 1944, the regiment was placed under the command of the 106th Air Field Defence Brigade, which was tasked with defending the RAF bases which were to be quickly constructed in [[France]] after the initial invasion.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref>Joslen, p. 23.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/44-06-06_Neptune/Land/_army_02_artillery.htm|title=Major General, Royal Artillery, 2nd British Army, 06.06.44|website=niehorster.org|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">Joslen, p. 463.</ref><ref name=\":21\">Ellis, Battle of Normandy, Location 10198.</ref>

On D+4, the regiment with the brigade landed in [[France]] to undertake airfield defence tasks in support of the [[2nd Tactical Air Force|(RAF) 2nd Tactical Air Force]]. Until late 1944, the regiment didn't see any front-line combat. In late 1944, the regiment moved to an area around [[Antwerp]], and with four troops (units, not soldiers) with support of an armoured car regiment, and some mortar teams were able to hold off attacks on a six-mile front on the [[Antwerp]]-[[Turnhout]] Canal.<ref name=\":20\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":21\" />

=== Scheldt South 'X' Deployment ===

==== Background ====
AA Command had plenty of warning that the Germans were developing V-1 flying bombs to use against the UK, and had detailed plans in place ([[Operation Diver]]), these plans also covered the strategically important ports of [[Antwerp]] ([[Netherlands]]) and [[Brussels]] ([[Belgium]]). These cities provided rear lines of communication and maintained the supply depôts for the [[21st Army Group]] which was preparing to cross the [[Rhine]] into the [[Rhineland]] and [[Westphalia]]. As a result of these increasing threats from the [[V1 (missile)|V-1]], [[Operation Diver]] was put into effect. As far as the mainland Europe theatre was concerned, the allies were to try and take over all, or most, of the launch sites or air bases from which they were launched. Once [[21st Army Group]] had captured [[Brussels]] and [[Antwerp]], these cities became targets for V-1s launched from within [[Germany]], and anti-Diver or 'X' defences had to be established.<ref name=\":23\">[[General]] Sir Frederick A. Pile, [https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/LondonGazette/38149.pdf Supplement to the London Gazette of Tuesday, the 16th of December, 1947].</ref><ref>Routledge, pp. 408-10.</ref><ref>Collier, ''Chapter XXIII The Flying Bomb:Part One (1939-1944)'', pp. 353-65.</ref>

To deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (code-named 'Divers'), the planners envisaged a large Gun Defence Area (GDA) integrated into a system ('Brussels X' ) of warning stations and observation posts, supported by radar and searchlights. On 21 October the first bombs were launched against [[Brussels]].<ref name=\":5\">Routledge, p. 336-8.</ref> The organisation of these posts and lines were organised into three 'lines';<ref name=\":5\" />

* (1st) Wireless Observation Units (WOUs) line; sited 40 to 50 miles in front of the guns to give eight minutes' warning by radio of a missile's<ref group=\"Notes\">At this point the term 'missile' wasn't being used, but will be said for simplicity.</ref> approach. At first, these covered south-east to east but were extended round to north. WOUs were grouped in fives and each groups had a LW radar manned by the [[RAF]].
* (2nd) Local Warning Stations (LWS) line; in an intermediate zone at about half the distance of the WOUs, each containing one Radar No.4 Mark V and two No.4 Mark IIIs, working in mutual support to track individual missile courses which could be passed to gun positions by way of an AAOR. Four such stations formed a troops, and missile tracks given a code number to identify them for engagement.
* (3rd) An inner belt of observation posts, about 20,000 yards in front of the guns, to give visual confirmation that the tracked target was a missile. Up to 12 such posts were groups as a troop.

==== Organisation ====
By the time the 'X' deployment was put in place, the regiment was organised as:<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":18\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/44_org/GHQ_aa/aa_bn-lt.html|title=Headquarters of a Light Antiaircraft Regiment, RA, 1944|website=niehorster.org|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://niehorster.org/017_britain/44_org/GHQ_aa/aa_bty-lt-40.html|title=Light Antiaircraft Battery (Mobile), RA, 1944|website=niehorster.org|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>

As the [[21st Army Group]] began moving farther east into [[Germany]], the regiment continued to move east towards the [[Scheldt]]. On 20 September 1944, the regiment was placed under command of the 74th AA Bde which had been tasked with covering Schledt South along with the 76th AA Bde in the north. On this day, the regiment began to replace the 106th AA Bde. The regiment was then deployed in the area and saw constant action against both the [[Luftwaffe]] and V-1s. By mid-December, the regiment was moved under command of the 105th AA Bde, but remained in their position and role.<ref>Joslen, pp. 334–5.</ref><ref>Joslen, Table LVII, p. 366.</ref>

As the V-1 threat diminished, the regiment moved across the [[Rhine]] and into [[Germany]] where it remained on garrison duty until 4 February 1946 when it began the process of being placed into [[Suspended Animation (military)|suspended animation]] (S/A) in the [[British Army of the Rhine]], on 15 March this process was complete.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":18\" />

== Postwar ==
Following the end of hostilities, by 1946 most territorial artillery regiments had been either disbanded or placed in suspended animation. On 1 January 1947 many of these regiments were reconstituted and many new regiments were formed as part of the reformed and re-organised [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] (TA), with new numbers according to the renumbering plan for the complete re-designation of all [[Royal Artillery]] units, both regular and territorial. There were at that time several territorial artillery units still on operational deployments in various theatres overseas. Following reformation the TA regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] adopted a 'standard' organisation which consisted of; RHQ, P, Q, and R Batteries all of which were based in [[Dumbarton]].<ref name=\":15\" /><ref name=\":18\" /><ref name=\":6\">Litchfield, pp. 5-6.</ref>

Following the [[Royal Artillery|Royal Artillery's]] renumbering system, light anti-aircraft regiments were granted numbers between 512 and 558, and granted '''554th (Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery''' as a result. On 1 April 1947, the TA was reformed, and subsequently moved under command of the local [[68th Anti-Aircraft Brigade|68th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (TA)]], headquartered in [[Glasgow]]. Finally on 10 March 1955, [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] was disbanded and the regiment was absorbed into the 402nd (5th/6th Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Light Regiment, Royal Artillery in [[Greenock]]. The regiment's successors can be traced to the modern [[102 (Clyde) Field Squadron, Royal Engineers]] which is based in [[Clydebank]], [[Scotland]] under the [[71 Engineer Regiment (United Kingdom)|71st Engineer Regiment]].<ref name=\":52\" /><ref>Litchfield, Appendix 5, p. 333.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://british-army-units1945on.co.uk/territorial-army-royal-artillery/520-563-regiments.html|title=British Army units from 1945 on - 520 - 563 Regiments 1947-67|website=british-army-units1945on.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>

== Uniform ==
'''As a Rifle Corps'''

The uniforms of the first twelve corps were all slate grey, and shortly after the formation of the battalion they were dressed uniformly in tunics, trousers, and skaos of that colour with scarlet facings and piping, grey-and-scarlet diced band and scarlet ball-tuft on the shakos, and brown waist and pouch belts. This uniform was worn till 1864, when it was replaced by a rifle-green one with scarlet collars and piping, and black braid on the cuffs, green shakos with black ball-tuft and red-and-black diced band, and black belts. Busbies with black and light green plumes replaced the shakos in 1874 (when also a double red piping was added to the cuffs) and were worn till 17 November 1881, when helmets with bronze ornaments took their place. The 9th Corps in [[Luss]] (later M Company) was in 1864 clothed in green doublets and Colquhoun tartan kilts, and continued to wear this uniform till its disbandment in 1882.<ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

'''Under the Argylls'''

On 8 March 1887, sanction was given for the battalion to adopt the scarlet doublet with yellow facings and the glengarry with red-and-white diced border of the [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders]], to be worn with [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Sutherland]] trews. The belts were changed to white. Officers and staff-serjeants wore blackcocks' tails in the glengarries in review order, and all ranks white spats in review and black leggings in marching order. Sashes were not worn. On 29 March 1904, a drab service dress with red piping on the trousers was authorised, and this was the sole uniform of the mounted and cyclist companies, which worse brown felt hats with it.<ref name=\":42\" />

'''Under the Royal Artillery'''

Upon conversion to artillery, the regiment retained the right to wear the Argyll's bonnet and cap badge. They also wore the regimental flash like the converted 5th and 6th Btns. This custom was carried on after 1947 in the 554th LAA Rgt.<ref name=\":15\" /><ref>Brayley, p. 21.</ref>

The regiment along with all other regiments of the [[Royal Artillery]] wore the grenade collar badge and [[Royal Artillery]] cannon cap badge on a dark blue beret. While the members of the regiment wore the Royal Artillery's 'gun' cap badge, but in addition they wore the RA's 'grenade' collar badge as a special badge above the left breast pocket of the tunic. Also wearing the white RA [[Lanyard#Uniform accessories|lanyard]] on the right shoulder.<ref name=\":72\">North, pp. 38-9.</ref><ref>Sainsbury, Plate 9, p. 7.</ref>

'''Rifle Volunteers Era Cap-badge'''

The cap badge of the Dumbartonshire Rifle Volunteer Corp(s) featured an elephant with a castle on its back. This device was taken from the civic arms of the county, the elephant being chosen, it is said, because its shape resembled that of the massive [[Dumbarton Rock|Dumbarton Rock (Dumbarton Castle)]], which towers over the [[Firth of Clyde]].<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":22\" /><ref name=\":42\" />

{{World city population tables}}

The [[United Nations]] uses three definitions for what constitutes a city, as not all cities in all jurisdictions are classified using the same criteria.<ref name=\"UNICEF\"/> Cities may be defined as the cities proper, the extent of their urban area, or their metropolitan regions.<ref name=\"UNICEF\"/> The largest city by population using the city proper definition, which is the area under the administrative boundaries of a local government, is [[Chongqing]], [[China]]. The largest city by population using the metropolitan area definition, which is a loose term referring to urban area and its primary commuter areas, is [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The largest city by population using the urban area definition, which is a loose term referring to a contiguous area with a certain population density, is also Tokyo, Japan.

==Common city definitions==
=== City proper (administrative) ===
{{Main|City proper}}
{{maplink|frame=yes|type=shape|stroke-width=2|id=Q11725|title=Chongqing|stroke-color=#000000|zoom=6|frame-lat=29.558|frame-long=107.50|frame-width=300|frame-height=240|frame-coordinates={{coord|30|00|30|N|107|34|00|E|region:CN-50|display=it}}|type2=shape|stroke-width2=2|id2=Q40|title2=Austria|text=The municipality of [[Chongqing]], whose administrative area is around the size of [[Austria]], has the largest population for a [[city proper]]. However, more than 70% of its residents actually live in [[rural area]]s.}}
A city can be defined by its administrative boundaries ([[city proper]]). UNICEF<ref name=\"UNICEF\"/> defines city proper as \"the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority.\" A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of [[local government]].<ref name=\"wup2007\">{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unup/index.asp?panel=6 |title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2007 Revision Population Database |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822053414/http://esa.un.org/unup/index.asp?panel=6 |archivedate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/densurbanNotes.htm |title=United Nations Statistics Division – Demographic and Social Statistics |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 July 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623192351/http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/densurbanNotes.htm |archivedate=23 June 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Demographic Yearbook 2005, Volume 57 |year=2008 |publisher=United Nations |isbn=978-92-1-051099-8 |page=241 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OwfGJtkpCbwC&pg=PA241 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502022103/https://books.google.com/books?id=OwfGJtkpCbwC&pg=PA241 |archivedate=2 May 2016  }}</ref> Cities proper and their boundaries and population data may not include suburbs.<ref name=\"wup2003\">{{cite book |title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2003 Revision |year=2004 |publisher=United Nations |isbn=92-1-151396-0 <!-- This is the correct ISBN.

The use of city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives.<ref name=\"wup2003\" /> Because of this definition, the city proper population figure may differ greatly with the urban area population figure, as many cities are amalgamations of smaller municipalities (Australia), and conversely, many Chinese cities govern territories that extend well beyond the traditional \"city proper\" into suburban and rural areas.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alexander|first1=Ruth|title=The world's biggest cities: How do you measure them? |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16761784|date=29 January 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=16 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302023557/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16761784|archivedate=2 March 2015  }}</ref> The Chinese municipality of [[Chongqing]], which claims the largest city proper in the world, comprises a huge administrative area of 82,403 km<sup>2</sup>, around the size of [[Austria]].

=== Metropolitan area ===
{{Main|Metropolitan area}}

A city can be defined by the inhabitants of its [[demography|demographic]] population, as by [[metropolitan area]], [[labour market]] area, or similar in a metropolitan area. UNICEF<ref name=\"UNICEF\"/> defines metropolitan area as follows:

{{quote|A formal local government area comprising the urban area as a whole and its primary commuter areas, typically formed around a city with a large concentration of people (i.e., a population of at least 100,000). In addition to the city proper, a metropolitan area includes both the surrounding territory with urban levels of residential density and some additional lower-density areas that are adjacent to and linked to the city (e.g., through frequent transport, road linkages or commuting facilities).}}

In many countries, metropolitan areas are established either with an official organisation or only for statistical purposes. In the United States, [[metropolitan statistical area]] (MSA) is defined by the [[U.S. Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) for statistical purpose.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/bulletins/fy2009/09-01.pdf |last=Nussle |first=Jim |title=Update of Statistical Area Definitions and Guidance on Their Uses |publisher=Office of Management and Budget |date=Nov 20, 2008 |pages=1–2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104180847/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/bulletins/fy2009/09-01.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-04 }}</ref> In the Philippines, metropolitan areas have an official agency, such as [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA) which manages [[Metro Manila|Manila metropolitan area]].<ref>http://www.mmda.gov.ph/mmda-about-us.html</ref> Similar agencies exist in Indonesia such as Jabodetabekjur Development Cooperation Agency for [[Jakarta metropolitan area]].<ref>https://metro.tempo.co/read/1152868/3-masalah-utama-bksp-jabodetabekjur-yang-dipimpin-anies-baswedan?TerkiniUtama&campaign=TerkiniUtama_Click_10</ref>

=== Urban area ===
{{Main|Urban area}}
{{See also|Number of urban areas by country}}
[[File:Night in the Greater Tokyo Area ISS054.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Greater Tokyo Area|Tokyo]] is considered the world's largest city, with its urbanisation exceeding its [[city limits]].]]
A city can be defined as a conditionally [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] [[urban area]], without regard to territorial or other boundaries inside an urban area. [[UNICEF]]<ref name=\"UNICEF\">{{cite web |url = http://www.unicef.org/sowc2012/statistics.php |title=SOWC-2012-DEFINITIONS|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=29 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208114052/http://www.unicef.org/sowc2012/statistics.php |archivedate=8 December 2013}}</ref> defines urban area as follows:

{{quote|The definition of \"urban\" varies from country to country, and, with periodic reclassification, can also vary within one country over time, making direct comparisons difficult. An urban area can be defined by one or more of the following: administrative criteria or political boundaries (e.g., area within the jurisdiction of a municipality or town committee), a threshold population size (where the minimum for an urban settlement is typically in the region of 2,000 people, although this varies globally between 200 and 50,000), population density, economic function (e.g., where a significant majority of the population is not primarily engaged in agriculture, or where there is surplus employment) or the presence of urban characteristics (e.g., paved streets, electric lighting, sewerage).}}

== Largest cities ==
There are 81 cities with an urban population over 5,000,000 people according to the United Nations 2018 population estimates.

The [[United Nations]] uses three definitions for what constitutes a city, as not all cities in all jurisdictions are classified using the same criteria.<ref name=\"UNICEF\"/> Cities may be defined as the cities proper, the extent of their urban area, or their metropolitan regions.<ref name=\"UNICEF\"/> The largest city by population using the city proper definition, which is the area under the administrative boundaries of a local government, is [[Chongqing]], [[China]]. The largest city by population using the metropolitan area definition, which is a loose term referring to urban area and its primary commuter areas, is [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. The largest city by population using the urban area definition, which is a loose term referring to a contiguous area with a certain population density, is also Tokyo, Japan.

==Common city definitions==
=== City proper (administrative) ===
{{Main|City proper}}
{{maplink|frame=yes|type=shape|stroke-width=2|id=Q11725|title=Chongqing|stroke-color=#000000|zoom=6|frame-lat=29.558|frame-long=107.50|frame-width=300|frame-height=240|frame-coordinates={{coord|30|00|30|N|107|34|00|E|region:CN-50|display=it}}|type2=shape|stroke-width2=2|id2=Q40|title2=Austria|text=The municipality of [[Chongqing]], whose administrative area is around the size of [[Austria]], has the largest population for a [[city proper]]. However, more than 70% of its residents actually live in [[rural area]]s.}}
A city can be defined by its administrative boundaries ([[city proper]]). UNICEF<ref name=\"UNICEF\"/> defines city proper as \"the population living within the administrative boundaries of a city or controlled directly from the city by a single authority.\" A city proper is a locality defined according to legal or political boundaries and an administratively recognised urban status that is usually characterised by some form of [[local government]].<ref name=\"wup2007\">{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unup/index.asp?panel=6 |title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2007 Revision Population Database |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822053414/http://esa.un.org/unup/index.asp?panel=6 |archivedate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/densurbanNotes.htm |title=United Nations Statistics Division – Demographic and Social Statistics |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=26 July 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623192351/http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/demographic/sconcerns/densurb/densurbanNotes.htm |archivedate=23 June 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Demographic Yearbook 2005, Volume 57 |year=2008 |publisher=United Nations |isbn=978-92-1-051099-8 |page=241 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OwfGJtkpCbwC&pg=PA241 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502022103/https://books.google.com/books?id=OwfGJtkpCbwC&pg=PA241 |archivedate=2 May 2016  }}</ref> Cities proper and their boundaries and population data may not include suburbs.<ref name=\"wup2003\">{{cite book |title=World Urbanization Prospects: The 2003 Revision |year=2004 |publisher=United Nations |isbn=92-1-151396-0 <!-- This is the correct ISBN.

The use of city proper as defined by administrative boundaries may not include suburban areas where an important proportion of the population working or studying in the city lives.<ref name=\"wup2003\" /> Because of this definition, the city proper population figure may differ greatly with the urban area population figure, as many cities are amalgamations of smaller municipalities (Australia), and conversely, many Chinese cities govern territories that extend well beyond the traditional \"city proper\" into suburban and rural areas.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alexander|first1=Ruth|title=The world's biggest cities: How do you measure them? |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16761784|date=29 January 2012|work=BBC News|accessdate=16 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302023557/http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-16761784|archivedate=2 March 2015  }}</ref> The Chinese municipality of [[Chongqing]], which claims the largest city proper in the world, comprises a huge administrative area of 82,403 km<sup>2</sup>, around the size of [[Austria]].

=== Metropolitan area ===
{{Main|Metropolitan area}}

A city can be defined by the inhabitants of its [[demography|demographic]] population, as by [[metropolitan area]], [[labour market]] area, or similar in a metropolitan area. UNICEF<ref name=\"UNICEF\"/> defines metropolitan area as follows:

{{quote|A formal local government area comprising the urban area as a whole and its primary commuter areas, typically formed around a city with a large concentration of people (i.e., a population of at least 100,000). In addition to the city proper, a metropolitan area includes both the surrounding territory with urban levels of residential density and some additional lower-density areas that are adjacent to and linked to the city (e.g., through frequent transport, road linkages or commuting facilities).}}

In many countries, metropolitan areas are established either with an official organisation or only for statistical purposes. In the United States, [[metropolitan statistical area]] (MSA) is defined by the [[U.S. Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) for statistical purpose.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/bulletins/fy2009/09-01.pdf |last=Nussle |first=Jim |title=Update of Statistical Area Definitions and Guidance on Their Uses |publisher=Office of Management and Budget |date=Nov 20, 2008 |pages=1–2 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104180847/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/omb/bulletins/fy2009/09-01.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-04 }}</ref> In the Philippines, metropolitan areas have an official agency, such as [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA) which manages [[Metro Manila|Manila metropolitan area]].<ref>http://www.mmda.gov.ph/mmda-about-us.html</ref> Similar agencies exist in Indonesia such as Jabodetabekjur Development Cooperation Agency for [[Jakarta metropolitan area]].<ref>https://metro.tempo.co/read/1152868/3-masalah-utama-bksp-jabodetabekjur-yang-dipimpin-anies-baswedan?TerkiniUtama&campaign=TerkiniUtama_Click_10</ref>

=== Urban area ===
{{Main|Urban area}}
{{See also|Number of urban areas by country}}
[[File:Night in the Greater Tokyo Area ISS054.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Greater Tokyo Area|Tokyo]] is considered the world's largest city, with its urbanisation exceeding its [[city limits]].]]
A city can be defined as a conditionally [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] [[urban area]], without regard to territorial or other boundaries inside an urban area. [[UNICEF]]<ref name=\"UNICEF\">{{cite web |url = http://www.unicef.org/sowc2012/statistics.php |title=SOWC-2012-DEFINITIONS|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=29 January 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208114052/http://www.unicef.org/sowc2012/statistics.php |archivedate=8 December 2013}}</ref> defines urban area as follows:

{{quote|The definition of \"urban\" varies from country to country, and, with periodic reclassification, can also vary within one country over time, making direct comparisons difficult. An urban area can be defined by one or more of the following: administrative criteria or political boundaries (e.g., area within the jurisdiction of a municipality or town committee), a threshold population size (where the minimum for an urban settlement is typically in the region of 2,000 people, although this varies globally between 200 and 50,000), population density, economic function (e.g., where a significant majority of the population is not primarily engaged in agriculture, or where there is surplus employment) or the presence of urban characteristics (e.g., paved streets, electric lighting, sewerage).}}

== Largest cities ==
There are 81 cities with an urban population over 5,000,000 people according to the United Nations 2018 population estimates.

{{Jehovah's Witnesses}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] base their practices on the [[Bible|biblical]] interpretations of [[Charles Taze Russell]] (1852–1916), founder ({{circa}} 1881) of the [[Bible Student movement]], and of successive presidents of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]], [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] (in office 1917–1942) and [[Nathan Homer Knorr]] (in office 1942–1977). Since 1976 practices have also been based on decisions made at closed meetings of the group's [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Franz|2002|p= 106}}.</ref><ref>''Keep Yourselves in God's Love'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 2008, page 43, \"The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses represents the slave class. ... elders today receive instructions and counsel from the Governing Body, either directly or through its representatives, such as traveling overseers.\"</ref> The group disseminates instructions regarding activities and acceptable behavior through ''[[The Watchtower]]'' magazine and through other [[Jehovah's Witnesses publications|official publications]], and at conventions and congregation meetings.

Jehovah's Witnesses endeavor to remain \"separate from the world\",<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Keep Clear of False Worship!|magazine= The Watchtower|date= March 15, 2006|page= 30|quote= [Jehovah's Witnesses] are 'no part of the world.' (John 15:19) The term 'world' here refers to human society alienated from God. (Ephesians 4:17–19; 1 John 5:19) We are separate from the world in that we shun attitudes, speech, and conduct that offend Jehovah. (1 John 2:15–17) Moreover, in harmony with the principle that 'bad associations spoil useful habits,' we avoid intimacy with those who do not live by Christian standards. (1 Corinthians 15:33) To be no part of the world is to remain 'without spot from the world.' (James 1:27) Hence, being separate from the world does not mean that we physically withdraw from all contact with other people.}}</ref> which they regard as a place of moral contamination and under the control of [[Satan]].

Members are expected to participate regularly in [[Evangelism|evangelizing work]] and to attend all congregation meetings, as well as regular large-scale conventions – highly structured events based on material from Watch Tower Society publications.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp= 66–68}}.</ref>

==Worship==
[[File:Jehovah Witnesses Kingdom Hall Svolvaer 2009.JPG|thumb|A Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses in Norway.]] [[File:Reunião em Salão do Reino.jpg|thumb|Worship at a Kingdom Hall in Portugal.]]Meetings for worship and study are held at [[Kingdom Hall]]s, and are open to the public. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in which \"territory\" they reside and are expected to attend weekly meetings as scheduled by the Watch Tower Society and congregation [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]]. The meetings are largely devoted to study of the Bible and Witness doctrines.<ref name=holdenhall>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=64–69}}.</ref> During meetings and in other formal circumstances, Witnesses refer to one another as \"Brother\" and \"Sister\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Botting |first1=Heather |last2=Botting |first2=Gary |authorlink2=Gary Botting |title=The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses |url=https://archive.org/details/orwellianworldof0000bott |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1984 |page=[https://archive.org/details/orwellianworldof0000bott/page/85 85] |isbn=0-8020-6545-7}}</ref> Sociologist Andrew Holden claims meetings create an atmosphere of uniformity for Witnesses, intensify their sense of belonging to a religious community, and reinforce the plausibility of the organization's belief system.<ref name=holdenhall /> He says they are also important in helping new converts adopt a different way of life.<ref name=holdenhall /> According to ''The Watchtower'', one role of the frequency and length of meetings is to protect Witnesses from becoming \"involved in the affairs of the world.\"<ref>\"What Do You Do with Your Time?\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1950, page 38, \"By setting and meeting the goal never to miss any of the meetings that the Lord provides for His people, the Christian is protected against becoming involved in the affairs of this world. He doesn’t have time for it!\"</ref><ref>\"Exert Yourselves Vigorously!\", ''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1972, page 206, \"They do much private Bible study, attend five weekly congregation meetings and spend much time each month in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and making disciples of people, besides providing support for themselves and their families. ... Being busy serves as a protection from many of the temptations and snares of the world, the flesh and the Devil.\"</ref>

The form and content of the meetings is established by the denomination's Brooklyn headquarters, generally involving a consideration of the same subject matter worldwide each week.<ref name=holdenhall /> Two meetings each week are divided into five distinct sections, lasting a total of about four hours. Meetings are opened and closed with [[Kingdom songs|hymns]] and brief prayers delivered from the platform. Witnesses are urged to prepare for all meetings by studying Watch Tower literature from which the content is drawn and looking up the scriptures cited in the articles.<ref>\"Benefit Fully From the Service Meetings\", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', January 1989, page 7.</ref> Kingdom Halls are typically functional in character, and contain no religious symbols.<ref name=holdenhall /> Each year, Witnesses from several congregations, which form a \"circuit\", gather for two one-day assemblies; several circuits meet once a year for a three-day \"regional convention\", and every few years the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses hold \"international conventions\" in selected cities around the world. These larger gatherings are usually held at rented stadiums or auditoriums. Their most important and solemn event is the celebration of the \"Lord's Evening Meal\", or \"Memorial of Christ's Death\".

===Weekend meeting===
The weekend meeting, usually held on Sunday, comprises a 30-minute public talk by a congregation [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders|elder]] or [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Ministerial servants|ministerial servant]] and a one-hour question-and-answer study of a Bible-based article from ''[[The Watchtower]]'' magazine,<ref name=holdenhall /> with questions prepared by the Watch Tower Society and the answers provided in the magazine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Franz|2007|p=420}}.</ref> Members may use their own words to express the ideas in the printed material,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=1 July 1999|page=20|title=Families, Praise God as Part of His Congregation}}</ref> though personal ideas derived from independent study are discouraged.<ref name=holdenhall /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Botting |first1=Heather |last2=Botting |first2=Gary |title=The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses |url=https://archive.org/details/orwellianworldof0000bott |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1984 |page=[https://archive.org/details/orwellianworldof0000bott/page/143 143] |isbn=0-8020-6545-7}}</ref>

===Midweek meeting===
The midweek meeting, typically held in the evening, includes various question-and-answer sessions based on Watch Tower Society publications,<ref name=holdenhall /><ref>''Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2000, page 15.</ref> Bible reading, and sample presentations of how to use Watch Tower Society literature for Bible studies and public preaching.<ref>\"Are You Benefiting Yourself?\", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', August 2000, page 3.</ref>

===Memorial of Christ's death===
{{See also|Memorialism}}
Jehovah's Witnesses commemorate Christ's death as a ransom or \"propitiatory sacrifice\" by observing the Lord's Evening Meal, or Memorial.<ref name=\"Memorial\">{{cite web|title=The Lord's Supper: Why Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Observe the Lord’s Supper Differently From the Way Other Religions Do?|publisher=Watchtower Bible & Tract Society|year=2018|url=https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/lords-supper/}}</ref><ref name=\"WOL\">{{cite web|title=The Eucharist: The Facts Behind the Ritual|publisher=Watchtower Online Library|year=2018|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2008249}}</ref> They celebrate it once per year, noting that it was instituted on the [[Passover]], an annual festival.<ref name=\"Memorial\" /><ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.</ref> They observe it on [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]] according to the ancient Jewish luni-solar calendar.<ref name=\"Memorial\" /><ref>''Insight On The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.</ref> Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that this is the only celebration the Bible commands Christians to observe.<ref>\"Jehovah is a God of Covenants\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1998, page 8, \"Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians—the Memorial of his death.\"</ref>

Of those who attend the Memorial, a small minority worldwide partake of the unleavened bread and wine. This is because Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the majority of the faithful have an earthly hope. Only those who believe they have a heavenly hope, the \"remnant\" (those still living) of the [[144000 (number)#Jehovah's Witnesses|144,000]] \"anointed\", partake of the bread and wine.<ref>''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, p. 207, \"Who should partake of these Memorial emblems? Logically, only those in the new covenant—that is, those who have the hope of going to heaven—should partake of the bread and the wine. God’s holy spirit convinces such ones that they have been selected to be heavenly kings.\"</ref> In 2018, more than 20 million people attended, and more than 19,500 members partook.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/2018-service-year-report/2018-grand-totals/|title=2018 Grand Totals|publisher=Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society}}</ref>

The Memorial, held after sunset, includes a talk on the meaning of the celebration and the circulation among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe the bread symbolizes Jesus Christ's body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine symbolizes his blood which redeems from sin. They do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]].<ref name=\"Memorial\" /><ref name=\"WOL\" /><ref>''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2005, p. 207.</ref><ref>\"Discerning What We Are — At Memorial Time\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref> Because many congregations have no members who claim to be anointed, it is common for no one to partake of the bread and wine.

===Assemblies and conventions===

Each year, Jehovah's Witnesses hold two one day \"Circuit Assemblies\", held in each [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Circuit|circuit]] worldwide. Each circuit comprises several congregations in a geographical area. These are held either in Assembly Halls owned by Jehovah's Witnesses, or in rented facilities, such as public auditoriums. Once a year, Jehovah's Witnesses gather at larger assemblies called \"Regional Conventions\" which are usually three days long (Friday to Sunday). These conventions consist primarily of Bible-based sermons, including demonstrations and experiences of their preaching work. They also often feature video presentations and live, full-costume dramatic plays re-enacting biblical accounts—such as [[Moses]] and the [[Plagues of Egypt]], and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]—or contemporary settings based on biblical principles. Every few years, \"International Conventions\" are held in selected cities, with visiting delegates from other countries. Attendance at some of these international conventions has exceeded one hundred thousand; the 1958 international convention in New York at [[Yankee Stadium]] and the [[Polo Grounds]] had a peak attendance exceeding 253,000.<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Look!

Specialized \"territory\" maps of residential and commercial areas are prepared within the boundaries of each congregation's territory and distributed to publishers who are responsible for preaching within that area. Witnesses are instructed to fill out monthly report slips on their preaching activity,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Do You Contribute to an Accurate Report?|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=December 2002|page=8}}</ref> listing the hours spent, publications placed with householders, and the number of \"return visits\" made to households where interest had been shown formerly.<ref name=holdenminister /> The reports are used to help measure the \"spirituality\" of individuals<ref name=holdenminister /><ref>{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|p=247}}.</ref> and to establish the eligibility of men as congregation elders and ministerial servants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Franz|2007|p=201}}.</ref> A Witness who fails to report for a month is termed an \"irregular publisher\"; one who has not turned in a field service report for six months consecutively is termed an \"inactive publisher\".

Witnesses have, in the past, used a wide variety of methods to spread their faith, including information marches, where members wore [[sandwich board]]s and handed out leaflets, to sound cars (car-mounted [[phonograph]]s), and syndicated newspaper columns and radio segments devoted to sermons. Between 1924 and 1957, the organization operated a radio station, WBBR, from New York. Since 2011, the Witnesses have engaged in \"public witnessing\" in metropolitan districts and fairs using tables, carts, and literature displays. The Watch Tower Society operates a website, [https://www.jw.org/en/ JW.org], which provides access to Watch Tower Society literature and [[streaming media|video streaming]].

==Watch Tower Society literature==

{{See also|Jehovah's Witnesses publications|List of Watch Tower Society publications}}

Jehovah's Witnesses make extensive use of Watch Tower Society literature, including books, magazines, booklets and handbills, to spread their beliefs and to use as textbooks at their religious meetings. The publications are produced in many languages, with a small selection available in 500 languages. Their primary journal, ''The Watchtower'' <!---and ''Awake!'', are--->is published simultaneously in nearly two hundred languages and, along with ''Awake!'', available in audio and electronic formats. Issues of both publications are compiled annually into bound volumes, and are added yearly to the ''Watchtower Library'' CD-ROM, which contains many Witness publications from 1950 onward, and is officially available to baptized members only.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 2007, p. 3</ref> New books, brochures, and other items are released at their annual conventions. Additionally, a number of [[compact audio cassette|audio cassettes]], [[videocassette]]s, and [[DVD]]s have been produced explaining the group's beliefs, practices, organization and history. Some of these also provide dramas based on biblical accounts. Since 1942 all Watch Tower literature has been published anonymously.<ref>{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=78}}.</ref>

Publications were sold to the public until the early 1990s, from which time they were offered free of charge, with a request for donations. The change in policy was first announced in the United States in February 1990, following the loss of a case before the US Supreme Court by [[Jimmy Swaggart]] Ministries on the issue of sales tax exemption for religious groups.<ref>[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1989/1989_88_1374/ Swaggart Ministries v. California Board of Equalization case summary, US Supreme Court Media]</ref> The Watch Tower Society had joined the case as an [[Amicus curiae]], or \"friend of the court\".<ref>[http://jwfacts.com/index_files/watchtower-swaggart-amicus-curiae.pdf Watch Tower brief, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs California Board of Equalization, US Supreme Court, 1988.]</ref> The court ruling would have resulted in the Watch Tower Society having to pay millions of dollars in sales tax if sales of their literature had continued.<ref>{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=320}}.</ref>

Witnesses are urged to prepare for congregation meetings by studying the assigned Watch Tower literature,<ref>''Organized To Do Jehovah's Will'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2005, page 62.</ref> and are expected to read all magazines and books published by the Society.<ref>\"Let Your Advancement Be Manifest\", ''Watchtower'', August 1, 1992, page 10.</ref><ref>\"Look to Jehovah for Insight\", ''Watchtower'', March 15, 1989, page 14.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=88}}.</ref> One analysis noted that each year Witnesses are expected to read more than 3,000 pages of the Society's publications, according to its suggested program for personal study.<ref>{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=231}}</ref> Much of the literature is illustrated extensively, with sociologist Andrew Holden observing utopian, post-Armageddon images of happy Witnesses in bright sunshine and pristine environments, often playing with formerly wild animals such as lions and tigers, in contrast to dark-colored images of unfavorable activities such as murders, burglaries and promiscuity that highlight the moral dangers outside the organization.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=92–93}}</ref>

==Conversion==
Individuals seeking to be baptised as Jehovah's Witnesses are required to follow a systematic, catechistical Bible study course, usually in their home, for several months. They will be expected to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall and must also demonstrate a willingness to carry out the doorstep ministry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=59}}.</ref> Before baptism they will be questioned by elders to determine that they understand and accept the beliefs of the Witnesses,<ref>''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will''</ref> and also that they accept Jesus' ransom sacrifice and repent of sins and have made a personal dedication to God.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 1/15/89 p. 13 par. 18 What Prevents You From Getting Baptized?</ref> Baptisms are normally performed in pools at assemblies and conventions. At these baptisms, candidates make \"public declaration\" of their prior dedication to God.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 5/15/03 p. 31 Questions From Readers</ref> The speaker asks the candidates the following two questions.
# “On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will?”
# “Do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in association with God’s spirit-directed organization?”
After candidates agree to both questions, they line up to undergo water immersion, usually in quick succession, often with hundreds baptised at large conventions.

Sociologist James Beckford reported two significant distinguishing features of the conversion process when related by Jehovah's Witnesses. He said they typically spoke of their conversion experience as a steady progression of mental states in which Witnesses \"'work for' their conversion by a methodical confrontation with intellectual obstacles and by a deliberate programme of self-reform. Conversion is not represented as something which ''happened'' to them; it is framed as something that they ''achieved''.\" Beckford noted that those he interviewed regarded sudden, emotional upheavals in religious consciousness as suspect: \"Experiences which smack of sudden or idiosyncratic illumination/revelation cannot be reconcilable with either the tenor of God's historical practice or the nature of his special covenant with the Watchtower Society.\"

He also found a striking contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to \"a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming\". Beckford cited an interview \"representative of many\" in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was \"talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed me how the facts of the Bible could not be faulted\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Beckford | first = James A. |  title = Accounting for Conversion | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 29 | issue = June 1978 | pages =251–256 | publisher = London School of Economics and Political Science | location = London | date = June 1978 |  jstor =589892 }}</ref>

==Ministers and ordination==
Jehovah's Witnesses consider as \"[[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]]\" all adherents who have been approved to engage in formal evangelizing. Witnesses consider their baptisms to be [[ordination]]s; ''[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Unbaptized publishers|unbaptized publishers]]'' are considered \"[[Laity#Christian laity|regular ministers]]\" whereas ''[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Baptized publishers|baptized publishers]]'' are considered \"ordained ministers\".<ref>\"Questions from Readers\", ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 1951, page 671-672, \"The authorities of the land generally call for some ceremony in connection with ordination for the ministry... The legal [opinion] is recognizing the two classifications made concerning ministers, namely, ordained ministers and regular unordained ministers. ...[A]n unbaptized one...may still point out to the court [or other authority] that he has not as yet undergone the ordination ceremony of water immersion, and for that reason may be classed by the law of the land as a regular minister rather than an ordained minister.\"</ref> Witnesses recognize that many government and administrative precedents for ministers are not intended to include all active adherents.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', January 1976, page 5-6,\"Since at times a request is made by officials for some evidence of “ordination” on the part of those serving in such capacities, a “Certificate for Ordained Minister” has been prepared and will be supplied on request to those elders or ministerial servants needing it. It will show the date, not of their baptism, but when they were appointed to serve in such capacities... But what of those who are engaged in full-time service as pioneers or members of Bethel families? ...Such appointment, however, does not fit the meaning of “ordination” as that term is generally understood [by non-Witnesses requesting these certificates]. ...Since the Bible itself sets out only the two congregational positions of responsibility, that of elders and of ministerial servants, we limit our ''application'' of the term “ordained minister” [as used by non-Witness authorities] to those in this Scriptural arrangement.[emphasis added]\"</ref> For example, only elders assert [[Priest–penitent privilege|ecclesiastical privilege]] and [[Confessional privilege (United States)|confessional privilege]].<ref>\"Meeting the Challenge of Loyalty\", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 1996, page 18</ref>

Only males may be appointed as elders and ministerial servants (their term for [[Deacon#Jehovah's Witnesses|deacons]]), and only baptized males may officiate at [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, and baptisms.<ref>\"The General Priesthood Today\", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 143</ref> A [[Ordination of women#Jehovah's Witnesses|female Witness minister]] may only lead congregational prayer and teaching in unusual circumstances, and must wear a [[Christian headcovering|head covering]] while doing so. Outside the congregation, a female minister also wears a head covering when she leads spiritual teaching in the presence of her husband, according to the [[Complementarianism|Christian complementarian view]]. Female headcovering is not required for other forms of teaching, or when participating in congregation meetings being led by another.<ref>\"Head Coverings—When and Why?\", ''Keep Yourselves in God's Love'', ©2008 Watch Tower, pages 43–44 and 209–212</ref> <!---Some US courts - please provide at least one non-US reference to avoid this being re-raised; restored 'some' as this is likely not universal--->Some courts and [[Government agency|government agencies]] have recognized that full-time Jehovah's Witnesses appointees, such as \"[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Regular pioneers|pioneers]]\" and those in [[Religious order#Jehovah's Witnesses|the faith's religious order]], qualify for ministerial exemptions regardless of gender.<ref>\"Women—May They Be “Ministers”?\", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 1981, page 19, \"Several courts in the United States have recognized female Jehovah’s Witnesses, in carrying on the door-to-door evangelistic work, as ministers. For example, the Supreme Court of Vermont, in Vermont v. Greaves (1941), stated that Elva Greaves “is an ordained minister of a sect or class known and designated as ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’.”\"</ref><!---This one was cited as it explicitly mentions 'female'. Plentiful case history from Canada, UK, and USA, but also other countries. Also not limited to \"courts\", as EEOC and other non-court agencies have repeatedly ruled similarly.--->

==Discipline==
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline}}
Formal [[Church discipline|discipline]] is administered by congregation elders. In the event that an accusation of serious [[sin]] is made concerning a baptized member, if there is sufficient evidence, a tribunal or judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, administer help and possibly apply sanctions.

''Disfellowshipping'' is the most severe form of discipline administered. Before taking this step, the judicial committee must determine that the individual has committed a \"serious sin\" and that there is no evidence of true repentance.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 9/15/87 p. 13.</ref> To judge that repentance is genuine, members of the judicial committee ask questions and review the actions of the accused member.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 1/1/95 p. 30 par. 3</ref> Baptized members who spread teachings contrary to the doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses can be disfellowshipped for [[apostasy]],<ref>''Pay Attention To Yourself and All the Flock'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1991, page 94, \"Apostasy is a standing away from, a falling away, defection, rebellion, abandonment; it involves teaching false doctrines, supporting or promoting false religion and its holidays or interfaith activities ... Persons who deliberately spread (stubbornly hold to and speak about) teachings contrary to Bible truth as taught by Jehovah's Witnesses are apostates.\"</ref><ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'' p. 34 Apostasy \"Others claim to believe the Bible but reject Jehovah’s organization.\"</ref><ref>''The Watchtower'' 4/1/86 p. 31.</ref> and a 1981 letter to overseers—reproduced in a book by former Governing Body member [[Raymond Franz]]—directed that a member who \"persists in believing other doctrine\", even without promoting such beliefs, may also be subject to disfellowshipping.<ref>''To All Circuit and District Overseers'', September 1, 1980, \"Keep in mind that to be disfellowshipped, an apostate does not have to be a promoter of apostate views. ... if a baptized Christian abandons the teachings of Jehovah, as presented by the faithful and discreet slave, and persists in believing other doctrine despite Scriptural reproof, then he is apostatizing.&nbsp;... [If] he continues to believe the apostate ideas and rejects what he has been provided through the 'slave class,' then appropriate judicial action should be taken. ... [If] something reasonably substantial comes to the attention of the elders along this line, it would be appropriate to make a kindly, discreet inquiry so as to protect the flock.\" Letter reproduced in ''Crisis of Conscience'', Raymond Franz, 1983, chapter 11.</ref> Once the decision to disfellowship has been made, a person has seven days to appeal, after which, if the person has not appealed, the disfellowshipping will be announced to the congregation; disfellowshipping does not take effect until the announcement is made to the congregation.<ref>''Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock'' – pgs. 121–122</ref> After a person is disfellowshipped, the person is shunned by all baptized members.<ref>''The Watchtower'' April 15, 1988 Discipline That Can Yield Peaceable Fruit Pgs. 26–31.</ref> Exceptions include cases where a member is forced to have commercial dealings with a member who is disfellowshipped, or if the disfellowshipped member is living with family members who are baptized. In these cases, the Witness is not permitted to speak about religious matters, except in the case of parents conducting a Bible study with a disfellowshipped minor.<ref>“Helping Minors to Worship God”, ''Awake!'' 11/15, 1988, p. 20.</ref> The extent to which disfellowshipped or disassociated relatives living in the same household are included in family life is left to the discretion of the family.<ref>\"Thus, it would be left to members of the family to decide on the extent to which the disfellowshipped family member would be included when eating or engaging in other household activities. And yet, they would not want to give brothers with whom they associate the impression that everything is the same as it was before the disfellowshipping occurred.\" Display Christian Loyalty When a Relative Is Disfellowshipped, p 4. Scan available at [http://www.jwfiles.com/scans/KM8-2002.htm JWfiles.com] accessed January 27, 2006.</ref> Family members living outside the home who are disfellowshipped have minimal contact.<ref>\"Disfellowshiping—How to View It\", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, p. 26., \"It might be possible to have almost no contact at all with the relative. Even if there were some family matters requiring contact, this certainly would be kept to a minimum.\"</ref><ref>\"Discipline That Can Yield Peaceable Fruit\", ''The Watchtower'' April 15, 1988, p. 26.</ref>

''Reproof'' involves sins that could lead to disfellowshipping. Ones considered \"truly repentant\" are reproved rather than disfellowshipped.<ref>“Questions From Readers”, ''The Watchtower'', January 1, 1983 pp. 30–31.</ref> Reproof is given \"before all onlookers\", based on their interpretation of 1 Timothy 5:20. If the sin is private in nature, the reproof would involve just the individual(s) involved. If the sin is known generally by the entire congregation or the community, an announcement is made informing the congregation that the person has been reproved. Later, without disclosing names or private details, one of the elders gives a separate talk ensuring that the congregation understands the sin, its dangers, and how to avoid it.<ref>“Repentance Leading Back to God”, ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1981, p. 27 par. 30.</ref> Reproved individuals have some congregation privileges restricted, until the elders decide that the member has regained \"spiritual strength.\"<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', March 1975, p. 4.</ref><ref>\"Reproofs Are the Way of Life\", ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 1977 p. 691.</ref> Restrictions may include not sharing in meeting parts, not commenting at meeting parts, and not praying for a group. The duration of restrictions depends on the elders. One cannot \"pioneer\" or \"auxiliary pioneer\" for at least one year after reproof is given.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'' March 1983, p. 3.</ref>

''Marking'' is practiced if a person's course of action is regarded as a violation of Bible principles, reflecting badly on the congregation, but is not a disfellowshipping offense.<ref>''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1999, p. 30</ref> The person is strongly counseled. If, after repeated counsel sessions, the person still pursues the disturbing course, he might be 'marked', which involves an announcement stating that the actions in question are wrong, without naming the individual involved. Congregation members limit social contact with that person. The purpose of this is to shame the person into correcting their actions.<ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1985, p. 31.</ref> \"Marked\" individuals are not shunned completely, but social contact is minimized.<ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1984 p. 31.</ref>

==Family life==
The family structure is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]].  The husband is considered the final authority of family decisions, as the head of his family. Marriages must be monogamous. Wives should be submissive to their husbands and husbands are to have deep respect and love for their wives.<ref>''The Bible's Viewpoint'' What Does It Mean to Be the Head of the House?, ''Awake!'' 2004b, July 8, 2004, p. 26.</ref> Husbands are instructed to treat their wives as Jesus treated his followers. He should not hurt or mistreat his family in any way. The father should be hard-working in providing necessities to his family. He must also provide for them in a spiritual capacity. This includes religious instruction for the family, and taking the lead in preaching activities. Parental discipline for children should not be in a harsh, cruel way. Children are instructed to obey their parents.

Married couples are encouraged to speak with local elders if they are having problems. Married couples can separate in the case of physical abuse and neglect, or if one partner attempts to hinder the other from being a Jehovah's Witness.<ref>''The Secret of Family Happiness'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1996, pp. 160–161.</ref> Remarriage after divorce is permissible only on the grounds of adultery, based on their understanding of Jesus' words at Matthew 5:32 and Matthew 19:9.

==Morality==
Jehovah's Witnesses demand high standards of morality within their ranks.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2005527 \"Are You Faithful in All Things?\", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 2005, page 26-30.]</ref> Their view of sexual behavior reflects conservative Christian views. Abortion is considered murder.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101989204 \"Abortion\", ''Reasoning from the Scriptures'', page 25-26.]</ref> Homosexuality, premarital sex, and extramarital sex are considered “[[Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline#List of \"serious sins\"|serious sins]]”.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102004524 \"Young People Ask...

However, the principles discussed apply equally to the use of chewing tobacco, snuff, electronic cigarettes that contain nicotine, and other products.\"</ref> abuse of drugs, and drunkenness are prohibited, though alcohol is permitted in moderation.<ref>''Jehovah’s Witnesses – Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1993,p. 180.</ref><ref>“You Must Be Holy Because Jehovah Is Holy”, ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1976, p. 123 par. 16.</ref> Modesty in dress and grooming is frequently stressed. Entertainment promoting immoral, \"demonic\", or violent themes is considered inappropriate. Members are warned that [[personal grooming]] such as beards, long hair or earrings for men, or other styles of dress or grooming might \"stumble\" the consciences of others.<ref>“When Another’s Conscience Is Involved”, ''Awake!'' April 22, 1979, pp. 27–28</ref>

Gambling by making money through the losses of others is viewed as a \"form of greed\", and is prohibited.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011167 \"Does the Bible Condemn Gambling?\", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 2011, pages 12–14.]</ref> The trading of stocks, shares and bonds is viewed as acceptable.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102000729 \"Is It Wise to Invest in the Stock Market?\", ''Awake!'', October 8, 2000, pages 25–27.]</ref>

==Blood==
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions}}
{{See also|Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
[[File:Bloedafname Sanquin.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Jehovah's Witnesses officially reject transfusions of whole [[allogeneic]] blood and some of its fractionated components]]
Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that the Bible prohibits the consumption, storage and transfusion of [[blood]], based on their understanding of scriptures such as Leviticus 17:10, 11: \"I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood\" and Acts 15:29: \"abstain from&nbsp;... blood.\" This standpoint is applied even in emergencies. ''The Watchtower'' introduced this view in 1945, and it has developed since then.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Watch Tower Society|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?}}</ref> Accordingly, the organization has established Hospital Information Services (HIS), which provides education and facilitation of [[bloodless surgery]]. This service also maintains Hospital Liaison Committees, which support adherents facing surgery and provide information to the medical community on bloodless surgery techniques and alternatives to blood.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Awake!|date=November 22, 1993|pages=24–25|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref>

Though accepted by most members, some within the Jehovah's Witness community do not endorse the doctrine.<ref>Lee Elder, The Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood, \"Why some Jehovah's Witnesses accept blood and conscientiously reject official Watchtower Society blood policy\", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 2000, Vol 26, pages 375–380.</ref>

Dutch anthropologist Richard Singelenberg has suggested the Watch Tower Society's prohibition on blood transfusions—as well as its edict against fellowship with outsiders—are rooted in the religious desire to maintain a communal state of purity worthy of divine favor. He noted: \"Rules of pollution and purity are instrumental in creating structural boundaries around group members.

Watch Tower Society publications teach that Witnesses are engaged in a \"[[spiritual warfare|spiritual, theocratic warfare]]\" against false teachings and wicked spirit forces they say try to impede them in their preaching work.<ref>\"Flocking Together in Battle Line\", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1983, page 17.</ref> Based on their interpretation of [[Ephesians]] 6:10–20, they believe their \"spiritual war\" is fought with truth, righteousness, the \"good news of peace\", faith, the hope of salvation, God's word and prayer.<ref>\"Fight the fine Fight of faith\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 2004, page 26–27.</ref><ref>\"Waging the Right Warfare\", ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1956, page 365.</ref> They have advocated the use of \"theocratic war strategy\" to protect the interests of God's cause, which would include hiding the truth from God's \"enemies\"<ref>\"Use theocratic war strategy\", ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1957, page 285,286.</ref><ref>\"Questions from readers\", ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 1960, pages 351–352.</ref> by being evasive or withholding truthful or incriminating information from those not entitled by law to know.<ref>\"Christians live the truth\", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 1954, page 597.</ref><ref>''Insight on the Scriptures'', Vol. 2, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, pages 244–245.</ref><ref>[http://www.jw.org/index.html?option=QrYQCsVrGlBBX ''Examining the Scriptures Daily''], May 18, 2011, \"Does being truthful with others mean that we must disclose every detail to whoever asks us a question?

==Separateness==
Jehovah's Witnesses are told they should remain \"separate from the world\" in harmony with Jesus' description of his followers at John 17:14–16. Watch Tower publications define the \"world\" as \"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah’s approved servants\" and teach that it is ruled by Satan<ref>''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, pages 435–436.</ref> and a place of danger<ref>\"Live a Balanced, Simple Life\", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1989, page 11.</ref> and moral contamination.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=12}}.</ref> Witnesses manifest their world-renouncing beliefs in many ways. They avoid involvement in social controversies,<ref>''What Does God Require?'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1996, page 13.</ref> remain politically neutral, and do not seek public office. The Watch Tower Society has stated that voting in political elections is a personal conscience decision,<ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 1999, p. 28, \"As to whether they will personally vote for someone running in an election, each one of Jehovah’s Witnesses makes a decision based on his Bible-trained conscience and an understanding of his responsibility to God and to the State.</ref> though a Witness who takes any action considered to be a \"violation of Christian neutrality\" may face religious sanctions.<ref>''Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock'', page 140.</ref> They refuse participation in ecumenical and interfaith activities,<ref>''Jehovah's Witnesses Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1993, page 188)</ref><ref>''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, pages 269–270.</ref> abstain from celebrating religious holidays, and reject many customs they claim have pagan origins. They do not work in industries associated with the military, nor serve in the armed services,<ref>''Worship the Only True God'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2002, p. 159.</ref> and refuse national military service, which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/region/asia_pacific/south_korea/english/releases/conscientious_obj/kor_e071004.pdf |title=Watch Tower Press Release, October 4, 2007 |access-date=August 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013182250/http://www.jw-media.org/region/asia_pacific/south_korea/english/releases/conscientious_obj/kor_e071004.pdf |archive-date=October 13, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They do not salute or pledge allegiance to national flags or sing national anthems or other patriotic songs.<ref>''Education'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2002, pp. 20–23</ref>

We certainly display love for our neighbors when we share with them the good news of the Kingdom.\"</ref> and Witnesses are under considerable pressure from the Society to show outsiders they are people of high moral fiber. Holden claims that as a result, Witnesses working with \"worldly\" colleagues tend to closely adhere to Watch Tower teachings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=123}}.</ref>

Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested that it is the group's intellectual and organizational isolation—coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents, rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution—that has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message.<ref>Ronald Lawson, \"Sect-state relations: Accounting for the differing trajectories of Seventh-Day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses\", ''Sociology of Religion'', Winter 1995, \"The urgency of the Witness's apocalyptic has changed very little over time. The intellectual isolation of the Witness leaders has allowed them to retain their traditional position, and it is they who continue to be the chief purveyors of the radical eschatology ....This commitment (to principle) was bolstered by their organizational isolation, intense indoctrination of adherents, rigid internal discipline, and considerable persecution.\"</ref>

==Celebrations==
Weddings, anniversaries, and funerals are observed, though they avoid incorporating certain traditions they see to have pagan origins.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 1/15/69 p. 58 Christian Weddings Should Reflect Reasonableness \"Of course, some customs are unscriptural and so they are objectionable to Christians. ... Other customs are plainly acts of false worship. So one planning a wedding does well to examine practices common in his area and analyze how people view them locally.\"</ref><ref>''The Watchtower'' 7/15/98 p. 24 A Christian View of Funeral Customs \"Funeral customs do not always conflict with Bible principles. When they do, Christians are determined to act in harmony with the Scriptures.\"</ref> ''The Watchtower'' has stated that the use of wedding rings by Witnesses is acceptable, even though wedding rings may have first been used by pagans, based on its conclusion that there is no definite evidence wedding rings were used \"as part of false ''religious'' practices\" (emphasis from original).<ref>''The Watchtower'' 1/15/72 p. 63 \"It is thus seen that the precise origin of the wedding ring is uncertain. Even if it were a fact that pagans first used wedding rings, would that rule such out for Christians? Not necessarily.\"</ref> Witnesses typically observe wedding anniversaries, with the Watch Tower Society noting that wedding anniversaries apparently do not stem from pagan origins.<ref>''The Watchtower'', December 1, 1971, p. 735.</ref>

Other common celebrations and religious or national holidays such as [[birthday]]s, [[Halloween]], [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]]<ref>\"Christmas Customs—Are They Christian\", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 2000, page 3-7.</ref> are not celebrated because they believe that these continue to involve \"false religious beliefs or activities.\"<ref>''Awake!'' 7/8/04 p. 30 \"Christians refrain from any celebrations or customs that continue to involve false religious beliefs or activities that violate Bible principles. For example, the Bible definitely puts birthday celebrations in a bad light\"</ref><ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1998, p. 30.</ref> Watch Tower Society publications rule out the celebration of [[Mother's Day]] because of a claimed link with pagan gods<ref>“They Are No Part of the World”, ''Jehovah’s Witnesses – Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom'', page 199, \"Jehovah’s Witnesses have good times with their families and friends. But they do not participate in holidays and celebrations that are linked with pagan gods (as is true of such holidays as Easter, New Year’s Day, May Day, and Mother’s Day).\"</ref> and concerns that giving \"special honor and worship\" to mothers is a form of \"creature worship\" that could turn people away from God.<ref>[http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/vindication1/vindication1_2.html ''Vindication'', J. F. Rutherford, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1931, pages 158–159.]</ref> The Society also directs Witnesses to shun [[May Day]], [[New Year's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]] celebrations because of their pagan origins.<ref>\"What Is the Bible’s View? Are They Harmless Observances?\", ''Awake!'', February 8, 1974, Page 27.</ref>

Their opposition to birthdays is said to be based on how the Bible presents them. Watch Tower Society publications note that the only birthday celebrations explicitly mentioned in the Bible are those of an unnamed [[Pharaoh]] and [[Herod Antipas]], and that both were associated with executions, and neither celebrant was a servant of God.<ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1998. pp. 30–31.</ref> Though some churches interpret Job 1:4 to indicate birthday feasts of Job's sons, Jehovah's Witnesses interpret them as a circuit of feasts from one house to the next.<ref>Job 1:4 reads \"And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.\" (King James version)</ref> The Bible does not show Jesus or his apostles celebrating birthdays and ''The Watchtower'' claims the absence of any record of the date of the birth of Jesus or his apostles indicates that \"God does not want us to celebrate any of these birthdays\".<ref>''The Watchtower'', November 15, 1960, p. 704.</ref>

==Construction==
International and regional building teams frequently undertake constructions of Kingdom Halls over the course of one or two weekends, termed \"quick-builds\". Larger construction projects, including building regional Assembly Halls and Bethel offices, factories, residences, warehouses, and farm facilities, are also performed almost entirely by volunteer members.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Humanitarian efforts==
Jehovah's Witnesses provide relief assistance in disaster-stricken areas for their members and others in the vicinity. Medicine and clothing were provided to both Hutu and Tutsi Witnesses during the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref>\"Christianity in Action: Amid Turmoil\", ''The Watchtower'', January 15, 1998.</ref> Following [[Hurricane Katrina]], they helped rebuild houses of Witnesses and others.<ref>''Awake!'', June 2006, page 19, \"Heeding the Warnings Made a Difference\"</ref> The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses uses \"Regional Building Committees\" to oversee relief efforts worldwide.<ref>''Awake!'', June 2006, p.19.</ref>

==Funding of activities==
Jehovah's Witnesses fund their activities, such as publishing, constructing and operating facilities, evangelism, and disaster relief via donations. There is no [[tithe|tithing]] or collection, but on exceptional occasions, members are reminded to donate to the organization; Witnesses typically provide an opportunity for members of the public to make donations as they encounter them in their preaching work. Donation boxes labeled for several purposes are located in Kingdom Halls and other meeting facilities. Generally there are contribution boxes for local operating expenses, a Kingdom Hall fund for helping Witnesses around the world to build Kingdom Halls, and a general fund for the \"Worldwide Work\", which includes the printing of literature, organization of conventions, supporting missionaries and disaster relief, and other operating expenses of the organization.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, December 2003, p. 7</ref><ref>“A New Program for Kingdom Hall Construction”, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, September 1983, p. 4-5.</ref>

The accounts (including donations) and the financial operation of the local congregation are reviewed monthly and posted on a congregation notice board. Donations are also accepted via mail, and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society can be named as a beneficiary to an estate, and also accepts donations in the form of life insurance policies, pension plans, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, retirement accounts, stocks and bonds, real estate, annuities and trusts.<ref>\"Ways in Which Some Choose to Give Contributions to the Worldwide Work\", ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 2006, page 20</ref>

[[Category:Beliefs and practices of Jehovah's Witnesses| ]]","{{Jehovah's Witnesses}}
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] base their practices on the [[Bible|biblical]] interpretations of [[Charles Taze Russell]] (1852–1916), founder ({{circa}} 1881) of the [[Bible Student movement]], and of successive presidents of the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania|Watch Tower Society]], [[Joseph Franklin Rutherford]] (in office 1917–1942) and [[Nathan Homer Knorr]] (in office 1942–1977). Since 1976 practices have also been based on decisions made at closed meetings of the group's [[Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses|Governing Body]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Franz|2002|p= 106}}.</ref><ref>''Keep Yourselves in God's Love'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, 2008, page 43, \"The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses represents the slave class. ... elders today receive instructions and counsel from the Governing Body, either directly or through its representatives, such as traveling overseers.\"</ref> The group disseminates instructions regarding activities and acceptable behavior through ''[[The Watchtower]]'' magazine and through other [[Jehovah's Witnesses publications|official publications]], and at conventions and congregation meetings.

Jehovah's Witnesses endeavor to remain \"separate from the world\",<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Keep Clear of False Worship!|magazine= The Watchtower|date= March 15, 2006|page= 30|quote= [Jehovah's Witnesses] are 'no part of the world.'

(Ephesians 4:17–19; 1 John 5:19) We are separate from the world in that we shun attitudes, speech, and conduct that offend Jehovah. (1 John 2:15–17) Moreover, in harmony with the principle that 'bad associations spoil useful habits,' we avoid intimacy with those who do not live by Christian standards.

Members are expected to participate regularly in [[Evangelism|evangelizing work]] and to attend all congregation meetings, as well as regular large-scale conventions – highly structured events based on material from Watch Tower Society publications.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp= 66–68}}.</ref>

==Worship==
[[File:Jehovah Witnesses Kingdom Hall Svolvaer 2009.JPG|thumb|A Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses in Norway.]] [[File:Reunião em Salão do Reino.jpg|thumb|Worship at a Kingdom Hall in Portugal.]]Meetings for worship and study are held at [[Kingdom Hall]]s, and are open to the public. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in which \"territory\" they reside and are expected to attend weekly meetings as scheduled by the Watch Tower Society and congregation [[Elder (Christianity)#Jehovah's Witnesses|elders]]. The meetings are largely devoted to study of the Bible and Witness doctrines.<ref name=holdenhall>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=64–69}}.</ref> During meetings and in other formal circumstances, Witnesses refer to one another as \"Brother\" and \"Sister\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Botting |first1=Heather |last2=Botting |first2=Gary |authorlink2=Gary Botting |title=The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses |url=https://archive.org/details/orwellianworldof0000bott |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1984 |page=[https://archive.org/details/orwellianworldof0000bott/page/85 85] |isbn=0-8020-6545-7}}</ref> Sociologist Andrew Holden claims meetings create an atmosphere of uniformity for Witnesses, intensify their sense of belonging to a religious community, and reinforce the plausibility of the organization's belief system.<ref name=holdenhall /> He says they are also important in helping new converts adopt a different way of life.<ref name=holdenhall /> According to ''The Watchtower'', one role of the frequency and length of meetings is to protect Witnesses from becoming \"involved in the affairs of the world.\"<ref>\"What Do You Do with Your Time?\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1950, page 38, \"By setting and meeting the goal never to miss any of the meetings that the Lord provides for His people, the Christian is protected against becoming involved in the affairs of this world. He doesn’t have time for it!\"</ref><ref>\"Exert Yourselves Vigorously!\", ''The Watchtower'', April 1, 1972, page 206, \"They do much private Bible study, attend five weekly congregation meetings and spend much time each month in preaching the good news of God’s kingdom and making disciples of people, besides providing support for themselves and their families. ... Being busy serves as a protection from many of the temptations and snares of the world, the flesh and the Devil.\"</ref>

The form and content of the meetings is established by the denomination's Brooklyn headquarters, generally involving a consideration of the same subject matter worldwide each week.<ref name=holdenhall /> Two meetings each week are divided into five distinct sections, lasting a total of about four hours. Meetings are opened and closed with [[Kingdom songs|hymns]] and brief prayers delivered from the platform. Witnesses are urged to prepare for all meetings by studying Watch Tower literature from which the content is drawn and looking up the scriptures cited in the articles.<ref>\"Benefit Fully From the Service Meetings\", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', January 1989, page 7.</ref> Kingdom Halls are typically functional in character, and contain no religious symbols.<ref name=holdenhall /> Each year, Witnesses from several congregations, which form a \"circuit\", gather for two one-day assemblies; several circuits meet once a year for a three-day \"regional convention\", and every few years the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses hold \"international conventions\" in selected cities around the world. These larger gatherings are usually held at rented stadiums or auditoriums. Their most important and solemn event is the celebration of the \"Lord's Evening Meal\", or \"Memorial of Christ's Death\".

===Weekend meeting===
The weekend meeting, usually held on Sunday, comprises a 30-minute public talk by a congregation [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Elders|elder]] or [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Ministerial servants|ministerial servant]] and a one-hour question-and-answer study of a Bible-based article from ''[[The Watchtower]]'' magazine,<ref name=holdenhall /> with questions prepared by the Watch Tower Society and the answers provided in the magazine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Franz|2007|p=420}}.</ref> Members may use their own words to express the ideas in the printed material,<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=1 July 1999|page=20|title=Families, Praise God as Part of His Congregation}}</ref> though personal ideas derived from independent study are discouraged.<ref name=holdenhall /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Botting |first1=Heather |last2=Botting |first2=Gary |title=The Orwellian World of Jehovah's Witnesses |url=https://archive.org/details/orwellianworldof0000bott |url-access=registration |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=1984 |page=[https://archive.org/details/orwellianworldof0000bott/page/143 143] |isbn=0-8020-6545-7}}</ref>

===Midweek meeting===
The midweek meeting, typically held in the evening, includes various question-and-answer sessions based on Watch Tower Society publications,<ref name=holdenhall /><ref>''Jehovah’s Witnesses—Who Are They? What Do They Believe?'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2000, page 15.</ref> Bible reading, and sample presentations of how to use Watch Tower Society literature for Bible studies and public preaching.<ref>\"Are You Benefiting Yourself?\", ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', August 2000, page 3.</ref>

===Memorial of Christ's death===
{{See also|Memorialism}}
Jehovah's Witnesses commemorate Christ's death as a ransom or \"propitiatory sacrifice\" by observing the Lord's Evening Meal, or Memorial.<ref name=\"Memorial\">{{cite web|title=The Lord's Supper: Why Do Jehovah’s Witnesses Observe the Lord’s Supper Differently From the Way Other Religions Do?|publisher=Watchtower Bible & Tract Society|year=2018|url=https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/faq/lords-supper/}}</ref><ref name=\"WOL\">{{cite web|title=The Eucharist: The Facts Behind the Ritual|publisher=Watchtower Online Library|year=2018|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2008249}}</ref> They celebrate it once per year, noting that it was instituted on the [[Passover]], an annual festival.<ref name=\"Memorial\" /><ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, p. 265.</ref> They observe it on [[Quartodeciman|Nisan 14]] according to the ancient Jewish luni-solar calendar.<ref name=\"Memorial\" /><ref>''Insight On The Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, p. 392.</ref> Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that this is the only celebration the Bible commands Christians to observe.<ref>\"Jehovah is a God of Covenants\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1998, page 8, \"Jesus instituted the only annual religious observance commanded for Christians—the Memorial of his death.\"</ref>

Of those who attend the Memorial, a small minority worldwide partake of the unleavened bread and wine. This is because Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the majority of the faithful have an earthly hope. Only those who believe they have a heavenly hope, the \"remnant\" (those still living) of the [[144000 (number)#Jehovah's Witnesses|144,000]] \"anointed\", partake of the bread and wine.<ref>''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, p. 207, \"Who should partake of these Memorial emblems? Logically, only those in the new covenant—that is, those who have the hope of going to heaven—should partake of the bread and the wine. God’s holy spirit convinces such ones that they have been selected to be heavenly kings.\"</ref> In 2018, more than 20 million people attended, and more than 19,500 members partook.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/2018-service-year-report/2018-grand-totals/|title=2018 Grand Totals|publisher=Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society}}</ref>

The Memorial, held after sunset, includes a talk on the meaning of the celebration and the circulation among the audience of unadulterated red wine and unleavened bread. Jehovah's Witnesses believe the bread symbolizes Jesus Christ's body which he gave on behalf of mankind, and that the wine symbolizes his blood which redeems from sin. They do not believe in [[transubstantiation]] or [[consubstantiation]].<ref name=\"Memorial\" /><ref name=\"WOL\" /><ref>''What Does The Bible Really Teach?'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2005, p. 207.</ref><ref>\"Discerning What We Are — At Memorial Time\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1990, p. 16.</ref> Because many congregations have no members who claim to be anointed, it is common for no one to partake of the bread and wine.

===Assemblies and conventions===

Each year, Jehovah's Witnesses hold two one day \"Circuit Assemblies\", held in each [[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Circuit|circuit]] worldwide. Each circuit comprises several congregations in a geographical area. These are held either in Assembly Halls owned by Jehovah's Witnesses, or in rented facilities, such as public auditoriums. Once a year, Jehovah's Witnesses gather at larger assemblies called \"Regional Conventions\" which are usually three days long (Friday to Sunday). These conventions consist primarily of Bible-based sermons, including demonstrations and experiences of their preaching work. They also often feature video presentations and live, full-costume dramatic plays re-enacting biblical accounts—such as [[Moses]] and the [[Plagues of Egypt]], and [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]—or contemporary settings based on biblical principles. Every few years, \"International Conventions\" are held in selected cities, with visiting delegates from other countries. Attendance at some of these international conventions has exceeded one hundred thousand; the 1958 international convention in New York at [[Yankee Stadium]] and the [[Polo Grounds]] had a peak attendance exceeding 253,000.<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Look!

Specialized \"territory\" maps of residential and commercial areas are prepared within the boundaries of each congregation's territory and distributed to publishers who are responsible for preaching within that area. Witnesses are instructed to fill out monthly report slips on their preaching activity,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Do You Contribute to an Accurate Report?|magazine=Our Kingdom Ministry|date=December 2002|page=8}}</ref> listing the hours spent, publications placed with householders, and the number of \"return visits\" made to households where interest had been shown formerly.<ref name=holdenminister /> The reports are used to help measure the \"spirituality\" of individuals<ref name=holdenminister /><ref>{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|p=247}}.</ref> and to establish the eligibility of men as congregation elders and ministerial servants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Franz|2007|p=201}}.</ref> A Witness who fails to report for a month is termed an \"irregular publisher\"; one who has not turned in a field service report for six months consecutively is termed an \"inactive publisher\".

Witnesses have, in the past, used a wide variety of methods to spread their faith, including information marches, where members wore [[sandwich board]]s and handed out leaflets, to sound cars (car-mounted [[phonograph]]s), and syndicated newspaper columns and radio segments devoted to sermons. Between 1924 and 1957, the organization operated a radio station, WBBR, from New York. Since 2011, the Witnesses have engaged in \"public witnessing\" in metropolitan districts and fairs using tables, carts, and literature displays. The Watch Tower Society operates a website, [https://www.jw.org/en/ JW.org], which provides access to Watch Tower Society literature and [[streaming media|video streaming]].

==Watch Tower Society literature==

{{See also|Jehovah's Witnesses publications|List of Watch Tower Society publications}}

Jehovah's Witnesses make extensive use of Watch Tower Society literature, including books, magazines, booklets and handbills, to spread their beliefs and to use as textbooks at their religious meetings. The publications are produced in many languages, with a small selection available in 500 languages. Their primary journal, ''The Watchtower'' <!---and ''Awake!'', are--->is published simultaneously in nearly two hundred languages and, along with ''Awake!'', available in audio and electronic formats. Issues of both publications are compiled annually into bound volumes, and are added yearly to the ''Watchtower Library'' CD-ROM, which contains many Witness publications from 1950 onward, and is officially available to baptized members only.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', September 2007, p. 3</ref> New books, brochures, and other items are released at their annual conventions. Additionally, a number of [[compact audio cassette|audio cassettes]], [[videocassette]]s, and [[DVD]]s have been produced explaining the group's beliefs, practices, organization and history. Some of these also provide dramas based on biblical accounts. Since 1942 all Watch Tower literature has been published anonymously.<ref>{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=78}}.</ref>

Publications were sold to the public until the early 1990s, from which time they were offered free of charge, with a request for donations. The change in policy was first announced in the United States in February 1990, following the loss of a case before the US Supreme Court by [[Jimmy Swaggart]] Ministries on the issue of sales tax exemption for religious groups.<ref>[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1980-1989/1989/1989_88_1374/ Swaggart Ministries v. California Board of Equalization case summary, US Supreme Court Media]</ref> The Watch Tower Society had joined the case as an [[Amicus curiae]], or \"friend of the court\".<ref>[http://jwfacts.com/index_files/watchtower-swaggart-amicus-curiae.pdf Watch Tower brief, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs California Board of Equalization, US Supreme Court, 1988.]</ref> The court ruling would have resulted in the Watch Tower Society having to pay millions of dollars in sales tax if sales of their literature had continued.<ref>{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=320}}.</ref>

Witnesses are urged to prepare for congregation meetings by studying the assigned Watch Tower literature,<ref>''Organized To Do Jehovah's Will'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2005, page 62.</ref> and are expected to read all magazines and books published by the Society.<ref>\"Let Your Advancement Be Manifest\", ''Watchtower'', August 1, 1992, page 10.</ref><ref>\"Look to Jehovah for Insight\", ''Watchtower'', March 15, 1989, page 14.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=88}}.</ref> One analysis noted that each year Witnesses are expected to read more than 3,000 pages of the Society's publications, according to its suggested program for personal study.<ref>{{Harvnb|Penton|1997|pp=231}}</ref> Much of the literature is illustrated extensively, with sociologist Andrew Holden observing utopian, post-Armageddon images of happy Witnesses in bright sunshine and pristine environments, often playing with formerly wild animals such as lions and tigers, in contrast to dark-colored images of unfavorable activities such as murders, burglaries and promiscuity that highlight the moral dangers outside the organization.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=92–93}}</ref>

==Conversion==
Individuals seeking to be baptised as Jehovah's Witnesses are required to follow a systematic, catechistical Bible study course, usually in their home, for several months. They will be expected to attend meetings at the Kingdom Hall and must also demonstrate a willingness to carry out the doorstep ministry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=59}}.</ref> Before baptism they will be questioned by elders to determine that they understand and accept the beliefs of the Witnesses,<ref>''Organized to Do Jehovah's Will''</ref> and also that they accept Jesus' ransom sacrifice and repent of sins and have made a personal dedication to God.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 1/15/89 p. 13 par. 18 What Prevents You From Getting Baptized?</ref> Baptisms are normally performed in pools at assemblies and conventions. At these baptisms, candidates make \"public declaration\" of their prior dedication to God.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 5/15/03 p. 31 Questions From Readers</ref> The speaker asks the candidates the following two questions.
# “On the basis of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, have you repented of your sins and dedicated yourself to Jehovah to do his will?”
# “Do you understand that your dedication and baptism identify you as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses in association with God’s spirit-directed organization?”
After candidates agree to both questions, they line up to undergo water immersion, usually in quick succession, often with hundreds baptised at large conventions.

Sociologist James Beckford reported two significant distinguishing features of the conversion process when related by Jehovah's Witnesses. He said they typically spoke of their conversion experience as a steady progression of mental states in which Witnesses \"'work for' their conversion by a methodical confrontation with intellectual obstacles and by a deliberate programme of self-reform. Conversion is not represented as something which ''happened'' to them; it is framed as something that they ''achieved''.\" Beckford noted that those he interviewed regarded sudden, emotional upheavals in religious consciousness as suspect: \"Experiences which smack of sudden or idiosyncratic illumination/revelation cannot be reconcilable with either the tenor of God's historical practice or the nature of his special covenant with the Watchtower Society.\"

He also found a striking contrast with other churches in the common attribution of responsibility for conversion to \"a spiritual guide ... the person who acted as the intermediary with the Watchtower movement and who supervised the initial process of learning and reforming\". Beckford cited an interview \"representative of many\" in which a convert recalled initially resisting the Watch Tower Society's teachings until he was \"talked into making a serious study of the scriptures ... I had plenty of objections and was sure the Witnesses were wrong, but (the Witness leading the personal Bible study sessions) showed me how the facts of the Bible could not be faulted\".<ref>{{cite journal | last = Beckford | first = James A. |  title = Accounting for Conversion | journal = British Journal of Sociology | volume = 29 | issue = June 1978 | pages =251–256 | publisher = London School of Economics and Political Science | location = London | date = June 1978 |  jstor =589892 }}</ref>

==Ministers and ordination==
Jehovah's Witnesses consider as \"[[Minister (Christianity)|ministers]]\" all adherents who have been approved to engage in formal evangelizing. Witnesses consider their baptisms to be [[ordination]]s; ''[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Unbaptized publishers|unbaptized publishers]]'' are considered \"[[Laity#Christian laity|regular ministers]]\" whereas ''[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Baptized publishers|baptized publishers]]'' are considered \"ordained ministers\".<ref>\"Questions from Readers\", ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 1951, page 671-672, \"The authorities of the land generally call for some ceremony in connection with ordination for the ministry... The legal [opinion] is recognizing the two classifications made concerning ministers, namely, ordained ministers and regular unordained ministers. ...[A]n unbaptized one...may still point out to the court [or other authority] that he has not as yet undergone the ordination ceremony of water immersion, and for that reason may be classed by the law of the land as a regular minister rather than an ordained minister.\"</ref> Witnesses recognize that many government and administrative precedents for ministers are not intended to include all active adherents.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', January 1976, page 5-6,\"Since at times a request is made by officials for some evidence of “ordination” on the part of those serving in such capacities, a “Certificate for Ordained Minister” has been prepared and will be supplied on request to those elders or ministerial servants needing it. It will show the date, not of their baptism, but when they were appointed to serve in such capacities... But what of those who are engaged in full-time service as pioneers or members of Bethel families? ...Such appointment, however, does not fit the meaning of “ordination” as that term is generally understood [by non-Witnesses requesting these certificates]. ...Since the Bible itself sets out only the two congregational positions of responsibility, that of elders and of ministerial servants, we limit our ''application'' of the term “ordained minister” [as used by non-Witness authorities] to those in this Scriptural arrangement.[emphasis added]\"</ref> For example, only elders assert [[Priest–penitent privilege|ecclesiastical privilege]] and [[Confessional privilege (United States)|confessional privilege]].<ref>\"Meeting the Challenge of Loyalty\", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 1996, page 18</ref>

Only males may be appointed as elders and ministerial servants (their term for [[Deacon#Jehovah's Witnesses|deacons]]), and only baptized males may officiate at [[wedding]]s, [[funeral]]s, and baptisms.<ref>\"The General Priesthood Today\", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1963, page 143</ref> A [[Ordination of women#Jehovah's Witnesses|female Witness minister]] may only lead congregational prayer and teaching in unusual circumstances, and must wear a [[Christian headcovering|head covering]] while doing so. Outside the congregation, a female minister also wears a head covering when she leads spiritual teaching in the presence of her husband, according to the [[Complementarianism|Christian complementarian view]]. Female headcovering is not required for other forms of teaching, or when participating in congregation meetings being led by another.<ref>\"Head Coverings—When and Why?\", ''Keep Yourselves in God's Love'', ©2008 Watch Tower, pages 43–44 and 209–212</ref> <!---Some US courts - please provide at least one non-US reference to avoid this being re-raised; restored 'some' as this is likely not universal--->Some courts and [[Government agency|government agencies]] have recognized that full-time Jehovah's Witnesses appointees, such as \"[[Organizational structure of Jehovah's Witnesses#Regular pioneers|pioneers]]\" and those in [[Religious order#Jehovah's Witnesses|the faith's religious order]], qualify for ministerial exemptions regardless of gender.<ref>\"Women—May They Be “Ministers”?\", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 1981, page 19, \"Several courts in the United States have recognized female Jehovah’s Witnesses, in carrying on the door-to-door evangelistic work, as ministers. For example, the Supreme Court of Vermont, in Vermont v. Greaves (1941), stated that Elva Greaves “is an ordained minister of a sect or class known and designated as ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses’.”\"</ref><!---This one was cited as it explicitly mentions 'female'. Plentiful case history from Canada, UK, and USA, but also other countries. Also not limited to \"courts\", as EEOC and other non-court agencies have repeatedly ruled similarly.--->

==Discipline==
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline}}
Formal [[Church discipline|discipline]] is administered by congregation elders. In the event that an accusation of serious [[sin]] is made concerning a baptized member, if there is sufficient evidence, a tribunal or judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, administer help and possibly apply sanctions.

''Disfellowshipping'' is the most severe form of discipline administered. Before taking this step, the judicial committee must determine that the individual has committed a \"serious sin\" and that there is no evidence of true repentance.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 9/15/87 p. 13.</ref> To judge that repentance is genuine, members of the judicial committee ask questions and review the actions of the accused member.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 1/1/95 p. 30 par. 3</ref> Baptized members who spread teachings contrary to the doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses can be disfellowshipped for [[apostasy]],<ref>''Pay Attention To Yourself and All the Flock'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1991, page 94, \"Apostasy is a standing away from, a falling away, defection, rebellion, abandonment; it involves teaching false doctrines, supporting or promoting false religion and its holidays or interfaith activities ... Persons who deliberately spread (stubbornly hold to and speak about) teachings contrary to Bible truth as taught by Jehovah's Witnesses are apostates.\"</ref><ref>''Reasoning From The Scriptures'' p. 34 Apostasy \"Others claim to believe the Bible but reject Jehovah’s organization.\"</ref><ref>''The Watchtower'' 4/1/86 p. 31.</ref> and a 1981 letter to overseers—reproduced in a book by former Governing Body member [[Raymond Franz]]—directed that a member who \"persists in believing other doctrine\", even without promoting such beliefs, may also be subject to disfellowshipping.<ref>''To All Circuit and District Overseers'', September 1, 1980, \"Keep in mind that to be disfellowshipped, an apostate does not have to be a promoter of apostate views. ... if a baptized Christian abandons the teachings of Jehovah, as presented by the faithful and discreet slave, and persists in believing other doctrine despite Scriptural reproof, then he is apostatizing.&nbsp;... [If] he continues to believe the apostate ideas and rejects what he has been provided through the 'slave class,' then appropriate judicial action should be taken. ... [If] something reasonably substantial comes to the attention of the elders along this line, it would be appropriate to make a kindly, discreet inquiry so as to protect the flock.\" Letter reproduced in ''Crisis of Conscience'', Raymond Franz, 1983, chapter 11.</ref> Once the decision to disfellowship has been made, a person has seven days to appeal, after which, if the person has not appealed, the disfellowshipping will be announced to the congregation; disfellowshipping does not take effect until the announcement is made to the congregation.<ref>''Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock'' – pgs. 121–122</ref> After a person is disfellowshipped, the person is shunned by all baptized members.<ref>''The Watchtower'' April 15, 1988 Discipline That Can Yield Peaceable Fruit Pgs. 26–31.</ref> Exceptions include cases where a member is forced to have commercial dealings with a member who is disfellowshipped, or if the disfellowshipped member is living with family members who are baptized. In these cases, the Witness is not permitted to speak about religious matters, except in the case of parents conducting a Bible study with a disfellowshipped minor.<ref>“Helping Minors to Worship God”, ''Awake!'' 11/15, 1988, p. 20.</ref> The extent to which disfellowshipped or disassociated relatives living in the same household are included in family life is left to the discretion of the family.<ref>\"Thus, it would be left to members of the family to decide on the extent to which the disfellowshipped family member would be included when eating or engaging in other household activities. And yet, they would not want to give brothers with whom they associate the impression that everything is the same as it was before the disfellowshipping occurred.\" Display Christian Loyalty When a Relative Is Disfellowshipped, p 4. Scan available at [http://www.jwfiles.com/scans/KM8-2002.htm JWfiles.com] accessed January 27, 2006.</ref> Family members living outside the home who are disfellowshipped have minimal contact.<ref>\"Disfellowshiping—How to View It\", ''The Watchtower'', September 15, 1981, p. 26., \"It might be possible to have almost no contact at all with the relative. Even if there were some family matters requiring contact, this certainly would be kept to a minimum.\"</ref><ref>\"Discipline That Can Yield Peaceable Fruit\", ''The Watchtower'' April 15, 1988, p. 26.</ref>

''Reproof'' involves sins that could lead to disfellowshipping. Ones considered \"truly repentant\" are reproved rather than disfellowshipped.<ref>“Questions From Readers”, ''The Watchtower'', January 1, 1983 pp. 30–31.</ref> Reproof is given \"before all onlookers\", based on their interpretation of 1 Timothy 5:20. If the sin is private in nature, the reproof would involve just the individual(s) involved. If the sin is known generally by the entire congregation or the community, an announcement is made informing the congregation that the person has been reproved. Later, without disclosing names or private details, one of the elders gives a separate talk ensuring that the congregation understands the sin, its dangers, and how to avoid it.<ref>“Repentance Leading Back to God”, ''The Watchtower'', September 1, 1981, p. 27 par. 30.</ref> Reproved individuals have some congregation privileges restricted, until the elders decide that the member has regained \"spiritual strength.\"<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', March 1975, p. 4.</ref><ref>\"Reproofs Are the Way of Life\", ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 1977 p. 691.</ref> Restrictions may include not sharing in meeting parts, not commenting at meeting parts, and not praying for a group. The duration of restrictions depends on the elders. One cannot \"pioneer\" or \"auxiliary pioneer\" for at least one year after reproof is given.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'' March 1983, p. 3.</ref>

''Marking'' is practiced if a person's course of action is regarded as a violation of Bible principles, reflecting badly on the congregation, but is not a disfellowshipping offense.<ref>''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1999, p. 30</ref> The person is strongly counseled. If, after repeated counsel sessions, the person still pursues the disturbing course, he might be 'marked', which involves an announcement stating that the actions in question are wrong, without naming the individual involved. Congregation members limit social contact with that person. The purpose of this is to shame the person into correcting their actions.<ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1985, p. 31.</ref> \"Marked\" individuals are not shunned completely, but social contact is minimized.<ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', April 15, 1984 p. 31.</ref>

==Family life==
The family structure is [[patriarchy|patriarchal]].  The husband is considered the final authority of family decisions, as the head of his family. Marriages must be monogamous. Wives should be submissive to their husbands and husbands are to have deep respect and love for their wives.<ref>''The Bible's Viewpoint'' What Does It Mean to Be the Head of the House?, ''Awake!'' 2004b, July 8, 2004, p. 26.</ref> Husbands are instructed to treat their wives as Jesus treated his followers. He should not hurt or mistreat his family in any way. The father should be hard-working in providing necessities to his family. He must also provide for them in a spiritual capacity. This includes religious instruction for the family, and taking the lead in preaching activities. Parental discipline for children should not be in a harsh, cruel way. Children are instructed to obey their parents.

Married couples are encouraged to speak with local elders if they are having problems. Married couples can separate in the case of physical abuse and neglect, or if one partner attempts to hinder the other from being a Jehovah's Witness.<ref>''The Secret of Family Happiness'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1996, pp. 160–161.</ref> Remarriage after divorce is permissible only on the grounds of adultery, based on their understanding of Jesus' words at Matthew 5:32 and Matthew 19:9.

==Morality==
Jehovah's Witnesses demand high standards of morality within their ranks.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2005527 \"Are You Faithful in All Things?\", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 2005, page 26-30.]</ref> Their view of sexual behavior reflects conservative Christian views. Abortion is considered murder.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1101989204 \"Abortion\", ''Reasoning from the Scriptures'', page 25-26.]</ref> Homosexuality, premarital sex, and extramarital sex are considered “[[Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline#List of \"serious sins\"|serious sins]]”.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102004524 \"Young People Ask...

However, the principles discussed apply equally to the use of chewing tobacco, snuff, electronic cigarettes that contain nicotine, and other products.\"</ref> abuse of drugs, and drunkenness are prohibited, though alcohol is permitted in moderation.<ref>''Jehovah’s Witnesses – Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1993,p. 180.</ref><ref>“You Must Be Holy Because Jehovah Is Holy”, ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 1976, p. 123 par. 16.</ref> Modesty in dress and grooming is frequently stressed. Entertainment promoting immoral, \"demonic\", or violent themes is considered inappropriate. Members are warned that [[personal grooming]] such as beards, long hair or earrings for men, or other styles of dress or grooming might \"stumble\" the consciences of others.<ref>“When Another’s Conscience Is Involved”, ''Awake!'' April 22, 1979, pp. 27–28</ref>

Gambling by making money through the losses of others is viewed as a \"form of greed\", and is prohibited.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011167 \"Does the Bible Condemn Gambling?\", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 2011, pages 12–14.]</ref> The trading of stocks, shares and bonds is viewed as acceptable.<ref>[http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/102000729 \"Is It Wise to Invest in the Stock Market?\", ''Awake!'', October 8, 2000, pages 25–27.]</ref>

==Blood==
{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and blood transfusions}}
{{See also|Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
[[File:Bloedafname Sanquin.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Jehovah's Witnesses officially reject transfusions of whole [[allogeneic]] blood and some of its fractionated components]]
Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that the Bible prohibits the consumption, storage and transfusion of [[blood]], based on their understanding of scriptures such as Leviticus 17:10, 11: \"I will certainly set my face against the one who is eating the blood\" and Acts 15:29: \"abstain from&nbsp;... blood.\" This standpoint is applied even in emergencies. ''The Watchtower'' introduced this view in 1945, and it has developed since then.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Watch Tower Society|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?}}</ref> Accordingly, the organization has established Hospital Information Services (HIS), which provides education and facilitation of [[bloodless surgery]]. This service also maintains Hospital Liaison Committees, which support adherents facing surgery and provide information to the medical community on bloodless surgery techniques and alternatives to blood.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Awake!|date=November 22, 1993|pages=24–25|publisher=Watch Tower Society}}</ref>

Though accepted by most members, some within the Jehovah's Witness community do not endorse the doctrine.<ref>Lee Elder, The Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood, \"Why some Jehovah's Witnesses accept blood and conscientiously reject official Watchtower Society blood policy\", ''Journal of Medical Ethics'', 2000, Vol 26, pages 375–380.</ref>

Dutch anthropologist Richard Singelenberg has suggested the Watch Tower Society's prohibition on blood transfusions—as well as its edict against fellowship with outsiders—are rooted in the religious desire to maintain a communal state of purity worthy of divine favor. He noted: \"Rules of pollution and purity are instrumental in creating structural boundaries around group members. And the more distinctive when formulated into divine precepts, the clearer the dividing lines between the faithful and those excluded.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last =Singelenberg| first = Richard |  title =The blood transufion taboo of Jehovah's Witnesses: origin, development and function of a controversial doctrine | journal =Social Science & Medicine | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages =521–522 |  date = 1990 | doi = 10.1016/0277-9536(90)90048-W }}</ref>

==Spiritual warfare==
Watch Tower Society publications teach that Witnesses are engaged in a \"[[spiritual warfare|spiritual, theocratic warfare]]\" against false teachings and wicked spirit forces they say try to impede them in their preaching work.<ref>\"Flocking Together in Battle Line\", ''The Watchtower'', March 1, 1983, page 17.</ref> Based on their interpretation of [[Ephesians]] 6:10–20, they believe their \"spiritual war\" is fought with truth, righteousness, the \"good news of peace\", faith, the hope of salvation, God's word and prayer.<ref>\"Fight the fine Fight of faith\", ''The Watchtower'', February 15, 2004, page 26–27.</ref><ref>\"Waging the Right Warfare\", ''The Watchtower'', June 15, 1956, page 365.</ref> They have advocated the use of \"theocratic war strategy\" to protect the interests of God's cause, which would include hiding the truth from God's \"enemies\"<ref>\"Use theocratic war strategy\", ''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1957, page 285,286.</ref><ref>\"Questions from readers\", ''The Watchtower'', June 1, 1960, pages 351–352.</ref> by being evasive or withholding truthful or incriminating information from those not entitled by law to know.<ref>\"Christians live the truth\", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 1954, page 597.</ref><ref>''Insight on the Scriptures'', Vol. 2, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1988, pages 244–245.</ref><ref>[http://www.jw.org/index.html?option=QrYQCsVrGlBBX ''Examining the Scriptures Daily''], May 18, 2011, \"Does being truthful with others mean that we must disclose every detail to whoever asks us a question? Not necessarily ... Jehovah's people need to be on guard against apostates and other wicked men who use trickery or cunning for selfish purposes.\"</ref> ''The Watchtower'' told Witnesses: \"It is proper to cover over our arrangements for the work that God commands us to do. If the wolfish foes draw wrong conclusions from our maneuvers to outwit them, no harm has been done to them by the harmless sheep, innocent in their motives as doves.\"<ref>\"Cautious as Serpents Among Wolves\", ''The Watchtower'', February 1, 1956, page 86.</ref>

==Separateness==
Jehovah's Witnesses are told they should remain \"separate from the world\" in harmony with Jesus' description of his followers at John 17:14–16. Watch Tower publications define the \"world\" as \"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah’s approved servants\" and teach that it is ruled by Satan<ref>''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, pages 435–436.</ref> and a place of danger<ref>\"Live a Balanced, Simple Life\", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 1989, page 11.</ref> and moral contamination.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=12}}.</ref> Witnesses manifest their world-renouncing beliefs in many ways. They avoid involvement in social controversies,<ref>''What Does God Require?'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1996, page 13.</ref> remain politically neutral, and do not seek public office. The Watch Tower Society has stated that voting in political elections is a personal conscience decision,<ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 1999, p. 28, \"As to whether they will personally vote for someone running in an election, each one of Jehovah’s Witnesses makes a decision based on his Bible-trained conscience and an understanding of his responsibility to God and to the State.</ref> though a Witness who takes any action considered to be a \"violation of Christian neutrality\" may face religious sanctions.<ref>''Pay Attention to Yourselves and to All the Flock'', page 140.</ref> They refuse participation in ecumenical and interfaith activities,<ref>''Jehovah's Witnesses Proclaimers of God's Kingdom'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1993, page 188)</ref><ref>''Reasoning From the Scriptures'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1989, pages 269–270.</ref> abstain from celebrating religious holidays, and reject many customs they claim have pagan origins. They do not work in industries associated with the military, nor serve in the armed services,<ref>''Worship the Only True God'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2002, p. 159.</ref> and refuse national military service, which in some countries may result in their arrest and imprisonment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/region/asia_pacific/south_korea/english/releases/conscientious_obj/kor_e071004.pdf |title=Watch Tower Press Release, October 4, 2007 |access-date=August 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013182250/http://www.jw-media.org/region/asia_pacific/south_korea/english/releases/conscientious_obj/kor_e071004.pdf |archive-date=October 13, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They do not salute or pledge allegiance to national flags or sing national anthems or other patriotic songs.<ref>''Education'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 2002, pp. 20–23</ref>

Witnesses are urged to minimize their social contact with non-members, even if they possess \"decent qualities\",<ref>{{cite journal | last =Weddle | first = David L. |  title =A new \"generation\" of Jehovah's Witnesses: Revised interpretation, ritual and identity | journal =Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page =363 | publisher = University of California Press |  date = April 2000 | jstor = 10.1525/nr.2000.3.2.350 }}</ref><ref>\"Train With Godly Devotion as Your Aim\", Watchtower, August 15, 1985, page 19.</ref><ref>\"Have a Full Share in the Great Spiritual Harvest\", ''The Watchtower'', July 15, 2010, page 19, \"Do you avoid unnecessary fellowship with schoolmates and fellow workers who do not share your beliefs? ... Your faithful compliance in such matters will bring excellent results.\"</ref> because of perceived dangers of worldly association.<ref>''Survival Into a New Earth'', Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1984, page 168.</ref><ref>\"Each One Will Carry His Own Load\", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 2006, page 23.</ref> Sociologist Andrew Holden indicated they are highly selective in choosing with whom they spend leisure time, generally choosing the company of other Witnesses. Many Witnesses interviewed by Holden reported tensions and ostracism at work because of their religious beliefs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=109–112}}.</ref> He reported that many Jehovah's Witness converts required some social adjustment as they gradually reduced contact with non-Witness friends.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=69}}.</ref> Association with those outside the organization, commonly termed by Witnesses as \"worldly\" and \"not in the Truth\", is acceptable only when it is viewed as an opportunity to preach<ref name=\"Franz p409\">{{Harvnb|Franz|2007|p=409}}</ref><ref>\"Keep Clear of False Worship!\", ''The Watchtower'', March 15, 2006, page 30, \"Should we hold ourselves completely aloof from those who do not share our faith? The answer is no. The second of the two greatest commandments states: 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' We certainly display love for our neighbors when we share with them the good news of the Kingdom.\"</ref> and Witnesses are under considerable pressure from the Society to show outsiders they are people of high moral fiber. Holden claims that as a result, Witnesses working with \"worldly\" colleagues tend to closely adhere to Watch Tower teachings.<ref>{{Harvnb|Holden|2002|pp=123}}.</ref>

Sociologist Ronald Lawson has suggested that it is the group's intellectual and organizational isolation—coupled with the intense indoctrination of adherents, rigid internal discipline and considerable persecution—that has contributed to the consistency of its sense of urgency in its apocalyptic message.<ref>Ronald Lawson, \"Sect-state relations: Accounting for the differing trajectories of Seventh-Day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses\", ''Sociology of Religion'', Winter 1995, \"The urgency of the Witness's apocalyptic has changed very little over time. The intellectual isolation of the Witness leaders has allowed them to retain their traditional position, and it is they who continue to be the chief purveyors of the radical eschatology ....This commitment (to principle) was bolstered by their organizational isolation, intense indoctrination of adherents, rigid internal discipline, and considerable persecution.\"</ref>

==Celebrations==
Weddings, anniversaries, and funerals are observed, though they avoid incorporating certain traditions they see to have pagan origins.<ref>''The Watchtower'' 1/15/69 p. 58 Christian Weddings Should Reflect Reasonableness \"Of course, some customs are unscriptural and so they are objectionable to Christians. ... Other customs are plainly acts of false worship. So one planning a wedding does well to examine practices common in his area and analyze how people view them locally.\"</ref><ref>''The Watchtower'' 7/15/98 p. 24 A Christian View of Funeral Customs \"Funeral customs do not always conflict with Bible principles. When they do, Christians are determined to act in harmony with the Scriptures.\"</ref> ''The Watchtower'' has stated that the use of wedding rings by Witnesses is acceptable, even though wedding rings may have first been used by pagans, based on its conclusion that there is no definite evidence wedding rings were used \"as part of false ''religious'' practices\" (emphasis from original).<ref>''The Watchtower'' 1/15/72 p. 63 \"It is thus seen that the precise origin of the wedding ring is uncertain. Even if it were a fact that pagans first used wedding rings, would that rule such out for Christians? Not necessarily.\"</ref> Witnesses typically observe wedding anniversaries, with the Watch Tower Society noting that wedding anniversaries apparently do not stem from pagan origins.<ref>''The Watchtower'', December 1, 1971, p. 735.</ref>

Other common celebrations and religious or national holidays such as [[birthday]]s, [[Halloween]], [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]]<ref>\"Christmas Customs—Are They Christian\", ''The Watchtower'', December 15, 2000, page 3-7.</ref> are not celebrated because they believe that these continue to involve \"false religious beliefs or activities.\"<ref>''Awake!'' 7/8/04 p. 30 \"Christians refrain from any celebrations or customs that continue to involve false religious beliefs or activities that violate Bible principles. For example, the Bible definitely puts birthday celebrations in a bad light\"</ref><ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1998, p. 30.</ref> Watch Tower Society publications rule out the celebration of [[Mother's Day]] because of a claimed link with pagan gods<ref>“They Are No Part of the World”, ''Jehovah’s Witnesses – Proclaimers of God’s Kingdom'', page 199, \"Jehovah’s Witnesses have good times with their families and friends. But they do not participate in holidays and celebrations that are linked with pagan gods (as is true of such holidays as Easter, New Year’s Day, May Day, and Mother’s Day).\"</ref> and concerns that giving \"special honor and worship\" to mothers is a form of \"creature worship\" that could turn people away from God.<ref>[http://www.strictlygenteel.co.uk/vindication1/vindication1_2.html ''Vindication'', J. F. Rutherford, Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society, 1931, pages 158–159.]</ref> The Society also directs Witnesses to shun [[May Day]], [[New Year's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]] celebrations because of their pagan origins.<ref>\"What Is the Bible’s View? Are They Harmless Observances?\", ''Awake!'', February 8, 1974, Page 27.</ref>

Their opposition to birthdays is said to be based on how the Bible presents them. Watch Tower Society publications note that the only birthday celebrations explicitly mentioned in the Bible are those of an unnamed [[Pharaoh]] and [[Herod Antipas]], and that both were associated with executions, and neither celebrant was a servant of God.<ref>Questions From Readers, ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1998. pp. 30–31.</ref> Though some churches interpret Job 1:4 to indicate birthday feasts of Job's sons, Jehovah's Witnesses interpret them as a circuit of feasts from one house to the next.<ref>Job 1:4 reads \"And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.\" (King James version)</ref> The Bible does not show Jesus or his apostles celebrating birthdays and ''The Watchtower'' claims the absence of any record of the date of the birth of Jesus or his apostles indicates that \"God does not want us to celebrate any of these birthdays\".<ref>''The Watchtower'', November 15, 1960, p. 704.</ref>

==Construction==
International and regional building teams frequently undertake constructions of Kingdom Halls over the course of one or two weekends, termed \"quick-builds\". Larger construction projects, including building regional Assembly Halls and Bethel offices, factories, residences, warehouses, and farm facilities, are also performed almost entirely by volunteer members.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Humanitarian efforts==
Jehovah's Witnesses provide relief assistance in disaster-stricken areas for their members and others in the vicinity. Medicine and clothing were provided to both Hutu and Tutsi Witnesses during the 1994 [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref>\"Christianity in Action: Amid Turmoil\", ''The Watchtower'', January 15, 1998.</ref> Following [[Hurricane Katrina]], they helped rebuild houses of Witnesses and others.<ref>''Awake!'', June 2006, page 19, \"Heeding the Warnings Made a Difference\"</ref> The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses uses \"Regional Building Committees\" to oversee relief efforts worldwide.<ref>''Awake!'', June 2006, p.19.</ref>

==Funding of activities==
Jehovah's Witnesses fund their activities, such as publishing, constructing and operating facilities, evangelism, and disaster relief via donations. There is no [[tithe|tithing]] or collection, but on exceptional occasions, members are reminded to donate to the organization; Witnesses typically provide an opportunity for members of the public to make donations as they encounter them in their preaching work. Donation boxes labeled for several purposes are located in Kingdom Halls and other meeting facilities. Generally there are contribution boxes for local operating expenses, a Kingdom Hall fund for helping Witnesses around the world to build Kingdom Halls, and a general fund for the \"Worldwide Work\", which includes the printing of literature, organization of conventions, supporting missionaries and disaster relief, and other operating expenses of the organization.<ref>''Our Kingdom Ministry'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, December 2003, p. 7</ref><ref>“A New Program for Kingdom Hall Construction”, ''Our Kingdom Ministry'', Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, September 1983, p. 4-5.</ref>

The accounts (including donations) and the financial operation of the local congregation are reviewed monthly and posted on a congregation notice board. Donations are also accepted via mail, and the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society can be named as a beneficiary to an estate, and also accepts donations in the form of life insurance policies, pension plans, bank accounts, certificates of deposit, retirement accounts, stocks and bonds, real estate, annuities and trusts.<ref>\"Ways in Which Some Choose to Give Contributions to the Worldwide Work\", ''The Watchtower'', November 1, 2006, page 20</ref>

An '''apartment''' ([[American English]]), or '''flat''' ([[British English]], [[Indian English]]), is a self-contained [[housing unit]] (a type of residential [[real estate]]) that occupies only part of a building, generally on a single [[storey]]. There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).

==Terminology==
===\"Flat\" vs \"apartment\"===
Both words refer to a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In other places the terms are interchangeable.

The term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/apartment|title=Apartment {{!}} Meaning of Apartment by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term  ''apartment'' is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment).

In some countries, the word \"[[Unit (housing)|unit]]\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\".

Some buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.

===By housing tenure===
[[File:St James Town1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Low-income housing]] of the [[St. James Town]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]
[[File:Cove, Punggol Field.JPG|thumb|right|[[Housing Development Board]] flats in [[Punggol]], [[Singapore]] ]]

([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)

[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \"[[Messuage]] or Tenement\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.

In the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a [[housing cooperative]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a [[condominium]], whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.

In England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.<ref>{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>

===By size of the unit===
Bachelor apartment, one-[[bedroom]], etc.; see below.

===By size of the building===
[[File:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-rise building]]s in the [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]
[[File:Fatima 0549 (19531851070).jpg|thumb|left|A [[low-rise building]] of flats above shops in [[Fátima, Portugal]]]]

Apartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.

A [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].

A [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as \"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.<ref>http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf</ref>

===By country===
In [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or \"co-op\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.

In [[British English]] the usual word is \"flat\", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.

In India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts.<ref>[https://www.magicbricks.com/flats-in-new-delhi-for-sale-pppfs]</ref>

[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms \"unit\", \"flat\" and \"apartment\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \"apartments\", as the term \"flats\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.

In [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.

In [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,<ref>[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]</ref> while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.

In Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.

==Types and characteristics==
===Studio apartment===

{{Main|Studio apartment}}
{{See also|Microapartment}}
The smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term \"one room\" (''wonroom'') refers to a studio apartment.<ref>{{cite web | title='Konglish' Not Spoken Here: Asia Society Korea Center Targets Signs and Schoolbooks | website=Asia Society | date=11 October 2012  | url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/konglish-not-spoken-here-asia-society-korea-center-targets-signs-and-schoolbooks | accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>

A [[bedsit]] is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a [[House in multiple occupation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Private renting: Houses in multiple occupation - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>

===Garden apartment (US)===
[[Merriam-Webster]] defines a garden apartment in [[American English]] as \"a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Garden apartment |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden%20apartment |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first \"garden apartment\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 17 October 2009</ref><ref>Hogan, Meghan. [http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/story-of-the-week/2006/eden-in-the-city.html Eden in the City] ''Preservation Magazine'' online, 2006-09-22. Article on preservation of early United States garden apartment buildings.</ref> Some garden apartment buildings place a one-car garage under each apartment. The interior grounds are often landscaped.

===Garden flat (UK)===
[[File:Streets of Bayswater.jpg|thumb|[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraced [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]]. The black railings enclose the basement areas, which in the twentieth century were converted to garden flats.]]
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the use of \"garden flat\" in [[British English]] as \"a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn\", although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. \"Garden flat\" can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \"tradesman's entrance\" via the area stairs. This \"lower ground floor\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \"garden flat\". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].

===Basement apartment===
{{Main|Basement apartment}}
Generally on the lowest floor of a building.

===Secondary suite===
{{Main|Secondary suite}}
When part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an \"in-law apartment\", \"annexe\", or \"granny flat\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \"basement suites\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an \"accessory dwelling unit\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.

===Salon apartment===
''Salon apartment'' is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in [[Belgrade]] and in certain towns in [[Yugoslavia]] in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>Alfirević Đorđe, Simonović Alfirević Sanјa. [https://scindeks.ceon.rs/article.aspx?artid=0354-60551744007A „'Salon' apartment in Serbia between the two world wars: Reassessing the rationale behind the term”]. Arhitektura i urbanizam (Beograd), Iss. 44 (2017), pp. 7-13. ({{DOI|10.5937/a-u0-11638}})</ref> The structure of the apartments included centrally located [[anteroom]] with a combined function of the dining room and one or more salon areas. Most of these apartments were built in Belgrade ([[Serbia]]), along with the first examples of apartments popularly named 'salon apartments', with the concept of spatial and functional organization later spreading to other larger urban centers in Yugoslavia.<ref>Keković, A., Petrović, M. (2011) [http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0354-4605/2011/0354-46051103495K.pdf Functional zones of flats in the period of Art Moderne in Niš (1930-1941)]. Facta universitatis - series: Architecture and Civil Engineering, vol. 9, br. 3, str. 495-499</ref>

===Maisonette===
{{redirect|Maisonette|other uses|Maisonette (disambiguation)}}
Maisonette (a corruption of 'maisonnette', from the French word for \"little house\") has no strict definition, but the OED suggests \"a part of a residential building which is occupied separately, usually on more than one floor and having its own outside entrance.\" It differs from a flat in having, usually, more than one floor, with a staircase internal to the dwelling leading from the entrance floor to the upper (or, in some cases, lower) other floor. This is a very common arrangement in much post-War British public housing, serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed.

A maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]]. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat.<ref name=\"Housing in Gateshead\" >{{Cite web
  |title=Housing in Gateshead
  |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/display_boards.pdf
  |publisher=Gateshead Council
  |year=2006
}}</ref> \"Maisonette\" could also stretch to [[cottage flat]]s, also known as 'Four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland.

===One dwelling with two storeys===
[[File:ScissorFlat.jpg|thumb|Plan of scissor flats.]]
The vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence \"flat\". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is \"maisonette\", as above. Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.

Two storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \"[[townhouse]]s\".

===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===
[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]
[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]

\"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]\" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.

Duplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. The term duplex is largely unknown in the UK; there, buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as ''semi-detached'' or just ''a semi'' (the i pronounced \"ee\" not \"eye\"), but the dwellings are usually two storeys (excluding any use of the roof space). This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion.

In the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or \"raised cottage\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref> In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.

Groups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]]. Again, the term triplex is virtually unknown in the UK.

===Loft apartment===
[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]
{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}
This type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].

These loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

An industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.

===Penthouse===
{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}
An apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Communal apartment===
{{Main|Communal apartment}}
In [[Russia]], a communal apartment («коммуналка») is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}</ref>

===Serviced apartment===
[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]
{{Main|Serviced apartment}}
{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}
A \"serviced apartment\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \"lock-up and leave\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Facilities===
[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]
Apartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Laundry#Shared_laundry_rooms|Laundry facilities]] may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

On or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.

Moving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.)

Small apartments often have only one entrance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In many American cities, the [[One-plus-five]] style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the [[International Building Code]]; these buildings typically feature four wood-framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs.<ref name=\"Curbed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/12/4/18125536/real-estate-modern-apartment-architecture |title=Why do all new apartment buildings look the same? |author=Sissom, Patrick |work=Curbed |date=4 December 2018 |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>

In [[ancient Rome]], the [[insulae]] (singular ''insula'') were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (the [[plebs]]) dwelled. The floor at ground level was used for [[taberna]]s, shops and businesses, with living space on the higher floors.

===Ancient and medieval Egypt===
During the medieval [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic-Islamic period]], the Egyptian capital of [[Fustat]] ([[Old Cairo]]) housed many [[high-rise]] residential buildings, some seven stories tall that could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. In the 10th century, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] described them as resembling [[minaret]]s,<ref name=Behrens/> and stated that the majority of Fustat's population lived in these multi-storey apartment buildings, each one housing more than 200 people.<ref>{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/122 122]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/122}}</ref> In the 11th century, [[Nasir Khusraw]] described some of these apartment buildings rising up to fourteen stories, with [[roof garden]]s on the top storey complete with ox-drawn [[water wheel]]s for irrigating them.<ref name=Behrens>{{citation|title=Islamic Architecture in Cairo|first=Doris|last=Behrens-Abouseif|year=1992|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-04-09626-4|page=6}}</ref>

===Ancient China===
The [[Hakka people]] in southern [[China]] adopted communal living structures designed to be easily defensible, in the form of Weilongwu (围龙屋) and [[Tulou]] (土楼). The latter are large, enclosed and fortified earth buildings, between three and five stories high and housing up to eighty families.

==Current examples==
===England===
In London, by the time of the 2011 census, 52 per cent of all homes were flats.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Housing-in-London-2012_v4.pdf Housing in London - The evidence base for The London Housing strategy - December 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313035749/http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Housing-in-London-2012_v4.pdf |date=13 March 2013 }}</ref> Many of these were built as Georgian or Victorian houses and subsequently divided up. Many others were built as [[council flat]]s. Many [[Tower blocks in Great Britain|tower blocks]] were built after the [[Second World War]]. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \"flat above a shop\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house—even if this was a small [[terraced house]]—while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.

During the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a {{Lang|fr|[[pied-à-terre]]}} in the capital. The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.

The first mansion flats in England were:
*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Thomas Knowles (1831–1908)|James Knowles]] designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \"houses\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].
*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.

===Scotland===
[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]
[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]
In [[Scotland]], the term \"[[tenement]]\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.

During the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \"[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]\" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''—both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \"back green\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \"factor\".

In [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide \"homes fit for heroes\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].

After [[Second World War|World War II]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M. ''The Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow''. London: Penguin Books, 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-071069-8}}</ref><ref>[http://www.scotcities.com/cathcart/houses.htm Houses and Mansions: Domestic Architecture of Glasgow's South Side] 2008-06-03</ref> Again, economic considerations meant that many of the planned \"New Town\" amenities were never built in these areas. These housing estates, known as \"schemes\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] (\"deserts with windows\", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition—the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable—but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.

In 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \"stone cleaning\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \"grey\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]</ref> and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.<!-- <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> --> The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a £96 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.</ref>

===United States===
[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]

[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]

In 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:

<blockquote>Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. \"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.\" In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31–32|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Many campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.

[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.

Some significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).

In the United States, \"tenement\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \"walk-ups\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \"[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky façades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.

====Property classes====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
In the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:

''Class A'' properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.

''Class B'' properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.

''Class C'' properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \"for life\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.

''Class D'' properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.

===Canada===
Apartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments—both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>

===Australia===
[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]
[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]
[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[Hanging garden (cultivation)|hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]

Apartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or \"owners corporation\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4{{Spaces|fig=}}m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.

In Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.

Australia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].

The earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values–both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914—the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=25 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}</ref>

During the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).

Post-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.

The main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.

In other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].

In the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).

In Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York \"loft\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.

Despite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.

Today, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.

Some Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.

===Yugoslavia===
The development of residential architecture in [[Yugoslavia]] during the period of [[socialism]] had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \"pack\" as many [[residential]] units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.<ref>Lojanica, V., Ristić, J., Međo, V. (2011) [http://architecture.scientific-journal.com/articles/1/1.pdf Multi–family Housing Architecture in Belgrade: Models and Development], in Proceedings from the International Conference on Architecture and Design INTERCAD. Vienna: Technical University, pp. 5-13.</ref> As a consequence of these aspirations, the following concepts emerged, making the core of housing research: (a) apartments with an extended circulation area, (b) apartments with a central sanitary core, (c) apartments with a circular connection and (d) apartments with extended perspectives (\"an [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]”).<ref>Alfirević Đorđe, Simonović Alfirević Sanja.

({{DOI|10.2298/SPAT1840008A}})</ref>

These \"socialist\" ideas for the organization of living space had a firm base in theoretical research and underwent the phase of testing in architectural [[competition]]s, housing seminars and congresses, which made them spread over the whole territory of the country.<ref>Kulić, V.

The process of humanizing housing was not characteristic only in the Yugoslav context, similar ideas also appeared in other socialist countries of that period, as in the example of pre-fabricated housing construction in the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Khrushchyovka]]), [[Czechoslovakia]] ([[Panelák]]), [[Hungary]] ([[Panelház]]) and [[East Germany]] ([[Plattenbau]]).<ref>Jovanović J., Grbić J., Petrović, D.

An '''apartment''' ([[American English]]), or '''flat''' ([[British English]], [[Indian English]]), is a self-contained [[housing unit]] (a type of residential [[real estate]]) that occupies only part of a building, generally on a single [[storey]]. There are many names for these overall buildings, see below. The [[housing tenure]] of apartments also varies considerably, from large-scale [[public housing]], to [[owner occupancy]] within what is legally a [[condominium]] ([[strata title]] or [[commonhold]]), to tenants renting from a private landlord (see [[leasehold estate]]).

==Terminology==
===\"Flat\" vs \"apartment\"===
Both words refer to a self-contained residential unit with its own front door, kitchen, toilet, and [[bathroom]]. In some parts of the world, the word ''apartment'' refers to a purpose-built unit in a building, whereas the word ''flat'' means a converted unit in an older building, usually a big house.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In other places the terms are interchangeable.

The term ''apartment'' is favored in North America (although in some cities ''flat'' is used for a unit which is part of a house containing two or three units, typically one to a floor<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/apartment|title=Apartment {{!}} Meaning of Apartment by Lexico|website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English|language=en|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}). In the UK, the term  ''apartment'' is more usual in professional [[real estate]] and [[architectural]] circles where otherwise the term ''flat'' is used commonly, but not exclusively, for an apartment on a single level (hence a 'flat' apartment).

In some countries, the word \"[[Unit (housing)|unit]]\" is a more general term referring to both apartments and rental business [[Suite (address)|suite]]s. The word 'unit' is generally used only in the context of a specific building; e.g., \"This building has three units\" or \"I'm going to rent a unit in this building\", but not \"I'm going to rent a unit somewhere\".

Some buildings can be characterized as 'mixed-use buildings', meaning part of the building is for commercial, business, or office use, usually on the first floor or first couple of floors, and one or more apartments are found in the rest of the building, usually on the upper floors.

===By housing tenure===
[[File:St James Town1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Low-income housing]] of the [[St. James Town]] neighborhood in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]
[[File:Cove, Punggol Field.JPG|thumb|right|[[Housing Development Board]] flats in [[Punggol]], [[Singapore]] ]]

([[Condominium]], [[public housing]], [[owner-occupancy]], etc.)

[[Tenement (law)|Tenement law]] refers to the [[feudalism|feudal]] basis of permanent property such as land or rents. It may be found combined as in \"[[Messuage]] or Tenement\" to encompass all the land, buildings and other assets of a property.

In the United States, some apartment-dwellers own their units, either as a [[housing cooperative]], in which the residents own shares of a corporation that owns the building or development; or in a [[condominium]], whose residents own their apartments and share ownership of the public spaces. Most apartments are in buildings designed for the purpose, but large older [[house]]s are sometimes divided into apartments. The word ''apartment'' denotes a residential unit or section in a building. In some locations, particularly the United States, the word connotes a rental unit owned by the building owner, and is not typically used for a condominium.

In England and Wales, some flat owners own shares in the company that owns the [[Fee simple|freehold]] of the building as well as holding the flat under a lease.  This arrangement is commonly known as a \"share of freehold\" flat. The freehold company has the right to collect annual ground rents from each of the flat owners in the building. The freeholder can also develop or sell the building, subject to the usual planning and restrictions that might apply. This situation does not happen in Scotland, where long leasehold of residential property was formerly unusual, and is now impossible.<ref>{{cite web| title=Long Leases (Scotland) Act 2012| website=UK Legislation| date=2012| url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2012/9/contents/enacted | accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref>

===By size of the unit===
Bachelor apartment, one-[[bedroom]], etc.; see below.

===By size of the building===
[[File:English Bay Vancouver.jpg|thumb|right|[[High-rise building]]s in the [[English Bay (Vancouver)|English Bay]] area of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada]]
[[File:Fatima 0549 (19531851070).jpg|thumb|left|A [[low-rise building]] of flats above shops in [[Fátima, Portugal]]]]

Apartment buildings are [[multi-story]] buildings where three or more residences are contained within one structure. Such a building may be called an ''apartment building'', ''apartment complex'', ''flat complex'', ''block of flats'', ''tower block'', ''high-rise'' or, occasionally, ''mansion block'' (in British English), especially if it consists of many apartments for rent. A high-rise apartment building is commonly referred to as a ''residential tower'', ''apartment tower'', or ''block of flats'' in Australia.

A [[high-rise building]] is defined by its height differently in various [[jurisdiction]]s. It may be only residential, in which case it might also be called a tower block, or it might include other functions such as hotel, offices, or shops. There is no clear difference between a tower block and a [[skyscraper]], although a building with fifty or more stories is generally considered a skyscraper.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547956/skyscraper|title=skyscraper|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc|accessdate=19 September 2012}}</ref> High-rise buildings became possible with the invention of the [[elevator]] (lift) and cheaper, more abundant building materials. Their [[structural system]] usually is made of [[reinforced concrete]] and [[steel]].

A [[low-rise building]] and mid-rise buildings have fewer storeys, but the limits are not always clear. [[Emporis]] defines a low-rise as \"an enclosed structure below 35 metres [115 feet] which is divided into regular floor levels.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://standards.emporis.com/?nav=realestate&lng=3&esn=49213 |title=Data Standards: Structures - low-rise building |publisher=Emporis Standards |accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The city of [[Toronto]] defines a mid-rise as a building between 4 and 12 stories.<ref>http://faculty.geog.utoronto.ca/Hess/Courses/studio/presentation%20on%20avenues%20and%20mid-rise%20study.pdf</ref>

===By country===
In [[American English]], the distinction between rental apartments and [[condominium]]s is that while rental buildings are owned by a single entity and rented out to many, condominiums are owned individually, while their owners still pay a monthly or yearly fee for building upkeep. Condominiums are often leased by their owner as rental apartments. A third alternative, the [[Housing cooperative|cooperative apartment]] building (or \"co-op\"), acts as a corporation with all of the tenants as shareholders of the building. Tenants in cooperative buildings do not own their apartment, but instead own a proportional number of shares of the entire cooperative. As in condominiums, cooperators pay a monthly fee for building upkeep. Co-ops are common in cities such as New York, and have gained some popularity in other larger urban areas in the U.S.

In [[British English]] the usual word is \"flat\", but ''apartment'' is used by property developers to denote expensive 'flats' in exclusive and expensive residential areas in, for example, parts of London such as [[Belgravia]] and [[Hampstead]]. In Scotland, it is called a block of flats or, if it is a traditional sandstone building, a ''[[tenement]]'', a term which has a negative connotation elsewhere.

In India, the word flat is used to refer to multi-storey dwellings that have lifts.<ref>[https://www.magicbricks.com/flats-in-new-delhi-for-sale-pppfs]</ref>

[[Australian English]] and [[New Zealand English]] traditionally used the term ''flat'' (although it also applies to any rental property), and more recently also use the terms ''unit'' or ''apartment''. In Australia, a 'unit' refers to flats, apartments or even [[semi-detached]] houses. In Australia, the terms \"unit\", \"flat\" and \"apartment\" are largely used interchangeably. Newer high-rise buildings are more often marketed as \"apartments\", as the term \"flats\" carries colloquial connotations. The term condominium or condo is rarely used in Australia despite attempts by developers to market it.

In [[South African English]], an apartment is usually a single level rental area that is a part of a larger building and can be entered from inside the building through a separate door leading off either a wind tunnel or entrance hall/lobby that is shared with other occupants of the building.

In [[Malaysian English]], ''flat'' often denotes a housing block of two rooms with walk-up, no lift, without facilities, typically five storeys tall, and with outdoor parking space,<ref>[https://www.propsocial.my/topic/226/categories-of-homes-in-malaysia-posted-by-propsocial-editor?all=1 Categories of Homes in Malaysia.]</ref> while ''apartment'' is more generic and may also include luxury condominiums.

In Japanese English [[loanword]]s (''[[Wasei-eigo]]''), the term ''apartment'' (''apaato'') is used for lower-income housing and ''mansion'' (''manshon'') is used for high-end apartments; but both terms refer to what English-speakers regard as an apartment (or condominium) and not the level of luxury of a [[mansion]] in English parlance. See [[Housing in Japan]]. ''[[Danchi]]'' is the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for a large cluster of apartment buildings of a particular style and design, typically built as [[public housing]] by government authorities.

==Types and characteristics==
===Studio apartment===

{{Main|Studio apartment}}
{{See also|Microapartment}}
The smallest self-contained apartments are referred to as studio, efficiency or bachelor apartments in the US, or studio flat in the UK. These units usually consist of a large single main room which acts as the living room, dining room and bedroom combined and usually also includes kitchen facilities, with a separate bathroom. In Korea, the term \"one room\" (''wonroom'') refers to a studio apartment.<ref>{{cite web | title='Konglish' Not Spoken Here: Asia Society Korea Center Targets Signs and Schoolbooks | website=Asia Society | date=11 October 2012  | url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/konglish-not-spoken-here-asia-society-korea-center-targets-signs-and-schoolbooks | accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref>

A [[bedsit]] is a UK variant on single room accommodation: a bed-sitting room, probably without cooking facilities, with a shared bathroom. A bedsit is not self-contained and so is not an apartment or flat as this article uses the terms; it forms part of what the UK government calls a [[House in multiple occupation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Private renting: Houses in multiple occupation - GOV.UK|url=https://www.gov.uk/private-renting/houses-in-multiple-occupation|website=www.gov.uk|accessdate=16 April 2018|language=en}}</ref>

===Garden apartment (US)===
[[Merriam-Webster]] defines a garden apartment in [[American English]] as \"a multiple-unit low-rise dwelling having considerable lawn or garden space\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Garden apartment |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/garden%20apartment |website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref> The apartment buildings are often arranged around courtyards that are open at one end. Such a garden apartment shares some characteristics of a [[townhouse]]: each apartment has its own building entrance, or shares that entrance via a staircase and lobby that adjoins other units immediately above and/or below it. Unlike a townhouse, each apartment occupies only one level. Such garden apartment buildings are almost never more than three stories high, since they typically lack [[elevator]]s. However, the first \"garden apartment\" buildings in New York, USA, built in the early 1900s, were constructed five stories high.<ref>[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/garden_apartments/ New York City Garden Apartments] retrieved 17 October 2009</ref><ref>Hogan, Meghan. [http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/story-of-the-week/2006/eden-in-the-city.html Eden in the City] ''Preservation Magazine'' online, 2006-09-22. Article on preservation of early United States garden apartment buildings.</ref> Some garden apartment buildings place a one-car garage under each apartment. The interior grounds are often landscaped.

===Garden flat (UK)===
[[File:Streets of Bayswater.jpg|thumb|[[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraced [[townhouse (Great Britain)|townhouses]]. The black railings enclose the basement areas, which in the twentieth century were converted to garden flats.]]
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines the use of \"garden flat\" in [[British English]] as \"a basement or ground-floor flat with a view of and access to a garden or lawn\", although its citations acknowledge that the reference to a garden may be illusory. \"Garden flat\" can serve simply as a euphemism for a basement. The large [[townhouse (Great Britain)|Georgian or Victorian townhouse]] was built with an excavated subterranean space around its front known as [[Area (architecture)|an area]], often surrounded by cast iron railings. This lowest floor housed the kitchen, the main place of work for the servants, with a \"tradesman's entrance\" via the area stairs. This \"lower ground floor\" (another euphemism) has proven ideal for conversion to a self-contained \"garden flat\". One American term for this arrangement is an [[English basement]].

===Basement apartment===
{{Main|Basement apartment}}
Generally on the lowest floor of a building.

===Secondary suite===
{{Main|Secondary suite}}
When part of a house is converted for the ostensible use of the owner's family member, the self-contained dwelling may be known as an \"in-law apartment\", \"annexe\", or \"granny flat\", though these (sometimes illegally) created units are often occupied by ordinary renters rather than the landlord's relative. In Canada these are commonly located below the main house and are therefore \"basement suites\".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Another term is an \"accessory dwelling unit\", which may be part of the main house, or a free-standing structure in its grounds.

===Salon apartment===
''Salon apartment'' is a term linked to the exclusive apartments built as part of multi-family houses in [[Belgrade]] and in certain towns in [[Yugoslavia]] in the first decades of the 20th century.<ref>Alfirević Đorđe, Simonović Alfirević Sanјa. [https://scindeks.ceon.rs/article.aspx?artid=0354-60551744007A „'Salon' apartment in Serbia between the two world wars: Reassessing the rationale behind the term”]. Arhitektura i urbanizam (Beograd), Iss. 44 (2017), pp. 7-13. ({{DOI|10.5937/a-u0-11638}})</ref> The structure of the apartments included centrally located [[anteroom]] with a combined function of the dining room and one or more salon areas. Most of these apartments were built in Belgrade ([[Serbia]]), along with the first examples of apartments popularly named 'salon apartments', with the concept of spatial and functional organization later spreading to other larger urban centers in Yugoslavia.<ref>Keković, A., Petrović, M. (2011) [http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0354-4605/2011/0354-46051103495K.pdf Functional zones of flats in the period of Art Moderne in Niš (1930-1941)]. Facta universitatis - series: Architecture and Civil Engineering, vol. 9, br. 3, str. 495-499</ref>

===Maisonette===
{{redirect|Maisonette|other uses|Maisonette (disambiguation)}}
Maisonette (a corruption of 'maisonnette', from the French word for \"little house\") has no strict definition, but the OED suggests \"a part of a residential building which is occupied separately, usually on more than one floor and having its own outside entrance.\" It differs from a flat in having, usually, more than one floor, with a staircase internal to the dwelling leading from the entrance floor to the upper (or, in some cases, lower) other floor. This is a very common arrangement in much post-War British public housing, serving both to reduce costs by reducing the amount of space given to access corridors and to emulate the 'traditional' two-storey terrace house to which many of the residents would have been accustomed.

A maisonette could encompass [[Tyneside flat]]s, pairs of single-storey flats within a two-storey [[terraced house|terrace]]. Their distinctive feature is their use of two separate front doors onto the street, each door leading to a single flat.<ref name=\"Housing in Gateshead\" >{{Cite web
  |title=Housing in Gateshead
  |url=http://www.gateshead.gov.uk/DocumentLibrary/housing/Leaflets/display_boards.pdf
  |publisher=Gateshead Council
  |year=2006
}}</ref> \"Maisonette\" could also stretch to [[cottage flat]]s, also known as 'Four-in-a-block flats', a style of housing common in Scotland.

===One dwelling with two storeys===
[[File:ScissorFlat.jpg|thumb|Plan of scissor flats.]]
The vast majority of apartments are on one level, hence \"flat\". Some, however, have two storeys, joined internally by stairs, just as many houses do. One term for this is \"maisonette\", as above. Some [[public housing in the United Kingdom]] was designed as [[scissor section flat]]s. On a grander level, [[penthouse apartment|penthouses]] may have more than one storey, to emphasise the idea of space and luxury.

Two storey units in new construction are sometimes referred to as \"[[townhouse]]s\".

===Small buildings with a few one-storey dwellings===
[[File:CambridgeTripleDecker.jpg|thumb|A triple-decker in New England.]]
[[File:Dingbat MaryJane.jpg|thumb|left|Dingbat MaryJane]]

\"[[Duplex (building)|Duplex]]\" refers to two separate units with a [[party wall|common demising wall]] or floor-ceiling assembly.

Duplex description can be different depending on the part of the US, but generally has two to four dwellings with a door for each and usually two front doors close together but separate - referred to as '[[Duplex (building)|duplex]]' indicating the number of units, not the number of floors, as in some areas of the country they are often only one story. The term duplex is largely unknown in the UK; there, buildings containing two dwellings with a common vertical wall are known as ''semi-detached'' or just ''a semi'' (the i pronounced \"ee\" not \"eye\"), but the dwellings are usually two storeys (excluding any use of the roof space). This form of construction is very common, and built as such rather than a later conversion.

In the United States, regional forms have developed, see [[vernacular architecture]]. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], a [[Polish flat]] or \"raised cottage\" is an existing small house that has been lifted up to accommodate the creation of a basement floor housing a separate apartment, then set down again, thus becoming a modest pair of dwellings.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Sally |editor-last=McMurray |title=People, Power, Places|date=2000|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville|isbn=9781572330757|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref> In the [[Sun Belt]], boxy small apartment buildings called [[Dingbat (building)|dingbats]], often with [[carport]]s below, sprang up from the 1950s.

Groups of more than two units have corresponding names (Triplex, etc.).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Those buildings that have a third storey are known as triplexes. See [[Three-decker (house)]]. Again, the term triplex is virtually unknown in the UK.

===Loft apartment===
[[File:400SGreenLoft.jpg|thumb|The interior of a loft conversion in Chicago]]
{{Main|Loft#Loft_apartment}}
This type of apartment developed in North America during the middle of the 20th century. The term initially described a living space created within a former industrial building, usually 19th century. These large apartments found favor with artists and musicians wanting accommodation in large cities (New York for example) and is related to unused buildings in the decaying parts of such cities being occupied illegally by people [[squatting]].

These loft apartments were usually located in former highrise warehouses and factories left vacant after town planning rules and economic conditions in the mid 20th century changed. The resulting apartments created a new bohemian lifestyle and are arranged in a completely different way from most urban living spaces, often including workshops and art studio spaces. As the supply of old buildings of a suitable nature has dried up, developers have responded by constructing new buildings in the same aesthetic with varying degrees of success.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

An industrial, warehouse, or commercial space converted to an apartment is commonly called a ''[[loft]]'', although some modern lofts are built by design.

===Penthouse===
{{Main|Penthouse apartment}}
An apartment located on the top floor of a high-rise apartment building.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Communal apartment===
{{Main|Communal apartment}}
In [[Russia]], a communal apartment («коммуналка») is a room with a shared kitchen and bath. A typical arrangement is a cluster of five or so room-apartments with a common kitchen and bathroom and separate front doors, occupying a floor in a pre-Revolutionary mansion. Traditionally a room is owned by the government and assigned to a family on a semi-permanent basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naherholung gleich ums Eck|url=http://www.terrafinanz.de/brenner-park-sendling|publisher=terrafinanz.de|accessdate=17 June 2013|language=German}}</ref>

===Serviced apartment===
[[File:PAJASA Service Apartment Mumbai.jpg|thumb|Serviced apartment, Mumbai, India]]
{{Main|Serviced apartment}}
{{See also|Apartment hotel|Corporate housing}}
A \"serviced apartment\" is any size space for residential living which includes regular maid and cleaning services provided by the rental agent. Serviced apartments or serviced flats developed in the early part of the 20th century and were briefly fashionable in the 1920s and 30s. They are intended to combine the best features of luxury and self-contained apartments, often being an adjunct of a [[hotel]]. Like guests semi-permanently installed in a luxury hotel, residents could enjoy the additional facilities such as house keeping, laundry, catering and other services if and when desired.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

A feature of these apartment blocks was quite glamorous interiors with lavish bathrooms but no kitchen or laundry spaces in each flat. This style of living became very fashionable as many upper-class people found they could not afford as many live-in staff after the First World War and revelled in a \"lock-up and leave\" life style that serviced apartment hotels supplied. Some buildings have been subsequently renovated with standard facilities in each apartment, but serviced apartment hotel complexes continue to be constructed. Recently a number of hotels have supplemented their traditional business model with serviced apartment wings, creating privately owned areas within their buildings - either [[freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[leasehold]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Facilities===
[[File:Laundry Room.jpg|thumb|Laundry Room]]
Apartments may be available for rent furnished, with furniture, or unfurnished into which a tenant moves in with their own furniture. [[Serviced apartment]]s, intended to be convenient for shorter stays, include soft furnishings and [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen utensils]], and [[maid service]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Laundry#Shared_laundry_rooms|Laundry facilities]] may reside in a common area accessible to all building tenants, or each apartment may have its own facilities. Depending on when the building was built and its design, utilities such as water, heating, and electricity may be common for all of the apartments, or separate for each apartment and billed separately to each tenant. (Many areas in the US have ruled it illegal to split a water bill among all the tenants, especially if a pool is on the premises.) Outlets for connection to telephones are typically included in apartments. Telephone service is optional and is almost always billed separately from the rent payments. Cable television and similar amenities also cost extra. Parking space(s), air conditioning, and extra storage space may or may not be included with an apartment. Rental [[Rental agreement|lease]]s often limit the maximum number of residents in each apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

On or around the ground floor of the apartment building, a series of [[Letter box|mailbox]]es are typically kept in a location accessible to the public and, thus, to the [[mail carrier]]. Every unit typically gets its own mailbox with individual keys to it. Some very large apartment buildings with a full-time staff may take mail from the carrier and provide mail-sorting service. Near the mailboxes or some other location accessible by outsiders, a buzzer (equivalent to a doorbell) may be available for each individual unit. In smaller apartment buildings such as two- or three-flats, or even four-flats, rubbish is often disposed of in trash containers similar to those used at houses. In larger buildings, rubbish is often collected in a common trash bin or dumpster. For cleanliness or minimizing noise, many lessors will place restrictions on tenants regarding smoking or keeping pets in an apartment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In more urban areas, apartments close to the [[downtown]] area have the benefits of proximity to jobs and/or [[public transportation]]. However, prices per square foot are often much higher than in suburban areas.

Moving up from studio flats are one-bedroom apartments, in which a bedroom is separate from the rest of the apartment, followed by two-bedroom, three-bedroom, etc. apartments. (Apartments with more than three bedrooms are rare.)

Small apartments often have only one entrance.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Large apartments often have two entrances, perhaps a door in the front and another in the back, or from an underground or otherwise attached parking structure. Depending on the building design, the entrance doors may be connected directly to the outside or to a common area inside, such as a hallway or a lobby.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In many American cities, the [[One-plus-five]] style of mid-rise, wood-framed apartments have gained significant popularity following a 2009 revision to the [[International Building Code]]; these buildings typically feature four wood-framed floors above a concrete podium and are popular with developers due to their high density and relatively lower construction costs.<ref name=\"Curbed\">{{cite web |url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/12/4/18125536/real-estate-modern-apartment-architecture |title=Why do all new apartment buildings look the same? |author=Sissom, Patrick |work=Curbed |date=4 December 2018 |accessdate=23 February 2019}}</ref>

The [[Puebloan peoples]] of what is now the Southwestern United States have constructed large, multi-room dwellings, some comprising more than 900 rooms, since the 10th century.

===Ancient Rome===
[[File:OstianInsula.JPG|thumb|Remains of an Ancient Roman apartment block from the early 2nd century AD in [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]]]]
In [[ancient Rome]], the [[insulae]] (singular ''insula'') were large apartment buildings where the lower and middle classes of [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] (the [[plebs]]) dwelled. The floor at ground level was used for [[taberna]]s, shops and businesses, with living space on the higher floors.

===Ancient and medieval Egypt===
During the medieval [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic-Islamic period]], the Egyptian capital of [[Fustat]] ([[Old Cairo]]) housed many [[high-rise]] residential buildings, some seven stories tall that could reportedly accommodate hundreds of people. In the 10th century, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] described them as resembling [[minaret]]s,<ref name=Behrens/> and stated that the majority of Fustat's population lived in these multi-storey apartment buildings, each one housing more than 200 people.<ref>{{citation|title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World|first=James E.|last=Lindsay|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|year=2005|isbn=0-313-32270-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/122 122]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/dailylifeinmedie00lind/page/122}}</ref> In the 11th century, [[Nasir Khusraw]] described some of these apartment buildings rising up to fourteen stories, with [[roof garden]]s on the top storey complete with ox-drawn [[water wheel]]s for irrigating them.<ref name=Behrens>{{citation|title=Islamic Architecture in Cairo|first=Doris|last=Behrens-Abouseif|year=1992|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=90-04-09626-4|page=6}}</ref>

By the 16th century, the current [[Cairo]] also had high-rise apartment buildings, where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were [[Renting|rented]] out to [[Leasehold estate|tenants]].<ref>{{citation|title=Traditional Islamic principles of built environment|first=Hisham|last=Mortada|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2003|isbn=0-7007-1700-5|page=viii}}</ref>

===Ancient China===
The [[Hakka people]] in southern [[China]] adopted communal living structures designed to be easily defensible, in the form of Weilongwu (围龙屋) and [[Tulou]] (土楼). The latter are large, enclosed and fortified earth buildings, between three and five stories high and housing up to eighty families.

==Current examples==
===England===
In London, by the time of the 2011 census, 52 per cent of all homes were flats.<ref>[http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Housing-in-London-2012_v4.pdf Housing in London - The evidence base for The London Housing strategy - December 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313035749/http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Housing-in-London-2012_v4.pdf |date=13 March 2013 }}</ref> Many of these were built as Georgian or Victorian houses and subsequently divided up. Many others were built as [[council flat]]s. Many [[Tower blocks in Great Britain|tower blocks]] were built after the [[Second World War]]. A number of these have been demolished and replaced with low-rise buildings or [[housing estate]]s.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the concept of the flat was slow to catch on amongst the British middle classes, which generally followed the north European standard of single-family houses dating far back into history. Those who lived in flats were assumed to be lower class and somewhat itinerant, renting for example a \"flat above a shop\" as part of a lease agreement for a tradesman. In London and most of Britain, everyone who could afford to do so occupied an entire house—even if this was a small [[terraced house]]—while the working poor continued to rent rooms in often overcrowded properties, with one (or more) families per room.

During the last quarter of the 19th century, as wealth increased, ideas began to change. Both urban growth and the increase in population meant that more imaginative housing concepts would be needed if the middle and upper classes were to maintain a {{Lang|fr|[[pied-à-terre]]}} in the capital. The traditional [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|London town house]] was becoming increasingly expensive to maintain. For bachelors and unmarried women in particular, the idea of renting a modern mansion flat became increasingly popular.

The first mansion flats in England were:
*Albert Mansions, which Philip Flower constructed and [[James Thomas Knowles (1831–1908)|James Knowles]] designed. These flats were constructed between 1867 and 1870, and were one of the earliest blocks of flats to fill the vacant spaces of the newly-laid out [[Victoria Street, London|Victoria Street]] at the end of the 1860s. Today, only a sliver of the building remains, next to the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]]. Albert Mansions was really 19 separate \"houses\", each with a staircase serving one flat per floor. Its tenants included [[Sir Arthur Sullivan]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Lord Alfred Tennyson]], whose connections with the developer's family were long-standing. Philip Flower's son, [[Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea|1st Baron Cyril Flower Battersea]], developed most of the mansion blocks on [[Prince of Wales Drive, London]].
*Albert Hall Mansions, designed by [[Richard Norman Shaw]] in 1876. Because this was a new type of housing, Shaw reduced risks as much as possible; each block was planned as a separate project, with the building of each part contingent on the successful occupation of every flat in the previous block. The gamble paid off and was a success.

===Scotland===
[[File:Victorian tenement at Boroughmuirhead, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|[[Tenement]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] (1893)]]
[[File:Tenementedin.jpg|thumb|right|Tenement in Marchmont, Edinburgh, built in 1882]]
In [[Scotland]], the term \"[[tenement]]\" lacks the pejorative connotations it carries elsewhere and refers simply to any block of flats sharing a common central staircase and lacking an elevator, particularly those constructed before 1919. Tenements were, and continue to be, inhabited by a wide range of social classes and income groups. Tenements today are bought by a wide range of social types, including young professionals, older [[retirees]], and by [[absentee landlords]], often for rental to students after they leave [[dorm|halls of residence]] managed by their institution. The [[National Trust for Scotland]] [[Tenement House (Glasgow)]] is a [[historic house museum]] offering an insight into the lifestyle of tenement dwellers, as it was generations ago.

During the 19th century tenements became the predominant type of new housing in [[Scotland]]'s industrial cities, although they were very common in the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]] in Edinburgh from the 15th century, where they reached ten or eleven storeys and in one case fourteen storeys. Built of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], Scottish tenements are usually three to five storeys in height, with two to four flats on each floor. (In contrast, industrial cities in England tended to favour \"[[Back-to-back houses|back-to-back]]\" [[terraced house|terrace]]s of [[brick]].) Scottish tenements are constructed in terraces, and each entrance within a block is referred to as a ''close'' or ''stair''—both referring to the shared passageway to the individual flats. Flights of stairs and landings are generally designated common areas, and residents traditionally took turns to sweep clean the floors and, in [[Aberdeen]] in particular, took turns to make use of shared laundry facilities in the \"back green\" (garden or yard). It is now more common for cleaning of the common ways to be contracted out through a managing agent or \"factor\".

In [[Glasgow]], where Scotland's highest concentration of tenement dwellings can be found, the urban renewal projects of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s brought an end to the city's slums, which had primarily consisted of older tenements built in the early 19th century in which large [[extended families]] would live together in cramped conditions. They were replaced by high-rise blocks that, within a couple of decades, became notorious for crime and poverty. The [[Glasgow Corporation]] made many efforts to improve the situation, most successfully with the City Improvement Trust, which cleared the slums of the old town, replacing them with what they thought of as a traditional high street, which remains an imposing townscape. (The City Halls and the [[Cleland Testimonial]] were part of this scheme.) National government help was given following [[World War I]] when Housing Acts sought to provide \"homes fit for heroes\". Garden suburb areas, based on English models, such as [[Knightswood]], were set up. These proved too expensive, so a modern tenement, three stories high, slate roofed and built of reconstituted stone, was re-introduced and a [[slum clearance]] programme initiated to clear areas such as the [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] and the [[Garngad]].

After [[Second World War|World War II]], more ambitious plans, known as the [[Bruce Plan]], were made for the complete evacuation of slums for modern mid-rise housing developments on the outskirts of the city. However, the central government refused to fund the plans, preferring instead to depopulate the city to a series of [[New towns in the United Kingdom|New Towns.]]<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Williamson, E., Riches, A. & Higgs, M. ''The Buildings of Scotland: Glasgow''. London: Penguin Books, 1990 {{ISBN|0-14-071069-8}}</ref><ref>[http://www.scotcities.com/cathcart/houses.htm Houses and Mansions: Domestic Architecture of Glasgow's South Side] 2008-06-03</ref> Again, economic considerations meant that many of the planned \"New Town\" amenities were never built in these areas. These housing estates, known as \"schemes\", came therefore to be widely regarded as unsuccessful; many, such as [[Castlemilk]], were just dormitories well away from the centre of the city with no amenities, such as shops and [[public houses]] (\"deserts with windows\", as [[Billy Connolly]] once put it). High-rise living too started off with bright ambition—the Moss Heights, built in the 1950s, are still desirable—but fell prey to later economic pressure. Many of the later tower blocks were poorly designed and cheaply built and their anonymity caused some social problems. The demolition of the tower blocks in order to build modern housing schemes has in some cases led to a re-interpretations of the tenement.

In 1970 a team from [[Strathclyde University]] demonstrated that the old tenements had been basically sound, and could be given new life with replumbing providing modern kitchens and bathrooms.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> The Corporation acted on this principle for the first time in 1973 at the ''Old Swan Corner'', [[Pollokshaws]]. Thereafter, ''Housing Action Areas'' were set up to renovate so-called slums. Later, privately owned tenements benefited from government help in \"stone cleaning\", revealing a honey-coloured sandstone behind the presumed \"grey\" tenemental facades. The policy of tenement demolition is now considered to have been short-sighted, wasteful and largely unsuccessful. Many of Glasgow's worst tenements were refurbished into desirable accommodation in the 1970s and 1980s<ref>[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/springburn/spring066.htm Glasgow Digital Library: Demolition of tenements in Gourlay Street, 1975]</ref> and the policy of demolition is considered to have destroyed fine examples of a \"universally admired architectural\" style.<!-- <ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> --> The [[Glasgow Housing Association]] took ownership of the public housing stock from the city council on 7 March 2003, and has begun a £96 million clearance and demolition programme to clear and demolish many of the high-rise flats.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090105180936/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/News/Archives/2006/May/housingrevolutionannounced.htm Glasgow announces a revolution in house-building] Wednesday 31 May 2006.</ref>

===United States===
[[File:NewtonMA TheChestnutHill.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Chestnut Hill]], an 1899 apartment house in [[Newton, Massachusetts]]]]

[[File:LowerEastSideTenements.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tenement]] buildings in [[Manhattan]]'s Lower East Side]]

In 1839, the first New York City [[tenement]] was built, and soon became breeding grounds for [[outlaw]]s, [[juvenile delinquent]]s, and [[organized crime]]. Tenements, or their slum landlords, were also known for their [[price gouging]] rent. ''How the Other Half Lives'' notes one tenement district:

<blockquote>Blind Man's Alley bear its name for a reason. Until little more than a year ago its dark burrows harbored a colony of blind beggars, tenants of a blind landlord, old Daniel Murphy, whom every child in the ward knows, if he never heard of the President of the United States. \"Old Dan\" made a big fortune--he told me once four hundred thousand dollars-- out of his alley and the surrounding tenements, only to grow blind himself in extreme old age, sharing in the end the chief hardship of the wretched beings whose lot he had stubbornly refused to better that he might increase his wealth. Even when the [[Metropolitan Board of Health|Board of Health]] at last compelled him to repair and clean up the worst of the old buildings, under threat of driving out the tenants and locking the doors behind them, the work was accomplished against the old man's angry protests. He appeared in person before the Board to argue his case, and his argument was characteristic. \"I have made my will,\" he said. \"My monument stands waiting for me in Calvary. I stand on the very brink of the grave, blind and helpless, and now (here the pathos of the appeal was swept under in a burst of angry indignation) do you want me to build and get skinned, skinned? These people are not fit to live in a nice house. Let them go where they can, and let my house stand.\" In spite of the genuine anguish of the appeal, it was downright amusing to find that his anger was provoked less by the anticipated waste of luxury on his tenants than by distrust of his own kind, the builder. He knew intuitively what to expect. The result showed that Mr. Murphy had gauged his tenants correctly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Riis|first1=Jacob A.|title=How the other half lives : studies among the tenements of New York|date=1890|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|isbn=9111562986| pages=31–32|edition=1st|url=https://archive.org/stream/howotherhalflive00riis_1|accessdate=2 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

Many campaigners, such as [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[Jacob Riis]], pushed for reforms in tenement dwellings. As a result, the [[New York State Tenement House Act]] was passed in 1901 to improve the conditions. More improvements followed. In 1949, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed the [[Housing Act of 1949]] to clean slums and reconstruct housing units for the poor.

[[The Dakota]] (1884) was one of the first luxury apartment buildings in New York City. The majority, however, remained tenements.

Some significant developments in architectural design of apartment buildings came out of the 1950s and '60s.  Among them were groundbreaking designs in the [[860-880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments]] (1951), [[New Century Guild]] (1961), [[Marina City]] (1964) and [[Lake Point Tower]] (1968).

In the United States, \"tenement\" is a label usually applied to the less expensive, more basic rental apartment buildings in older sections of large cities. Many of these apartment buildings are \"walk-ups\" without an elevator, and some have shared bathing facilities, though this is becoming less common. The slang term \"[[Dingbat (building)|dingbat]]\" is used to describe cheap urban apartment buildings from the 1950s and 1960s with unique and often wacky façades to differentiate themselves within a full block of apartments. They are often built on stilts, and with parking underneath.

====Property classes====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}
In the United States, properties are typically in one of four property classes, denoted by a letter grade. These grades are used to help [[investor]]s and [[real estate brokers]] speak a common language so they can understand a property's characteristics and condition quickly. They are as follows:

''Class A'' properties are luxury units. They are usually less than 10 years old and are often new, upscale apartment buildings. Average rents are high, and they are generally in desirable geographic areas. [[White-collar worker]]s live in them and are usually renters by choice.

''Class B'' properties can be 10 to 25 years old. They are generally well maintained and have a middle class tenant base of both white- and blue-collar workers. Some are renters by choice, and others by necessity.

''Class C'' properties were built within the last 30 to 40 years. They generally have blue-collar and low- to moderate-income tenants, and the rents are below market. Many tenants are renters \"for life\". On the other hand, some of their tenants are just starting out and are likely to work their way up the rental scale as their income rises.

''Class D'' properties house many [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] (government-subsidized) tenants. They are generally located in lower socioeconomic areas.

===Canada===
Apartments were popular in Canada, particularly in urban centres like Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, and Hamilton in the 1950s to 1970s. By the 1980s, many multi-unit buildings were being constructed as [[condominium]]s instead of apartments—both are now very common. In Toronto and Vancouver, high-rise apartments and condominiums have been spread around the city, giving even the major suburbs a skyline. The robustness of the condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver are based on the lack of land availability.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wang |first=Sissi |url=http://www.canadianbusiness.com/economy/the-latest-threat-to-the-condo-market-apartment-buildings-rise-again/ |title=The latest threat to the condo market: apartment buildings rise again |work=Canadian Business |date=8 July 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref> The average capitalization rate in the Greater Toronto Area for Q3 2015 hit its lowest level in 30 years: in Q3 2015 it stood at 3.75 per cent, down from 4.2 per cent in Q2 2015 and down almost 50 per cent from the 6.3 per cent posted in Q3 2010.<ref>{{cite web |last=DiGianfelice |first=Lorenzo |url=https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/gta-cap-rate-hits-new-benchmark-low/ |title=GTA cap rate hits new benchmark low |work=Canadian Apartment Magazine |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=17 October 2015}}</ref>

===Australia===
[[File:Q1 Q Deck day.JPG|thumb|The skyline of the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Queensland]] is dominated by apartments.]]
[[File:Canterbury flats st kilda.jpg|thumb|right|The Canterbury in [[St Kilda, Victoria]] is one of the earliest surviving apartment buildings in Australia.]]
[[File:(1)One Central Park.jpg|thumb|[[One Central Park]], Sydney, which features vertical [[Hanging garden (cultivation)|hanging gardens]] and sustainable [[green design]]]]

Apartment buildings in Australia are typically managed by a [[body corporate]] or \"owners corporation\" in which owners pay a monthly fee to provide for common maintenance and help cover future repair. Many apartments are owned through [[strata title]]. Due to legislation, Australian banks will either apply [[loan to value]] ratios of over 70 per cent for strata titles of less than 50 square metres, the [[Big four banks|big four Australian banks]] will not loan at all for strata titles of less than 30 square metres. These are usually classified as studio apartments or student accommodation. Australian legislation enforces a minimum 2.4{{Spaces|fig=}}m floor-ceiling height which differentiates apartment buildings from office buildings.

In Australia, apartment living is a popular lifestyle choice for [[DINKY]], [[yuppie]]s, [[university student]]s and more recently [[empty nester]]s, however, rising land values in the big cities in recent years has seen an increase in families living in apartments. In [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] apartment living is sometimes not a matter of choice for the many socially disadvantaged people who often end up in public housing towers.

Australia has a relatively recent history in apartment buildings. [[Terrace houses]] were the early response to density development, though the majority of Australians lived in fully detached houses. Apartments of any kind were legislated against in the [[Parliament of Queensland]] as part of the [[Undue Subdivision of Land Prevention Act 1885]].

The earliest apartment buildings were in the major cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]] as the response to fast rising land values–both cities are home to the two oldest surviving apartment buildings in the country, Kingsclere in [[Potts Point]], and The Canterbury Flats in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. [[Melbourne Mansions]] on [[Collins Street, Melbourne]] (now demolished), built in 1906 for mostly wealthy residents is believed by many to be the earliest. Today the oldest surviving self-contained apartment buildings are in the [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] area including the Fawkner Mansions (1910), Majestic Mansions (1912 as a boarding house) and the Canterbury (1914—the oldest surviving buildings contained flats).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peterson |first=Richard |url=http://www.skhs.org.au/SKHSbuildings/pdf%20files/21.pdf |title=The Canterbury (Flats) - 236 Canterbury Road, St Kilda West |work=A Place of Sensuous Resort: Buildings of St Kilda and Their People |publisher=St Kilda Historical Society |date=2005 |access-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Kingsclere, built in 1912 is believed to be the earliest apartment building in Sydney and still survives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |title=High Rise has a past too |publisher=Heritage.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=25 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020628220428/http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/heritagensw/win00/8_art.htm |archive-date=28 June 2002 }}</ref>

During the interwar years, apartment building continued in inner Melbourne (particularly in areas such as St Kilda and [[South Yarra]]), Sydney (particularly in areas such as [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]], [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghust]] and [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]]) and in Brisbane (in areas such as [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]], [[Fortitude Valley, Queensland|Fortitude Valley]] and [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]]).

Post-[[World War II]], with the [[Australian Dream]] apartment buildings went out of vogue and flats were seen as accommodation only for the poor. Walk-up flats (without a lift) of two to three storeys however were common in the middle suburbs of cities for lower income groups.

The main exceptions were Sydney and the [[Gold Coast, Queensland]] where apartment development continued for more than half a century. In Sydney a limited geography and highly sought after waterfront views ([[Sydney Harbour]] and beaches such as [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi]]) made apartment living socially acceptable. While on the Gold Coast views of the ocean, proximity to the beach and a large tourist population made apartments a popular choice. Since the 1960s, these cities maintained much higher population densities than the rest of Australia through the acceptance of apartment buildings.

In other cities, apartment building was almost solely restricted to [[public housing]]. [[Public housing in Australia]] was common in the larger cities, particularly in Melbourne (by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]]) where a huge number of hi-rise housing commission flats were built between the 1950s and 1970s by successive governments as part of an urban renewal program. Areas affected included [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]], [[Flemington, Victoria|Flemington]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]], [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]] and [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran]]. Similar projects were run in Sydney's lower socio-economic areas like [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].

In the 1980s, modern apartment buildings sprang up in riverside locations in [[Brisbane]] (along the [[Brisbane River]]) and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (along the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]]).

In Melbourne, in the 1990s, a trend began for apartment buildings without the requirement of spectacular views. As a continuation of the [[gentrification]] of the inner city, a fashion became New York \"loft\" style apartments (see above) and a large stock of old warehouses and old abandoned office buildings in and around the central business district became the target of developers. The trend of [[adaptive reuse]] extended to conversion of old churches and schools. Similar warehouse conversions and gentrification began in Brisbane suburbs such as [[Teneriffe, Queensland]] and Fortitude Valley and in Sydney in areas such as [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]]. As supply of buildings for conversion ran out, reproduction and post modern style apartments followed. The popularity of these apartments also stimulated a boom in the construction of new hi-rise apartment buildings in inner cities. This was particularly the case in Melbourne which was fuelled by official planning policies ([[Postcode 3000]]), making the CBD the fastest growing, population wise in the country. Apartment building in the Melbourne metropolitan area has also escalated with the advent of the [[Melbourne 2030]] planning policy. [[Urban renewal]] areas like [[Melbourne Docklands|Docklands]], [[Southbank, Victoria|Southbank]], [[St Kilda Road]] and [[Port Melbourne]] are now predominantly apartments. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of student apartment buildings in areas such as Carlton in Melbourne.

Despite their size, other smaller cities including [[Canberra]], [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Townsville]], [[Cairns]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Geelong]] have begun building apartments in the 2000s.

Today, residential buildings [[Eureka Tower]] and [[Q1 (building)|Q1]] are the tallest in the country. In many cases, apartments in [[inner city]] areas of the major cities can cost much more than much larger houses in the outer suburbs.

Some Australian cities, such as [[Gold Coast, Queensland]], are inhabited predominantly by apartment dwellers.

===Yugoslavia===
The development of residential architecture in [[Yugoslavia]] during the period of [[socialism]] had its peak in the 1960s and 1970s. Significant progress in construction was accompanied by housing research directed towards finding the optimal urbanistic solutions for the newly formed lifestyle of the socialist society. The tendency was to \"pack\" as many [[residential]] units as possible into each building, almost up to the limits of the functional minimum, at the same time with the aim of setting a more humane pattern of living.<ref>Lojanica, V., Ristić, J., Međo, V. (2011) [http://architecture.scientific-journal.com/articles/1/1.pdf Multi–family Housing Architecture in Belgrade: Models and Development], in Proceedings from the International Conference on Architecture and Design INTERCAD. Vienna: Technical University, pp. 5-13.</ref> As a consequence of these aspirations, the following concepts emerged, making the core of housing research: (a) apartments with an extended circulation area, (b) apartments with a central sanitary core, (c) apartments with a circular connection and (d) apartments with extended perspectives (\"an [[Enfilade (architecture)|enfilade]]”).<ref>Alfirević Đorđe, Simonović Alfirević Sanja. [http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/1450-569X/2018/1450-569X1840008A.pdf „’Socialist Apartment’ in Yugoslavia: Paradigm or Tendency?”]. Spatium (Belgrade), No. 40 (2018), pp. 8-17. ({{DOI|10.2298/SPAT1840008A}})</ref>

These \"socialist\" ideas for the organization of living space had a firm base in theoretical research and underwent the phase of testing in architectural [[competition]]s, housing seminars and congresses, which made them spread over the whole territory of the country.<ref>Kulić, V.

The process of humanizing housing was not characteristic only in the Yugoslav context, similar ideas also appeared in other socialist countries of that period, as in the example of pre-fabricated housing construction in the [[Soviet Union]] ([[Khrushchyovka]]), [[Czechoslovakia]] ([[Panelák]]), [[Hungary]] ([[Panelház]]) and [[East Germany]] ([[Plattenbau]]).<ref>Jovanović J., Grbić J., Petrović, D.

'''Sinicization''', '''sinicisation''', '''sinofication''', or '''sinification''', or '''sinonization''' is a process whereby non-Chinese societies come under the influence of [[Chinese culture]], particularly [[Han Chinese]] culture, language, societal norms, and ethnic identity. Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language, law, lifestyle, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, culture, and value systems. More broadly, \"Sinicization\" may refer to policies of [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or [[cultural imperialism]] imposed by [[China]] onto neighboring [[East Asia|East Asian countries]], and [[Ethnic minorities in China|minority ethnic groups]] inside China.  Evidence of this can be seen in the value systems, cuisine, [[Chinese architecture|architectural style]], and lexicons. This is reflected in the histories of [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] for example, in the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adoption of the Chinese writing system]] as [[Written Chinese|the script]] of the Han Chinese has long been a unifying feature in the [[Sinosphere]] as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to these Asian countries.

==Integration==
The integration or assimilation policy is a type of [[nationalism]] aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among the population. Proponents believe integration will help to develop shared values, pride in being the country’s citizen, respect and acceptance towards cultural differences among citizens of China. Critics argue that integration destroys [[ethnic diversity]], [[language diversity]], and [[cultural diversity]]. Analogous to [[North America]] with approximately 300 [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] and distinct ethnic groups; in China there are 292 non-Mandarin [[Languages of China|languages]] spoken by native peoples of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CN|title=China|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Ethnologue]]|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> There are also a number of [[Immigration to China|immigrant]] languages, such as [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]], etc.

==Historical examples of sinicization==
===Austronesian peoples===
Before sinicization, non-Chinese indigenous peoples of [[South China|Southern China]], collectively termed by the Chinese as [[Baiyue]] inhabited the coastline of China from as far north as the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] to as far south as the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].  Analysis of DNA recovered from human remains shows high frequencies of [[Haplogroup O1]] in [[Liangzhu culture]] linking this culture to modern Austronesian populations. It is believed that Liangzhu culture was the ancestral homeland of Proto-Austronesian populations before they [[Austronesian hypothesis|spread to Taiwan]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. Over time, the southward spread of Han Chinese led to the sinicization of most of the Baiyue populations that remained in Southern China, whether in the [[Yangtze River valley|Yangtze Valley]] or in coastal areas from the mouth of the Yangtze to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Prehistoric Settlement of the Pacific, Volume 86, Part 5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XiELAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA137&dq=in+the+southward+spread+of+Han+Chinese+led+to+the+sinicization+of+all+AN-speakers#v=onepage&q=in%20the%20southward%20spread%20of%20Han%20Chinese%20led%20to%20the%20sinicization%20of%20all%20AN-speakers&f=false|isbn = 9780871698650|last1 = Goodenough|first1 = Ward Hunt|year = 1996}}</ref> The remnants of these peoples who were not fully sinicized are now recognized officially as the [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] of the [[China|PRC]].

===Turkic peoples===

Descendants of [[Uyghurs]] who migrated to [[Taoyuan County, Hunan]] have largely assimilated into the Han Chinese and [[Hui people|Hui]] population and practice Chinese customs, speaking [[varieties of Chinese]] as their language.

===Tang dynasty===
During the 8th and 9th centuries in the [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese male soldiers moved into [[Guizhou]] ([[Chinese postal romanization|formerly romanized as]] Kweichow) and married native non-Chinese women, their descendants being known as ''Lao-han-jen'' (original Chinese), in contrast to new Chinese people who colonized Guizhou at later times.

===Yuan dynasty===

The Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]] appointed a [[Muslims|Muslim]] from [[Bukhara]], [[Ajall Shams al-Din Omar]], as governor of [[Yunnan]] after conquering the [[Bai people|Bai]] [[Kingdom of Dali]].  Sayyid Ajjall then promoted Sinicization and [[Confucianization]] of the non-Han Chinese peoples in Yunnan during his reign.  Sayyid Ajall founded a \"Chinese style\" city where modern [[Kunming]] is today, called Zhongjing Cheng. He ordered that a [[Buddhist temple]], a [[Confucian temple]], and two [[mosque]]s be built in the city.<ref>{{cite book|title=Beyond the Great Wall: Urban Form and Transformation on the Chinese Frontiers|first=Piper Rae|last=Gaubatz|volume=|edition=illustrated|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=drGGEsi1fFEC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=sichuan+ajall+yuan#v=onepage&q=sichuan%20ajall%20yuan&f=false|page=78|isbn=0804723990|accessdate=24 April 2014| ref=harv }}</ref>  Advocating Confucianism was part of his policy.

Massive military campaigns were launched by the [[Ming dynasty]] during the [[Miao Rebellions (Ming Dynasty)|Miao Rebellions]] against the southern indigenous [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Yao people|Yao]], and other tribes, settled thousands of Han and Hui in their land after exterminating most of the former indigenous tribes.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

During the [[Ming conquest of Yunnan]] Chinese military soldiers were settled in Yunnan, and many married the native women.

===Qing dynasty===
The rulers of the [[Qing dynasty]] were [[Manchu people|ethnic Manchus]] who adopted the norms of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to justify their rules. The \"orthodox\" historical view emphasized the power of [[Han Chinese]] to \"sinicize\" their conquerors, although more recent research such as the [[New Qing History]] school revealed Manchu rulers were savvy in their manipulation of their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, the emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used [[Central Asia]]n models of rule as much as [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ones. There is also evidence of sinicization, however. For example, Manchus originally had their own separate style of naming from the Han Chinese, but eventually adopted Han Chinese naming practices.

[[Manchu name]]s consisted of more than the two or one syllable [[Chinese name]]s, and when phonetically transcribed into Chinese, they made no sense at all.<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=famous Manchu figure of the early Qing who belonged to the Niohuru clan) would have been the unwieldy \"Niu-gu-lu E-bi-long\" in Chinese. Moreover, the characters used in names were typically chosen to represent the sounds of Manchu, and not to carry any particular meaning in Chinese. For educated Han Chinese accustomed to names composed of a familiar surname and one or two elegang characters drawn from a poem or a passage from the classics, Manchu names looked not just different, but absurd. What was oneo to make of a name like E-bi-long, written in Chinese characters meaning \"repress-must flourish,\" or Duo-er-gun, meaning \"numerous-thou-roll\"? S.... To them they looked like nonsense.... But they are not nonsense in Manchu: \"E-bi-long\" is the transcription of ebilun, meaning \"a delicate or sickly child,\" and \"Duo-er-gun\" is the Chinese transcription of dorgon, the Manchu word for badger.|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA242#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=0-8047-4684-2|page=242|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C.

Giving \"numeral names\" was another unique Manchu habit. These were names that actually referred to numbers. Sometimes they were given using Manchu numbers—for example, Nadanju (seventy) or Susai (fifty). Other times number names used the Manchu transcriptions of Chinese numbers, as in the name Loišici (= Liushi qi, \"sixty-seven\"), Bašinu (= bashi wu, \"eight-five\").45 Such names, unheard of among the Han, were quite common among the Manchus, an appeared from time to time among Chinese bannermen. Popular curiosity about this odd custom in Qing was partly satisfied by the nineteenth-century bannerman-writer Fu-ge, who explained in his book of \"jottings\" that naming children for their grandparents' ages was a way of wishing longevity to the newly born.46|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA243#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=0-8047-4684-2|page=243|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C.

Thus, in the seventh generation of the Gūwalgiya lineage were sons with two names, one Manchu and one Chinese, such as Duolunbu/Shiman, Delinbu/Shizhu, and Tehengbu/Shizhen. Within the family and the banner, these boys used their Manchu name, but outside they used their Han-style name.

Usage of surnames was not traditional to the Manchu while it was to the Han Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=Chinese names consist typically of a single-character surname and a given name of one or two characters, the latter usually chosen for their auspicious meaning.

Examples of this policy included the renaming of streets with mainland geographical names, use of [[Mandarin Chinese]] in schools and punishments for using other regional languages (such as the [[wikt:fāngyán|fāngyán]] of [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Hokkien]]), and teaching students to revere traditional ethics, develop pan-[[Chinese nationalism]], and view Taiwan from the perspective of China.<ref>{{cite conference | first = June Teufel | last = Dreyer | title = Taiwan's Evolving Identity | url = http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&event_id=31149 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | location = Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | quote = In order to shore up his government’s legitimacy, Chiang set about turning Taiwan’s inhabitants into Chinese. To use Renan’s terminology, Chiang chose to re-define the concept of shared destiny to include the mainland. Streets were re-named; major thoroughfares in Taipei received names associated with the traditional Confucian virtues. The avenue passing in front of the foreign ministry en route to the presidential palace was named chieh-shou (long life), in Chiang’s honor. Students were required to learn Mandarin and speak it exclusively; those who disobeyed and spoke Taiwanese Min, Hakka, or aboriginal tongues could be fined, slapped, or subjected to other disciplinary actions. | date = July 17, 2003 | accessdate = May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/17827189.html|quote=The new KMT concluded that it must “Sinicize” Taiwan if it were ever to unify mainland China.

The process of re-asserting non-Chinese identity, as in the case of ethnic groups in Taiwan, is sometimes known as [[desinicization]].  This is an issue in, for example, the [[Taiwan independence movement]] and [[Taiwanization|Taiwan localization movements]].

In April 2016, [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] declared that in order to “actively guide the adaptation of religions to socialist society, an important task is supporting China’s religions’ persistence in the direction of sinicization.”<ref name=\"diplomat-2018\">{{cite news |last1=Bowie |first1=Julia |last2=Gitter |first2=David |title=The CCP's Plan to 'Sinicize' Religions |url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/06/the-ccps-plan-to-sinicize-religions/ |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=The Diplomat |date=14 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=习近平：全面提高新形势下宗教工作水平-新华网 |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/2016-04/23/c_1118716540.htm |website=www.xinhuanet.com |accessdate=9 February 2020 |language=zh|date=23 April 2016}}</ref> He later reiterated this plan to the [[19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|19th Communist Party Congress]] saying “We will fully implement the Party’s basic policy on religious affairs, insist on the sinicization of Chinese religions, and provide active guidance for religion and socialism to coexist.”<ref name=\"diplomat-2018\"/><ref>{{cite news |title=习近平：决胜全面建成小康社会 夺取新时代中国特色社会主义伟大胜利——在中国共产党第十九次全国代表大会上的报告-新华网 |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/politics/19cpcnc/2017-10/27/c_1121867529.htm |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=www.xinhuanet.com |date=27 October 2017 |language=zh}}</ref>

====Protestantism====

The [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] (TSPM) of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in China has described the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and the anti-Christian movement of 1922-27 as early efforts to sinicize Christianity.<ref name=\"scmp-may-2019\">{{cite news |last1=Gan |first1=Nectar |title=Chinese Protestant church head wants purge of Western influences |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3001240/official-head-chinas-protestant-churches-says-religions-must-be |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=12 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

The TSPM and [[China Christian Council]] arranged a conference in Shanghai on August 4–6, 2014, commemorating the anniversary of the TSPM.

Subsequently, China’s government-sponsored China Christian Council (CCC) and the TSPM orchestrated a conference in Shanghai on August 4–6 to commemorate the anniversary of the TSPM, which included a seminar on the so-called “sinicization” of Christianity. Fu Xianwei, chairman of the TSPM, was quoted as saying that “churches in China will continue to explore the sinicization of Christianity [and] ensure Christianity takes root in the soil of Chinese culture, ethnicity, and society... To advance the sinicization of Christianity, churches will need guidance and support from government agencies in charge of religious affairs.” Gao Feng, chairman of the CCC, stated that the TSPM would “take on a new mission in this age, adhere to the path of sinicization, and deepen and advance the process of sinicizing Christianity.” Wang Zuo’an, director of the State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA), also reinforced the need for the sinicization of Christianity. |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title='Sinicization' of Christianity China's aim |url=http://bpnews.net/44702/sinicization-of-christianity-chinas-aim |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=Baptist Press |date=6 May 2015 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2019, TSPM chairman Xu Xiaohong made a pledge to eliminate any Western \"imprint\" from Chinese faith saying \"[We] must recognise that Chinese churches are surnamed ‘China’, not ‘the West’\" and \"No matter how much effort or time it takes, our resolution in upholding the Sinicisation of Protestantism will never change, and our determination to walk a path that is adapted to a socialist society will never waver.\"<ref name=\"scmp-may-2019\"/>

'''Sinicization''', '''sinicisation''', '''sinofication''', or '''sinification''', or '''sinonization''' is a process whereby non-Chinese societies come under the influence of [[Chinese culture]], particularly [[Han Chinese]] culture, language, societal norms, and ethnic identity. Areas of influence include diet, writing, industry, education, language, law, lifestyle, politics, philosophy, religion, science and technology, culture, and value systems. More broadly, \"Sinicization\" may refer to policies of [[acculturation]], [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], or [[cultural imperialism]] imposed by [[China]] onto neighboring [[East Asia|East Asian countries]], and [[Ethnic minorities in China|minority ethnic groups]] inside China.  Evidence of this can be seen in the value systems, cuisine, [[Chinese architecture|architectural style]], and lexicons. This is reflected in the histories of [[Japan]], [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] for example, in the [[adoption of Chinese literary culture|adoption of the Chinese writing system]] as [[Written Chinese|the script]] of the Han Chinese has long been a unifying feature in the [[Sinosphere]] as the vehicle for exporting Chinese culture to these Asian countries.

==Integration==
The integration or assimilation policy is a type of [[nationalism]] aimed at strengthening of the Chinese identity among the population. Proponents believe integration will help to develop shared values, pride in being the country’s citizen, respect and acceptance towards cultural differences among citizens of China. Critics argue that integration destroys [[ethnic diversity]], [[language diversity]], and [[cultural diversity]]. Analogous to [[North America]] with approximately 300 [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] and distinct ethnic groups; in China there are 292 non-Mandarin [[Languages of China|languages]] spoken by native peoples of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/CN|title=China|last=|first=|date=|website=[[Ethnologue]]|language=en|access-date=2018-12-05}}</ref> There are also a number of [[Immigration to China|immigrant]] languages, such as [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]], etc.

==Historical examples of sinicization==
===Austronesian peoples===
Before sinicization, non-Chinese indigenous peoples of [[South China|Southern China]], collectively termed by the Chinese as [[Baiyue]] inhabited the coastline of China from as far north as the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] to as far south as the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].  Analysis of DNA recovered from human remains shows high frequencies of [[Haplogroup O1]] in [[Liangzhu culture]] linking this culture to modern Austronesian populations. It is believed that Liangzhu culture was the ancestral homeland of Proto-Austronesian populations before they [[Austronesian hypothesis|spread to Taiwan]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. Over time, the southward spread of Han Chinese led to the sinicization of most of the Baiyue populations that remained in Southern China, whether in the [[Yangtze River valley|Yangtze Valley]] or in coastal areas from the mouth of the Yangtze to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]].<ref>{{cite book|title= Prehistoric Settlement of the Pacific, Volume 86, Part 5|url= https://books.google.com/?id=XiELAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA137&dq=in+the+southward+spread+of+Han+Chinese+led+to+the+sinicization+of+all+AN-speakers#v=onepage&q=in%20the%20southward%20spread%20of%20Han%20Chinese%20led%20to%20the%20sinicization%20of%20all%20AN-speakers&f=false|isbn = 9780871698650|last1 = Goodenough|first1 = Ward Hunt|year = 1996}}</ref> The remnants of these peoples who were not fully sinicized are now recognized officially as the [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] of the [[China|PRC]].

===Tang dynasty===
During the 8th and 9th centuries in the [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese male soldiers moved into [[Guizhou]] ([[Chinese postal romanization|formerly romanized as]] Kweichow) and married native non-Chinese women, their descendants being known as ''Lao-han-jen'' (original Chinese), in contrast to new Chinese people who colonized Guizhou at later times.

During the [[Ming conquest of Yunnan]] Chinese military soldiers were settled in Yunnan, and many married the native women.

===Qing dynasty===
The rulers of the [[Qing dynasty]] were [[Manchu people|ethnic Manchus]] who adopted the norms of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to justify their rules. The \"orthodox\" historical view emphasized the power of [[Han Chinese]] to \"sinicize\" their conquerors, although more recent research such as the [[New Qing History]] school revealed Manchu rulers were savvy in their manipulation of their subjects and from the 1630s through at least the 18th century, the emperors developed a sense of Manchu identity and used [[Central Asia]]n models of rule as much as [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ones. There is also evidence of sinicization, however. For example, Manchus originally had their own separate style of naming from the Han Chinese, but eventually adopted Han Chinese naming practices.

[[Manchu name]]s consisted of more than the two or one syllable [[Chinese name]]s, and when phonetically transcribed into Chinese, they made no sense at all.<ref>{{cite book|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|quote=famous Manchu figure of the early Qing who belonged to the Niohuru clan) would have been the unwieldy \"Niu-gu-lu E-bi-long\" in Chinese. Moreover, the characters used in names were typically chosen to represent the sounds of Manchu, and not to carry any particular meaning in Chinese. For educated Han Chinese accustomed to names composed of a familiar surname and one or two elegang characters drawn from a poem or a passage from the classics, Manchu names looked not just different, but absurd.

Giving \"numeral names\" was another unique Manchu habit. These were names that actually referred to numbers. Sometimes they were given using Manchu numbers—for example, Nadanju (seventy) or Susai (fifty). Other times number names used the Manchu transcriptions of Chinese numbers, as in the name Loišici (= Liushi qi, \"sixty-seven\"), Bašinu (= bashi wu, \"eight-five\").45 Such names, unheard of among the Han, were quite common among the Manchus, an appeared from time to time among Chinese bannermen. Popular curiosity about this odd custom in Qing was partly satisfied by the nineteenth-century bannerman-writer Fu-ge, who explained in his book of \"jottings\" that naming children for their grandparents' ages was a way of wishing longevity to the newly born.46|location=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&pg=PA243#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=0-8047-4684-2|page=243|title=The Manchu Way: The Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|edition=illustrated, reprint|author=Mark C.

Manchu names were different. For one thing, Manchus did not commonly employ surnames, identifying themselves usually by their banner affiliation rather than by their lineage. Even if they had customarily used both surname and given name, this would not have eliminated the difference with Han names, since Manchu names of any kind were very often longer than two characters—that is, two syllables— in length.

=== Taiwan ===
After the Republic of China took control of [[Taiwan]] in 1945 and [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|relocated its capital]] to [[Taipei]] in 1949, the intention of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] was to eventually go back to [[mainland China]] and retake control of it. Chiang believed that to retake mainland China, it would be necessary to re-Sinicize Taiwan's inhabitants who had undergone assimilation [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese rule]]. Examples of this policy included the renaming of streets with mainland geographical names, use of [[Mandarin Chinese]] in schools and punishments for using other regional languages (such as the [[wikt:fāngyán|fāngyán]] of [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Hokkien]]), and teaching students to revere traditional ethics, develop pan-[[Chinese nationalism]], and view Taiwan from the perspective of China.<ref>{{cite conference | first = June Teufel | last = Dreyer | title = Taiwan's Evolving Identity | url = http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=events.event_summary&event_id=31149 Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | location = Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars | quote = In order to shore up his government’s legitimacy, Chiang set about turning Taiwan’s inhabitants into Chinese. To use Renan’s terminology, Chiang chose to re-define the concept of shared destiny to include the mainland. Streets were re-named; major thoroughfares in Taipei received names associated with the traditional Confucian virtues. The avenue passing in front of the foreign ministry en route to the presidential palace was named chieh-shou (long life), in Chiang’s honor. Students were required to learn Mandarin and speak it exclusively; those who disobeyed and spoke Taiwanese Min, Hakka, or aboriginal tongues could be fined, slapped, or subjected to other disciplinary actions. | date = July 17, 2003 | accessdate = May 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/17827189.html|quote=The new KMT concluded that it must “Sinicize” Taiwan if it were ever to unify mainland China.

The [[Three-Self Patriotic Movement]] (TSPM) of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] churches in China has described the [[Boxer Rebellion]] and the anti-Christian movement of 1922-27 as early efforts to sinicize Christianity.<ref name=\"scmp-may-2019\">{{cite news |last1=Gan |first1=Nectar |title=Chinese Protestant church head wants purge of Western influences |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3001240/official-head-chinas-protestant-churches-says-religions-must-be |accessdate=9 February 2020 |work=South China Morning Post |date=12 March 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

{{Software development process}}

'''Scrum''' is an [[agile software development|agile]] process framework for managing complex knowledge work, with an initial emphasis on [[software development]], although it has been used in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex work, research and advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/lessons-learned-using-scrum-in-non-technical-teams/|title=Lessons learned: Using Scrum in non-technical teams|website=Agile Alliance|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref> It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called ''sprints'', no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Name ==

The software development term ''scrum'' was first used in a 1986 paper titled \"The New New Product Development Game\". The term is borrowed from [[Rugby football|rugby]], where a scrum is a formation of players. The term ''scrum'' was chosen by the paper's authors because it emphasizes teamwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dzone.com/articles/scrum-whats-in-a-name|title=Scrum, What's in a Name? - DZone Agile|website=dzone.com}}</ref>

''Scrum'' is occasionally seen written in all-capitals, as ''SCRUM''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/q/6389423 |title=Should \"SCRUM\" be written in all caps?|website=stackoverflow.com|access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> The word is not an [[acronym]], so this stylization is not correct; it likely arose due to an early paper by Ken Schwaber<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwaber|first=Ken|title=Scrum.org Ken Schwaber|url=https://www.scrum.org/team/ken-schwaber}}</ref> which capitalized ''SCRUM'' in its title.<ref name=\"schwaber\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwaber|first=Ken|year=2004|title=SCRUM Development Process|url=http://www.jeffsutherland.org/oopsla/schwapub.pdf|journal=Advanced Development Methods}}</ref> 

While the [[trademark]] on the term ''Scrum'' itself has been allowed to lapse, it is deemed as owned by the wider community rather than an individual,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agilelearninglabs.com/2011/01/scrummaster-vs-scrum-master/|title=ScrumMaster vs scrum master: What do you think?|last=Johnson|first=Hillary Louise|date=January 13, 2011|website=agilelearninglabs.com|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref> so the leading capital for ''Scrum'' is retained in this article.

Many of the terms used in Scrum are typically written with leading capitals (e.g., ''Scrum Master'', ''Daily Scrum''). However, to maintain an encyclopedic tone, this article uses normal sentence case for these terms (e.g., ''scrum master'', ''daily scrum'') – unless they are recognized marks (such as ''Certified Scrum Master'').

== Key ideas ==

Scrum is a lightweight, [[Iterative design|iterative]] and [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental]] framework for managing complex work.<ref name=\"scrumalliance\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum|title=What is Scrum?|website=What is Scrum? An Agile Framework for Completing Complex Projects - Scrum Alliance|publisher=Scrum Alliance|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"gunther\">{{cite web|url=http://guntherverheyen.com/2013/03/21/scrum-framework-not-methodology/|title=Scrum: Framework, not methodology|website=Gunther Verheyen|publisher=Gunther Verheyen|last1=Verheyen|first1=Gunther|accessdate=February 24, 2016|date=March 21, 2013}}</ref> The framework challenges assumptions of the traditional, sequential approach to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical [[Colocation (business)|co-location]] or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines involved.

A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change their minds about what they want or need (often called ''requirements volatility''<ref>J. Henry and S. Henry. Quantitative assessment of the software maintenance process and requirements volatility. In Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer Science, pages 346–351, 1993.</ref>) and that there will be unpredictable challenges—for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. 

As such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based [[Empirical process|empirical approach]] – accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

== History ==

[[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] introduced the term ''scrum'' in the context of [[New product development|product development]] in their 1986 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, 'The New New Product Development Game'.<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\">{{Cite journal|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Hirotaka|last2=Nonaka|first2=Ikujiro|date=January 1, 1986|title=The New New Product Development Game|url=https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|quote=Moving the Scrum Downfield|via=}}</ref> Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in ''The Knowledge Creating Company''<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC&dq=The+Knowledge+Creating+Company&printsec=frontcover|title= The Knowledge Creating Company|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|year= 1995|accessdate= March 12, 2013|isbn= 9780199762330}}</ref> that it is a form of \"organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally\".

The authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer [[economic sector|industries]].<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> They called this the [[holistic]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]] approach, as the whole process is performed by one [[cross-functional team]] across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\".<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> (In [[rugby football]], a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] is used to restart play, as the forwards of each team interlock with their heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.<ref>{{Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Scrum}}</ref>)

The Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex products, such as software, that weren't based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.

In the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word scrum.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171122013020/https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archivedate= November 22, 2017|format= PDF|title= Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last= Sutherland|first= Jeff|authorlink= Jeff Sutherland|date= October 2004|accessdate= September 26, 2008 }}</ref>

Ken and Jeff worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, Scrum. They tested Scrum and continually improved it, leading to their 1995 paper, contributions to the Agile Manifesto<ref name=\"agilemanifesto\">{{cite web|url=https://agilemanifesto.org|title=Manifesto for Agile Software Development|accessdate=October 17, 2019}}</ref> in 2001, and the worldwide spread and use of Scrum since 2002.

In 1995, Sutherland and Schwaber jointly presented a paper describing the Scrum framework at the Business Object Design and Implementation Workshop held as part of [[OOPSLA|Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications '95]] (OOPSLA '95) in Austin, Texas.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Sutherland|first1= Jeffrey Victor|authorlink1= Jeff Sutherland|last2= Schwaber|first2= Ken|authorlink2= Ken Schwaber|title= Business object design and implementation: OOPSLA '95 workshop proceedings|year= 1995|publisher= [[The University of Michigan]]|isbn= 978-3-540-76096-2|page= 118 }}</ref> Over the following years, Schwaber and Sutherland collaborated to combine this material—with their experience and evolving good practice—to develop what became known as Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />

In 2001, Schwaber worked with [[Mike Beedle]] to describe the method in the book, ''Agile Software Development with Scrum''.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Schwaber|first1= Ken|authorlink1= Ken Schwaber|last2= Beedle|first2= Mike|title= Agile software development with Scrum|year= 2002|publisher= Prentice Hall|isbn= 978-0-13-067634-4 }}</ref> Scrum's approach to planning and managing product development involves bringing [[decision-making]] authority to the level of operation properties and certainties.<ref name=\"schwaber\">{{cite book|title= Agile Project Management with Scrum|url= https://archive.org/details/agileprojectmana0000schw|url-access= registration|last= Schwaber|first= Ken|authorlink= Ken Schwaber|publisher= [[Microsoft Press]]|isbn= 978-0-7356-1993-7|date= February 1, 2004 }}
</ref>

In 2002, Schwaber with others founded the [[Scrum Alliance]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShojBgAAQBAJ|title=The Scrum Culture: Introducing Agile Methods in Organizations|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319118277|series=Management for Professionals|location=Cham|publication-date=2015|page=26|quote=Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland presented Scrum for the first time at the OOPSLA conference in Austin, Texas, in 1995.

Schwaber left the Scrum Alliance in late 2009 and founded Scrum.org<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scrum.org/index|title=Home|website=Scrum.org|language=en|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref> which oversees the parallel ''Professional Scrum'' accreditation series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.leanagile.in/post/54764080535/certified-scrum-master-vs-professional-scrum|title=Certified Scrum Master vs Professional Scrum Master|last=Partogi|first=Joshua|date=July 7, 2013|publisher=Lean Agile Institute|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref>

Since 2009, a public document called ''The Scrum Guide''<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> has been published and updated by Schwaber and Sutherland. It has been revised 5 times, with the current version being November 2017.

== Roles ==
{{original research|section|date=April 2019}}

=== Product owner ===

The product owner, representing the product's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and the [[voice of the customer]] (or may represent the desires of a committee<ref name=\":3\" />), is responsible for delivering good business results.<ref name=\"Essential Scrum: Velocity\">{{Citation

A scrum team should have only one product owner (although a product owner could support more than one team)<ref name=\":1\" /> This role should not be combined with that of the scrum master. The product owner should focus on the business side of product development and spend the majority of their time liaising with stakeholders and the team. The product owner should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution, but rather will seek consensus among the team members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf|title=The Scrum Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scrum guide|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf|pages=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scrumalliance.org/learn-about-scrum/community-webinars/webinar-replays/scrum-fundamentals/the-role-of-the-product-owner|title=The Role of the Product Owner|website=Scrum Alliance|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref>{{better source|date=February 2016|reason=an anon gave the concern that the reference gives the opinion of a single author and could hardly be considered authoritative}} The Product Owner uses Scrum’s empirical tools to manage highly complex work, while controlling risk and achieving value.

This role is crucial and requires a deep understanding of both sides: the business and the engineers (developers) in the scrum team. Therefore a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it (because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the Development Team using a technical language, as required. 

Communication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love|last=Pichler|first=Roman|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-68413-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm|title= The Product Owner Role: A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams|last= Ambler|first= Scott|publisher= agilemodeling.com|access-date= July 22, 2016 |  quote =  [...] in practice there proves to be two critical aspects to this role: first as a stakeholder proxy within the development team and second as a project team representative to the overall stakeholder community as a whole.}}</ref>

As the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Product Owner Role|url=http://scrum-master.thinkific.com/pages/the-product-owner-role|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>

* Define and announce releases.
* Communicate delivery and team status.
* Share progress during governance meetings.
* Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.
* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.
* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.

Empathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have—the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.<ref name=\":1\">Cohn, Mike. Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.</ref>

A product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.

=== Development team ===

The development team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build increments of valuable output every sprint.<ref name=\":0\" /> 

While team members are referred to as ''developers'' in some literature<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />, the term refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians, analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, due to the confusion that can arise when some people do not feel the term 'developer' applies to them, they are often referred to just as ''team members''. 

The team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.<ref name=\":0\" />

=== Scrum master ===

Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.<ref>Carroll, N, O’Connor, M. and Edison, H. (2018). The Identification and Classification of Impediments to Software Flow, The Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS 2018), August 16–18, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.</ref> The scrum master is not a traditional [[team leader|team lead]] or [[project manager]] but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The scrum master ensures that the scrum framework is followed. The scrum master helps to ensure the team follows the agreed processes in the Scrum framework, often facilitates key sessions, and encourages the team to improve. The role has also been referred to as a team facilitator<ref>Leybourn, E. (2013). ''Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management''. London: IT Governance Publishing: 117–120.</ref> or [[servant leadership|servant-leader]] to reinforce these dual perspectives.

The core responsibilities of a scrum master include (but are not limited to):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/core-scrum-values-roles|title=Core Scrum|website=Scrum Alliance|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref>

* Helping the product owner maintain the product backlog in a way that ensures the needed work is well understood so the team can continually make forward progress
* Helping the team to determine the definition of done for the product, with input from key stakeholders
* Coaching the team, within the Scrum principles, in order to deliver high-quality features for its product<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Lean Mobile App Development: Apply Lean startup methodologies to develop successful iOS and Android apps|last=Drongelen|first=Mike van|last2=Dennis|first2=Adam|last3=Garabedian|first3=Richard|last4=Gonzalez|first4=Alberto|last5=Krishnaswamy|first5=Aravind|date=2017|publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd|year=|isbn=9781786467041|location=Birmingham, UK|pages=43}}</ref>
* Promoting self-organization within the team
* Helping the scrum team to avoid or remove impediments to its progress, whether internal or external to the team
* Facilitating team events to ensure regular progress
* Educating key stakeholders on Agile and Scrum principles
* Coaching the development team in self-organization and cross-functionality

The scrum master helps people and organizations adopt empirical and lean thinking, leaving behind hopes for certainty and predictability. 

One of the ways the scrum master role differs from a project manager is that the latter may have [[Management|people management]] responsibilities and the scrum master does not. A scrum master provides a limited amount of direction since the team is expected to be empowered and self-organizing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|last=Cobb|first=Charles G.|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118991046|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=37}}</ref> Scrum does not formally recognise the role of project manager, as traditional [[command and control]] tendencies would cause difficulties.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/Scrum_Primer|title=The Scrum Primer: A Lightweight Guide to the Theory and Practice of Scrum (Version 2.0)|author1=Pete Deemer|author2=Gabrielle Benefield|date=December 17, 2012|publisher=InfoQ|author3=Craig Larman|author4=Bas Vodde}}</ref>

== Workflow ==

=== Sprint ===
[[File:Scrum Framework.png|thumb|right|Scrum framework]]{{Distinguish|Hackathon#Code sprints}}[[File:Scrum process.svg|thumb|The Scrum process]]

A sprint (also known as ''iteration'' or ''timebox'') is the basic unit of development in Scrum. The sprint is a [[timeboxing|timeboxed]] effort; that is, the length is agreed and fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.<ref name=\"schwaber\" />

Each sprint starts with a ''sprint planning'' event that establishes a sprint goal and the required product backlog items. The team accepts what they agree is ready and translate this into a sprint backlog, with a breakdown of the work required and an estimated forecast for the sprint goal. Each sprint ends with a ''sprint review'' and ''sprint retrospective'', that reviews progress to show to stakeholders and identify lessons and improvements for the next sprints.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> 

Scrum emphasizes valuable, useful output at the end of the sprint that is really done. In the case of software, this likely includes that the software has been fully integrated, tested and documented, and is potentially releasable.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" />

=== Sprint planning ===

At the beginning of a sprint, the scrum team holds a sprint planning event<ref name=\"Sprint 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.neonrain.com/agile-scrum-web-development|title=Agile SCRUM For Denver Web Development|last=Gangji|first=Arif|last2=Hartman|first2=Bob|year=2015|website=|publisher=Neon Rain Interactive|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref> to:

* Mutually discuss and agree on the scope of work that is intended to be done during that sprint
* Select product backlog items that can be completed in one sprint
* Prepare a sprint backlog that includes the work needed to complete the selected product backlog items
* Agree the '''sprint goal,''' a short description of what they are forecasting to deliver at the end of the sprint.
*The recommended duration is four hours for a two-week sprint (pro-rata for other sprint durations) <ref name=\"scrumguide\" />
** During the first half, the whole scrum team (development team, scrum master, and product owner) selects the product backlog items they believe could be completed in that sprint
** During the second half, the development team identifies the detailed work (tasks) required to complete those product backlog items; resulting in a confirmed sprint backlog
*** As the detailed work is elaborated, some product backlog items may be split or put back into the product backlog if the team no longer believes they can complete the required work in a single sprint
* Once the development team has prepared their sprint backlog, they forecast (usually by voting) which tasks will be delivered within the sprint.

=== Daily scrum ===

[[File:Daily sprint meeting.jpg|thumb|A daily scrum in the computing room. This centralized location helps the team start on time.]]

Each day during a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum (or [[stand-up meeting|stand-up]]) with specific guidelines:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-daily-scrum|title=What is a Daily Scrum?|website=Scrum.org|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"schwaber\" />

* All members of the development team come prepared. The daily scrum:
** starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing
** should happen at the same time and place every day
** is limited ([[timeboxing|timeboxed]]) to fifteen minutes
* Anyone is welcome, though only development team members should contribute.
* During the daily scrum, each team member typically answers three questions:
** What did I complete yesterday that contributed to the team meeting our sprint goal?
** What do I plan to complete today to contribute to the team meeting our sprint goal?
** Do I see any impediment that could prevent me or the team from meeting our sprint goal?

Any impediment (e.g., stumbling block, risk, issue, delayed dependency, assumption proved unfounded)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Little|first=Joe|date=January 17, 2011|title=Impediment Management|url=http://agileconsortium.blogspot.com/2011/01/impediment-management.html|publisher=Agile Consortium}}</ref> identified in the daily scrum should be captured by the scrum master and displayed on the team's scrum board or on a shared risk board, with an agreed person designated to working toward a resolution (outside of the daily scrum). While the currency of work status is the whole team's responsibility, the scrum master often updates the sprint burndown chart.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=The Agile Developer's Handbook: Get more value from your software development: get the best out of the Agile methodology|last=Flewelling|first=Paul|date=2018|publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd|year=|isbn=9781787280205|location=Birmingham, UK|pages=91}}</ref> Where the team does not see the value in these events, it is the responsibility of the scrum master to find out why.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Art of Scrum: How Scrum Masters Bind Dev Teams and Unleash Agility|last=McKenna|first=Dave|date=2016|publisher=CA Press|year=|isbn=9781484222768|location=Aliquippa, PA|pages=126|language=en}}</ref> This is part of the responsibility of educating the team and stakeholders about the Scrum principles.<ref name=\":4\" /> 

No detailed discussions should happen during the daily scrum. Once the meeting ends, individual members can get together to discuss issues in detail; such a meeting is sometimes known as a 'breakout session' or an 'after party'.<ref name=\":5\" />

=== Sprint review ===

At the end of a sprint, the team holds two events: the sprint review and the sprint retrospective.

At the sprint review, the team:

* reviews the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed
* presents the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. the [[technology demo | demo]])
* collaborates with the stakeholders on what to work on next

Guidelines for sprint reviews:

* Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated.
* The recommended duration is two hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint-durations).<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />

=== Sprint retrospective ===

At the sprint retrospective, the team:

* Reflects on the past sprint
* Identifies and agrees on [[Continual improvement process|continuous process improvement]] actions

Guidelines for sprint retrospectives:

* Three main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint? What did not go well? What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?
* The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint duration(s))
* This event is facilitated by the scrum master

=== Backlog refinement ===

Backlog [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]] (formerly called grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity. Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.

Although not originally a core Scrum practice, backlog refinement has been added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint, with a recommended investment of up to 10% of a team's sprint capacity.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416–421}}</ref>

The backlog can also include [[technical debt]] (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

=== Cancelling a sprint ===

The product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.

== Artifacts ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

=== Product backlog ===

The product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=Péraire|first3=Cécile|title=The Product Backlog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330823863_The_Product_Backlog|publisher=IEEE}}</ref> and contains an ordered list of [[Requirement|product requirements]] that a scrum team maintains for a [[New product development|product]]. Common formats include [[user story|user stories]] and [[use case]]s.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" /> The requirements define [[Software feature|feature]]s, [[Patch (computing)|bug fix]]es, [[non-functional requirement]]s, etc.—whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed.

The product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.

The product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in [[Planning poker|story points]] using the [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|rounded Fibonacci scale]]. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the [[return on investment]] is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.batimes.com/articles/authoring-requirements-in-an-agile-world.html|title= Authoring Requirements in an Agile World|publisher= BA Times|first= Tony|last= Higgins|date= March 31, 2009}}</ref>

The product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery. For instance, if a user story is estimated as a 5 in effort (using Fibonacci sequence), it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it

Story points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant. The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team. For example, an estimate of 5 for one team could be a 2 for another having senior developers and higher skills.

Every team should have a product owner, although in many instances a product owner could work with more than one team.<ref name=\":1\" /> The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.

The product backlog:

* Captures requests to modify a product—including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues
* Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner

Typically, the product owner and the scrum team work together to develop the breakdown of work; this becomes the product backlog, which evolves as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.

==== Management ====

A product backlog, in its simplest form, is merely a list of items to work on. Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs|title=The product backlog: your ultimate to-do list|website=Atlassian|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}</ref>

The product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint. On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. Conceptually, it is ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list, but it is not unusual to see in practice that teams are able to take lower-priority items from the list along with the top ones selected. This normally happens because there is time left within the sprint to accommodate more work. Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on. The further down the backlog goes, the less refined the items should be. As Schwaber and Beedle put it \"The lower the priority, the less detail until you can barely make out the backlog item.\"<ref name=\"schwaber\" />

As the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment—the team can learn about new market opportunities to take advantage of, competitor threats that arise, and feedback from customers that can change the way the product was meant to work. All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. This is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.<ref name=\"Pichler, Roman 2010\">Pichler, Roman. ''Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.{{qn|date=March 2017}}</ref>

=== Sprint backlog ===

[[File:Scrum task board.jpg|thumb|A scrum task board]]

The sprint backlog is the list of work the development team must address during the next sprint.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\">{{cite book|author1=Russ J. Martinelli|author2=Dragan Z. Milosevic|title=Project Management ToolBox: Tools and Techniques for the Practicing Project Manager|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbA7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA304|date=January 5, 2016|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-97320-2|page=304}}</ref> The list is derived by the scrum team progressively selecting product backlog items in priority order from the top of the product backlog until they feel they have enough work to fill the sprint. The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.

The product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\" /> Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity. This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.

The sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress and done.

Once a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.

=== Increment ===

The ''increment'' is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's ''definition of done'' (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.

=== Extensions ===

The following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />

==== Sprint burndown chart ====

[[File:SampleBurndownChart.svg|thumb|A sample burndown chart for a completed sprint, showing remaining effort at the end of each day.]]

{{main|Burn down chart}}

The sprint burndown chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.<ref name=\"Cobb2015\">{{cite book|author=Charles G. Cobb|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHjTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA378|date=January 27, 2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99104-6|page=378}}</ref> Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides quick visualizations for reference. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the days in a sprint, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining each day (typically representing the estimate of hours of work remaining).

During sprint planning, the ideal burndown chart is plotted. Then, during the sprint, each member picks up tasks from the sprint backlog and works on them. At the end of the day, they update the remaining hours for tasks to be completed. In such a way, the actual burndown chart is updated day by day.

It should not be confused with an [[earned value management|earned value chart]].

==== Release burn-up chart ====

[[File:SampleBurnupChart.png|thumb|A sample burn-up chart for a release, showing scope completed each sprint (MVP = Minimum Viable Product)]]

The release burn-up chart is a way for the team to provide visibility and track progress toward a release. Updated at the end of each sprint, it shows progress toward delivering a forecast scope. The horizontal axis of the release burn-up chart shows the sprints in a release, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work completed at the end of each sprint (typically representing cumulative story points of work completed). Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope.

The release burn-up chart makes it easy to see how much work has been completed, how much work has been added or removed (if the horizontal scope line moves), and how much work is left to be done.

==== Definition of ready (DoR) ====
The start criteria to determine whether the [[specification]]s and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a [[user story]].

==== Definition of done (DoD) ====
The [[exit-criteria]] to determine whether a product backlog item is complete. In many cases, the DoD requires that all [[regression testing|regression tests]] be successful. The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team.<ref>Ken Schwaber, ''Agile Project Management with Scrum'', p.55</ref>

==== Velocity ====

The total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in [[user story]] points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.

==== Spike ====

A time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype. Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives. Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept. The duration and objective(s) of a spike is agreed between product owner and development team before the start. Unlike sprint commitments, spikes may or may not deliver tangible, shippable, valuable functionality. For example, the objective of a spike might be to successfully reach a decision on a course of action. The spike is over when the time is up, not necessarily when the objective has been delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html|title=Create a Spike Solution|publisher=Extreme Programming}}</ref>

==== Tracer bullet ====

Also called a drone spike, a tracer bullet is a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throwaway code. It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as [[Tracer ammunition|ammunition]] that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/|title=Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!|last=Sterling|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2007|website=Getting Agile|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>

== Limitations ==

The benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Limitations of Agile Software Processes |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Extreme Programming and Flexible Processes in Software Engineering |pages=43–46 |orig-year=2002 |arxiv=1409.6600v1 |last1=Turk |first1=Dan |last2=France |first2=Robert |last3=Rumpe |first3=Bernhard |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Issues-and-Challenges-in-Scrum-Implementation.pdf |title=Issues and Challenges in Scrum Implementation |journal=International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>

* '''Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time''': In Scrum, developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time. While recent improvements in technology have reduced the impact of these barriers (e.g., being able to collaborate on a digital whiteboard), the Agile manifesto asserts that the best communication is face to face.<ref name=\"AgileManifesto\">{{cite web|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto |year=2001 |website=|publisher=Agile Alliance |author=[[Kent Beck]] |author2=James Grenning |author3=[[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]] |author4=Mike Beedle |author5=[[Jim Highsmith]] |author6=[[Stephen J. Mellor|Steve Mellor]] |author7=Arie van Bennekum |author8=[[Andy Hunt (author)|Andrew Hunt]] |author9=[[Ken Schwaber]] |author10=[[Alistair Cockburn]] |author11=[[Ron Jeffries]] |author12=[[Jeff Sutherland]] |author13=[[Ward Cunningham]] |author14=Jon Kern |author15=[[Dave Thomas (programmer)|Dave Thomas]] |author16=[[Martin Fowler (software engineer)|Martin Fowler]] |author17=[[Brian Marick]] |accessdate=August 7, 2017}}</ref>
* '''Teams whose members have very specialized skills''': In Scrum, developers should have [[T-shaped skills]], allowing them to work on tasks outside of their specialization. This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership. While team members with very specific skills can and do contribute well, they should be encouraged to learn more about and collaborate with other disciplines.
* '''Products with many external dependencies''': In Scrum, dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as [[user acceptance testing]] or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints.
* '''Products that are [[Product life-cycle theory|mature]] or [[Legacy system|legacy]] or with regulated [[quality control]]''': In Scrum, product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of [[regression testing]] or safety testing (e.g., medical devices or vehicle control) for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer [[waterfall model|waterfall]] releases.

From a business perspective, Scrum has many virtues, one of which is that it is designed to yield the best business solutions. However, the efficiency by which it does so in any given organization can vary widely and is largely dependent on the ability of the organization to adhere to the implementation guidelines. Every company has its own distinct organizational structure, culture, and set of business practices, and some are more naturally amenable to this methodology than others.

== Tools for implementation ==
{{Main|Comparison of Scrum software}}
Like other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.

Many companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum—which are either dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.

Other organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly|last=Dubakov|first=Michael|year=2008|accessdate=August 30, 2010 }}</ref>

== Scrum values ==

Scrum is a feedback-driven empirical approach which is, like all empirical process control, underpinned by the three pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. In order to make these things visible, scrum teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working. With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Scrum: an ideal framework for agile projects|last=Morris|first=David|publisher=In Easy Steps|year=2017|isbn=9781840787313|location=|pages=178–179|oclc=951453155}}</ref>

These three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />

# Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every [[Sprint (software development)|sprint]].
# Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.
# Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.
# Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.
# Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.

== Adaptations ==

The hybridization of Scrum with other software development methodologies is common as Scrum does not cover the whole [[software lifecycle|product development lifecycle]]; therefore, organizations find the need to add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive implementation. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Hron, M. |author2=Obwegeser, N.|date=January 2018|title=Scrum in practice: an overview of Scrum adaptations|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/116906219/Hron_Obwegeser_Scrum_in_practice_An_overview_of_Scrum_adaptations.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), January 3-6, 2018}}</ref>

Various authors and communities of people who use Scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt Scrum to particular problems or organizations.  Many refer to these methodological techniques as 'patterns' - by analogy with [[design pattern]]s in architecture and software.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/scrumorgpatterns.com/www/|title=Scrum as Organizational Patterns |last=Bjørnvig|first=Gertrud|last2=Coplien|first2=Jim|date=June 21, 2008|website=|publisher=Gertrude & Cope}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumplop.org|title=Scrum Pattern Community |website=ScrumPLoP.org|access-date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Such patterns have extended Scrum outside of the software development domain into Manufacturing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agilebusinessmanagement.org/content/wikispeed-%E2%80%93-applying-agile-software-principles-and-practices-fast-automotive-development|title=WIKISPEED – Applying Agile software principles and practices for fast automotive development|date=December 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Agile Business Management Consortium |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Finance and [[Human Resources]].

=== Scrumban ===
{{Main|Scrumban}}

Scrumban is a software production model based on Scrum and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]. Scrumban is especially suited for [[Software maintenance|product maintenance]] with frequent and unexpected work items, such as [[Software bug|production defects]] or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's [[workflow]] is directed in a way that allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, and on the other hand ensures each team member is constantly employed.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook|title=Kanban and Scrum - Making the most of both|last=Kniberg|first=Henrik|last2=Skarin|first2=Mattias|date=December 21, 2009 |website=|publisher=InfoQ|format=PDF|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>

To illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard.<ref name=\"scrumban\">{{cite web|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/|title=scrum-ban|last=Ladas|first=Corey|date=October 27, 2007|publisher=Lean Software Engineering|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the case of decentralized teams, stage-illustration software such as [[Assembla]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] or [[Agilo for Trac|Agilo]] can be used.

The major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\" />

=== Scrum of scrums ===

The scrum of scrums is a technique to operate Scrum at scale, for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing them to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" /> especially on areas of overlap and integration. Depending on the cadence (timing) of the scrum of scrums, the relevant daily scrum for each scrum team ends by designating one member as an ambassador to participate in the scrum of scrums with ambassadors from other teams. Depending on the context, the ambassadors may be technical contributors or each team's scrum master.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\">{{cite web |publisher=Agile Alliance |title=Scrum of Scrums |url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html |date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref>

Rather than simply a progress update, the scrum of scrums should focus on how teams are collectively working to resolve, mitigate, or accept any risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions (RIDAs) that have been identified. The scrum of scrums tracks these RIDAs via a backlog of its own, such as a risk board (sometimes known as a ''ROAM board'' after the initials of resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/risk-management-how-to-stop-risks-from-screwing-up-your-projects/ |title=Risk Management – How to Stop Risks from Screwing Up Your Projects!|publisher=Kelly Waters}}</ref> which typically leads to greater coordination and collaboration between teams.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />

This should run similar to a daily scrum, with each ambassador answering the following four questions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrum of Scrums|url=http://scrummastertest.com/scrum-of-scrums/|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>

* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions has your team resolved since we last met?
* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions will your team resolve before we meet again?
* Are there any new risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions slowing your team down or getting in their way?
* Are you about to introduce a new risk, impediment, dependency, or assumption that will get in another team's way?

As [[Jeff Sutherland]] commented,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />

<blockquote>Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a 'meta Scrum'. The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an operational delivery mechanism.</blockquote>

===Large-scale Scrum===
Large-scale Scrum (LeSS) is a product development framework that extends Scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of Scrum.

There are two levels to the framework: the first LeSS level is designed for up to eight teams; the second level, known as 'LeSS Huge', introduces additional scaling elements for development with up to hundreds of developers. \"Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. Large-scale Scrum requires examining the purpose of single-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larman |last2=scrumyear=2013 |title=Scaling Agile Development (Crosstalk journal, November / December 2013)|url=http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2013/201305/201305-larman.pdf}}</ref>

Bas Vodde and [[Craig Larman]] evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries. It evolved by taking Scrum and trying many different experiments to discover what works. In 2013, the experiments were solidified into the LeSS framework rules.<ref>{{cite web|year=2014 |title=Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)|url=http://less.works}}</ref> The intention of LeSS is to 'descale' organization complexity, dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solutions, and solving them in simpler ways. Less roles, less management, less organizational structures.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grgic |year=2015 |title=Descaling organisation with LeSS (Blog) |url=https://leanarch.eu/2015/05/09/descaling-organisation-with-less-2/}}</ref>

'''Scrum''' is an [[agile software development|agile]] process framework for managing complex knowledge work, with an initial emphasis on [[software development]], although it has been used in other fields and is slowly starting to be explored for other complex work, research and advanced technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/lessons-learned-using-scrum-in-non-technical-teams/|title=Lessons learned: Using Scrum in non-technical teams|website=Agile Alliance|accessdate=April 8, 2019}}</ref> It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called ''sprints'', no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks, then track progress and re-plan in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums.

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Name ==

The software development term ''scrum'' was first used in a 1986 paper titled \"The New New Product Development Game\". The term is borrowed from [[Rugby football|rugby]], where a scrum is a formation of players. The term ''scrum'' was chosen by the paper's authors because it emphasizes teamwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dzone.com/articles/scrum-whats-in-a-name|title=Scrum, What's in a Name? - DZone Agile|website=dzone.com}}</ref>

''Scrum'' is occasionally seen written in all-capitals, as ''SCRUM''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stackoverflow.com/q/6389423 |title=Should \"SCRUM\" be written in all caps?|website=stackoverflow.com|access-date=January 10, 2017}}</ref> The word is not an [[acronym]], so this stylization is not correct; it likely arose due to an early paper by Ken Schwaber<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwaber|first=Ken|title=Scrum.org Ken Schwaber|url=https://www.scrum.org/team/ken-schwaber}}</ref> which capitalized ''SCRUM'' in its title.<ref name=\"schwaber\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwaber|first=Ken|year=2004|title=SCRUM Development Process|url=http://www.jeffsutherland.org/oopsla/schwapub.pdf|journal=Advanced Development Methods}}</ref> 

While the [[trademark]] on the term ''Scrum'' itself has been allowed to lapse, it is deemed as owned by the wider community rather than an individual,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agilelearninglabs.com/2011/01/scrummaster-vs-scrum-master/|title=ScrumMaster vs scrum master: What do you think?|last=Johnson|first=Hillary Louise|date=January 13, 2011|website=agilelearninglabs.com|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref> so the leading capital for ''Scrum'' is retained in this article.

Many of the terms used in Scrum are typically written with leading capitals (e.g., ''Scrum Master'', ''Daily Scrum''). However, to maintain an encyclopedic tone, this article uses normal sentence case for these terms (e.g., ''scrum master'', ''daily scrum'') – unless they are recognized marks (such as ''Certified Scrum Master'').

== Key ideas ==

Scrum is a lightweight, [[Iterative design|iterative]] and [[Iterative and incremental development|incremental]] framework for managing complex work.<ref name=\"scrumalliance\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum|title=What is Scrum?|website=What is Scrum? An Agile Framework for Completing Complex Projects - Scrum Alliance|publisher=Scrum Alliance|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"gunther\">{{cite web|url=http://guntherverheyen.com/2013/03/21/scrum-framework-not-methodology/|title=Scrum: Framework, not methodology|website=Gunther Verheyen|publisher=Gunther Verheyen|last1=Verheyen|first1=Gunther|accessdate=February 24, 2016|date=March 21, 2013}}</ref> The framework challenges assumptions of the traditional, sequential approach to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical [[Colocation (business)|co-location]] or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines involved.

A key principle of Scrum is the dual recognition that customers will change their minds about what they want or need (often called ''requirements volatility''<ref>J. Henry and S. Henry. Quantitative assessment of the software maintenance process and requirements volatility. In Proc. of the ACM Conference on Computer Science, pages 346–351, 1993.</ref>) and that there will be unpredictable challenges—for which a predictive or planned approach is not suited. 

As such, Scrum adopts an evidence-based [[Empirical process|empirical approach]] – accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined up front, and instead focusing on how to maximize the team's ability to deliver quickly, to respond to emerging requirements, and to adapt to evolving technologies and changes in market conditions.

== History ==

[[Hirotaka Takeuchi]] and [[Ikujiro Nonaka]] introduced the term ''scrum'' in the context of [[New product development|product development]] in their 1986 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, 'The New New Product Development Game'.<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\">{{Cite journal|last1=Takeuchi|first1=Hirotaka|last2=Nonaka|first2=Ikujiro|date=January 1, 1986|title=The New New Product Development Game|url=https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG|journal=Harvard Business Review|volume=|pages=|accessdate=June 9, 2010|quote=Moving the Scrum Downfield|via=}}</ref> Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in ''The Knowledge Creating Company''<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=B-qxrPaU1-MC&dq=The+Knowledge+Creating+Company&printsec=frontcover|title= The Knowledge Creating Company|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|year= 1995|accessdate= March 12, 2013|isbn= 9780199762330}}</ref> that it is a form of \"organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally\".

The authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer [[economic sector|industries]].<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> They called this the [[holistic]] or [[Rugby football|rugby]] approach, as the whole process is performed by one [[cross-functional team]] across multiple overlapping phases, in which the team \"tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth\".<ref name=\"TakeuchiNonaka\" /> (In [[rugby football]], a [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] is used to restart play, as the forwards of each team interlock with their heads down and attempt to gain possession of the ball.<ref>{{Oxford&nbsp;Dictionaries|Scrum}}</ref>)

The Scrum framework was based on research by Schwaber with Tunde Babatunde at DuPont Research Station and University of Delaware. Tunde advised that attempts to develop complex products, such as software, that weren't based in empiricism were doomed to higher risks and rates of failure as the initial conditions and assumptions change. Empiricism, using frequent inspection and adaptation, with flexibility and transparency is the most suitable approach.

In the early 1990s, [[Ken Schwaber]] used what would become Scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods; while [[Jeff Sutherland]], John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, referring to it using the single word scrum.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url= https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171122013020/https://www.scrumalliance.org/resource_download/35|archivedate= November 22, 2017|format= PDF|title= Agile Development: Lessons learned from the first Scrum|last= Sutherland|first= Jeff|authorlink= Jeff Sutherland|date= October 2004|accessdate= September 26, 2008 }}</ref>

Ken and Jeff worked together to integrate their ideas into a single framework, Scrum. They tested Scrum and continually improved it, leading to their 1995 paper, contributions to the Agile Manifesto<ref name=\"agilemanifesto\">{{cite web|url=https://agilemanifesto.org|title=Manifesto for Agile Software Development|accessdate=October 17, 2019}}</ref> in 2001, and the worldwide spread and use of Scrum since 2002.

In 1995, Sutherland and Schwaber jointly presented a paper describing the Scrum framework at the Business Object Design and Implementation Workshop held as part of [[OOPSLA|Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications '95]] (OOPSLA '95) in Austin, Texas.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Sutherland|first1= Jeffrey Victor|authorlink1= Jeff Sutherland|last2= Schwaber|first2= Ken|authorlink2= Ken Schwaber|title= Business object design and implementation: OOPSLA '95 workshop proceedings|year= 1995|publisher= [[The University of Michigan]]|isbn= 978-3-540-76096-2|page= 118 }}</ref> Over the following years, Schwaber and Sutherland collaborated to combine this material—with their experience and evolving good practice—to develop what became known as Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />

In 2001, Schwaber worked with [[Mike Beedle]] to describe the method in the book, ''Agile Software Development with Scrum''.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Schwaber|first1= Ken|authorlink1= Ken Schwaber|last2= Beedle|first2= Mike|title= Agile software development with Scrum|year= 2002|publisher= Prentice Hall|isbn= 978-0-13-067634-4 }}</ref> Scrum's approach to planning and managing product development involves bringing [[decision-making]] authority to the level of operation properties and certainties.<ref name=\"schwaber\">{{cite book|title= Agile Project Management with Scrum|url= https://archive.org/details/agileprojectmana0000schw|url-access= registration|last= Schwaber|first= Ken|authorlink= Ken Schwaber|publisher= [[Microsoft Press]]|isbn= 978-0-7356-1993-7|date= February 1, 2004 }}
</ref>

In 2002, Schwaber with others founded the [[Scrum Alliance]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShojBgAAQBAJ|title=The Scrum Culture: Introducing Agile Methods in Organizations|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319118277|series=Management for Professionals|location=Cham|publication-date=2015|page=26|quote=Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland presented Scrum for the first time at the OOPSLA conference in Austin, Texas, in 1995.

Schwaber left the Scrum Alliance in late 2009 and founded Scrum.org<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scrum.org/index|title=Home|website=Scrum.org|language=en|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref> which oversees the parallel ''Professional Scrum'' accreditation series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.leanagile.in/post/54764080535/certified-scrum-master-vs-professional-scrum|title=Certified Scrum Master vs Professional Scrum Master|last=Partogi|first=Joshua|date=July 7, 2013|publisher=Lean Agile Institute|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref>

Since 2009, a public document called ''The Scrum Guide''<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> has been published and updated by Schwaber and Sutherland. It has been revised 5 times, with the current version being November 2017.

== Roles ==
{{original research|section|date=April 2019}}
There are three roles in the Scrum framework.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Agile Scrum Foundation Courseware, Second Edition|last=Rad|first=Nader K.|last2=Turley|first2=Frank|date=2018|publisher=Van Haren|year=|isbn=9789401802796|location='s-Hertogenbosch, Netherlands|pages=26}}</ref> These are ideally co-located to ensure optimal communication among team members. While many organizations have other roles involved with defining and delivering the product, Scrum defines only these three.<ref name=\"scrumguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf|title=The Scrum Guide |website=|publisher=Scrum.org|author1=[[Ken Schwaber]] |author2=[[Jeff Sutherland]]|accessdate=October 27, 2017}}</ref>

=== Product owner ===

The product owner, representing the product's [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and the [[voice of the customer]] (or may represent the desires of a committee<ref name=\":3\" />), is responsible for delivering good business results.<ref name=\"Essential Scrum: Velocity\">{{Citation

The product owner should focus on the business side of product development and spend the majority of their time liaising with stakeholders and the team. The product owner should not dictate how the team reaches a technical solution, but rather will seek consensus among the team members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf|title=The Scrum Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scrum guide|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2016/2016-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf|pages=6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scrumalliance.org/learn-about-scrum/community-webinars/webinar-replays/scrum-fundamentals/the-role-of-the-product-owner|title=The Role of the Product Owner|website=Scrum Alliance|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref>{{better source|date=February 2016|reason=an anon gave the concern that the reference gives the opinion of a single author and could hardly be considered authoritative}} This role is crucial and requires a deep understanding of both sides: the business and the engineers (developers) in the scrum team. Therefore a good product owner should be able to communicate what the business needs, ask why they need it (because there may be better ways to achieve that), and convey the message to all stakeholders including the Development Team using a technical language, as required. The Product Owner uses Scrum’s empirical tools to manage highly complex work, while controlling risk and achieving value.

Communication is a core responsibility of the product owner. The ability to convey priorities and empathize with team members and stakeholders is vital to steer product development in the right direction. The product owner role bridges the communication gap between the team and its stakeholders, serving as a proxy for stakeholders to the team and as a team representative to the overall stakeholder community.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love|last=Pichler|first=Roman|date=March 11, 2010|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=978-0-321-68413-4|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://agilemodeling.com/essays/productOwner.htm|title= The Product Owner Role: A Stakeholder Proxy for Agile Teams|last= Ambler|first= Scott|publisher= agilemodeling.com|access-date= July 22, 2016 |  quote =  [...] in practice there proves to be two critical aspects to this role: first as a stakeholder proxy within the development team and second as a project team representative to the overall stakeholder community as a whole.}}</ref>

As the face of the team to the stakeholders, the following are some of the communication tasks of the product owner to the stakeholders:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Product Owner Role|url=http://scrum-master.thinkific.com/pages/the-product-owner-role|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=February 3, 2017}}</ref>

* Define and announce releases.
* Communicate delivery and team status.
* Share progress during governance meetings.
* Share significant RIDAs (risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions) with stakeholders.
* Negotiate priorities, scope, funding, and schedule.
* Ensure that the product backlog is visible, transparent and clear.

Empathy is a key attribute for a product owner to have—the ability to put one's self in another's shoes. A product owner converses with different stakeholders, who have a variety of backgrounds, job roles, and objectives. A product owner must be able to see from these different points of view. To be effective, it is wise for a product owner to know the level of detail the audience needs. The development team needs thorough feedback and specifications so they can build a product up to expectation, while an executive sponsor may just need summaries of progress. Providing more information than necessary may lose stakeholder interest and waste time. A direct means of communication is the most preferred by seasoned agile product owners.<ref name=\":1\">Cohn, Mike. Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.</ref>

A product owner's ability to communicate effectively is also enhanced by being skilled in techniques that identify stakeholder needs, negotiate priorities between stakeholder interests, and collaborate with developers to ensure effective implementation of requirements.

=== Development team ===

The development team has from three to nine members who carry out all tasks required to build increments of valuable output every sprint.<ref name=\":0\" /> 

While team members are referred to as ''developers'' in some literature<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />, the term refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product, and can include researchers, architects, designers, data specialists, statisticians, analysts, engineers, programmers, and testers, among others.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, due to the confusion that can arise when some people do not feel the term 'developer' applies to them, they are often referred to just as ''team members''. 

The team is self-organizing. While no work should come to the team except through the product owner, and the scrum master is expected to protect the team from too much distraction, the team should still be encouraged to interact directly with customers and/or stakeholders to gain maximum understanding and immediacy of feedback.<ref name=\":0\" />

=== Scrum master ===

Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables.<ref>Carroll, N, O’Connor, M. and Edison, H. (2018). The Identification and Classification of Impediments to Software Flow, The Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS 2018), August 16–18, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.</ref> The scrum master is not a traditional [[team leader|team lead]] or [[project manager]] but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The scrum master ensures that the scrum framework is followed. The scrum master helps to ensure the team follows the agreed processes in the Scrum framework, often facilitates key sessions, and encourages the team to improve. The role has also been referred to as a team facilitator<ref>Leybourn, E. (2013). ''Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management''. London: IT Governance Publishing: 117–120.</ref> or [[servant leadership|servant-leader]] to reinforce these dual perspectives.

The core responsibilities of a scrum master include (but are not limited to):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum/core-scrum-values-roles|title=Core Scrum|website=Scrum Alliance|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref>

* Helping the product owner maintain the product backlog in a way that ensures the needed work is well understood so the team can continually make forward progress
* Helping the team to determine the definition of done for the product, with input from key stakeholders
* Coaching the team, within the Scrum principles, in order to deliver high-quality features for its product<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Lean Mobile App Development: Apply Lean startup methodologies to develop successful iOS and Android apps|last=Drongelen|first=Mike van|last2=Dennis|first2=Adam|last3=Garabedian|first3=Richard|last4=Gonzalez|first4=Alberto|last5=Krishnaswamy|first5=Aravind|date=2017|publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd|year=|isbn=9781786467041|location=Birmingham, UK|pages=43}}</ref>
* Promoting self-organization within the team
* Helping the scrum team to avoid or remove impediments to its progress, whether internal or external to the team
* Facilitating team events to ensure regular progress
* Educating key stakeholders on Agile and Scrum principles
* Coaching the development team in self-organization and cross-functionality

The scrum master helps people and organizations adopt empirical and lean thinking, leaving behind hopes for certainty and predictability. 

One of the ways the scrum master role differs from a project manager is that the latter may have [[Management|people management]] responsibilities and the scrum master does not. A scrum master provides a limited amount of direction since the team is expected to be empowered and self-organizing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|last=Cobb|first=Charles G.|date=2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=|isbn=9781118991046|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=37}}</ref> Scrum does not formally recognise the role of project manager, as traditional [[command and control]] tendencies would cause difficulties.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\">{{cite web|url=http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/Scrum_Primer|title=The Scrum Primer: A Lightweight Guide to the Theory and Practice of Scrum (Version 2.0)|author1=Pete Deemer|author2=Gabrielle Benefield|date=December 17, 2012|publisher=InfoQ|author3=Craig Larman|author4=Bas Vodde}}</ref>

== Workflow ==

=== Sprint ===
[[File:Scrum Framework.png|thumb|right|Scrum framework]]{{Distinguish|Hackathon#Code sprints}}[[File:Scrum process.svg|thumb|The Scrum process]]

A sprint (also known as ''iteration'' or ''timebox'') is the basic unit of development in Scrum. The sprint is a [[timeboxing|timeboxed]] effort; that is, the length is agreed and fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.<ref name=\"schwaber\" />

Each sprint starts with a ''sprint planning'' event that establishes a sprint goal and the required product backlog items. The team accepts what they agree is ready and translate this into a sprint backlog, with a breakdown of the work required and an estimated forecast for the sprint goal. Each sprint ends with a ''sprint review'' and ''sprint retrospective'', that reviews progress to show to stakeholders and identify lessons and improvements for the next sprints.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> 

Scrum emphasizes valuable, useful output at the end of the sprint that is really done. In the case of software, this likely includes that the software has been fully integrated, tested and documented, and is potentially releasable.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" />

=== Sprint planning ===

At the beginning of a sprint, the scrum team holds a sprint planning event<ref name=\"Sprint 2009\">{{cite web|url=http://www.neonrain.com/agile-scrum-web-development|title=Agile SCRUM For Denver Web Development|last=Gangji|first=Arif|last2=Hartman|first2=Bob|year=2015|website=|publisher=Neon Rain Interactive|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref> to:

* Mutually discuss and agree on the scope of work that is intended to be done during that sprint
* Select product backlog items that can be completed in one sprint
* Prepare a sprint backlog that includes the work needed to complete the selected product backlog items
* Agree the '''sprint goal,''' a short description of what they are forecasting to deliver at the end of the sprint.
*The recommended duration is four hours for a two-week sprint (pro-rata for other sprint durations) <ref name=\"scrumguide\" />
** During the first half, the whole scrum team (development team, scrum master, and product owner) selects the product backlog items they believe could be completed in that sprint
** During the second half, the development team identifies the detailed work (tasks) required to complete those product backlog items; resulting in a confirmed sprint backlog
*** As the detailed work is elaborated, some product backlog items may be split or put back into the product backlog if the team no longer believes they can complete the required work in a single sprint
* Once the development team has prepared their sprint backlog, they forecast (usually by voting) which tasks will be delivered within the sprint.

=== Daily scrum ===

[[File:Daily sprint meeting.jpg|thumb|A daily scrum in the computing room. This centralized location helps the team start on time.]]

Each day during a sprint, the team holds a daily scrum (or [[stand-up meeting|stand-up]]) with specific guidelines:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-daily-scrum|title=What is a Daily Scrum?|website=Scrum.org|access-date=January 6, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"schwaber\" />

* All members of the development team come prepared. The daily scrum:
** starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing
** should happen at the same time and place every day
** is limited ([[timeboxing|timeboxed]]) to fifteen minutes
* Anyone is welcome, though only development team members should contribute.
* During the daily scrum, each team member typically answers three questions:
** What did I complete yesterday that contributed to the team meeting our sprint goal?
** What do I plan to complete today to contribute to the team meeting our sprint goal?
** Do I see any impediment that could prevent me or the team from meeting our sprint goal?

Any impediment (e.g., stumbling block, risk, issue, delayed dependency, assumption proved unfounded)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Little|first=Joe|date=January 17, 2011|title=Impediment Management|url=http://agileconsortium.blogspot.com/2011/01/impediment-management.html|publisher=Agile Consortium}}</ref> identified in the daily scrum should be captured by the scrum master and displayed on the team's scrum board or on a shared risk board, with an agreed person designated to working toward a resolution (outside of the daily scrum). While the currency of work status is the whole team's responsibility, the scrum master often updates the sprint burndown chart.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=The Agile Developer's Handbook: Get more value from your software development: get the best out of the Agile methodology|last=Flewelling|first=Paul|date=2018|publisher=Packt Publishing Ltd|year=|isbn=9781787280205|location=Birmingham, UK|pages=91}}</ref> Where the team does not see the value in these events, it is the responsibility of the scrum master to find out why.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Art of Scrum: How Scrum Masters Bind Dev Teams and Unleash Agility|last=McKenna|first=Dave|date=2016|publisher=CA Press|year=|isbn=9781484222768|location=Aliquippa, PA|pages=126|language=en}}</ref> This is part of the responsibility of educating the team and stakeholders about the Scrum principles.<ref name=\":4\" /> 

No detailed discussions should happen during the daily scrum. Once the meeting ends, individual members can get together to discuss issues in detail; such a meeting is sometimes known as a 'breakout session' or an 'after party'.<ref name=\":5\" />

=== Sprint review ===

At the end of a sprint, the team holds two events: the sprint review and the sprint retrospective.

At the sprint review, the team:

* reviews the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed
* presents the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. the [[technology demo | demo]])
* collaborates with the stakeholders on what to work on next

Guidelines for sprint reviews:

* Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated.
* The recommended duration is two hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint-durations).<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />

=== Sprint retrospective ===

At the sprint retrospective, the team:

* Reflects on the past sprint
* Identifies and agrees on [[Continual improvement process|continuous process improvement]] actions

Guidelines for sprint retrospectives:

* Three main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint? What did not go well? What could be improved for better productivity in the next sprint?
* The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (proportional for other sprint duration(s))
* This event is facilitated by the scrum master

=== Backlog refinement ===

Backlog [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]] (formerly called grooming) is the ongoing process of reviewing product backlog items and checking that they are appropriately prepared and ordered in a way that makes them clear and executable for teams once they enter sprints via the sprint planning activity. Product backlog items may be broken into multiple smaller ones. Acceptance criteria may be clarified. Dependencies may be identified and investigated.

Although not originally a core Scrum practice, backlog refinement has been added to the Scrum Guide and adopted as a way of managing the quality of product backlog items entering a sprint, with a recommended investment of up to 10% of a team's sprint capacity.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Cho|first=L|title=Adopting an Agile Culture A User Experience Team's Journey|journal=Agile Conference|year=2009|doi=10.1109/AGILE.2009.76|isbn=978-0-7695-3768-9|pages=416–421}}</ref>

The backlog can also include [[technical debt]] (also known as design debt or code debt). This is a concept in software development that reflects the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

=== Cancelling a sprint ===

The product owner can cancel a sprint if necessary.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" /> The product owner may do so with input from the team, scrum master or management. For instance, management may wish the product owner to cancel a sprint if external circumstances negate the value of the sprint goal. If a sprint is abnormally terminated, the next step is to conduct a new sprint planning, where the reason for the termination is reviewed.

== Artifacts ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

=== Product backlog ===

The product backlog is a breakdown of work to be done<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sedano|first1=Todd|last2=Ralph|first2=Paul|last3=Péraire|first3=Cécile|title=The Product Backlog|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330823863_The_Product_Backlog|publisher=IEEE}}</ref> and contains an ordered list of [[Requirement|product requirements]] that a scrum team maintains for a [[New product development|product]]. Common formats include [[user story|user stories]] and [[use case]]s.<ref name=\"scrumprimer\" /> The requirements define [[Software feature|feature]]s, [[Patch (computing)|bug fix]]es, [[non-functional requirement]]s, etc.—whatever must be done to deliver a viable product. The product owner prioritizes product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, size, and date needed.

The product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is visible to everyone but may only be changed with the consent of the product owner, who is ultimately responsible for ordering product backlog items for the development team to choose.

The product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in [[Planning poker|story points]] using the [[Fibonacci scale (agile)|rounded Fibonacci scale]]. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence the ordering of product backlog items; for example, if two features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the [[return on investment]] is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.batimes.com/articles/authoring-requirements-in-an-agile-world.html|title= Authoring Requirements in an Agile World|publisher= BA Times|first= Tony|last= Higgins|date= March 31, 2009}}</ref>

The product backlog and the business value of each product backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The effort to deliver each item is estimated by the development team in story points, or time. By estimating in story points, the team reduces the dependency in individual developers; this is useful especially in dynamic teams where developers are often assigned to other projects after sprint delivery. For instance, if a user story is estimated as a 5 in effort (using Fibonacci sequence), it remains 5 regardless of how many developers are working on it

Story points define the effort in a time-box, so they do not change with time. For instance, in one hour an individual can walk, run, or climb, but the effort expended is clearly different. The gap progression between the terms in the Fibonacci sequence encourages the team to deliver carefully considered estimates. Estimates of 1, 2 or 3 imply similar efforts (1 being trivial), but if the team estimates an 8 or 13 (or higher), the impact on both delivery and budget can be significant. The value of using story points is that the team can reuse them by comparing similar work from previous sprints, but it should be recognized that estimates are relative to the team. For example, an estimate of 5 for one team could be a 2 for another having senior developers and higher skills.

Every team should have a product owner, although in many instances a product owner could work with more than one team.<ref name=\":1\" /> The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.

The product backlog:

* Captures requests to modify a product—including new features, replacing old features, removing features, and fixing issues
* Ensures the development team has work that maximizes business benefit to the product owner

Typically, the product owner and the scrum team work together to develop the breakdown of work; this becomes the product backlog, which evolves as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.

==== Management ====

A product backlog, in its simplest form, is merely a list of items to work on. Having well-established rules about how work is added, removed and ordered helps the whole team make better decisions about how to change the product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.atlassian.com/agile/backlogs|title=The product backlog: your ultimate to-do list|website=Atlassian|accessdate=July 20, 2016}}</ref>

The product owner prioritizes product backlog items based on which are needed soonest. The team then chooses which items they can complete in the coming sprint. On the scrum board, the team moves items from the product backlog to the sprint backlog, which is the list of items they will build. Conceptually, it is ideal for the team to only select what they think they can accomplish from the top of the list, but it is not unusual to see in practice that teams are able to take lower-priority items from the list along with the top ones selected. This normally happens because there is time left within the sprint to accommodate more work. Items at the top of the backlog, the items to work on first, should be broken down into stories that are suitable for the development team to work on. The further down the backlog goes, the less refined the items should be. As Schwaber and Beedle put it \"The lower the priority, the less detail until you can barely make out the backlog item.\"<ref name=\"schwaber\" />

As the team works through the backlog, it must be assumed that change happens outside their environment—the team can learn about new market opportunities to take advantage of, competitor threats that arise, and feedback from customers that can change the way the product was meant to work. All of these new ideas tend to trigger the team to adapt the backlog to incorporate new knowledge. This is part of the fundamental mindset of an agile team. The world changes, the backlog is never finished.<ref name=\"Pichler, Roman 2010\">Pichler, Roman. ''Agile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love''. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Addison-Wesley, 2010.{{qn|date=March 2017}}</ref>

=== Sprint backlog ===

[[File:Scrum task board.jpg|thumb|A scrum task board]]

The sprint backlog is the list of work the development team must address during the next sprint.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\">{{cite book|author1=Russ J. Martinelli|author2=Dragan Z. Milosevic|title=Project Management ToolBox: Tools and Techniques for the Practicing Project Manager|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SbA7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA304|date=January 5, 2016|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-97320-2|page=304}}</ref> The list is derived by the scrum team progressively selecting product backlog items in priority order from the top of the product backlog until they feel they have enough work to fill the sprint. The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new-sprint, and use this as a guideline of how much 'effort' they can complete.

The product backlog items may be broken down into tasks by the development team.<ref name=\"MartinelliMilosevic2016\" /> Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned (or pushed) to team members by someone else; rather team members sign up for (or pull) tasks as needed according to the backlog priority and their own skills and capacity. This promotes self-organization of the development team and developer buy-in.

The sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like to do, in progress and done.

Once a sprint backlog is committed, no additional work can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.

=== Increment ===

The ''increment'' is the potentially releasable output of the sprint that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous sprints. The increment must be complete, according to the scrum team's ''definition of done'' (DoD), fully functioning, and in a usable condition regardless of whether the product owner decides to actually deploy and use it.

=== Extensions ===

The following artifacts and techniques can be used to help people use Scrum.<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />

==== Sprint burndown chart ====

[[File:SampleBurndownChart.svg|thumb|A sample burndown chart for a completed sprint, showing remaining effort at the end of each day.]]

{{main|Burn down chart}}

The sprint burndown chart is a publicly displayed chart showing remaining work in the sprint backlog.<ref name=\"Cobb2015\">{{cite book|author=Charles G. Cobb|title=The Project Manager's Guide to Mastering Agile: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vHjTBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA378|date=January 27, 2015|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-99104-6|page=378}}</ref> Updated every day, it gives a simple view of the sprint progress. It also provides quick visualizations for reference. The horizontal axis of the sprint burndown chart shows the days in a sprint, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work remaining each day (typically representing the estimate of hours of work remaining).

During sprint planning, the ideal burndown chart is plotted. Then, during the sprint, each member picks up tasks from the sprint backlog and works on them. At the end of the day, they update the remaining hours for tasks to be completed. In such a way, the actual burndown chart is updated day by day.

It should not be confused with an [[earned value management|earned value chart]].

==== Release burn-up chart ====

[[File:SampleBurnupChart.png|thumb|A sample burn-up chart for a release, showing scope completed each sprint (MVP = Minimum Viable Product)]]

The release burn-up chart is a way for the team to provide visibility and track progress toward a release. Updated at the end of each sprint, it shows progress toward delivering a forecast scope. The horizontal axis of the release burn-up chart shows the sprints in a release, while the vertical axis shows the amount of work completed at the end of each sprint (typically representing cumulative story points of work completed). Progress is plotted as a line that grows up to meet a horizontal line that represents the forecast scope; often shown with a forecast, based on progress to date, that indicates how much scope might be completed by a given release date or how many sprints it will take to complete the given scope.

The release burn-up chart makes it easy to see how much work has been completed, how much work has been added or removed (if the horizontal scope line moves), and how much work is left to be done.

==== Definition of ready (DoR) ====
The start criteria to determine whether the [[specification]]s and inputs are set enough to start the work item, i.e. a [[user story]].

==== Definition of done (DoD) ====
The [[exit-criteria]] to determine whether a product backlog item is complete. In many cases, the DoD requires that all [[regression testing|regression tests]] be successful. The definition of done may vary from one scrum team to another but must be consistent within one team.<ref>Ken Schwaber, ''Agile Project Management with Scrum'', p.55</ref>

==== Velocity ====

The total effort a team is capable of in a sprint. The number is derived by evaluating the work (typically in [[user story]] points) completed in the last sprint. The collection of historical velocity data is a guideline for assisting the team in understanding how much work they can likely achieve in a future sprint.

==== Spike ====

A time-boxed period used to research a concept or create a simple prototype. Spikes can either be planned to take place in between sprints or, for larger teams, a spike might be accepted as one of many sprint delivery objectives. Spikes are often introduced before the delivery of large or complex product backlog items in order to secure budget, expand knowledge, or produce a proof of concept. The duration and objective(s) of a spike is agreed between product owner and development team before the start. Unlike sprint commitments, spikes may or may not deliver tangible, shippable, valuable functionality. For example, the objective of a spike might be to successfully reach a decision on a course of action. The spike is over when the time is up, not necessarily when the objective has been delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/spike.html|title=Create a Spike Solution|publisher=Extreme Programming}}</ref>

==== Tracer bullet ====

Also called a drone spike, a tracer bullet is a spike with the current architecture, current technology set, current set of best practices that result in production quality code. It might just be a very narrow implementation of the functionality but is not throwaway code. It is of production quality, and the rest of the iterations can build on this code. The name has military origins as [[Tracer ammunition|ammunition]] that makes the path of the bullet visible, allowing for corrections. Often these implementations are a 'quick shot' through all layers of an application, such as connecting a single form's input field to the back-end, to prove the layers connect as expected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettingagile.com/2007/10/22/research-spikes-tracer-bullets-oh-my/|title=Research, Spikes, Tracer Bullets, Oh My!|last=Sterling|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2007|website=Getting Agile|access-date=October 23, 2016}}</ref>

== Limitations ==

The benefits of Scrum may be more difficult to achieve when:<ref>{{cite journal |title=Limitations of Agile Software Processes |journal=Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Extreme Programming and Flexible Processes in Software Engineering |pages=43–46 |orig-year=2002 |arxiv=1409.6600v1 |last1=Turk |first1=Dan |last2=France |first2=Robert |last3=Rumpe |first3=Bernhard |year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ijser.org/researchpaper/Issues-and-Challenges-in-Scrum-Implementation.pdf |title=Issues and Challenges in Scrum Implementation |journal=International Journal of Scientific & Engineering Research |volume=3 |issue=8 |date=August 2012 |accessdate=December 10, 2015}}</ref>

* '''Teams whose members are geographically dispersed or part-time''': In Scrum, developers should have close and ongoing interaction, ideally working together in the same space most of the time. While recent improvements in technology have reduced the impact of these barriers (e.g., being able to collaborate on a digital whiteboard), the Agile manifesto asserts that the best communication is face to face.<ref name=\"AgileManifesto\">{{cite web|url=http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html|title=Principles behind the Agile Manifesto |year=2001 |website=|publisher=Agile Alliance |author=[[Kent Beck]] |author2=James Grenning |author3=[[Robert Cecil Martin|Robert C. Martin]] |author4=Mike Beedle |author5=[[Jim Highsmith]] |author6=[[Stephen J. Mellor|Steve Mellor]] |author7=Arie van Bennekum |author8=[[Andy Hunt (author)|Andrew Hunt]] |author9=[[Ken Schwaber]] |author10=[[Alistair Cockburn]] |author11=[[Ron Jeffries]] |author12=[[Jeff Sutherland]] |author13=[[Ward Cunningham]] |author14=Jon Kern |author15=[[Dave Thomas (programmer)|Dave Thomas]] |author16=[[Martin Fowler (software engineer)|Martin Fowler]] |author17=[[Brian Marick]] |accessdate=August 7, 2017}}</ref>
* '''Teams whose members have very specialized skills''': In Scrum, developers should have [[T-shaped skills]], allowing them to work on tasks outside of their specialization. This can be encouraged by good Scrum leadership. While team members with very specific skills can and do contribute well, they should be encouraged to learn more about and collaborate with other disciplines.
* '''Products with many external dependencies''': In Scrum, dividing product development into short sprints requires careful planning; external dependencies, such as [[user acceptance testing]] or coordination with other teams, can lead to delays and the failure of individual sprints.
* '''Products that are [[Product life-cycle theory|mature]] or [[Legacy system|legacy]] or with regulated [[quality control]]''': In Scrum, product increments should be fully developed and tested in a single sprint; products that need large amounts of [[regression testing]] or safety testing (e.g., medical devices or vehicle control) for each release are less suited to short sprints than to longer [[waterfall model|waterfall]] releases.

From a business perspective, Scrum has many virtues, one of which is that it is designed to yield the best business solutions. However, the efficiency by which it does so in any given organization can vary widely and is largely dependent on the ability of the organization to adhere to the implementation guidelines. Every company has its own distinct organizational structure, culture, and set of business practices, and some are more naturally amenable to this methodology than others.

== Tools for implementation ==
{{Main|Comparison of Scrum software}}
Like other agile methods, effective adoption of Scrum can be supported through a wide range of tools.

Many companies use universal tools, such as spreadsheets to build and maintain artifacts such as the sprint backlog. There are also open-source and proprietary software packages for Scrum—which are either dedicated to product development using the Scrum framework or support multiple product development approaches including Scrum.

Other organizations implement Scrum without software tools and maintain their artifacts in hard-copy forms such as paper, whiteboards, and sticky notes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://targetprocess.com/download/whitepaper/agiletools.pdf|format=PDF|title=Agile Tools. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly|last=Dubakov|first=Michael|year=2008|accessdate=August 30, 2010 }}</ref>

== Scrum values ==

Scrum is a feedback-driven empirical approach which is, like all empirical process control, underpinned by the three pillars of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. All work within the Scrum framework should be visible to those responsible for the outcome: the process, the workflow, progress, etc. In order to make these things visible, scrum teams need to frequently inspect the product being developed and how well the team is working. With frequent inspection, the team can spot when their work deviates outside of acceptable limits and adapt their process or the product under development.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Scrum: an ideal framework for agile projects|last=Morris|first=David|publisher=In Easy Steps|year=2017|isbn=9781840787313|location=|pages=178–179|oclc=951453155}}</ref>

These three pillars require trust and openness in the team, which the following five values of Scrum enable:<ref name=\"scrumguide\" />

# Commitment: Team members individually commit to achieving their team goals, each and every [[Sprint (software development)|sprint]].
# Courage: Team members know they have the courage to work through conflict and challenges together so that they can do the right thing.
# Focus: Team members focus exclusively on their team goals and the sprint backlog; there should be no work done other than through their backlog.
# Openness: Team members and their stakeholders agree to be transparent about their work and any challenges they face.
# Respect: Team members respect each other to be technically capable and to work with good intent.

== Adaptations ==

The hybridization of Scrum with other software development methodologies is common as Scrum does not cover the whole [[software lifecycle|product development lifecycle]]; therefore, organizations find the need to add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive implementation. For example, at the start of product development, organizations commonly add process guidance on the business case, requirements gathering and prioritization, initial high-level design, and budget and schedule forecasting.<ref>{{Cite journal |author1=Hron, M. |author2=Obwegeser, N.|date=January 2018|title=Scrum in practice: an overview of Scrum adaptations|url=http://pure.au.dk/portal/files/116906219/Hron_Obwegeser_Scrum_in_practice_An_overview_of_Scrum_adaptations.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 2018 51st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS), January 3-6, 2018}}</ref>

Various authors and communities of people who use Scrum have also suggested more detailed techniques for how to apply or adapt Scrum to particular problems or organizations.  Many refer to these methodological techniques as 'patterns' - by analogy with [[design pattern]]s in architecture and software.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/a/scrumorgpatterns.com/www/|title=Scrum as Organizational Patterns |last=Bjørnvig|first=Gertrud|last2=Coplien|first2=Jim|date=June 21, 2008|website=|publisher=Gertrude & Cope}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrumplop.org|title=Scrum Pattern Community |website=ScrumPLoP.org|access-date=July 22, 2016}}</ref> Such patterns have extended Scrum outside of the software development domain into Manufacturing,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agilebusinessmanagement.org/content/wikispeed-%E2%80%93-applying-agile-software-principles-and-practices-fast-automotive-development|title=WIKISPEED – Applying Agile software principles and practices for fast automotive development|date=December 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Agile Business Management Consortium |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Finance and [[Human Resources]].

=== Scrumban ===
{{Main|Scrumban}}

Scrumban is a software production model based on Scrum and [[Kanban (development)|Kanban]]. Scrumban is especially suited for [[Software maintenance|product maintenance]] with frequent and unexpected work items, such as [[Software bug|production defects]] or programming errors. In such cases the time-limited sprints of the Scrum framework may be perceived to be of less benefit, although Scrum's daily events and other practices can still be applied, depending on the team and the situation at hand. Visualization of the work stages and limitations for simultaneous unfinished work and defects are familiar from the Kanban model. Using these methods, the team's [[workflow]] is directed in a way that allows for minimum completion time for each work item or programming error, and on the other hand ensures each team member is constantly employed.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\">{{cite web|url=https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/kanban-scrum-minibook|title=Kanban and Scrum - Making the most of both|last=Kniberg|first=Henrik|last2=Skarin|first2=Mattias|date=December 21, 2009 |website=|publisher=InfoQ|format=PDF|accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>

To illustrate each stage of work, teams working in the same space often use post-it notes or a large whiteboard.<ref name=\"scrumban\">{{cite web|url=http://leansoftwareengineering.com/ksse/scrum-ban/|title=scrum-ban|last=Ladas|first=Corey|date=October 27, 2007|publisher=Lean Software Engineering|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> In the case of decentralized teams, stage-illustration software such as [[Assembla]], [[Jira (software)|JIRA]] or [[Agilo for Trac|Agilo]] can be used.

The major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.<ref name=\"knibergskarin\" />

=== Scrum of scrums ===

The scrum of scrums is a technique to operate Scrum at scale, for multiple teams working on the same product, allowing them to discuss progress on their interdependencies, focusing on how to coordinate delivering software,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" /> especially on areas of overlap and integration. Depending on the cadence (timing) of the scrum of scrums, the relevant daily scrum for each scrum team ends by designating one member as an ambassador to participate in the scrum of scrums with ambassadors from other teams. Depending on the context, the ambassadors may be technical contributors or each team's scrum master.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\">{{cite web |publisher=Agile Alliance |title=Scrum of Scrums |url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/scrumofscrums.html |date=December 17, 2015 }}</ref>

Rather than simply a progress update, the scrum of scrums should focus on how teams are collectively working to resolve, mitigate, or accept any risks, impediments, dependencies, and assumptions (RIDAs) that have been identified. The scrum of scrums tracks these RIDAs via a backlog of its own, such as a risk board (sometimes known as a ''ROAM board'' after the initials of resolved, owned, accepted, and mitigated),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutagile.com/risk-management-how-to-stop-risks-from-screwing-up-your-projects/ |title=Risk Management – How to Stop Risks from Screwing Up Your Projects!|publisher=Kelly Waters}}</ref> which typically leads to greater coordination and collaboration between teams.<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />

This should run similar to a daily scrum, with each ambassador answering the following four questions:<ref>{{cite web|title=Scrum of Scrums|url=http://scrummastertest.com/scrum-of-scrums/|website=Scrum Master Test Prep|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}</ref>

* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions has your team resolved since we last met?
* What risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions will your team resolve before we meet again?
* Are there any new risks, impediments, dependencies, or assumptions slowing your team down or getting in their way?
* Are you about to introduce a new risk, impediment, dependency, or assumption that will get in another team's way?

As [[Jeff Sutherland]] commented,<ref name=\"scrumofscrums\" />

<blockquote>Since I originally defined the Scrum of Scrums (Ken Schwaber was at IDX working with me), I can definitively say the Scrum of Scrums is not a 'meta Scrum'. The Scrum of Scrums as I have used it is responsible for delivering the working software of all teams to the Definition of Done at the end of the sprint, or for releases during the sprint. PatientKeeper delivered to production four times per Sprint. Ancestry.com delivers to production 220 times per two-week Sprint. Hubspot delivers live software 100-300 times a day. The Scrum of Scrums Master is held accountable for making this work. So the Scrum of Scrums is an operational delivery mechanism.</blockquote>

===Large-scale Scrum===
Large-scale Scrum (LeSS) is a product development framework that extends Scrum with scaling rules and guidelines without losing the original purposes of Scrum.

There are two levels to the framework: the first LeSS level is designed for up to eight teams; the second level, known as 'LeSS Huge', introduces additional scaling elements for development with up to hundreds of developers. \"Scaling Scrum starts with understanding and being able to adopt standard real one-team Scrum. Large-scale Scrum requires examining the purpose of single-team Scrum elements and figuring out how to reach the same purpose while staying within the constraints of the standard Scrum rules.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larman |last2=scrumyear=2013 |title=Scaling Agile Development (Crosstalk journal, November / December 2013)|url=http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2013/201305/201305-larman.pdf}}</ref>

Bas Vodde and [[Craig Larman]] evolved the LeSS framework from their experiences working with large-scale product development, especially in the telecoms and finance industries. It evolved by taking Scrum and trying many different experiments to discover what works. In 2013, the experiments were solidified into the LeSS framework rules.<ref>{{cite web|year=2014 |title=Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS)|url=http://less.works}}</ref> The intention of LeSS is to 'descale' organization complexity, dissolving unnecessary complex organizational solutions, and solving them in simpler ways. Less roles, less management, less organizational structures.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Grgic |year=2015 |title=Descaling organisation with LeSS (Blog) |url=https://leanarch.eu/2015/05/09/descaling-organisation-with-less-2/}}</ref>

In 1898 some ghost films were made, the [[Shirō Asano (cameraman)|Shirō Asano]] shorts ''[[Bake Jizo]]'' (Jizo the Spook / 化け地蔵) and ''[[Shinin no sosei]]'' (Resurrection of a Corpse).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/765/J-Horror:+An+Alternative+Guide |title=Seek Japan {{!}} J-Horror: An Alternative Guide |access-date=June 8, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528164551/http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/765/J-Horror:+An+Alternative+Guide |archive-date=May 28, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first documentary, the short ''[[Geisha no teodori]]'' (芸者の手踊り), was made in June 1899. [[Tsunekichi Shibata]] made a number of early films, including ''[[Momijigari (film)|Momijigari]]'', an 1899 record of two famous actors performing a scene from a well-known [[kabuki]] play. Early films were influenced by traditional theater&nbsp;– for example, kabuki and [[bunraku]].

At the dawn of the twentieth century theaters in Japan hired [[benshi]], storytellers who sat next to the screen and narrated silent movies. They were descendants of [[kabuki]] jōruri, [[kōdan]] storytellers, theater barkers and other forms of oral storytelling.<ref>{{cite book| author = Dym, Jeffrey A.| title=Benshi, Japanese Silent Film Narrators, and Their Forgotten Narrative Art of Setsumei: A History of Japanese Silent Film Narration| year=2003| publisher=Edwin Mellen Press| isbn=978-0-7734-6648-7 }}</ref> Benshi could be accompanied by music like silent films from [[Cinema of the United States|cinema of the West]]. With the advent of sound in the early 1930s, the benshi gradually declined.

In 1908, [[Shōzō Makino (director)|Shōzō Makino]], considered the pioneering director of Japanese film, began his influential career with ''Honnōji gassen'' (本能寺合戦), produced for [[Yokota Shōkai]]. Shōzō recruited [[Matsunosuke Onoe]], a former [[kabuki]] actor, to star in his productions. Onoe became Japan's first [[film star]], appearing in over 1,000 films, mostly shorts, between 1909 and 1926. The pair pioneered the ''[[jidaigeki]]'' genre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matsudafilm.com/matsuda/c_pages/c_de.html |title=Who's Who in Japanese Silent Films |accessdate=2007-01-05 |work=Matsuda Film Productions }}</ref> [[Tokihiko Okada]] was a popular romantic lead of the same era.

[[File:Sessue Hayakawa 1918.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Kintaro Hayakawa]], one of the biggest stars in Hollywood during the silent film era of the 1910s and 1920s.]]

Among intellectuals, critiques of Japanese cinema grew in the 1910s and eventually developed into a movement that transformed Japanese film. Film criticism began with early film magazines such as ''Katsudō shashinkai'' (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by [[Yasunosuke Gonda]] in 1914, but many early [[film critics]] often focused on chastising the work of studios like [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Tennenshoku Katsudō Shashin|Tenkatsu]] for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from [[kabuki]] and [[shinpa]] such as [[onnagata]]) and for not utilizing what were considered more [[cinematic techniques]] to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the [[Pure Film Movement]], writers in magazines such as ''[[Kinema Record]]'' called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as [[Norimasa Kaeriyama]], went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as ''[[The Glow of Life]]'' (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, [[Harumi Hanayagi]]). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film ''The Captain's Daughter'', [[Masao Inoue (actor)|Masao Inoue]] started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the [[gendaigeki]] and [[scriptwriting]].<ref>See Bernardi.</ref>

===1920s===
New studios established around 1920, such as [[Shochiku]] and [[Taikatsu]], aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, [[Thomas Kurihara]] directed films scripted by the novelist [[Junichiro Tanizaki]], who was a strong advocate of film reform.<ref>See Lamarre.</ref> Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of [[Eizō Tanaka]]. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], whose later works (including ''[[Ugetsu]]''/''Ugetsu Monogatari'') retain a very high reputation.

Japanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of [[movie stars]] and a new style of [[jidaigeki]]. Directors such as [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]] and [[Masahiro Makino]] made [[samurai films]] like ''[[A Diary of Chuji's Travels]]'' and ''[[Roningai]]'' featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes.<ref>{{cite book| last = Thornton| first = S. A.| title = The Japanese Period Film| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-3136-6 }}</ref> Some stars, such as [[Tsumasaburo Bando]], [[Kanjūrō Arashi]], [[Chiezō Kataoka]], [[Takako Irie]] and [[Utaemon Ichikawa]], were inspired by [[Makino Film Productions]] and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], [[Mansaku Itami]] and [[Sadao Yamanaka]] honed their skills. Director [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]] created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece ''[[A Page of Madness]]'', starring Masao Inoue, in 1926.<ref>See Gerow, ''A Page of Madness''.</ref> Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like [[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]], [[Teikine]], and [[Toa Studios]], could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.

With the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s, there arose so-called [[tendency films]] with left-leaning tendencies. Directors [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]], [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], and [[Tomu Uchida]] were prominent examples. In contrast to these commercially produced [[35mm movie film|35 mm films]], the [[Marxist]] [[Proletarian Film League of Japan]] (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] and [[16 mm film|16mm]]), with more radical intentions.<ref>Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film'', pp. 19–47.</ref> Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: ''[[Sakanaya Honda]], [[Jitsuroku Chushingura]], Horaijima, [[Orochi (film)|Orochi]], Maboroshi, [[Kurutta Ippeji]], [[Jujiro]], [[Kurama Tengu: Kyōfu Jidai]]'', and ''Kurama Tengu''.<ref>[[Japanese films of the 1920s]]</ref>

A later version of ''The Captain's Daughter'' was one of the first [[Sound film|talkie]] films. It used the [[Mina Talkie System]]. The Japanese film industry later split into two groups; one retained the Mina Talkie System, while the other used the Iisutofyon Talkie System used to make Tojo Masaki's films.

The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|1923 earthquake]], the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's [[humidity]] on flammable and unstable [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.

===1930s===
[[File:Humanity and Paper Balloons poster.jpg|thumb|Cinema poster for [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s 1937 ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'']]
Unlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent.<ref>\"[http://filmsound.org/film-sound-history/sound-in-japan.htm The Transition to Sound in Japan]\", Freda Freiberg, Filmsound.org</ref> For instance, [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s ''An Inn in Tokyo'' (1935), considered a precursor to the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was ''[[Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato]]'' (1930), which used the ''[[Mina Talkie System]]''. Notable talkies of this period include [[Mikio Naruse]]'s ''[[Wife, Be Like A Rose!]]'' (''Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni'', 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' (''Gion no shimai'', 1936); ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936); and ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939); and [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'' (1937).

Film criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured \"impressionist\" criticism pursued by critics such as [[Tadashi Iijima]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], and [[Matsuo Kishi]] was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genjū Sasa]] who sought an ideological critique of films.<ref name=\"Gerow\">{{cite book|author1=Aaron Gerow|authorlink1=Aaron Gerow|editor1-last=Miyao|editor1-first=Daisuke|editor1-link=Daisuke Miyao|title=The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199731664|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731664.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199731664-e-005|accessdate=27 April 2018|language=en|chapter=Critical Reception: Historical Conceptions of Japanese Film Criticism}}</ref>

The 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the [[Film Law]], which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing [[propaganda films]] and promoting [[documentary films]] (also called ''bunka eiga'' or \"culture films\"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as [[Fumio Kamei]].<ref>See Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film''.</ref> Realism was in favor; [[film theorist]]s such as [[Taihei Imamura]] and [[Heiichi Sugiyama]] advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]] and [[Tomotaka Tasaka]] produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style.

===1940s===

====Wartime movies====
[[File:Li_Xianglan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]]]]
{{further|War film}}

Because of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.

During this period, when Japan was expanding its Empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942 [[Kajiro Yamamoto]]'s film ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]'' or \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.

[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]] was a very popular actress. She rose to international stardom with 22 wartime movies. The [[Manchukuo Film Association]] let her use the Chinese name Li Xianglan so she could represent Chinese roles in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war she used her official Japanese name and starred in an additional 29 movies. She was elected as a member of the [[Japanese parliament]] in the 1970s and served for 18 years.

[[Akira Kurosawa]] made his feature film debut with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]'' in 1943.

====American Occupation====
[[File:Yoko Sugi and Setsuko Hara in Aoi Sanmyaku.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tadashi Imai]]'s \"[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\" starring [[Yōko Sugi]] and [[Setsuko Hara]] (1949)]]

In 1945, when Japan was defeated in World War II, the rule of Japan by the SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) began. Movies produced in Japan were managed by GHQ's subordinate organization CIE (Civil Information Educational Section, 民間情報教育局). This management system lasted until 1952, and it was the first time in the Japanese movie world that management and control by a foreign institution was implemented. During the planning and scripting stages it was translated to English, only the movies approved by the CIE were produced. For example, [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s “[[Akatsuki no Dassō]]” (1950) was originally a work depicting a Korean military comfort woman starring [[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]], but with dozens of CIE censorship, it became an original work.<ref>「日本映画史１００年」p.134 (100 years of Japanese film history)</ref> The completed film was censored a second time by a CCD ([[Civil Censorship Detachment]]). The censorship was also carried out retroactively to past movie works.<ref>「日本映画史１００年」p.129 (\"100 Years of Japanese Film History\")</ref> Japan was exposed to over a decade's worth of American [[animation]] that were banned under the war-time government.

Furthermore, as part of the occupation policy, the issue of responsibility for war spread to the film industry, and when voices of banning war cooperators in movie production during the war began to be expressed, [[Nagamasa Kawakita]], [[Kanichi Negishi]], [[Shiro Kido]] in 1947, the person who was involved in such high-motion films was exiled. However, as in other genre pursuits, the position of responsibility for war has been dealt with vaguely in the film industry, and the above measures were lifted in 1950.

The first movie released after the war was “Soyokaze” (そよかぜ) 1945 by [[Yasushi Sasaki]], and the theme song “[[Ringo no Uta (1946 song)|Ringo no Uta]]” by [[Michiko Namiki]] was a big hit.

In the production ban list promulgated in 1945 by CIE's David Conde, nationalism, patriotism, suicide and slaughter, brutal violent movies, etc. became prohibited items, making the production of historical drama virtually impossible . As a result, actors who have been using historical drama as their business appeared in contemporary drama. This includes [[Chiezō Kataoka]]'s “[[Bannai Tarao]]” (1946), [[Tsumasaburō Bandō]]'s “[[Torn Drum]] (破れ太鼓)” (1949), [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s “The Child Holding Hands (手をつなぐ子等)”, and [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]]'s “King (王将)”.

In addition, many propaganda films were produced as democratic courtesy works recommended by SCAP. Significant movies among them are, [[Setsuko Hara]] appeared in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s “[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]” (1946), [[Kōzaburō Yoshimura]]'s “[[A Ball at the Anjo House]]” (1947), [[Tadashi Imai]]'s “[[Aoi sanmyaku]]” (1949), etc. It gained national popularity as a star symbolizing the beginning of a new era. In [[Yasushi Sasaki]]'s \"[[Hata no Seishun]] (はたちの青春)\" (1946), the first kiss scene of a Japanese movie was filmed.

The first collaborations between [[Akira Kurosawa]] and actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] were ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' in 1948 and ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' in 1949. [[Yasujirō Ozu]] directed the critically and commercially successful ''[[Late Spring]]'' in 1949.

The [[Mainichi Film Award]] was created in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/cinema/mfa/etc/about.html |script-title=ja:毎日映画コンクールとは |publisher=mainichi.jp|language=ja}}</ref>

===1950s===

The 1950s are widely considered the [[Golden age (metaphor)|Golden Age]] of Japanese cinema.<ref name=Kehr/> Three Japanese films from this decade (''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Tokyo Story]]'') appeared in the top ten of ''[[Sight & Sound]]''{{'}}s critics' and directors' polls for the [[Films considered the greatest ever|best films of all time]] in 2002.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021222042917/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/ BFI | Sight & Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002]</ref> They also appeared in the 2012 polls,<ref name=\"bfi\">{{cite news |authors=Sight & Sound contributors, [[Ian Christie (film scholar)|Ian Christie]] |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time |title=The 50 Greatest Films of All Time |work=[[Sight & Sound]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |origyear=September 2012 |date=August 7, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"2012directors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/sight-sound-2012-directors-top-ten|title=2012 Directors' poll|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref> with ''Tokyo Story'' (1953) dethroning ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' at the top of the [[The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|2012 directors' poll]].<ref name=\"2012directors\"/>

War movies restricted by [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]] began to be produced, Hideo Sekigawa's “[[Listen to the Voices of the Sea]]” (1950), [[Tadashi Imai]]'s “Himeyuri no Tô - Tower of the Lilies” (1953), [[Keisuke Kinoshita]]'s “[[Twenty-Four Eyes]]” (1954), “ [[Kon Ichikawa]]'s “[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]” (1956), and other works aimed at the tragic and sentimental retrospective of the war experience, one after another, It became a social influence. Other Nostalgia films such as [[Battleship Yamato (1953)]] and [[Eagle of the Pacific]] (1953) were also mass-produced. Under these circumstances, movies such as \"Emperor Meiji and the Russo-Japanese War (明治天皇と日露大戦争)\" (1957), where [[Kanjūrō Arashi]] played [[Emperor Meiji]], also appeared. It was a situation that was unthinkable before the war, the commercialization of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] who was supposed to be sacred and inviolable.

The period after the American Occupation led to a rise in diversity in movie distribution thanks to the increased output and popularity of the film studios of [[Toho]], [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei]], [[Shochiku]], [[Nikkatsu]], and [[Toei Company|Toei]]. This period gave rise to the four great artists of Japanese cinema: [[Masaki Kobayashi]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], and [[Yasujirō Ozu]]. Each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by America in unique and innovative ways.

The decade started with [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''Rashomon'' (1950), which won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1951 and the [[Academy Honorary Award|Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1952, and marked the entrance of Japanese cinema onto the world stage. It was also the breakout role for legendary star [[Toshiro Mifune]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Prince, Stephen| title = The Warrior's Camera| year = 1999| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-01046-5 }}, p.127.</ref> In 1953 ''[[Entotsu no mieru basho]]'' by [[Heinosuke Gosho]] was in competition at the [[3rd Berlin International Film Festival]].

The first Japanese film in [[Color motion picture film|color]] was ''[[Carmen Comes Home]]'' directed by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and released in 1951. There was also a black-and-white version of this film available. ''[[Tokyo File 212]]'' (1951) was the first American feature film to be shot entirely in Japan. The lead roles were played by [[Florence Marly]] and Robert Peyton. It featured the geisha [[Ichimaru]] in a short cameo. Suzuki Ikuzo's Tonichi Enterprises Company co-produced the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tokyo File 212: Detail View|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=50894|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]}}</ref> ''[[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]]'', a 1953 film by [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]], was the first movie that filmed using [[Eastmancolor]] film, ''Gate of Hell'' was both [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei]]'s first color film and the first Japanese color movie to be released outside Japan, receiving an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1954 for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] by [[Sanzo Wada]] and an Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It also won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.

The year 1954 saw two of Japan's most influential films released. The first was the [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, [[Ishirō Honda]] directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', which was released in America as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters]]''. Though edited for its Western release, [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]] became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of ''[[kaiju]]'' films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, ''[[Ikiru]]'' was in competition at the [[4th Berlin International Film Festival]].

In 1955, [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for [[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Part I]] of his [[Samurai Trilogy|''Samurai'' trilogy]] and in 1958 won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''[[Rickshaw Man]]''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed two anti-war dramas: ''[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires On The Plain]]'' (1959), along with ''[[Enjo]]'' (1958), which was adapted from [[Yukio Mishima]]'s novel ''Temple Of The Golden Pavilion''. [[Masaki Kobayashi]] made three films which would collectively become known as ''[[The Human Condition (film trilogy)|The Human Condition Trilogy]]'': ''No Greater Love'' (1959), and ''The Road To Eternity'' (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with ''A Soldier's Prayer''.

Kenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including ''The Life of Oharu'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). He won the Silver Bear at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''Ugetsu''. Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. [[Mikio Naruse]] made ''[[Repast (film)|Repast]]'' (1950), ''Late Chrysanthemums'' (1954), ''The Sound of the Mountain'' (1954) and ''Floating Clouds'' (1955). Yasujirō Ozu began directing color films beginning with ''Equinox Flower'' (1958), and later ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' (1959) and ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934), and was shot by ''Rashomon'' and ''Sansho the Bailiff'' cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]].

The [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] were established in 1950. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[Until We Meet Again (1950 film)|Until We Meet Again]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]].

===1960s===
[[File:Toshiro Mifune 1954 Scan10003 160913.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Toshiro Mifune]] was at the center of many of Kurosawa's films.]]

The number of films produced, and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/japanesecinemain195060/ ''Japanese Cinema in the 1950s and 1960s'']</ref> Most films were shown in double bills, with one half of the bill being a \"program picture\" or B-movie. A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as ''[[The Hoodlum Soldier]]'' or ''[[Akumyo series|Akumyo]]''.

The huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Yasujirō Ozu made his final film, ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'', in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama ''[[When a Woman Ascends the Stairs]]'' in 1960; his final film was 1967's ''Scattered Clouds''.

Kon Ichikawa captured the watershed [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] in his three-hour documentary ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]]'' (1965). [[Seijun Suzuki]] was fired by [[Nikkatsu]] for \"making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money\" after his surrealist [[Yakuza film|yakuza flick]] ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' (1967).

The 1960s were the peak years of the ''[[Japanese New Wave]]'' movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. [[Nagisa Oshima]], [[Kaneto Shindo]], [[Masahiro Shinoda]], [[Susumu Hani]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'', ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' and ''[[Death By Hanging]]'', along with Shindo's ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'', Hani's ''[[Kanojo to kare]]'' and Imamura's ''[[The Insect Woman]]'', became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, [[Kazuo Kuroki]], [[Toshio Matsumoto]], and [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. [[Shinsuke Ogawa]] and [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]] became the most important documentarists: \"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\"<ref name=\"Nornes\">{{cite book|last=Nornes|first=Abé Mark|title=The Documentaries of Noriaki Tsuchimoto|chapter=Noriaki Tsuchimoto and the Reverse View Documentary|year=2011|publisher=Zakka Films|pages=2–4}}</ref>

Teshigahara's ''[[The Woman in the Dunes (film)|Woman in the Dunes]]'' (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Foreign Language Film [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. Masaki Kobayashi's ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Bushido, Samurai Saga]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]] won the Golden Bear at the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]]. ''[[Immortal Love]]'' by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and ''[[Twin Sisters of Kyoto]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Chieko]]'', both by [[Noboru Nakamura]], also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Lost Spring]]'', also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[17th Berlin International Film Festival]].

===1970s===

The 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television. Total audience declined from 1.2 billion in 1960 to 0.2 billion in 1980.<ref>
{{cite book|last1=Sato|first1=Tadao|title=Currents in Japanese Cinema|publisher=Kodansha|year=1982|page=244}}</ref>
Film companies fought back in various ways, such as the bigger budget films of [[Kadokawa Pictures]], or including increasingly sexual or violent content and language which could not be shown on television. The resulting [[pink film]] industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the \"[[idol films|idol eiga]]\", films starring young [[Japanese idol|\"idols\"]], who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.

[[File:Nakadai.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tatsuya Nakadai]]]]

[[Toshiya Fujita]] made the revenge film ''[[Lady Snowblood (film)|Lady Snowblood]]'' in 1973. In the same year, [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made the film ''[[Coup d'Etat (1973 film)|Coup d'État]]'', a portrait of [[Ikki Kita]], the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-scène, as well as its avant-garde score by [[Ichiyanagi Sei]], garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.

In 1976 the [[Hochi Film Award]] was created. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' by [[Kon Ichikawa]]. Nagisa Oshima directed ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving [[Sada Abe]] set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.

[[Kinji Fukasaku]] completed the epic ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' series of yakuza films. [[Yoji Yamada]] introduced the commercially successful [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo|''Tora-San'' series]], while also directing other films, notably the popular ''[[The Yellow Handkerchief (1977 film)|The Yellow Handkerchief]]'', which won the first [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Shōhei Imamura retreated to [[Documentary film|documentary work]], though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1979 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (1979).

''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' by Akira Kurosawa and ''[[Sandakan No. 8]]'' by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

===1980s===
The 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios [[Toho]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]] barely staying in business, [[Shochiku]] supported almost solely by the ''Otoko wa tsurai'' films, and [[Nikkatsu]] declining even further.

Of the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' in 1980. [[Shohei Imamura]] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'' (1983). [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made ''[[A Promise (1986 film)|A Promise]]'' (1986), his first film since 1973's ''Coup d'État''.

[[File:1992 Juzo Itami.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Juzo Itami]]]]

New directors who appeared in the 80s include actor [[Juzo Itami]], who directed his first film, ''[[The Funeral (1984 film)|The Funeral]]'', in 1984, and achieved critical and box office success with ''[[Tampopo]]'' in 1985. [[Shinji Sōmai]], an artistically inclined populist director who made films like the youth-focused [[Typhoon Club (film)| Typhoon Club]], and the critically acclaimed Roman porno [[Love Hotel (1985 film)| Love Hotel]] among others. [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.

During the 1980s, [[anime]] gained in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. [[Mamoru Oshii]] released his landmark ''[[Angel's Egg]]'' in 1985. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] adapted his [[manga]] series ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind]]'' into a [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1984. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] followed suit by adapting his own manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' into a [[Akira (1988 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1988.

[[Home video]] made possible the creation of a [[direct-to-video]] film industry.

===1990s===

Because of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex]] in Japan.

[[Takeshi Kitano]] emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993), ''[[Kids Return]]'' (1996) and ''[[Hana-bi]]'' (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Shōhei Imamura again won the Golden Palm (shared with [[Iran]]ian director [[Abbas Kiarostami]]), this time for ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]'' (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining [[Alf Sjöberg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Bille August]].

Kiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of ''[[Cure (film)|Cure]]'' (1997). [[Takashi Miike]] launched a prolific career with titles such as ''[[Audition (1999 film)|Audition]]'' (1999), ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Bird People in China]]'' (1998). Former documentary filmmaker [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] launched an acclaimed feature career with ''[[Maborosi]]'' (1996) and ''[[After Life (film)|After Life]]'' (1999).

Hayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' (1992)&nbsp;– which beat ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) as the [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|highest-grossing film in Japan]]&nbsp;– and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).

Several new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' in 1996. [[Satoshi Kon]] directed the award-winning psychological thriller ''[[Perfect Blue]]''. [[Hideaki Anno]] also gained considerable recognition with ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' in 1997.

===2000s===
[[File:HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hayao Miyazaki]]]]

The number of movies being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Movies based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production. The 1990s and 2000s are considered to be \"Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age\", due to the immense popularity of anime, both within Japan and overseas.<ref name=\"Kehr\">Dave Kehr, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/film-anime-japanese-cinema-s-second-golden-age.html Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2002.</ref>

Although not a commercial success, ''[[All About Lily Chou-Chou]]'' directed by [[Shunji Iwai]] was honored at the Berlin, the Yokohama and the Shanghai Film Festivals in 2001. Takeshi Kitano appeared in ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' and directed and starred in ''[[Dolls (2002 film)|Dolls]]'' and ''[[Zatoichi (2003 film)|Zatoichi]]''. Several horror films, ''[[Kairo (film)|Kairo]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Yogen]]'', [[Ju-on|the ''Grudge'' series]] and ''[[One Missed Call (2004 film)|One Missed Call]]'' met with commercial success. In 2004, ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', directed by [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Godzilla. In 2005, director [[Seijun Suzuki]] made his 56th film, ''[[Princess Raccoon]]''. [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] claimed film festival awards around the world with two of his films ''[[Distance (2001 film)|Distance]]'' and ''[[Nobody Knows (2004 film)|Nobody Knows]]''. Female film director [[Naomi Kawase]]'s film ''[[The Mourning Forest]]'' won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. [[Yoji Yamada]], director of the [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]] series, made a trilogy of acclaimed revisionist samurai films, 2002's ''[[Twilight Samurai]]'', followed by ''[[The Hidden Blade]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Love and Honor (2006 film)|Love and Honor]]'' in 2006.

In anime, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] directed ''[[Spirited Away]]'' in 2001, breaking Japanese box office records and winning several awards—including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] in 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|title=The 75th Academy Awards (2003)|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|url-status=live|accessdate=December 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128072357/http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|archivedate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>—followed by ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Ponyo]]'' in 2004 and 2008 respectively. In 2004, Mamoru Oshii released the anime movie ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'' which received critical praise around the world. His 2008 film ''[[The Sky Crawlers]]'' was met with similarly positive international reception. Satoshi Kon also released three quieter, but nonetheless highly successful films: ''[[Millennium Actress]]'', ''[[Tokyo Godfathers]]'', and ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]''. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] released ''[[Steamboy]]'', his first animated project since the 1995 short film compilation ''[[Memories (1995 film)|Memories]]'', in 2004. In collaboration with [[Studio 4C]], American director [[Michael Arias]] released ''[[Tekkon Kinkreet]]'' in 2008, to international acclaim. After several years of directing primarily lower-key live-action films, [[Hideaki Anno]] formed [[Studio Khara|his own production studio]] and revisited his still-popular ''Evangelion'' franchise with the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' tetralogy, a new series of films providing an alternate retelling of the original story.

In February 2000, the Japan Film Commission Promotion Council was established. On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]]. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government&nbsp;– on both the national and local levels&nbsp;– must lend aid in order to preserve film media. The laws were passed on November 30 and came into effect on December 7. In 2003, at a gathering for the Agency of Cultural Affairs, twelve policies were proposed in a written report to allow public-made films to be promoted and shown at the Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art.

===2010s===

Four films have so far received international recognition by being selected to compete in major film festivals: ''[[Caterpillar (2010 film)|Caterpillar]]'' by [[Kōji Wakamatsu]] was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]] and won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]], ''[[Outrage (2010 film)|Outrage]]'' by [[Takeshi Kitano]] was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Himizu (film)|Himizu]]'' by [[Sion Sono]] was in competition for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]].

In 2011, [[Takashi Miike]]'s ''[[Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai]]'' was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]], the first [[3D film]] ever to screen In Competition at Cannes. The film was co-produced by British independent producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], who had successfully broken Japanese titles such as [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence]]'' and '' [[Taboo (1999 film)|Taboo]]'', [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]'', and Miike's ''[[13 Assassins (2010 film)|13 Assassins]]'' onto the international stage as producer.

In 2018, [[Hirokazu Kore-Eda]] won the Palme d'Or for his movie ''[[Shoplifters (film)|Shoplifters]]'' at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival|71st Cannes Film Festival]], a festival that also featured [[Ryūsuke Hamaguchi]]'s ''[[Asako I & II]]'' in competition.

The [[kinetoscope]], first shown commercially by [[Thomas Edison]] in the United States in 1894, was first shown in Japan in November 1896. The [[Vitascope]] and the [[Lumière Brothers]]' [[Cinematograph]] were first presented in Japan in early 1897,<ref>{{cite book |last=Tsukada |first=Yoshinobu |title=Nihon eigashi no kenkyū: katsudō shashin torai zengo no jijō |publisher=Gendai Shokan |year=1980}}</ref> by businessmen such as [[Inabata Katsutaro]].<ref name=\"Victorian\">{{cite web |last=McKernan |first=Luke|title=Inabata Katsutaro |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/inabata |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |accessdate=14 December 2012}}</ref> Lumière cameramen were the first to shoot films in Japan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Eiga denrai: shinematogurafu to <Meiji no Nihon> |editor1=Yoshishige Yoshida |editor2=Masao Yamaguchi |editor3=Naoyuki Kinoshita |publisher=Iwanami Shoten|location=1995 |isbn=4-00-000210-4}}</ref> Moving pictures, however, were not an entirely new experience for the Japanese because of their rich tradition of pre-cinematic devices such as ''gentō'' (''utsushi-e'') or the [[magic lantern]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Iwamoto |first=Kenji |title=Gentō no seiki: eiga zenʾya no shikaku bunkashi = Centuries of magic lanterns in Japan |publisher=Shinwasha |year=2002 |isbn=978-4-916087-25-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/bunka/museum/kikaku/exhibition02/english/index-e.html |title=Utushi-e (Japanese Phantasmagoria) |last=Kusahara |first=Machiko |year=1999 |publisher=Media Art Plaza |accessdate=29 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528025650/http://plaza.bunka.go.jp/bunka/museum/kikaku/exhibition02/english/index-e.html |archive-date=28 May 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The first successful Japanese film in late 1897 showed sights in Tokyo.<ref>{{cite book| author=Keiko I.

In 1898 some ghost films were made, the [[Shirō Asano (cameraman)|Shirō Asano]] shorts ''[[Bake Jizo]]'' (Jizo the Spook / 化け地蔵) and ''[[Shinin no sosei]]'' (Resurrection of a Corpse).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/765/J-Horror:+An+Alternative+Guide |title=Seek Japan {{!}} J-Horror: An Alternative Guide |access-date=June 8, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528164551/http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/765/J-Horror:+An+Alternative+Guide |archive-date=May 28, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first documentary, the short ''[[Geisha no teodori]]'' (芸者の手踊り), was made in June 1899. [[Tsunekichi Shibata]] made a number of early films, including ''[[Momijigari (film)|Momijigari]]'', an 1899 record of two famous actors performing a scene from a well-known [[kabuki]] play. Early films were influenced by traditional theater&nbsp;– for example, kabuki and [[bunraku]].

At the dawn of the twentieth century theaters in Japan hired [[benshi]], storytellers who sat next to the screen and narrated silent movies. They were descendants of [[kabuki]] jōruri, [[kōdan]] storytellers, theater barkers and other forms of oral storytelling.<ref>{{cite book| author = Dym, Jeffrey A.| title=Benshi, Japanese Silent Film Narrators, and Their Forgotten Narrative Art of Setsumei: A History of Japanese Silent Film Narration| year=2003| publisher=Edwin Mellen Press| isbn=978-0-7734-6648-7 }}</ref> Benshi could be accompanied by music like silent films from [[Cinema of the United States|cinema of the West]]. With the advent of sound in the early 1930s, the benshi gradually declined.

In 1908, [[Shōzō Makino (director)|Shōzō Makino]], considered the pioneering director of Japanese film, began his influential career with ''Honnōji gassen'' (本能寺合戦), produced for [[Yokota Shōkai]]. Shōzō recruited [[Matsunosuke Onoe]], a former [[kabuki]] actor, to star in his productions. Onoe became Japan's first [[film star]], appearing in over 1,000 films, mostly shorts, between 1909 and 1926. The pair pioneered the ''[[jidaigeki]]'' genre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matsudafilm.com/matsuda/c_pages/c_de.html |title=Who's Who in Japanese Silent Films |accessdate=2007-01-05 |work=Matsuda Film Productions }}</ref> [[Tokihiko Okada]] was a popular romantic lead of the same era.

Among intellectuals, critiques of Japanese cinema grew in the 1910s and eventually developed into a movement that transformed Japanese film. Film criticism began with early film magazines such as ''Katsudō shashinkai'' (begun in 1909) and a full-length book written by [[Yasunosuke Gonda]] in 1914, but many early [[film critics]] often focused on chastising the work of studios like [[Nikkatsu]] and [[Tennenshoku Katsudō Shashin|Tenkatsu]] for being too theatrical (using, for instance, elements from [[kabuki]] and [[shinpa]] such as [[onnagata]]) and for not utilizing what were considered more [[cinematic techniques]] to tell stories, instead relying on benshi. In what was later named the [[Pure Film Movement]], writers in magazines such as ''[[Kinema Record]]'' called for a broader use of such cinematic techniques. Some of these critics, such as [[Norimasa Kaeriyama]], went on to put their ideas into practice by directing such films as ''[[The Glow of Life]]'' (1918), which was one of the first films to use actresses (in this case, [[Harumi Hanayagi]]). There were parallel efforts elsewhere in the film industry. In his 1917 film ''The Captain's Daughter'', [[Masao Inoue (actor)|Masao Inoue]] started using techniques new to the silent film era, such as the close-up and cut back. The Pure Film Movement was central in the development of the [[gendaigeki]] and [[scriptwriting]].<ref>See Bernardi.</ref>

===1920s===
New studios established around 1920, such as [[Shochiku]] and [[Taikatsu]], aided the cause for reform. At Taikatsu, [[Thomas Kurihara]] directed films scripted by the novelist [[Junichiro Tanizaki]], who was a strong advocate of film reform.<ref>See Lamarre.</ref> Even Nikkatsu produced reformist films under the direction of [[Eizō Tanaka]]. By the mid-1920s, actresses had replaced onnagata and films used more of the devices pioneered by Inoue. Some of the most discussed silent films from Japan are those of [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], whose later works (including ''[[Ugetsu]]''/''Ugetsu Monogatari'') retain a very high reputation.

Japanese films gained popularity in the mid-1920s against foreign films, in part fueled by the popularity of [[movie stars]] and a new style of [[jidaigeki]]. Directors such as [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]] and [[Masahiro Makino]] made [[samurai films]] like ''[[A Diary of Chuji's Travels]]'' and ''[[Roningai]]'' featuring rebellious antiheroes in fast-cut fight scenes that were both critically acclaimed and commercial successes.<ref>{{cite book| last = Thornton| first = S. A.| title = The Japanese Period Film| year = 2008| publisher = McFarland & Co.| isbn = 978-0-7864-3136-6 }}</ref> Some stars, such as [[Tsumasaburo Bando]], [[Kanjūrō Arashi]], [[Chiezō Kataoka]], [[Takako Irie]] and [[Utaemon Ichikawa]], were inspired by [[Makino Film Productions]] and formed their own independent production companies where directors such as [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], [[Mansaku Itami]] and [[Sadao Yamanaka]] honed their skills. Director [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]] created a production company to produce the experimental masterpiece ''[[A Page of Madness]]'', starring Masao Inoue, in 1926.<ref>See Gerow, ''A Page of Madness''.</ref> Many of these companies, while surviving during the silent era against major studios like [[Nikkatsu]], [[Shochiku]], [[Teikine]], and [[Toa Studios]], could not survive the cost involved in converting to sound.

With the rise of left-wing political movements and labor unions at the end of the 1920s, there arose so-called [[tendency films]] with left-leaning tendencies. Directors [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]], [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]], and [[Tomu Uchida]] were prominent examples. In contrast to these commercially produced [[35mm movie film|35 mm films]], the [[Marxist]] [[Proletarian Film League of Japan]] (Prokino) made works independently in smaller gauges (such as [[9.5 mm film|9.5mm]] and [[16 mm film|16mm]]), with more radical intentions.<ref>Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film'', pp. 19–47.</ref> Tendency films suffered from severe censorship heading into the 1930s, and Prokino members were arrested and the movement effectively crushed. Such moves by the government had profound effects on the expression of political dissent in 1930s cinema. Films from this period include: ''[[Sakanaya Honda]], [[Jitsuroku Chushingura]], Horaijima, [[Orochi (film)|Orochi]], Maboroshi, [[Kurutta Ippeji]], [[Jujiro]], [[Kurama Tengu: Kyōfu Jidai]]'', and ''Kurama Tengu''.<ref>[[Japanese films of the 1920s]]</ref>

A later version of ''The Captain's Daughter'' was one of the first [[Sound film|talkie]] films. It used the [[Mina Talkie System]]. The Japanese film industry later split into two groups; one retained the Mina Talkie System, while the other used the Iisutofyon Talkie System used to make Tojo Masaki's films.

The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|1923 earthquake]], the bombing of Tokyo during World War II, and the natural effects of time and Japan's [[humidity]] on flammable and unstable [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] have resulted in a great dearth of surviving films from this period.

===1930s===
[[File:Humanity and Paper Balloons poster.jpg|thumb|Cinema poster for [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s 1937 ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'']]
Unlike in the West, silent films were still being produced in Japan well into the 1930s; as late as 1938, a third of Japanese films were silent.<ref>\"[http://filmsound.org/film-sound-history/sound-in-japan.htm The Transition to Sound in Japan]\", Freda Freiberg, Filmsound.org</ref> For instance, [[Yasujirō Ozu]]'s ''An Inn in Tokyo'' (1935), considered a precursor to the [[Neorealism (art)|neorealism]] genre, was a silent film. A few Japanese sound shorts were made in the 1920s and 1930s, but Japan's first feature-length talkie was ''[[Fujiwara Yoshie no furusato]]'' (1930), which used the ''[[Mina Talkie System]]''. Notable talkies of this period include [[Mikio Naruse]]'s ''[[Wife, Be Like A Rose!]]'' (''Tsuma Yo Bara No Yoni'', 1935), which was one of the first Japanese films to gain a theatrical release in the U.S.; [[Kenji Mizoguchi]]'s ''[[Sisters of the Gion]]'' (''Gion no shimai'', 1936); ''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936); and ''[[The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums]]'' (1939); and [[Sadao Yamanaka]]'s ''[[Humanity and Paper Balloons]]'' (1937).

Film criticism shared this vitality, with many film journals such as ''[[Kinema Junpo]]'' and newspapers printing detailed discussions of the cinema of the day, both at home and abroad. A cultured \"impressionist\" criticism pursued by critics such as [[Tadashi Iijima]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], and [[Matsuo Kishi]] was dominant, but opposed by leftist critics such as [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genjū Sasa]] who sought an ideological critique of films.<ref name=\"Gerow\">{{cite book|author1=Aaron Gerow|authorlink1=Aaron Gerow|editor1-last=Miyao|editor1-first=Daisuke|editor1-link=Daisuke Miyao|title=The Oxford Handbook of Japanese Cinema|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199731664|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199731664.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199731664-e-005|accessdate=27 April 2018|language=en|chapter=Critical Reception: Historical Conceptions of Japanese Film Criticism}}</ref>

The 1930s also saw increased government involvement in cinema, which was symbolized by the passing of the [[Film Law]], which gave the state more authority over the film industry, in 1939. The government encouraged some forms of cinema, producing [[propaganda films]] and promoting [[documentary films]] (also called ''bunka eiga'' or \"culture films\"), with important documentaries being made by directors such as [[Fumio Kamei]].<ref>See Nornes, ''Japanese Documentary Film''.</ref> Realism was in favor; [[film theorist]]s such as [[Taihei Imamura]] and [[Heiichi Sugiyama]] advocated for documentary or realist drama, while directors such as [[Hiroshi Shimizu (director)|Hiroshi Shimizu]] and [[Tomotaka Tasaka]] produced fiction films that were strongly realistic in style.

===1940s===

====Wartime movies====
[[File:Li_Xianglan.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]]]]
{{further|War film}}

Because of World War II and the weak economy, unemployment became widespread in Japan, and the cinema industry suffered.

During this period, when Japan was expanding its Empire, the Japanese government saw cinema as a propaganda tool to show the glory and invincibility of the [[Empire of Japan]]. Thus, many films from this period depict patriotic and militaristic themes. In 1942 [[Kajiro Yamamoto]]'s film ''[[Hawai Mare oki kaisen]]'' or \"The War at Sea from Hawaii to Malaya\" portrayed the attack on Pearl Harbor; the film made use of special effects directed by [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], including a miniature scale model of Pearl Harbor itself.

[[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]] was a very popular actress. She rose to international stardom with 22 wartime movies. The [[Manchukuo Film Association]] let her use the Chinese name Li Xianglan so she could represent Chinese roles in Japanese propaganda movies. After the war she used her official Japanese name and starred in an additional 29 movies. She was elected as a member of the [[Japanese parliament]] in the 1970s and served for 18 years.

[[Akira Kurosawa]] made his feature film debut with ''[[Sanshiro Sugata|Sugata Sanshiro]]'' in 1943.

====American Occupation====
[[File:Yoko Sugi and Setsuko Hara in Aoi Sanmyaku.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Tadashi Imai]]'s \"[[Aoi sanmyaku]]\" starring [[Yōko Sugi]] and [[Setsuko Hara]] (1949)]]

In 1945, when Japan was defeated in World War II, the rule of Japan by the SCAP ([[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers]]) began. Movies produced in Japan were managed by GHQ's subordinate organization CIE (Civil Information Educational Section, 民間情報教育局). This management system lasted until 1952, and it was the first time in the Japanese movie world that management and control by a foreign institution was implemented. During the planning and scripting stages it was translated to English, only the movies approved by the CIE were produced. For example, [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s “[[Akatsuki no Dassō]]” (1950) was originally a work depicting a Korean military comfort woman starring [[Yoshiko Yamaguchi]], but with dozens of CIE censorship, it became an original work.<ref>「日本映画史１００年」p.134 (100 years of Japanese film history)</ref> The completed film was censored a second time by a CCD ([[Civil Censorship Detachment]]). The censorship was also carried out retroactively to past movie works.<ref>「日本映画史１００年」p.129 (\"100 Years of Japanese Film History\")</ref> Japan was exposed to over a decade's worth of American [[animation]] that were banned under the war-time government.

Furthermore, as part of the occupation policy, the issue of responsibility for war spread to the film industry, and when voices of banning war cooperators in movie production during the war began to be expressed, [[Nagamasa Kawakita]], [[Kanichi Negishi]], [[Shiro Kido]] in 1947, the person who was involved in such high-motion films was exiled. However, as in other genre pursuits, the position of responsibility for war has been dealt with vaguely in the film industry, and the above measures were lifted in 1950.

The first movie released after the war was “Soyokaze” (そよかぜ) 1945 by [[Yasushi Sasaki]], and the theme song “[[Ringo no Uta (1946 song)|Ringo no Uta]]” by [[Michiko Namiki]] was a big hit.

In the production ban list promulgated in 1945 by CIE's David Conde, nationalism, patriotism, suicide and slaughter, brutal violent movies, etc. became prohibited items, making the production of historical drama virtually impossible . As a result, actors who have been using historical drama as their business appeared in contemporary drama. This includes [[Chiezō Kataoka]]'s “[[Bannai Tarao]]” (1946), [[Tsumasaburō Bandō]]'s “[[Torn Drum]] (破れ太鼓)” (1949), [[Hiroshi Inagaki]]'s “The Child Holding Hands (手をつなぐ子等)”, and [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]]'s “King (王将)”.

[[File:Yoshiko Kuga 530406 Scan10007.JPG|thumb|left|150px|[[Yoshiko Kuga]]]]

In addition, many propaganda films were produced as democratic courtesy works recommended by SCAP. Significant movies among them are, [[Setsuko Hara]] appeared in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s “[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]” (1946), [[Kōzaburō Yoshimura]]'s “[[A Ball at the Anjo House]]” (1947), [[Tadashi Imai]]'s “[[Aoi sanmyaku]]” (1949), etc. It gained national popularity as a star symbolizing the beginning of a new era. In [[Yasushi Sasaki]]'s \"[[Hata no Seishun]] (はたちの青春)\" (1946), the first kiss scene of a Japanese movie was filmed.

The first collaborations between [[Akira Kurosawa]] and actor [[Toshiro Mifune]] were ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' in 1948 and ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' in 1949. [[Yasujirō Ozu]] directed the critically and commercially successful ''[[Late Spring]]'' in 1949.

The [[Mainichi Film Award]] was created in 1946.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/enta/cinema/mfa/etc/about.html |script-title=ja:毎日映画コンクールとは |publisher=mainichi.jp|language=ja}}</ref>

===1950s===

The 1950s are widely considered the [[Golden age (metaphor)|Golden Age]] of Japanese cinema.<ref name=Kehr/> Three Japanese films from this decade (''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and ''[[Tokyo Story]]'') appeared in the top ten of ''[[Sight & Sound]]''{{'}}s critics' and directors' polls for the [[Films considered the greatest ever|best films of all time]] in 2002.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20021222042917/http://www.bfi.org.uk/sightandsound/topten/poll/ BFI | Sight & Sound | Top Ten Poll 2002]</ref> They also appeared in the 2012 polls,<ref name=\"bfi\">{{cite news |authors=Sight & Sound contributors, [[Ian Christie (film scholar)|Ian Christie]] |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time |title=The 50 Greatest Films of All Time |work=[[Sight & Sound]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |origyear=September 2012 |date=August 7, 2017 |accessdate=April 24, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"2012directors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/sight-sound-2012-directors-top-ten|title=2012 Directors' poll|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref> with ''Tokyo Story'' (1953) dethroning ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' at the top of the [[The Sight & Sound Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time|2012 directors' poll]].<ref name=\"2012directors\"/>

War movies restricted by [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]] began to be produced, Hideo Sekigawa's “[[Listen to the Voices of the Sea]]” (1950), [[Tadashi Imai]]'s “Himeyuri no Tô - Tower of the Lilies” (1953), [[Keisuke Kinoshita]]'s “[[Twenty-Four Eyes]]” (1954), “ [[Kon Ichikawa]]'s “[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]” (1956), and other works aimed at the tragic and sentimental retrospective of the war experience, one after another, It became a social influence. Other Nostalgia films such as [[Battleship Yamato (1953)]] and [[Eagle of the Pacific]] (1953) were also mass-produced. Under these circumstances, movies such as \"Emperor Meiji and the Russo-Japanese War (明治天皇と日露大戦争)\" (1957), where [[Kanjūrō Arashi]] played [[Emperor Meiji]], also appeared. It was a situation that was unthinkable before the war, the commercialization of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] who was supposed to be sacred and inviolable.

The period after the American Occupation led to a rise in diversity in movie distribution thanks to the increased output and popularity of the film studios of [[Toho]], [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei]], [[Shochiku]], [[Nikkatsu]], and [[Toei Company|Toei]]. This period gave rise to the four great artists of Japanese cinema: [[Masaki Kobayashi]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], and [[Yasujirō Ozu]]. Each director dealt with the effects the war and subsequent occupation by America in unique and innovative ways.

The decade started with [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''Rashomon'' (1950), which won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 1951 and the [[Academy Honorary Award|Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1952, and marked the entrance of Japanese cinema onto the world stage. It was also the breakout role for legendary star [[Toshiro Mifune]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Prince, Stephen| title = The Warrior's Camera| year = 1999| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-01046-5 }}, p.127.</ref> In 1953 ''[[Entotsu no mieru basho]]'' by [[Heinosuke Gosho]] was in competition at the [[3rd Berlin International Film Festival]].

[[File:Fujita Yasuko.JPG|thumb|150px|Fujita Yasuko, an active Japanese actress of the 50s.]]

The first Japanese film in [[Color motion picture film|color]] was ''[[Carmen Comes Home]]'' directed by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and released in 1951. There was also a black-and-white version of this film available. ''[[Tokyo File 212]]'' (1951) was the first American feature film to be shot entirely in Japan. The lead roles were played by [[Florence Marly]] and Robert Peyton. It featured the geisha [[Ichimaru]] in a short cameo. Suzuki Ikuzo's Tonichi Enterprises Company co-produced the film.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tokyo File 212: Detail View|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=50894|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]}}</ref> ''[[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]]'', a 1953 film by [[Teinosuke Kinugasa]], was the first movie that filmed using [[Eastmancolor]] film, ''Gate of Hell'' was both [[Kadokawa Pictures|Daiei]]'s first color film and the first Japanese color movie to be released outside Japan, receiving an [[Academy Honorary Award]] in 1954 for [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] by [[Sanzo Wada]] and an Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film. It also won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the first Japanese film to achieve that honour.

The year 1954 saw two of Japan's most influential films released. The first was the [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]] epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', about a band of hired samurai who protect a helpless village from a rapacious gang of thieves. The same year, [[Ishirō Honda]] directed the anti-nuclear monster-drama ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', which was released in America as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters]]''. Though edited for its Western release, [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla]] became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of ''[[kaiju]]'' films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Also in 1954, another Kurosawa film, ''[[Ikiru]]'' was in competition at the [[4th Berlin International Film Festival]].

In 1955, [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] won an Academy Honorary Award for Best Foreign Language Film for [[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Part I]] of his [[Samurai Trilogy|''Samurai'' trilogy]] and in 1958 won the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''[[Rickshaw Man]]''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed two anti-war dramas: ''[[The Burmese Harp (1956 film)|The Burmese Harp]]'' (1956), which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards, and ''[[Fires on the Plain (1959 film)|Fires On The Plain]]'' (1959), along with ''[[Enjo]]'' (1958), which was adapted from [[Yukio Mishima]]'s novel ''Temple Of The Golden Pavilion''. [[Masaki Kobayashi]] made three films which would collectively become known as ''[[The Human Condition (film trilogy)|The Human Condition Trilogy]]'': ''No Greater Love'' (1959), and ''The Road To Eternity'' (1959). The trilogy was completed in 1961, with ''A Soldier's Prayer''.

Kenji Mizoguchi, who died in 1956, ended his career with a series of masterpieces including ''The Life of Oharu'' (1952), ''[[Ugetsu]]'' (1953) and ''[[Sansho the Bailiff]]'' (1954). He won the Silver Bear at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for ''Ugetsu''. Mizoguchi's films often deal with the tragedies inflicted on women by Japanese society. [[Mikio Naruse]] made ''[[Repast (film)|Repast]]'' (1950), ''Late Chrysanthemums'' (1954), ''The Sound of the Mountain'' (1954) and ''Floating Clouds'' (1955). Yasujirō Ozu began directing color films beginning with ''Equinox Flower'' (1958), and later ''[[Good Morning (1959 film)|Good Morning]]'' (1959) and ''[[Floating Weeds]]'' (1958), which was adapted from his earlier silent ''[[A Story of Floating Weeds]]'' (1934), and was shot by ''Rashomon'' and ''Sansho the Bailiff'' cinematographer [[Kazuo Miyagawa]].

The [[Blue Ribbon Awards]] were established in 1950. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[Until We Meet Again (1950 film)|Until We Meet Again]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]].

===1960s===
[[File:Toshiro Mifune 1954 Scan10003 160913.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Toshiro Mifune]] was at the center of many of Kurosawa's films.]]

The number of films produced, and the cinema audience reached a peak in the 1960s.<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/japanesecinemain195060/ ''Japanese Cinema in the 1950s and 1960s'']</ref> Most films were shown in double bills, with one half of the bill being a \"program picture\" or B-movie. A typical program picture was shot in four weeks. The demand for these program pictures in quantity meant the growth of film series such as ''[[The Hoodlum Soldier]]'' or ''[[Akumyo series|Akumyo]]''.

The huge level of activity of 1960s Japanese cinema also resulted in many classics. Akira Kurosawa directed the 1961 classic ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. Yasujirō Ozu made his final film, ''[[An Autumn Afternoon]]'', in 1962. Mikio Naruse directed the wide screen melodrama ''[[When a Woman Ascends the Stairs]]'' in 1960; his final film was 1967's ''Scattered Clouds''.

Kon Ichikawa captured the watershed [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Olympics]] in his three-hour documentary ''[[Tokyo Olympiad]]'' (1965). [[Seijun Suzuki]] was fired by [[Nikkatsu]] for \"making films that don't make any sense and don't make any money\" after his surrealist [[Yakuza film|yakuza flick]] ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' (1967).

The 1960s were the peak years of the ''[[Japanese New Wave]]'' movement, which began in the 1950s and continued through the early 1970s. [[Nagisa Oshima]], [[Kaneto Shindo]], [[Masahiro Shinoda]], [[Susumu Hani]] and [[Shohei Imamura]] emerged as major filmmakers during the decade. Oshima's ''[[Cruel Story of Youth]]'', ''[[Night and Fog in Japan]]'' and ''[[Death By Hanging]]'', along with Shindo's ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'', Hani's ''[[Kanojo to kare]]'' and Imamura's ''[[The Insect Woman]]'', became some of the better-known examples of Japanese New Wave filmmaking. Documentary played a crucial role in the New Wave, as directors such as Hani, [[Kazuo Kuroki]], [[Toshio Matsumoto]], and [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] moved from documentary into fiction film, while feature filmmakers like Oshima and Imamura also made documentaries. [[Shinsuke Ogawa]] and [[Noriaki Tsuchimoto]] became the most important documentarists: \"two figures [that] tower over the landscape of Japanese documentary.\"<ref name=\"Nornes\">{{cite book|last=Nornes|first=Abé Mark|title=The Documentaries of Noriaki Tsuchimoto|chapter=Noriaki Tsuchimoto and the Reverse View Documentary|year=2011|publisher=Zakka Films|pages=2–4}}</ref>

Teshigahara's ''[[The Woman in the Dunes (film)|Woman in the Dunes]]'' (1964) won the Special Jury Prize at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and Best Foreign Language Film [[Academy Awards|Oscars]]. Masaki Kobayashi's ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' (1965) also picked up the Special Jury Prize at Cannes and received a nomination for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Bushido, Samurai Saga]]'' by [[Tadashi Imai]] won the Golden Bear at the [[13th Berlin International Film Festival]]. ''[[Immortal Love]]'' by [[Keisuke Kinoshita]] and ''[[Twin Sisters of Kyoto]]'' and ''[[Portrait of Chieko]]'', both by [[Noboru Nakamura]], also received nominations for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. ''[[Lost Spring]]'', also by Nakamura, was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[17th Berlin International Film Festival]].

===1970s===

The 1970s saw the cinema audience drop due to the spread of television. Total audience declined from 1.2 billion in 1960 to 0.2 billion in 1980.<ref>
{{cite book|last1=Sato|first1=Tadao|title=Currents in Japanese Cinema|publisher=Kodansha|year=1982|page=244}}</ref>
Film companies fought back in various ways, such as the bigger budget films of [[Kadokawa Pictures]], or including increasingly sexual or violent content and language which could not be shown on television. The resulting [[pink film]] industry became the stepping stone for many young independent filmmakers. The seventies also saw the start of the \"[[idol films|idol eiga]]\", films starring young [[Japanese idol|\"idols\"]], who would bring in audiences due to their fame and popularity.

[[File:Nakadai.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Tatsuya Nakadai]]]]

[[Toshiya Fujita]] made the revenge film ''[[Lady Snowblood (film)|Lady Snowblood]]'' in 1973. In the same year, [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made the film ''[[Coup d'Etat (1973 film)|Coup d'État]]'', a portrait of [[Ikki Kita]], the leader of the Japanese coup of February 1936. Its experimental cinematography and mise-en-scène, as well as its avant-garde score by [[Ichiyanagi Sei]], garnered it wide critical acclaim within Japan.

In 1976 the [[Hochi Film Award]] was created. The first winner for Best Film was ''[[The Inugamis (1976 film)|The Inugamis]]'' by [[Kon Ichikawa]]. Nagisa Oshima directed ''[[In the Realm of the Senses]]'' (1976), a film detailing a crime of passion involving [[Sada Abe]] set in the 1930s. Controversial for its explicit sexual content, it has never been seen uncensored in Japan.

[[Kinji Fukasaku]] completed the epic ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' series of yakuza films. [[Yoji Yamada]] introduced the commercially successful [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo|''Tora-San'' series]], while also directing other films, notably the popular ''[[The Yellow Handkerchief (1977 film)|The Yellow Handkerchief]]'', which won the first [[Japan Academy Prize (film)|Japan Academy Prize]] for Best Film in 1978. New wave filmmakers Susumu Hani and Shōhei Imamura retreated to [[Documentary film|documentary work]], though Imamura made a dramatic return to feature filmmaking with ''[[Vengeance Is Mine (1979 film)|Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (1979).

''[[Dodes'ka-den]]'' by Akira Kurosawa and ''[[Sandakan No. 8]]'' by Kei Kumai were nominated to the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

===1980s===
The 1980s saw the decline of the major Japanese film studios and their associated chains of cinemas, with major studios [[Toho]] and [[Toei Company|Toei]] barely staying in business, [[Shochiku]] supported almost solely by the ''Otoko wa tsurai'' films, and [[Nikkatsu]] declining even further.

Of the older generation of directors, Akira Kurosawa directed ''[[Kagemusha]]'' (1980), which won the Palme d'Or at the [[1980 Cannes Film Festival]], and ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]'' (1985). Seijun Suzuki made a comeback beginning with ''[[Zigeunerweisen (film)|Zigeunerweisen]]'' in 1980. [[Shohei Imamura]] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for ''[[The Ballad of Narayama (1983 film)|The Ballad of Narayama]]'' (1983). [[Yoshishige Yoshida]] made ''[[A Promise (1986 film)|A Promise]]'' (1986), his first film since 1973's ''Coup d'État''.

[[File:1992 Juzo Itami.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Juzo Itami]]]]

New directors who appeared in the 80s include actor [[Juzo Itami]], who directed his first film, ''[[The Funeral (1984 film)|The Funeral]]'', in 1984, and achieved critical and box office success with ''[[Tampopo]]'' in 1985. [[Shinji Sōmai]], an artistically inclined populist director who made films like the youth-focused [[Typhoon Club (film)| Typhoon Club]], and the critically acclaimed Roman porno [[Love Hotel (1985 film)| Love Hotel]] among others. [[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]], who would generate international attention beginning in the mid-1990s, made his initial debut with pink films and genre horror.

During the 1980s, [[anime]] gained in popularity, with new animated movies released every summer and winter, often based upon popular anime television series. [[Mamoru Oshii]] released his landmark ''[[Angel's Egg]]'' in 1985. [[Hayao Miyazaki]] adapted his [[manga]] series ''[[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (manga)|Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind]]'' into a [[Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1984. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] followed suit by adapting his own manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'' into a [[Akira (1988 film)|feature film of the same name]] in 1988.

[[Home video]] made possible the creation of a [[direct-to-video]] film industry.

===1990s===

Because of economic recessions, the number of movie theaters in Japan had been steadily decreasing since the 1960s. The 1990s saw the reversal of this trend and the introduction of the [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex]] in Japan.

[[Takeshi Kitano]] emerged as a significant filmmaker with works such as ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993), ''[[Kids Return]]'' (1996) and ''[[Hana-bi]]'' (1997), which was given the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Shōhei Imamura again won the Golden Palm (shared with [[Iran]]ian director [[Abbas Kiarostami]]), this time for ''[[The Eel (Japanese film)|The Eel]]'' (1997). He became the fifth two-time recipient, joining [[Alf Sjöberg]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Bille August]].

Kiyoshi Kurosawa gained international recognition following the release of ''[[Cure (film)|Cure]]'' (1997). [[Takashi Miike]] launched a prolific career with titles such as ''[[Audition (1999 film)|Audition]]'' (1999), ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Bird People in China]]'' (1998). Former documentary filmmaker [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] launched an acclaimed feature career with ''[[Maborosi]]'' (1996) and ''[[After Life (film)|After Life]]'' (1999).

Hayao Miyazaki directed two mammoth box office and critical successes, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' (1992)&nbsp;– which beat ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) as the [[List of highest-grossing films in Japan|highest-grossing film in Japan]]&nbsp;– and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (1997), which also claimed the top box office spot until ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).

Several new anime directors rose to widespread recognition, bringing with them notions of anime as not only entertainment, but modern art. Mamoru Oshii released the internationally acclaimed philosophical science fiction action film ''[[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell]]'' in 1996. [[Satoshi Kon]] directed the award-winning psychological thriller ''[[Perfect Blue]]''. [[Hideaki Anno]] also gained considerable recognition with ''[[The End of Evangelion]]'' in 1997.

===2000s===
[[File:HayaoMiyazakiCCJuly09.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Hayao Miyazaki]]]]

The number of movies being shown in Japan steadily increased, with about 821 films released in 2006. Movies based on Japanese television series were especially popular during this period. Anime films now accounted for 60 percent of Japanese film production. The 1990s and 2000s are considered to be \"Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age\", due to the immense popularity of anime, both within Japan and overseas.<ref name=\"Kehr\">Dave Kehr, [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/movies/film-anime-japanese-cinema-s-second-golden-age.html Anime, Japanese Cinema's Second Golden Age], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 20, 2002.</ref>

Although not a commercial success, ''[[All About Lily Chou-Chou]]'' directed by [[Shunji Iwai]] was honored at the Berlin, the Yokohama and the Shanghai Film Festivals in 2001. Takeshi Kitano appeared in ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'' and directed and starred in ''[[Dolls (2002 film)|Dolls]]'' and ''[[Zatoichi (2003 film)|Zatoichi]]''. Several horror films, ''[[Kairo (film)|Kairo]]'', ''[[Dark Water (2002 film)|Dark Water]]'', ''[[Yogen]]'', [[Ju-on|the ''Grudge'' series]] and ''[[One Missed Call (2004 film)|One Missed Call]]'' met with commercial success. In 2004, ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', directed by [[Ryuhei Kitamura]], was released to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Godzilla. In 2005, director [[Seijun Suzuki]] made his 56th film, ''[[Princess Raccoon]]''. [[Hirokazu Koreeda]] claimed film festival awards around the world with two of his films ''[[Distance (2001 film)|Distance]]'' and ''[[Nobody Knows (2004 film)|Nobody Knows]]''. Female film director [[Naomi Kawase]]'s film ''[[The Mourning Forest]]'' won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 2007. [[Yoji Yamada]], director of the [[Otoko wa Tsurai yo]] series, made a trilogy of acclaimed revisionist samurai films, 2002's ''[[Twilight Samurai]]'', followed by ''[[The Hidden Blade]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Love and Honor (2006 film)|Love and Honor]]'' in 2006.

In anime, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] directed ''[[Spirited Away]]'' in 2001, breaking Japanese box office records and winning several awards—including the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Best Animated Feature]] in 2003<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|title=The 75th Academy Awards (2003)|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|url-status=live|accessdate=December 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128072357/http://oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2003|archivedate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>—followed by ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[Ponyo]]'' in 2004 and 2008 respectively. In 2004, Mamoru Oshii released the anime movie ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'' which received critical praise around the world. His 2008 film ''[[The Sky Crawlers]]'' was met with similarly positive international reception. Satoshi Kon also released three quieter, but nonetheless highly successful films: ''[[Millennium Actress]]'', ''[[Tokyo Godfathers]]'', and ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]''. [[Katsuhiro Otomo]] released ''[[Steamboy]]'', his first animated project since the 1995 short film compilation ''[[Memories (1995 film)|Memories]]'', in 2004. In collaboration with [[Studio 4C]], American director [[Michael Arias]] released ''[[Tekkon Kinkreet]]'' in 2008, to international acclaim. After several years of directing primarily lower-key live-action films, [[Hideaki Anno]] formed [[Studio Khara|his own production studio]] and revisited his still-popular ''Evangelion'' franchise with the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' tetralogy, a new series of films providing an alternate retelling of the original story.

In February 2000, the Japan Film Commission Promotion Council was established. On November 16, 2001, the Japanese Foundation for the Promotion of the Arts laws were presented to the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]]. These laws were intended to promote the production of media arts, including film scenery, and stipulate that the government&nbsp;– on both the national and local levels&nbsp;– must lend aid in order to preserve film media. The laws were passed on November 30 and came into effect on December 7. In 2003, at a gathering for the Agency of Cultural Affairs, twelve policies were proposed in a written report to allow public-made films to be promoted and shown at the Film Center of the National Museum of Modern Art.

===2010s===

Four films have so far received international recognition by being selected to compete in major film festivals: ''[[Caterpillar (2010 film)|Caterpillar]]'' by [[Kōji Wakamatsu]] was in competition for the Golden Bear at the [[60th Berlin International Film Festival]] and won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]], ''[[Outrage (2010 film)|Outrage]]'' by [[Takeshi Kitano]] was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Himizu (film)|Himizu]]'' by [[Sion Sono]] was in competition for the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[68th Venice International Film Festival]].

In 2011, [[Takashi Miike]]'s ''[[Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai]]'' was In Competition for the Palme d'Or at the [[2012 Cannes Film Festival]], the first [[3D film]] ever to screen In Competition at Cannes. The film was co-produced by British independent producer [[Jeremy Thomas]], who had successfully broken Japanese titles such as [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence]]'' and '' [[Taboo (1999 film)|Taboo]]'', [[Takeshi Kitano]]'s ''[[Brother (2000 film)|Brother]]'', and Miike's ''[[13 Assassins (2010 film)|13 Assassins]]'' onto the international stage as producer.

In 2018, [[Hirokazu Kore-Eda]] won the Palme d'Or for his movie ''[[Shoplifters (film)|Shoplifters]]'' at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival|71st Cannes Film Festival]], a festival that also featured [[Ryūsuke Hamaguchi]]'s ''[[Asako I & II]]'' in competition.

'''Daniel Patrick \"Pat\" Moynihan''' (March 16, 1927&nbsp;– March 26, 2003) was an American [[politician]], [[sociologist]], and diplomat. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he represented [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States Senate]] and served as an adviser to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]. 

Born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Moynihan moved at a young age to [[New York City]]. Following a stint in the navy, he earned a Ph.D. in history from [[Tufts University]]. He worked on the staff of New York Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] before joining President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration in 1961. He served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor under Kennedy and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], devoting much of his time to the [[War on Poverty]]. In 1965, he published the controversial [[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|Moynihan Report]]. Moynihan left the Johnson administration in 1965 and became a professor at [[Harvard University]].

In 1969, he accepted Nixon's offer to serve as an Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and he was elevated to the position of [[Counselor to the President]] later that year. He left the administration at the end of 1970, and accepted appointment as [[United States Ambassador to India]] in 1973. He accepted President [[Gerald Ford]]'s appointment to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1975, holding that position until 1976, when he won election to the Senate.

Moynihan represented New York in the Senate from 1977 to 2001. He served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment Committee]] from 1992 to 1993 and as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] from 1993 to 1995. He also led the [[Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy|Moynihan Secrecy Commission]], which studied the regulation of classified information. He emerged as a strong critic of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s foreign policy and opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]]. He frequently broke with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions, but opposed welfare reform in the 1990s. He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the Congressional authorization for the [[Gulf War]]. He is tied with [[Jacob K. Javits]] as the longest-serving Senator from the state of New York.<ref>[[Chuck Schumer]] will join them when he completes the term to which he was elected in 2016.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Moynihan was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], the son of Margaret Ann (née Phipps), a homemaker, and John Henry Moynihan, a reporter for a daily newspaper in Tulsa.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook|author=H.W.

Brought up in a poor neighborhood of [[Hell's Kitchen]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/15/opinion/the-city-life-recalling-a-complicated-man.html]</ref> he shined shoes, attended various [[Public education|public]], private, and [[parochial school]]s, and ultimately graduated from [[Benjamin Franklin High School (New York, New York)|Benjamin Franklin High School]] in [[East Harlem]]. He was a parishioner of [[Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael (New York City)|St. Raphael's Church]], [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], and also cast his first vote in that church.<ref name=organ>[http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/SSCyrilMethodius.html NYC Organ History Website] (Accessed 24 Jan 2011)</ref>
He and his brother, Michael Willard Moynihan, spent most of their childhood summers at their grandfather's farm in [[Bluffton, Indiana]]. Moynihan briefly worked as a [[longshoreman]] before entering the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), which at that time provided free [[higher education]] to city residents.

Following a year at CCNY, Moynihan joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1944. He was assigned to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Middlebury College]] from 1944 to 1945 and then enrolled as a [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] student at [[Tufts University]], where he received an undergraduate degree in naval science in 1946. He completed active service as [[Gun|gunnery officer]] of the [[USS Quirinus (ARL-39)|USS ''Quirinus'']] at the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] in 1947. Moynihan then returned to Tufts, where he completed a second undergraduate degree in [[sociology]]<ref name=\"nixonlibrary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/central/smof/moynihan.php|publisher=nixonlibrary.gov|title=Daniel Patrick Moynihan|accessdate=2017-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170504/https://nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/central/smof/moynihan.php|archive-date=2016-12-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''cum laude'' in 1948 and earned an [[M.A.]] from the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] in 1949.

After failing the [[Foreign Service Officer]] exam, he continued his doctoral studies at the Fletcher School as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellow]] at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1950 to 1953. During this period, Moynihan struggled with writer's block and began to fashion himself as a \"[[dandy]],\" cultivating \"a taste for [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suits, rococo conversational riffs and Churchillian oratory\" even as he maintained that \"nothing and no one at LSE ever disposed me to be anything but a New York Democrat who had some friends who worked on the docks and drank beer after work.\"<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism|author=Troy, G.|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199920303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyOoaxtz6KoC&pg=PA44|page=44|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>

He ultimately received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[history]] (with a dissertation on the relationship between the United States and the [[International Labour Organization]]) from the Fletcher School in 1961 while serving as an assistant professor of [[political science]] and director of a government research project centered around [[Averell Harriman]]'s papers at [[Syracuse University]]'s [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]].<ref name=\"proquest\">{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302084811/|title=The United States and the International Labor Organization, 1889–1934 – ProQuest|accessdate=2017-01-26|via=ProQuest}}</ref><ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002530045|publisher=search.marquiswhoswho.com|title=Marquis Biographies Online|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>

==Political career and return to academia==
Moynihan's political career started in the 1950s, when he served as a member of New York Governor [[Averell Harriman]]'s staff in a variety of positions (including speechwriter and acting secretary to the governor). He met his future wife, Elizabeth (Liz) Brennan, who also worked on Harriman's staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/27/archives/elizabeth-moynihan-leaves-the-sidelines-for-an-active-role-in.html|title=Elizabeth Moynihan Leaves the Sidelines for an Active Role in Senate Race|website=New York Times}}</ref>

This period ended following Harriman's loss to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 general election. Moynihan returned to academia, serving as a lecturer for brief periods at [[Russell Sage College]] (1957–1958) and the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] (1959) before taking a tenure-track position at Syracuse University (1959–1961). During this period, Moynihan was a delegate to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] as part of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s delegate pool.

===Kennedy and Johnson Administrations; controversy over the War on Poverty===
Moynihan first served in the Kennedy administration as special (1961–1962) and executive (1962–1963) assistant to [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretaries]] [[Arthur J. Goldberg]] and [[W. Willard Wirtz]]. In 1962, he authored the directive \"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\", which discouraged use of an official style for [[Federal building|federal buildings,]] and has been credited with enabling \"a wide ranging set of innovative public building projects\" in subsequent decades, including the [[San Francisco Federal Building]] and the [[United States Courthouse (Austin, Texas, 2012)|United States Courthouse in Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture \"the preferred and default style\" for America's public buildings|last=Pacheco|first=Antonio|date=2020-02-04|website=Archinect|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>

He was then appointed as [[United States Department of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] for Policy, Planning and Research, serving from 1963 to 1965 under Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In this capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities. He devoted his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the [[War on Poverty]]. His small staff included [[Ralph Nader]].

They took inspiration from historian [[Stanley Elkins]]'s ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' (1959). Elkins essentially contended that [[slavery]] had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that such dependence still existed a century later after the American Civil War. Moynihan and his staff believed that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority and must also \"act affirmatively\" in order to counter the problem of historic discrimination.

Moynihan's research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.

Moynihan issued his research in 1965 under the title ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', now commonly known as ''The Moynihan Report''. Moynihan's report<ref name=\"dol\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|publisher=dol.gov|title=U.S. Department of Labor – History – The Negro Family – The Case for National Action (Moynihan's War on Poverty report)|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120102028/https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|archive-date=2017-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks. Critics on the left attacked it as \"[[Victim blaming|blaming the victim]]\",<ref>''The National Review''; March 27, 2003</ref> a slogan coined by psychologist [[William Ryan (psychologist)|William Ryan]].<ref>See William Ryan, ''Blaming the Victim,'' Random House, 1971</ref> Some suggested that Moynihan was propagating the views of racists<ref>Graebner, William. \"The End of Liberalism: Narrating Welfare's Decline, from the Moynihan Report (1965) to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (1996)\", ''Journal of Policy History'', Vol. 14, Number 2, 2002, pp. 170–190</ref> because much of the press coverage of the report focused on the discussion of children being born out of wedlock. Despite Moynihan's warnings, the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program included rules for payments only if no \"Man [was] in the house.\"<ref>http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Man-in-the-House+Rule</ref> Critics said that the nation was paying poor women to throw their husbands out of the house.

After the 1994 [[Republican Revolution|Republican sweep of Congress]], Moynihan agreed that correction was needed for a welfare system that possibly encouraged women to raise their children without fathers: \"The Republicans are saying we have a hell of a problem, and we do.\"<ref name=\"time1994\">{{cite magazine |first=Richard|last=Lacayo|title= Down on the Downtrodden |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982006,00.html |magazine=Time Magazine |date=December 19, 1994 |accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>

===Local New York City politics and ongoing academic career===
By the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], Moynihan was recognized as a political ally of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965. He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the [[New York City Council]], a position now known as the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney [[Frank D. O'Connor]].

During this transitional period, Moynihan maintained an academic affiliation as a fellow at [[Wesleyan University]]'s Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967. In 1966, he was appointed to the faculties of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Graduate School of Public Administration]] as a full professor of education and urban politics. After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his faculty line was transferred to the University's Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the [[Harvard–MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]].<ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\"/> With turmoil and [[riots]] in the United States, Moynihan, \"a national board member of [[Americans for Democratic Action|ADA]] incensed at the radicalism of the current [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[Black Power]] movements\", decided to \"call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives,\"<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [https://www.mises.org/story/1842 Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal], ''[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]''</ref> and wrote that the next administration would have to be able to unite the nation again.

===Nixon Administration===
Connecting with [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968, Moynihan joined the [[Executive Office of the President]] in January 1969 as Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and executive secretary of the Council of Urban Affairs (later the Urban Affairs Council), a forerunner of the [[Domestic Policy Council]] envisaged as an analog to the [[United States National Security Council]]. As one of the few people in Nixon's inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies, he was very influential in the early months of the administration. However, his disdain for \"traditional budget-conscious positions\" (including his proposed Family Assistance Plan, a \"[[negative income tax]] or [[guaranteed minimum income]]\" for families that met work requirements or demonstrated that they were seeking work which ultimately stalled in the Senate despite prefiguring the later [[Supplemental Security Income]] program) led to frequent clashes (belying their unwavering mutual respect) with Nixon's principal domestic policy advisor, conservative economist and [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet-rank]] [[Counselor to the President]] [[Arthur F. Burns]].<ref name=\"bloomberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-28/when-nixon-listened-to-liberal-moynihan|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=When Nixon Listened to Liberal Moynihan – Bloomberg View|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>

While formulating Nixon's [[Guaranteed minimum income|Guaranteed Annual Income]] (GAI) proposal, Moynihan conducted significant discussions concerning a [[Basic Income Guarantee]] with [[Russell B. Long]] and [[Louis O. Kelso]].

Although Moynihan was promoted to Counselor to the President for Urban Affairs with Cabinet rank shortly after Burns was nominated by Nixon to serve as [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] in October 1969, it was concurrently announced that Moynihan would be returning to Harvard (a stipulation of his leave from the University) at the end of 1970. Accordingly, operational oversight of the Urban Affairs Council was given to Moynihan's nominal successor as Domestic Policy Assistant, former [[White House Counsel]] [[John Ehrlichman]]. This decision was instigated by [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H.R. Haldeman]],<ref name=\"google4\">{{cite book|title=The Professor and the President: Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the Nixon White House|author=Hess, S.|date=2014|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815726166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU2aBAAAQBAJ|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref> a close friend of Ehrlichman since college and his main patron in the administration. Haldeman's maneuvering situated Moynihan in a more peripheral context as the administration's \"resident thinker\" on domestic affairs for the duration of his service.<ref name=\"google5\">{{cite book|title=Richard M.

In 1969, on Nixon's initiative, [[NATO]] tried to establish a third civil column, establishing a hub of research and initiatives in the civil area, dealing as well with environmental topics.<ref name=\"Hüne\"/> Moynihan<ref name=\"Hüne\"/> named [[acid rain]] and the [[Greenhouse effect]] as suitable international challenges to be dealt by NATO. NATO was chosen, since the organization had suitable expertise in the field, as well as experience with international research coordination. The German government was skeptical and saw the initiative as an attempt by the US to regain international terrain after the lost [[Vietnam War]]. The topics gained momentum in civil conferences and institutions.<ref name=\"Hüne\">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), [[Kai F. Hünemörder]], Franz Steiner Verlag, 2004 {{ISBN|3-515-08188-7}}</ref>

In 1970, Moynihan wrote a memo to President Nixon saying, \"The time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect'. The subject has been too much talked about. The forum has been too much taken over to hysterics, paranoids, and boodlers on all sides. We need a period in which [[Negro]] progress continues and racial rhetoric fades.\"<ref>[http://www.aol.bartleby.com/73/1579.html \"1579: Daniel Patrick Moynihan (1927–2003)\"].

===US Ambassador===
Following the October 1969 reorganization of the White House domestic policy staff, Moynihan was offered the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] (then held by career Foreign Service Officer [[Charles Woodruff Yost]]) by Nixon on November 17, 1969; after initially accepting the president's offer, he decided to remain in Washington when the Family Assistance Plan stalled in the [[Senate Finance Committee]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|title=Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary|author1=Moynihan, D.|author2=Weisman, S.|date=2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586489205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bm-BjcLtRwwC|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref> On November 24, 1970, he refused a second offer from Nixon due to potential familial strain and ongoing financial problems; depression stemming from the repudiation of the Family Assistance Plan by liberal Democrats; and the inability to effect change due to static policy directives in what amounted to a tertiary role behind [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William P. Rogers]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Instead, he commuted from Harvard as a part-time member of the United States delegation during the ambassadorship of [[George H.W. Bush]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>

In 1973, Moynihan (who was circumspect toward the administration's \"tilt\" to [[Pakistan]]) accepted Nixon's offer to serve as [[United States Ambassador to India]], where he would remain until 1975. The relationship between the two countries was at a low point following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for US embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian [[Indian rupee|rupees]] to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, then equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/11/moynihan-letters-201011 An American Original], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', October 2010</ref> The \"Rupee Deal\" is logged in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the world's largest check, written by Ambassador Moynihan to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].<ref>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/america-can-learn-from-india/1/119060.html America can learn from India], ''[[India Today]]'', November 6, 2010</ref>

In June 1975, Moynihan accepted his third offer to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position (including a rotation as President of the [[United Nations Security Council]]) that he would only hold until February 1976. Under President [[Gerald Ford]], Ambassador Moynihan took a hardline [[anti-communist]] stance, in line with the agenda of the White House at the time. He was also a strong supporter of [[Israel]],<ref>[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0694/9406044.html Daniel Moynihan], WRMEA.</ref> condemning [[UN Resolution 3379]], which declared [[Zionism]] to be a form of [[racism]].<ref name=\"'70s 320\">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/320 320]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/320|url-access= registration}}</ref> Moynihan's wife Liz later recalled being approached in the UN galleries by Permanent PLO Observer to the UN Zehdi Terzi during the controversy. He made a remark of which she later did not remember the exact phrasing, but rendered it approximately as 'you must have mixed feelings about remembering events in New Delhi', which she and biographer Gil Troy interpreted as a threatening reference to a failed assassination plan against her husband two years earler.<ref>[[Troy, Gil]], ''Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism'' (2012), New York: Oxford University Press, page 55, {{ISBN|978-0-19-992030-3}}</ref> But the American public responded enthusiastically to his moral outrage over the resolution; his condemnation of the \"Zionism is Racism\" resolution brought him celebrity status and helped him win a [[US Senate]] seat a year later.<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', page 6</ref> In his book, ''Moynihan's Moment'', [[Gil Troy]] posits that Moynihan's 1975 UN speech opposing the resolution was the key moment of his political career.<ref>[http://www.jewishreviewofbooks.com/publications/detail/with-words-we-govern-men With Words We Govern Men], Suzanne Garment, ''[[Jewish Review of Books]]'', Winter 2013</ref>

Perhaps the most controversial action of Moynihan's career was his response, as Ambassador to the UN, to the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor]] in 1975. [[Gerald Ford]] considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against [[Communism]], which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the [[UN Security Council]] took no action against the larger nation's annexation of a small country. The Indonesian invasion caused the deaths of 100,000–200,000 Timorese through violence, illness, and hunger.<ref name=CAVR>[http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm Chega!

{{quote|The United States wished things to turn out as they did, and worked to bring this about. The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ON2TPWZkiCIC ''A Dangerous Place''], Little Brown, 1980, p. 247</ref>}}

Later, he said he had defended a \"shameless\" [[Cold War]] policy toward East Timor.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pandaemoniumethn00moyn ''Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics''], Oxford University Press 1993, page 153</ref>

Moynihan's thinking began to change during his tenure at the UN. In his 1993 book on nationalism, ''Pandaemonium'', he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the [[Soviet Union]] in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, [[imperialist]] [[Marxist]] state, and more as a weak [[political realism|realist]] state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a [[failed state]] headed for implosion.

Nevertheless, Moynihan's tenure at the UN marked the beginnings of a more bellicose, [[neoconservative]] American foreign policy that turned away from Kissinger's unabashedly covert, [[détente]]-driven [[realpolitik]].<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', p. 159</ref> Although it was never substantiated, Moynihan initially believed that Kissinger directed [[Ivor Richard, Baron Richard]] (then [[British Ambassador to the United Nations]]) to publicly denounce his actions as \"[[Wyatt Earp]]\" diplomacy. Demoralized, Moynihan resigned from what he would subsequently characterize as an \"abbreviated posting\" in February 1976. In ''Pandaemonium'', Moynihan expounded upon this decision, maintaining that he was \"something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired.\"

===Career in the Senate===
In November 1976, Moynihan was elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative [[Bella Abzug]], former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]], New York City Council President [[Paul O'Dwyer]] and businessman [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] in the Democratic primary, and [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]] in the general election. Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York's budget to determine whether it was paying out more in [[Federal spending and taxation across states|federal taxes than it received in spending]]. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the ''[[Fisc]]'' (from the French<ref>[http://fiscreport.org/index02a7.html?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=26 \"The History of the Fisc\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on the Fisc Report website. Retrieved 2010-06-17.</ref>). Moynihan's strong support for Israel while UN Ambassador inspired support for him among the state's large [[Jewish]] population.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan H. Levy|title=The Political Life of Bella Abzug, 1920–1976: Political Passions, Women's Rights, and Congressional Battles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kS9nAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA252|year=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|page=252|isbn=9780739181652}}</ref>

In an August 7, 1978 speech to the Senate, following the jailing of [[M. A. Farber]], Moynihan stated the possibility of Congress having to become involved with securing press freedom and that the Senate should be aware of the issue's seriousness.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-moynihan-sees-need-for-bill-to-guarantee-freedom.html|title=Moynihan Sees Need For Bill to Guarantee Freedom of the Press|date=August 8, 1978|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Moynihan's strong advocacy for New York's interests in the Senate, buttressed by the ''Fisc'' reports and recalling his strong advocacy for US positions in the UN, did at least on one occasion allow his advocacy to escalate into a physical attack. Senator [[Kit Bond]], nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on [[civility]] in political discourse that Moynihan had once \"slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] Moynihan had slipped into a [[highway]] appropriations bill. Some months later Moynihan apologized, and the two occasionally would relax in Moynihan's office after a long day to discuss their shared interest in [[urban renewal]] over a glass of port.\"<ref>[http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2010/06/02/pages/3628/index.xml?page=2& \"Uncivil society: Jim Leach '64 leads an effort to restore respectful discourse to our national life, but it's tough going\"], by Mark F. Bernstein, ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]'', June 2, 2010. Retrieved 2010-06-17.</ref>

Moynihan continued to be interested in foreign policy as a Senator, sitting on the Select Committee on Intelligence. His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate, as he emerged as a critic of the [[Ronald Reagan]] Administration's hawkish [[Cold War]] policies, such as support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in [[Latin America]], or anywhere. He suggested the Soviets were suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising [[ethnic]] [[nationalism]] and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986, editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the Reagan Administration's \"consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism – which is not in fact going on.\" In a September 8, 1990, letter to [[Erwin Griswold]], Moynihan wrote: \"I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the cold war. Huge changes took place, some of which we hardly notice.\"<ref>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]].

Moynihan introduced Section 1706 of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], which cost certain professionals (like computer programmers, engineers, draftspersons, and designers) who depended on intermediary agencies (consulting firms) a self-employed tax status option, but other professionals (like accountants and lawyers) continued to enjoy Section 530 exemptions from payroll taxes. This change in the tax code was expected to offset the tax revenue losses of other legislation that Moynihan proposed to change the law of foreign taxes of Americans working abroad.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/nyregion/new-tax-law-threatens-high-tech-consultants.html \"New Tax Law threatens high-tech consultants\"] by Karla Jennings, ''The New York Times'', February 22, 1987 (p. 11 in paper).

In the mid-1990s, Moynihan was one of the Democrats to support the ban on the procedure known as [[partial-birth abortion]]. He said of the procedure: \"I think this is just too close to [[infanticide]]. A child has been born and it has exited the [[uterus]]. What on Earth is this procedure?\" Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue. He challenged them saying, \"you women are ruining the Democratic Party with your insistence on [[abortion]].\"<ref>''Human Life Review'', Summer 2003, page 13.</ref><ref>Chapter4: Too close to infanticide [https://books.google.com/books?id=WS7IqNEKUFQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT51#v=onepage GB link] at [[Google Books]]</ref>

Moynihan broke with orthodox liberal positions of his party on numerous occasions. As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that \"there is no health care crisis in this country.\"

On other issues though, he was much more progressive. He voted against the [[death penalty]]; the [[flag desecration amendment]];<ref>{{USBill|106|SJ|14}}, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=2&vote=00048#position Record Vote Number: 48]</ref> the [[balanced budget amendment]], the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]]; the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]; the [[Communications Decency Act]]; and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a [[flat tax]]. Moynihan also voted against authorization of the [[Gulf War]]. Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he ended by voting against [[welfare reform]] in 1996, a bill that removed unemployment benefits. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who crossed party lines to support it.

==Public speaker==
Moynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] style. He had some peculiar mannerisms of speech, in the form of slight stuttering and drawn-out vowels for emphasis. Linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] compared his speaking style to that of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|title=William F. Buckley: A Man of Many Words|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88397125|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref>

==Commission on Government Secrecy==
{{Main|Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy}}
[[File:Patrick Moynihan 1998.jpg|thumb|Moynihan in 1998]]
In the post-[[Cold War]] era, the 103rd Congress enacted legislation directing an inquiry into the uses of government secrecy. Moynihan chaired the Commission, which studied and made recommendations on the \"culture of secrecy\" that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.

The Commission's findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] of its classified [[Venona]] file. This file documents the FBI's joint [[counterintelligence]] investigation, with the United States [[Arlington Hall|Signals Intelligence Service]], into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.

After release of the information, Moynihan authored ''Secrecy: The American Experience''<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300080794|title= Secrecy: The American Experience |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.

==Career as scholar==
As a [[public intellectual]], Moynihan published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] in numerous publications, including ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and ''[[The Public Interest]]''.

Moynihan coined the term \"professionalization of reform,\" by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.<ref>''The Public Interest'', volume 1, Issue 1 1965</ref>

In 1983, he was awarded the [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] Award given by the [[American Political Science Association]] \"in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} He wrote 19 books, leading his personal friend, columnist and former professor [[George F. Will]], to remark that Moynihan \"wrote more books than most senators have read.\" After retiring from the Senate, he rejoined the faculty of the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at [[Syracuse University]], where he began his academic career in 1959.

Moynihan's scholarly accomplishments led [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], writing in  ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' to describe the senator as \"the nation's best thinker among politicians since [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and its best politician among thinkers since [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]].\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics 2000 |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |author2=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |publisher=National Journal |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/1090 1090–1091] |quote=Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson, now approaches the end of a long career in public office. |url=https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/1090 }}</ref> Moynihan's 1993 article, \"Defining Deviancy Down\",<ref>''The American Scholar'', vol. 62, no. 1, winter 1993, pp. 17–3</ref> was notably controversial.<ref name=\"sunysuffolk\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm|publisher=www2.sunysuffolk.edu|title=Defining Deviancy|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128102459/http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm|archive-date=2017-01-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"barrypopik\">{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/defining_deviancy_down_daniel_patrick_moynihan|publisher=barrypopik.com|title=The Big Apple: \"Defining deviancy down\" (Daniel Patrick Moynihan)|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>

Moynihan was honored posthumously:
* In 2004, [[Michael Bloomberg]], the Mayor of [[New York City]], announced plans for an expanded and renovated [[Pennsylvania Station (New York)|Penn Station]]. A new [[Amtrak]] and [[Long Island Rail Road]] concourse will be built in the [[James Farley Post Office]] building, a block from the current facility. The new facility would be named \"Moynihan Station\" (later \"Moynihan Train Hall\") in Moynihan's honor. Moynihan had long championed the project, which will be a replica of [[Pennsylvania Station (1910-1963)|the original Penn Station]]; he had shined shoes in the original station as a boy during the Great Depression. During his latter years in the Senate, Moynihan had to secure federal approvals and financing for the project.<ref>[http://www.moynihanstation.org/newsite/2006/07/a_narrative_history_of_penn_st.html Friends of Moynihan Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023437/http://www.moynihanstation.org/newsite/2006/07/a_narrative_history_of_penn_st.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}.

We were on the side of the people who denied this, and a president who could have changed his rhetoric, explained it, told the American people, didn't know the facts, they were secret, and they were kept from him.\"<br />– ''Secrecy: The American Experience'', October 1998<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/114123-1 |title=Secrecy: The American Experience |last1=Moynihan |first1=Daniel |date=21 October 1998 |publisher= C-SPAN |at=44:34 to 45:40 minute mark |location= City University of New York Graduate School |accessdate= 2014-02-05}}</ref><!-- first broadcast 31 October 1998 -->

'''Daniel Patrick \"Pat\" Moynihan''' (March 16, 1927&nbsp;– March 26, 2003) was an American [[politician]], [[sociologist]], and diplomat. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he represented [[New York (state)|New York]] in the [[United States Senate]] and served as an adviser to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]]. 

Born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], Moynihan moved at a young age to [[New York City]]. Following a stint in the navy, he earned a Ph.D. in history from [[Tufts University]]. He worked on the staff of New York Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] before joining President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration in 1961. He served as an Assistant Secretary of Labor under Kennedy and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], devoting much of his time to the [[War on Poverty]]. In 1965, he published the controversial [[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action|Moynihan Report]]. Moynihan left the Johnson administration in 1965 and became a professor at [[Harvard University]].

In 1969, he accepted Nixon's offer to serve as an Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and he was elevated to the position of [[Counselor to the President]] later that year. He left the administration at the end of 1970, and accepted appointment as [[United States Ambassador to India]] in 1973. He accepted President [[Gerald Ford]]'s appointment to the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] in 1975, holding that position until 1976, when he won election to the Senate.

Moynihan represented New York in the Senate from 1977 to 2001. He served as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment Committee]] from 1992 to 1993 and as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]] from 1993 to 1995. He also led the [[Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy|Moynihan Secrecy Commission]], which studied the regulation of classified information. He emerged as a strong critic of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s foreign policy and opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|health care plan]]. He frequently broke with [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions, but opposed welfare reform in the 1990s. He also voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and the Congressional authorization for the [[Gulf War]]. He is tied with [[Jacob K. Javits]] as the longest-serving Senator from the state of New York.<ref>[[Chuck Schumer]] will join them when he completes the term to which he was elected in 2016.</ref>

==Early life and education==
Moynihan was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], the son of Margaret Ann (née Phipps), a homemaker, and John Henry Moynihan, a reporter for a daily newspaper in Tulsa.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook|author=H.W.

Brought up in a poor neighborhood of [[Hell's Kitchen]],<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/15/opinion/the-city-life-recalling-a-complicated-man.html]</ref> he shined shoes, attended various [[Public education|public]], private, and [[parochial school]]s, and ultimately graduated from [[Benjamin Franklin High School (New York, New York)|Benjamin Franklin High School]] in [[East Harlem]]. He was a parishioner of [[Church of Sts. Cyril & Methodius and St. Raphael (New York City)|St. Raphael's Church]], [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], and also cast his first vote in that church.<ref name=organ>[http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/SSCyrilMethodius.html NYC Organ History Website] (Accessed 24 Jan 2011)</ref>
He and his brother, Michael Willard Moynihan, spent most of their childhood summers at their grandfather's farm in [[Bluffton, Indiana]]. Moynihan briefly worked as a [[longshoreman]] before entering the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), which at that time provided free [[higher education]] to city residents.

Following a year at CCNY, Moynihan joined the [[United States Navy]] in 1944. He was assigned to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Middlebury College]] from 1944 to 1945 and then enrolled as a [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] student at [[Tufts University]], where he received an undergraduate degree in naval science in 1946. He completed active service as [[Gun|gunnery officer]] of the [[USS Quirinus (ARL-39)|USS ''Quirinus'']] at the rank of [[lieutenant (junior grade)]] in 1947. Moynihan then returned to Tufts, where he completed a second undergraduate degree in [[sociology]]<ref name=\"nixonlibrary\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/central/smof/moynihan.php|publisher=nixonlibrary.gov|title=Daniel Patrick Moynihan|accessdate=2017-02-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231170504/https://nixonlibrary.gov/forresearchers/find/textual/central/smof/moynihan.php|archive-date=2016-12-31|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''cum laude'' in 1948 and earned an [[M.A.]] from the [[Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]] in 1949.

After failing the [[Foreign Service Officer]] exam, he continued his doctoral studies at the Fletcher School as a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright fellow]] at the [[London School of Economics]] from 1950 to 1953. During this period, Moynihan struggled with writer's block and began to fashion himself as a \"[[dandy]],\" cultivating \"a taste for [[Savile Row tailoring|Savile Row]] suits, rococo conversational riffs and Churchillian oratory\" even as he maintained that \"nothing and no one at LSE ever disposed me to be anything but a New York Democrat who had some friends who worked on the docks and drank beer after work.\"<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism|author=Troy, G.|date=2013|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=9780199920303|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fyOoaxtz6KoC&pg=PA44|page=44|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>

He ultimately received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[history]] (with a dissertation on the relationship between the United States and the [[International Labour Organization]]) from the Fletcher School in 1961 while serving as an assistant professor of [[political science]] and director of a government research project centered around [[Averell Harriman]]'s papers at [[Syracuse University]]'s [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]].<ref name=\"proquest\">{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/302084811/|title=The United States and the International Labor Organization, 1889–1934 – ProQuest|accessdate=2017-01-26|via=ProQuest}}</ref><ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\">{{cite web|url=http://search.marquiswhoswho.com/profile/100002530045|publisher=search.marquiswhoswho.com|title=Marquis Biographies Online|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>

==Political career and return to academia==
Moynihan's political career started in the 1950s, when he served as a member of New York Governor [[Averell Harriman]]'s staff in a variety of positions (including speechwriter and acting secretary to the governor). He met his future wife, Elizabeth (Liz) Brennan, who also worked on Harriman's staff.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/27/archives/elizabeth-moynihan-leaves-the-sidelines-for-an-active-role-in.html|title=Elizabeth Moynihan Leaves the Sidelines for an Active Role in Senate Race|website=New York Times}}</ref>

This period ended following Harriman's loss to [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in the 1958 general election. Moynihan returned to academia, serving as a lecturer for brief periods at [[Russell Sage College]] (1957–1958) and the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]] (1959) before taking a tenure-track position at Syracuse University (1959–1961). During this period, Moynihan was a delegate to the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] as part of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s delegate pool.

===Kennedy and Johnson Administrations; controversy over the War on Poverty===
Moynihan first served in the Kennedy administration as special (1961–1962) and executive (1962–1963) assistant to [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretaries]] [[Arthur J. Goldberg]] and [[W. Willard Wirtz]]. In 1962, he authored the directive \"Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture\", which discouraged use of an official style for [[Federal building|federal buildings,]] and has been credited with enabling \"a wide ranging set of innovative public building projects\" in subsequent decades, including the [[San Francisco Federal Building]] and the [[United States Courthouse (Austin, Texas, 2012)|United States Courthouse in Austin, Texas]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archinect.com/news/article/150182232/new-executive-order-could-make-classical-architecture-the-preferred-and-default-style-for-america-s-public-buildings|title=New executive order could make classical architecture \"the preferred and default style\" for America's public buildings|last=Pacheco|first=Antonio|date=2020-02-04|website=Archinect|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-09}}</ref>

He was then appointed as [[United States Department of Labor|Assistant Secretary of Labor]] for Policy, Planning and Research, serving from 1963 to 1965 under Kennedy and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In this capacity, he did not have operational responsibilities. He devoted his time to trying to formulate national policy for what would become the [[War on Poverty]]. His small staff included [[Ralph Nader]].

They took inspiration from historian [[Stanley Elkins]]'s ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' (1959). Elkins essentially contended that [[slavery]] had made black Americans dependent on the dominant society, and that such dependence still existed a century later after the American Civil War. Moynihan and his staff believed that government must go beyond simply ensuring that members of minority groups have the same rights as the majority and must also \"act affirmatively\" in order to counter the problem of historic discrimination.

Moynihan's research of Labor Department data demonstrated that even as fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (almost invariably the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments in certain parts of the United States.

Moynihan issued his research in 1965 under the title ''[[The Negro Family: The Case For National Action]]'', now commonly known as ''The Moynihan Report''. Moynihan's report<ref name=\"dol\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|publisher=dol.gov|title=U.S. Department of Labor – History – The Negro Family – The Case for National Action (Moynihan's War on Poverty report)|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170120102028/https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/webid-meynihan.htm|archive-date=2017-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> fueled a debate over the proper course for government to take with regard to the economic underclass, especially blacks. Critics on the left attacked it as \"[[Victim blaming|blaming the victim]]\",<ref>''The National Review''; March 27, 2003</ref> a slogan coined by psychologist [[William Ryan (psychologist)|William Ryan]].<ref>See William Ryan, ''Blaming the Victim,'' Random House, 1971</ref> Some suggested that Moynihan was propagating the views of racists<ref>Graebner, William. \"The End of Liberalism: Narrating Welfare's Decline, from the Moynihan Report (1965) to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act (1996)\", ''Journal of Policy History'', Vol. 14, Number 2, 2002, pp. 170–190</ref> because much of the press coverage of the report focused on the discussion of children being born out of wedlock. Despite Moynihan's warnings, the [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program included rules for payments only if no \"Man [was] in the house.\"<ref>http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Man-in-the-House+Rule</ref> Critics said that the nation was paying poor women to throw their husbands out of the house.

After the 1994 [[Republican Revolution|Republican sweep of Congress]], Moynihan agreed that correction was needed for a welfare system that possibly encouraged women to raise their children without fathers: \"The Republicans are saying we have a hell of a problem, and we do.\"<ref name=\"time1994\">{{cite magazine |first=Richard|last=Lacayo|title= Down on the Downtrodden |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982006,00.html |magazine=Time Magazine |date=December 19, 1994 |accessdate=2007-07-22}}</ref>

===Local New York City politics and ongoing academic career===
By the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 presidential election]], Moynihan was recognized as a political ally of [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. For this reason he was not favored by then-President Johnson, and he left the Johnson Administration in 1965. He ran for office in the Democratic Party primary for the presidency of the [[New York City Council]], a position now known as the [[New York City Public Advocate]]. However, he was defeated by Queens District Attorney [[Frank D. O'Connor]].

During this transitional period, Moynihan maintained an academic affiliation as a fellow at [[Wesleyan University]]'s Center for Advanced Studies from 1964 to 1967. In 1966, he was appointed to the faculties of [[Harvard University]]'s [[Harvard Graduate School of Education|Graduate School of Education]] and [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Graduate School of Public Administration]] as a full professor of education and urban politics. After commencing a second extended leave because of his public service in 1973, his faculty line was transferred to the University's Department of Government, where he remained until 1977. From 1966 to 1969, he also held a secondary administrative appointment as director of the [[Harvard–MIT Joint Center for Urban Studies]].<ref name=\"search.marquiswhoswho.com\"/> With turmoil and [[riots]] in the United States, Moynihan, \"a national board member of [[Americans for Democratic Action|ADA]] incensed at the radicalism of the current [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war]] and [[Black Power]] movements\", decided to \"call for a formal alliance between liberals and conservatives,\"<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray N.]]. [https://www.mises.org/story/1842 Confessions of a Right-Wing Liberal], ''[[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]''</ref> and wrote that the next administration would have to be able to unite the nation again.

===Nixon Administration===
Connecting with [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] [[Richard Nixon]] in 1968, Moynihan joined the [[Executive Office of the President]] in January 1969 as Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and executive secretary of the Council of Urban Affairs (later the Urban Affairs Council), a forerunner of the [[Domestic Policy Council]] envisaged as an analog to the [[United States National Security Council]]. As one of the few people in Nixon's inner circle who had done academic research related to social policies, he was very influential in the early months of the administration. However, his disdain for \"traditional budget-conscious positions\" (including his proposed Family Assistance Plan, a \"[[negative income tax]] or [[guaranteed minimum income]]\" for families that met work requirements or demonstrated that they were seeking work which ultimately stalled in the Senate despite prefiguring the later [[Supplemental Security Income]] program) led to frequent clashes (belying their unwavering mutual respect) with Nixon's principal domestic policy advisor, conservative economist and [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet-rank]] [[Counselor to the President]] [[Arthur F. Burns]].<ref name=\"bloomberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-12-28/when-nixon-listened-to-liberal-moynihan|publisher=bloomberg.com|title=When Nixon Listened to Liberal Moynihan – Bloomberg View|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>

While formulating Nixon's [[Guaranteed minimum income|Guaranteed Annual Income]] (GAI) proposal, Moynihan conducted significant discussions concerning a [[Basic Income Guarantee]] with [[Russell B. Long]] and [[Louis O. Kelso]].

Although Moynihan was promoted to Counselor to the President for Urban Affairs with Cabinet rank shortly after Burns was nominated by Nixon to serve as [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] in October 1969, it was concurrently announced that Moynihan would be returning to Harvard (a stipulation of his leave from the University) at the end of 1970. Accordingly, operational oversight of the Urban Affairs Council was given to Moynihan's nominal successor as Domestic Policy Assistant, former [[White House Counsel]] [[John Ehrlichman]]. This decision was instigated by [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[H.R. Haldeman]],<ref name=\"google4\">{{cite book|title=The Professor and the President: Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the Nixon White House|author=Hess, S.|date=2014|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=9780815726166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU2aBAAAQBAJ|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref> a close friend of Ehrlichman since college and his main patron in the administration.

In 1969, on Nixon's initiative, [[NATO]] tried to establish a third civil column, establishing a hub of research and initiatives in the civil area, dealing as well with environmental topics.<ref name=\"Hüne\"/> Moynihan<ref name=\"Hüne\"/> named [[acid rain]] and the [[Greenhouse effect]] as suitable international challenges to be dealt by NATO. NATO was chosen, since the organization had suitable expertise in the field, as well as experience with international research coordination. The German government was skeptical and saw the initiative as an attempt by the US to regain international terrain after the lost [[Vietnam War]]. The topics gained momentum in civil conferences and institutions.<ref name=\"Hüne\">Die Frühgeschichte der globalen Umweltkrise und die Formierung der deutschen Umweltpolitik(1950–1973) (Early history of the environmental crisis and the setup of German environmental policy 1950–1973), [[Kai F.

In 1970, Moynihan wrote a memo to President Nixon saying, \"The time may have come when the issue of race could benefit from a period of 'benign neglect'. The subject has been too much talked about. The forum has been too much taken over to hysterics, paranoids, and boodlers on all sides.

===US Ambassador===
Following the October 1969 reorganization of the White House domestic policy staff, Moynihan was offered the position of [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]] (then held by career Foreign Service Officer [[Charles Woodruff Yost]]) by Nixon on November 17, 1969; after initially accepting the president's offer, he decided to remain in Washington when the Family Assistance Plan stalled in the [[Senate Finance Committee]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\">{{cite book|title=Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an American Visionary|author1=Moynihan, D.|author2=Weisman, S.|date=2010|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781586489205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bm-BjcLtRwwC|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref> On November 24, 1970, he refused a second offer from Nixon due to potential familial strain and ongoing financial problems; depression stemming from the repudiation of the Family Assistance Plan by liberal Democrats; and the inability to effect change due to static policy directives in what amounted to a tertiary role behind [[Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William P. Rogers]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/> Instead, he commuted from Harvard as a part-time member of the United States delegation during the ambassadorship of [[George H.W. Bush]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>

In 1973, Moynihan (who was circumspect toward the administration's \"tilt\" to [[Pakistan]]) accepted Nixon's offer to serve as [[United States Ambassador to India]], where he would remain until 1975. The relationship between the two countries was at a low point following the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. Ambassador Moynihan was alarmed that two great democracies were cast as antagonists, and set out to fix things. He proposed that part of the burdensome debt be written off, part used to pay for US embassy expenses in India, and the remaining converted into Indian [[Indian rupee|rupees]] to fund an Indo-US cultural and educational exchange program that lasted for a quarter century. On February 18, 1974, he presented to the Government of India a check for 16,640,000,000 rupees, then equivalent to $2,046,700,000, which was the greatest amount paid by a single check in the history of banking.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2010/11/moynihan-letters-201011 An American Original], ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', October 2010</ref> The \"Rupee Deal\" is logged in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the world's largest check, written by Ambassador Moynihan to Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].<ref>[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/america-can-learn-from-india/1/119060.html America can learn from India], ''[[India Today]]'', November 6, 2010</ref>

In June 1975, Moynihan accepted his third offer to serve as United States Ambassador to the United Nations, a position (including a rotation as President of the [[United Nations Security Council]]) that he would only hold until February 1976. Under President [[Gerald Ford]], Ambassador Moynihan took a hardline [[anti-communist]] stance, in line with the agenda of the White House at the time. He was also a strong supporter of [[Israel]],<ref>[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0694/9406044.html Daniel Moynihan], WRMEA.</ref> condemning [[UN Resolution 3379]], which declared [[Zionism]] to be a form of [[racism]].<ref name=\"'70s 320\">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/320 320]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/320|url-access= registration}}</ref> Moynihan's wife Liz later recalled being approached in the UN galleries by Permanent PLO Observer to the UN Zehdi Terzi during the controversy. He made a remark of which she later did not remember the exact phrasing, but rendered it approximately as 'you must have mixed feelings about remembering events in New Delhi', which she and biographer Gil Troy interpreted as a threatening reference to a failed assassination plan against her husband two years earler.<ref>[[Troy, Gil]], ''Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism'' (2012), New York: Oxford University Press, page 55, {{ISBN|978-0-19-992030-3}}</ref> But the American public responded enthusiastically to his moral outrage over the resolution; his condemnation of the \"Zionism is Racism\" resolution brought him celebrity status and helped him win a [[US Senate]] seat a year later.<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', page 6</ref> In his book, ''Moynihan's Moment'', [[Gil Troy]] posits that Moynihan's 1975 UN speech opposing the resolution was the key moment of his political career.<ref>[http://www.jewishreviewofbooks.com/publications/detail/with-words-we-govern-men With Words We Govern Men], Suzanne Garment, ''[[Jewish Review of Books]]'', Winter 2013</ref>

Perhaps the most controversial action of Moynihan's career was his response, as Ambassador to the UN, to the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor]] in 1975. [[Gerald Ford]] considered Indonesia, then under a military dictatorship, a key ally against [[Communism]], which was influential in East Timor. Moynihan ensured that the [[UN Security Council]] took no action against the larger nation's annexation of a small country. The Indonesian invasion caused the deaths of 100,000–200,000 Timorese through violence, illness, and hunger.<ref name=CAVR>[http://www.cavr-timorleste.org/en/Brief.htm Chega!

{{quote|The United States wished things to turn out as they did, and worked to bring this about. The Department of State desired that the United Nations prove utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ON2TPWZkiCIC ''A Dangerous Place''], Little Brown, 1980, p. 247</ref>}}

Later, he said he had defended a \"shameless\" [[Cold War]] policy toward East Timor.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/pandaemoniumethn00moyn ''Pandaemonium: Ethnicity in International Politics''], Oxford University Press 1993, page 153</ref>

Moynihan's thinking began to change during his tenure at the UN. In his 1993 book on nationalism, ''Pandaemonium'', he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the [[Soviet Union]] in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, [[imperialist]] [[Marxist]] state, and more as a weak [[political realism|realist]] state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a [[failed state]] headed for implosion.

Nevertheless, Moynihan's tenure at the UN marked the beginnings of a more bellicose, [[neoconservative]] American foreign policy that turned away from Kissinger's unabashedly covert, [[détente]]-driven [[realpolitik]].<ref>''Moynihan's Moment'', p. 159</ref> Although it was never substantiated, Moynihan initially believed that Kissinger directed [[Ivor Richard, Baron Richard]] (then [[British Ambassador to the United Nations]]) to publicly denounce his actions as \"[[Wyatt Earp]]\" diplomacy. Demoralized, Moynihan resigned from what he would subsequently characterize as an \"abbreviated posting\" in February 1976. In ''Pandaemonium'', Moynihan expounded upon this decision, maintaining that he was \"something of an embarrassment to my own government, and fairly soon left before I was fired.\"

===Career in the Senate===
In November 1976, Moynihan was elected to the [[U.S. Senate]] from the State of New York, defeating U.S. Representative [[Bella Abzug]], former U.S. Attorney General [[Ramsey Clark]], New York City Council President [[Paul O'Dwyer]] and businessman [[Abraham Hirschfeld]] in the Democratic primary, and [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] incumbent [[James L. Buckley]] in the general election. Shortly after election, Moynihan analyzed the State of New York's budget to determine whether it was paying out more in [[Federal spending and taxation across states|federal taxes than it received in spending]]. Finding that it was, he produced a yearly report known as the ''[[Fisc]]'' (from the French<ref>[http://fiscreport.org/index02a7.html?option=com_content&task=view&id=6&Itemid=26 \"The History of the Fisc\"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, on the Fisc Report website. Retrieved 2010-06-17.</ref>). Moynihan's strong support for Israel while UN Ambassador inspired support for him among the state's large [[Jewish]] population.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alan H. Levy|title=The Political Life of Bella Abzug, 1920–1976: Political Passions, Women's Rights, and Congressional Battles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kS9nAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA252|year=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|page=252|isbn=9780739181652}}</ref>

In an August 7, 1978 speech to the Senate, following the jailing of [[M. A. Farber]], Moynihan stated the possibility of Congress having to become involved with securing press freedom and that the Senate should be aware of the issue's seriousness.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/08/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-moynihan-sees-need-for-bill-to-guarantee-freedom.html|title=Moynihan Sees Need For Bill to Guarantee Freedom of the Press|date=August 8, 1978|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

Moynihan's strong advocacy for New York's interests in the Senate, buttressed by the ''Fisc'' reports and recalling his strong advocacy for US positions in the UN, did at least on one occasion allow his advocacy to escalate into a physical attack. Senator [[Kit Bond]], nearing retirement in 2010, recalled with some embarrassment in a conversation on [[civility]] in political discourse that Moynihan had once \"slugged [Bond] on the Senate floor after Bond denounced an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] Moynihan had slipped into a [[highway]] appropriations bill. Some months later Moynihan apologized, and the two occasionally would relax in Moynihan's office after a long day to discuss their shared interest in [[urban renewal]] over a glass of port.\"<ref>[http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2010/06/02/pages/3628/index.xml?page=2& \"Uncivil society: Jim Leach '64 leads an effort to restore respectful discourse to our national life, but it's tough going\"], by Mark F. Bernstein, ''[[Princeton Alumni Weekly]]'', June 2, 2010. Retrieved 2010-06-17.</ref>

Moynihan continued to be interested in foreign policy as a Senator, sitting on the Select Committee on Intelligence. His strongly anti-Soviet views became far more moderate, as he emerged as a critic of the [[Ronald Reagan]] Administration's hawkish [[Cold War]] policies, such as support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Moynihan argued there was no active Soviet-backed conspiracy in [[Latin America]], or anywhere. He suggested the Soviets were suffering from massive internal problems, such as rising [[ethnic]] [[nationalism]] and a collapsing economy. In a December 21, 1986, editorial in ''[[The New York Times]]'', Moynihan predicted the replacement on the world stage of Communist expansion with ethnic conflicts. He criticized the Reagan Administration's \"consuming obsession with the expansion of Communism – which is not in fact going on.\" In a September 8, 1990, letter to [[Erwin Griswold]], Moynihan wrote: \"I have one purpose left in life; or at least in the Senate. It is to try to sort out what would be involved in reconstituting the American government in the aftermath of the cold war. Huge changes took place, some of which we hardly notice.\"<ref>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]].

Moynihan introduced Section 1706 of the [[Tax Reform Act of 1986]], which cost certain professionals (like computer programmers, engineers, draftspersons, and designers) who depended on intermediary agencies (consulting firms) a self-employed tax status option, but other professionals (like accountants and lawyers) continued to enjoy Section 530 exemptions from payroll taxes. This change in the tax code was expected to offset the tax revenue losses of other legislation that Moynihan proposed to change the law of foreign taxes of Americans working abroad.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/22/nyregion/new-tax-law-threatens-high-tech-consultants.html \"New Tax Law threatens high-tech consultants\"] by Karla Jennings, ''The New York Times'', February 22, 1987 (p. 11 in paper).

In the mid-1990s, Moynihan was one of the Democrats to support the ban on the procedure known as [[partial-birth abortion]]. He said of the procedure: \"I think this is just too close to [[infanticide]]. A child has been born and it has exited the [[uterus]]. What on Earth is this procedure?\" Earlier in his career in the Senate, Moynihan had expressed his annoyance with the adamantly pro-choice interest groups petitioning him and others on the issue. He challenged them saying, \"you women are ruining the Democratic Party with your insistence on [[abortion]].\"<ref>''Human Life Review'', Summer 2003, page 13.</ref><ref>Chapter4: Too close to infanticide [https://books.google.com/books?id=WS7IqNEKUFQC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT51#v=onepage GB link] at [[Google Books]]</ref>

Moynihan broke with orthodox liberal positions of his party on numerous occasions. As chairman of the [[Senate Finance Committee]] in the 1990s, he strongly opposed President [[Bill Clinton]]'s proposal to expand health care coverage to all Americans. Seeking to focus the debate over health insurance on the financing of health care, Moynihan garnered controversy by stating that \"there is no health care crisis in this country.\"

On other issues though, he was much more progressive. He voted against the [[death penalty]]; the [[flag desecration amendment]];<ref>{{USBill|106|SJ|14}}, 106th Congress, 2nd Session, [https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=106&session=2&vote=00048#position Record Vote Number: 48]</ref> the [[balanced budget amendment]], the [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]]; the [[Defense of Marriage Act]]; the [[Communications Decency Act]]; and the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He was critical of proposals to replace the progressive income tax with a [[flat tax]]. Moynihan also voted against authorization of the [[Gulf War]]. Despite his earlier writings on the negative effects of the welfare state, he ended by voting against [[welfare reform]] in 1996, a bill that removed unemployment benefits. He was sharply critical of the bill and certain [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] who crossed party lines to support it.

==Public speaker==
Moynihan was a popular public speaker with a distinctly [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] style. He had some peculiar mannerisms of speech, in the form of slight stuttering and drawn-out vowels for emphasis. Linguist [[Geoffrey Nunberg]] compared his speaking style to that of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Nunberg|first=Geoff|title=William F. Buckley: A Man of Many Words|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88397125|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2011-05-16}}</ref>

==Commission on Government Secrecy==
{{Main|Moynihan Commission on Government Secrecy}}
[[File:Patrick Moynihan 1998.jpg|thumb|Moynihan in 1998]]
In the post-[[Cold War]] era, the 103rd Congress enacted legislation directing an inquiry into the uses of government secrecy. Moynihan chaired the Commission, which studied and made recommendations on the \"culture of secrecy\" that pervaded the United States government and its intelligence community for 80 years, beginning with the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], and made recommendations on the statutory regulation of classified information.

The Commission's findings and recommendations were presented to the President in 1997. As part of the effort, Moynihan secured release from the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] of its classified [[Venona]] file. This file documents the FBI's joint [[counterintelligence]] investigation, with the United States [[Arlington Hall|Signals Intelligence Service]], into Soviet espionage within the United States. Much of the information had been collected and classified as secret information for over 50 years.

After release of the information, Moynihan authored ''Secrecy: The American Experience''<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0300080794|title= Secrecy: The American Experience |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref> where he discussed the impact government secrecy has had on the domestic politics of America for the past half century, and how myths and suspicion created an unnecessary partisan chasm.

==Career as scholar==
As a [[public intellectual]], Moynihan published articles on urban ethnic politics and on the problems of the poor in cities of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] in numerous publications, including ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' and ''[[The Public Interest]]''.

Moynihan coined the term \"professionalization of reform,\" by which the government bureaucracy thinks up problems for government to solve rather than simply responding to problems identified elsewhere.<ref>''The Public Interest'', volume 1, Issue 1 1965</ref>

In 1983, he was awarded the [[Hubert H. Humphrey]] Award given by the [[American Political Science Association]] \"in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist.\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} He wrote 19 books, leading his personal friend, columnist and former professor [[George F. Will]], to remark that Moynihan \"wrote more books than most senators have read.\" After retiring from the Senate, he rejoined the faculty of the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at [[Syracuse University]], where he began his academic career in 1959.

Moynihan's scholarly accomplishments led [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]], writing in  ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' to describe the senator as \"the nation's best thinker among politicians since [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and its best politician among thinkers since [[Thomas Jefferson|Jefferson]].\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics 2000 |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |author2=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |publisher=National Journal |location=Washington D.C. |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/1090 1090–1091] |quote=Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson, now approaches the end of a long career in public office. |url=https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00/page/1090 }}</ref> Moynihan's 1993 article, \"Defining Deviancy Down\",<ref>''The American Scholar'', vol. 62, no. 1, winter 1993, pp. 17–3</ref> was notably controversial.<ref name=\"sunysuffolk\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm|publisher=www2.sunysuffolk.edu|title=Defining Deviancy|accessdate=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128102459/http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/formans/DefiningDeviancy.htm|archive-date=2017-01-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"barrypopik\">{{cite web|url=http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/defining_deviancy_down_daniel_patrick_moynihan|publisher=barrypopik.com|title=The Big Apple: \"Defining deviancy down\" (Daniel Patrick Moynihan)|accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref>

Moynihan was honored posthumously:
* In 2004, [[Michael Bloomberg]], the Mayor of [[New York City]], announced plans for an expanded and renovated [[Pennsylvania Station (New York)|Penn Station]]. A new [[Amtrak]] and [[Long Island Rail Road]] concourse will be built in the [[James Farley Post Office]] building, a block from the current facility. The new facility would be named \"Moynihan Station\" (later \"Moynihan Train Hall\") in Moynihan's honor. Moynihan had long championed the project, which will be a replica of [[Pennsylvania Station (1910-1963)|the original Penn Station]]; he had shined shoes in the original station as a boy during the Great Depression. During his latter years in the Senate, Moynihan had to secure federal approvals and financing for the project.<ref>[http://www.moynihanstation.org/newsite/2006/07/a_narrative_history_of_penn_st.html Friends of Moynihan Station] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023437/http://www.moynihanstation.org/newsite/2006/07/a_narrative_history_of_penn_st.html |date=March 4, 2016 }}. Moynihanstation.org (July 1, 2006). Retrieved July 26, 2013.</ref>
* In 2005, the [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] of [[Syracuse University]] renamed its Global Affairs Institute as the [[Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs]].
* The [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse|federal district courthouse]] in Manhattan's Foley Square was named in his honor.

The county has a diverse economy with no sector employing more than 13% of the local workforce. [[Horseshoe Southern Indiana]] is the largest employer, followed by [[Tyson Foods]] and the Harrison County Hospital. Tourism plays a significant role in the economy and is centered on the county's many historic sites. County government is divided among several bodies including the boards of the county's three school districts, three elected commissioners who exercise legislative and executive powers, an elected county council that controls the county budget, a circuit and superior court, and township trustees in the county's 12 townships. The county has 10 [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] towns with a total population of over 5,000, as well as many small unincorporated towns. One Interstate highway and one U. S. Route run through the county, as do eight Indiana State Roads and two railroad lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/files/StateTransportationMap.pdf|title=Indiana Transportation Map 2009–2010|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|year=2009|format=PDF|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"indiana-railroad-map\">{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/files/MAIN-RR-11_V1.pdf|title=State of Indiana 2011 Rail System Map|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|year=2011|format=PDF|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref>

Migratory groups of Native Americans inhabited the area for thousands of years, but the first permanent settlements in what would become Harrison County were created by American settlers in the years after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The population grew rapidly during first decade of the 19th&nbsp;century. Corydon was officially platted in 1808 and became the capital of the [[Indiana Territory]] in 1813. Many of the state's early important historic events occurred in the county, including the writing of Indiana's first constitution. Corydon was the state capital until 1825, but in the years afterward remained an important hub for southern Indiana. In 1859 there was a major [[meteorite]] strike.<ref name=c3>Crayden 1959, p. 3.</ref> In 1863 the [[Battle of Corydon]] was fought, the only battle of the [[American Civil War]] to occur in Indiana.<ref name=f86>Funk 1969, p. 86.</ref>

[[File:Southern edge of Swan's Landing.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Swan's Landing Site]]
Humans first entered what would become Indiana near the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. This region was of particular value to the early humans because of the abundance of [[flint]]. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000&nbsp;BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the [[Hopewell culture|Hopewells]] and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippians]].<ref name=d7>Dick 2000, p. 7.</ref> One flint-working and camping location is the [[Swan's Landing Archeological Site]], one of the most important [[Archaic period in the Americas|Early Archaic]] archaeological sites in eastern North America.<ref>Smith, Edward E., Jr.  \"The Swan's Landing Site (12Hr304): An Early Archaic (Kirk Horizon) Site in Harrison County, South-Central Indiana\".  ''Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology'' 20.2 (1995): 192–238.  213.</ref> Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American settlers in the last decade of the 18th&nbsp;century.<ref name=d7/>

The area became part of the United States following its conquest during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Veterans of the revolution received land grants in the eastern part of the county as part of [[Clark's Grant]]. [[Daniel Boone]] and his brother [[Squire Boone]] were early explorers of the county, entering from Kentucky in the 1780s. [[Harvey Heth]], [[Spier Spencer]], and Edward Smith were among the first to settle in the county beginning in the 1790s. Smith built the first home in the area of [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]].<ref name=d8>Dick 2000, p. 8.</ref>

Harrison County was originally part of [[Knox County, Indiana|Knox County]] and [[Clark County, Indiana|Clark County]] but was separated in 1808. It was the first [[Indiana]] county formed by the [[Indiana Territory|Indiana territorial]] legislature instead of the Governor.<ref name=f118>Funk 1969, p. 118.</ref> Portions of the county were later separated into parts of Crawford, Floyd, Washington, Jackson, Clark, Lawrence, Perry, Scott and Orange Counties.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 122.</ref> The county was named for [[William Henry Harrison]], the first governor of [[Indiana Territory]], a General in [[War of 1812]], hero of [[Battle of Tippecanoe|Tippecanoe]], and the 9th [[U.S. President]].<ref name = f118/> Harrison was the largest land holder in the county at the time and had a small estate at [[Harrison Spring]].<ref name=IHI>Goodrich 1875, p. 560.</ref>
[[File:Squire Boone Caverns burial cave 1.jpg|right|thumb|Original burial site marker of Squire Boone]]

Squire Boone settled permanently in what is now Boone Township in 1806. He died in 1815 and is buried in a cave near his home, [[Squire Boone Caverns]]. James, Isaiah, and Daniel (son of Squire) Boone settled in Harrison County's Heth Township during the first decade of the 1800s.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 6.</ref> The county's first church was built by Boone east of present-day [[Laconia, Indiana|Laconia]].<ref name=d8/> The church, which has been reconstructed, is known as Old Goshen. Jacob Kintner settled near Corydon in about 1810. He was one of the wealthiest settlers and amassed a {{convert|700|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract of land around Corydon, built a large home, and maintained an inn.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 10.</ref> Paul and Susanna Mitchem became [[Quaker]]s and immigrated to Harrison County from [[North Carolina]] in 1814, bringing with them 107&nbsp;slaves whom they freed after arriving. Although some of the former slaves left, the group became one of the largest communities of free blacks in the state.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 34.</ref>

The first road was built in Harrison County in 1809 connecting Corydon with [[Mauckport, Indiana|Mauckport]] on the [[Ohio River]]. A tow-and-ferry line was operated there by the Mauck family bringing settlers into the county from [[Kentucky]]. This road and ferry greatly expanded the county's economic viability and ease of access to the outside world, leading to a rapid settlement of the area. The county's population more than doubled in the following decade.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 7.</ref>

[[Dennis Pennington]], who lived near [[Lanesville, Indiana|Lanesville]], became one of the county's early leading citizens and speaker of the territory's legislature.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 12.</ref> Corydon began competing with other southern Indiana settlements to become the new capital of the territory after its reorganization in 1809. Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May 1, 1813, after Pennington suggested that it would be safer than Vincennes.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 16.</ref> For the next twelve years, Corydon was the political center of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.<ref name=IHI/>

The first division of the county occurred in 1814 when the northern portion of the county was separated to become Washington County. In 1818 with the western part of the county was partitioned off to become Crawford County.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 124.</ref> In 1819 Floyd County was created out of the eastern part of the county.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 129.</ref> Since that time, Harrison County's eastern border has had minor adjustments through land transactions with Floyd County; the last change occurred in 1968.

The northern part of the county is known as the barrens, named by the early settlers for its scarce timber. At first, settlers preferred the southern areas where wood was available.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 16.</ref> The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest barren ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The [[Central Barren, Indiana|Central Barren]] covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19th&nbsp;century, settlers found the barrens to be fertile farmland, and they were quickly settled. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20th&nbsp;century the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.<ref>Roose 1911, pp. 17–18.</ref>

A large [[Meteorite fall|meteorite]] fell near Buena Vista on March 28, 1859. The impact site and a part of the meteorite have been preserved.<ref name=c3/>
[[File:Corydon train wreck1902.jpg|right|thumb|A train wreck at the Corydon Junction's southern trestle (January 19, 1902)]]

The first Harrison County fair was held in Corydon in 1860; it has been an annual event since then and is the state's longest continuously running fair.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 1.</ref> The county fairgrounds were built in Corydon on Edward Smith's former homesite. The original grandstand burned in 1960 and the county purchased a new grandstand from the minor league baseball team at [[Parkway Field]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>Dick 2000, p. 38.</ref>

The only Civil War battle fought in Indiana occurred in Harrison County on July 9, 1863, between the [[Indiana Legion|Harrison County Legion]] and a Confederate group under Brigadier General [[John Hunt Morgan]], during [[Morgan's Raid]].<ref name=f86/> Morgan crossed the Ohio River into Harrison County in the early hours of daylight, resisted by artillery fire from the Indiana shore and an armed river boat. Confederate artillery returned fire from the opposite shore, and the Legion retreated towards Corydon. The citizens of Mauckport fled the town carrying their valuables.<ref name=f86/> Morgan landed on the east side of Mauckport with two thousand cavalry and marched north burning homes, farms, and mills.<ref name=f86/> The county militia made a stand to block his advance on the county seat and the resulting conflict is known as the [[Battle of Corydon]]. The battle was won by the Confederates and the town of Corydon was then sacked and stores were looted and ransomed. The battle left 4&nbsp;dead, 12&nbsp;wounded, and 355&nbsp;captured.<ref name=f87>Funk 1969, p. 87.</ref> After the battle Morgan continued into northern Harrison County where he looted the New Salisbury area with the main body of troops. Crandall and Palmyra were robbed and sacked by detachments. His forces left the county the following day; they were eventually defeated and captured by Union Army forces.<ref name=f87/>

The railroad reached Harrison County in 1869. A line was completed across the northern half of county in 1874 running from Floyd County connecting Crandall and then continuing west into Crawford County.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 11.</ref> A southward extension connecting Corydon to Crandall was completed in 1882. A train wreck killed three in 1902.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 12.</ref> The southern extension connecting Corydon was purchased by the [[Corydon Scenic Railroad Company]] in 1989. It operated as a tourist attraction until its 2003 closing, which ended passenger service in the county.<ref>Longest 2005, p. 91.</ref>

The first county courthouse was a small log building. When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County Courthouse and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed to make way for a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the [[Indiana first capitol building|first state capitol building]]. The new courthouse was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000.{{#tag:ref|A $250,000 capital expense in 1928 would be roughly equivalent to $14,500,000 in 2010.<ref name=\"Williamson\">Williamson, Samuel H.

==Geography==
[[File:Map of Harrison County, Indiana.svg|thumb|right|400px|Map of Harrison County, showing townships, settlements, and major highways]]
Harrison County is located in the far southern part of Indiana, about halfway between the state's east and west borders. The [[Ohio River]] defines the county's southern border; across the river lies the state of [[Kentucky]] and the city of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. The [[Blue River (Indiana)|Blue River]] runs along the county's western border. According to the 2010&nbsp;census, the county has a total area of {{convert|486.52|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|484.52|sqmi}} (or 99.59%) is land and {{convert|2.00|sqmi}} (or 0.41%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>

[[Harrison Spring]] is located west of Corydon; it is {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter and is over {{convert|40|ft|m}} deep, making it the largest and deepest spring in Indiana. It rises from a solid rock in a level spot of land, and it outputs enough water to have turned flour mills in the past. Is the largest spring by volume in Indiana producing over 3 million gallons (11 million liters) of water daily. The name recognizes William Henry Harrison, who owned this area.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 23.</ref>

Harrison County is hilly in parts. The [[Knobstone Escarpment]] begins in the southeastern part of the county, rises sharply at the Ohio River, and runs along the eastern edge of the county. The \"knobs\" are the most significant series of hills in Indiana, with the highest knobs near the Ohio River towering {{convert|610|ft|m}} over the surrounding valley.<ref>Logan 1922, p. 90.</ref> This is the greatest local relief difference in the state.<ref>Logan 1922, p. 91.</ref> The Ohio River borders the entire southeastern, southern, and southwestern part of the county. Blue River forms the western border with Indian Creek and Buck Creek as the primary internal drainage systems.

The western part of the county is preserved as the [[Harrison-Crawford State Forest]] and the [[O'Bannon Woods State Park]]. The county has extensive cave systems including Squire Boone Caverns, the Binkley Cave System ([[Indiana Caverns]]) and smaller, highly decorated caves such as Jewel Box and Devil's Graveyard caves.

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]] and by the [[Indiana Code]]. Executive and legislative power is vested in the Board of Commissioners, and fiscal power is vested in the County Council.<ref name = inc3623/>

The seven member county council is the fiscal branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts and three are elected at-large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local income, property, excise and service taxes. County income and property taxes are subject to state level approval.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

The Board of Commissioners consists of three commissioners who are elected county-wide in four–year staggered terms. One commissioner serves as president of the board. The commissioners manage the budget set forth by the council, the collection of revenue, enact and repeal ordinances, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government. The commissioners meet twice monthly.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>

Harrison County has a Circuit Court and a Superior Court. The Superior Court handles adult criminal cases, small claims cases, traffic tickets, and infractions. The Circuit Court handles the rest of the cases in the county, including most of the divorce cases, juvenile matters, CHINS cases, civil proceedings, probate, estates, adoptions and civil commitments. Judges in each court serve a six-year term. The Judge of the Circuit Court appoints a referee to handle family law cases.<ref name=inc2102/>

The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]] and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each serves a four–year term. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>

Each township has a [[Indiana Township Trustee|trustee]] who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief and manages cemetery care, among other duties. The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board. The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unitedtownships.org/?page_id=95|title=Government|publisher=United Township Association of Indiana|accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref>

'''Harrison County''' is located in the far southern part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Indiana]] along the [[Ohio River]]. The [[County (United States)|county]] was officially established in 1808. As of the 2010 [[United States Census|census]], the county's population was 39,364, an increase of 6.6% from 2000.<ref name=QF>{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/18/18061.html|title=Harrison County QuickFacts|accessdate=September 20, 2011|publisher=US Census Bureau|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607082128/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/18/18061.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011}}</ref> The [[county seat]] is [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]], the former capital of Indiana.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uscounties.org/cffiles_web/counties/county.cfm?id=18061|title=Find a County – Harrison County IN|publisher=National Association of Counties|accessdate=January 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180614144249/http://www.uscounties.org/cffiles_web/counties/county.cfm?id=18061|archive-date=June 14, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Harrison County is part of the [[Louisville metropolitan area|Louisville-Jefferson County, KY-IN Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

The county has a diverse economy with no sector employing more than 13% of the local workforce. [[Horseshoe Southern Indiana]] is the largest employer, followed by [[Tyson Foods]] and the Harrison County Hospital. Tourism plays a significant role in the economy and is centered on the county's many historic sites. County government is divided among several bodies including the boards of the county's three school districts, three elected commissioners who exercise legislative and executive powers, an elected county council that controls the county budget, a circuit and superior court, and township trustees in the county's 12 townships. The county has 10 [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] towns with a total population of over 5,000, as well as many small unincorporated towns. One Interstate highway and one U. S. Route run through the county, as do eight Indiana State Roads and two railroad lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/files/StateTransportationMap.pdf|title=Indiana Transportation Map 2009–2010|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|year=2009|format=PDF|accessdate=December 16, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"indiana-railroad-map\">{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/indot/files/MAIN-RR-11_V1.pdf|title=State of Indiana 2011 Rail System Map|publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation|year=2011|format=PDF|accessdate=June 19, 2011}}</ref>

Migratory groups of Native Americans inhabited the area for thousands of years, but the first permanent settlements in what would become Harrison County were created by American settlers in the years after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. The population grew rapidly during first decade of the 19th&nbsp;century. Corydon was officially platted in 1808 and became the capital of the [[Indiana Territory]] in 1813. Many of the state's early important historic events occurred in the county, including the writing of Indiana's first constitution. Corydon was the state capital until 1825, but in the years afterward remained an important hub for southern Indiana. In 1859 there was a major [[meteorite]] strike.<ref name=c3>Crayden 1959, p. 3.</ref> In 1863 the [[Battle of Corydon]] was fought, the only battle of the [[American Civil War]] to occur in Indiana.<ref name=f86>Funk 1969, p. 86.</ref>

==History==
{{see also| History of Indiana}}
[[File:Southern edge of Swan's Landing.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Swan's Landing Site]]
Humans first entered what would become Indiana near the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]]. This region was of particular value to the early humans because of the abundance of [[flint]]. There is evidence of flint mining in local caves as early as 2000&nbsp;BCE; the stone was used to produce crude tools. Passing migratory tribes frequented the area which was influenced by succeeding groups of peoples including the [[Hopewell culture|Hopewells]] and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippians]].<ref name=d7>Dick 2000, p. 7.</ref> One flint-working and camping location is the [[Swan's Landing Archeological Site]], one of the most important [[Archaic period in the Americas|Early Archaic]] archaeological sites in eastern North America.<ref>Smith, Edward E., Jr.  \"The Swan's Landing Site (12Hr304): An Early Archaic (Kirk Horizon) Site in Harrison County, South-Central Indiana\".  ''Midcontinental Journal of Archaeology'' 20.2 (1995): 192–238.  213.</ref> Permanent human settlements in the county began with the arrival of American settlers in the last decade of the 18th&nbsp;century.<ref name=d7/>

The area became part of the United States following its conquest during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Veterans of the revolution received land grants in the eastern part of the county as part of [[Clark's Grant]]. [[Daniel Boone]] and his brother [[Squire Boone]] were early explorers of the county, entering from Kentucky in the 1780s. [[Harvey Heth]], [[Spier Spencer]], and Edward Smith were among the first to settle in the county beginning in the 1790s. Smith built the first home in the area of [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]].<ref name=d8>Dick 2000, p. 8.</ref>

Harrison County was originally part of [[Knox County, Indiana|Knox County]] and [[Clark County, Indiana|Clark County]] but was separated in 1808. It was the first [[Indiana]] county formed by the [[Indiana Territory|Indiana territorial]] legislature instead of the Governor.<ref name=f118>Funk 1969, p. 118.</ref> Portions of the county were later separated into parts of Crawford, Floyd, Washington, Jackson, Clark, Lawrence, Perry, Scott and Orange Counties.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 122.</ref> The county was named for [[William Henry Harrison]], the first governor of [[Indiana Territory]], a General in [[War of 1812]], hero of [[Battle of Tippecanoe|Tippecanoe]], and the 9th [[U.S. President]].<ref name = f118/> Harrison was the largest land holder in the county at the time and had a small estate at [[Harrison Spring]].<ref name=IHI>Goodrich 1875, p. 560.</ref>
[[File:Squire Boone Caverns burial cave 1.jpg|right|thumb|Original burial site marker of Squire Boone]]

Squire Boone settled permanently in what is now Boone Township in 1806. He died in 1815 and is buried in a cave near his home, [[Squire Boone Caverns]]. James, Isaiah, and Daniel (son of Squire) Boone settled in Harrison County's Heth Township during the first decade of the 1800s.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 6.</ref> The county's first church was built by Boone east of present-day [[Laconia, Indiana|Laconia]].<ref name=d8/> The church, which has been reconstructed, is known as Old Goshen. Jacob Kintner settled near Corydon in about 1810. He was one of the wealthiest settlers and amassed a {{convert|700|acre|km2|adj=on}} tract of land around Corydon, built a large home, and maintained an inn.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 10.</ref> Paul and Susanna Mitchem became [[Quaker]]s and immigrated to Harrison County from [[North Carolina]] in 1814, bringing with them 107&nbsp;slaves whom they freed after arriving. Although some of the former slaves left, the group became one of the largest communities of free blacks in the state.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 34.</ref>

The first road was built in Harrison County in 1809 connecting Corydon with [[Mauckport, Indiana|Mauckport]] on the [[Ohio River]]. A tow-and-ferry line was operated there by the Mauck family bringing settlers into the county from [[Kentucky]]. This road and ferry greatly expanded the county's economic viability and ease of access to the outside world, leading to a rapid settlement of the area. The county's population more than doubled in the following decade.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 7.</ref>

[[Dennis Pennington]], who lived near [[Lanesville, Indiana|Lanesville]], became one of the county's early leading citizens and speaker of the territory's legislature.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 12.</ref> Corydon began competing with other southern Indiana settlements to become the new capital of the territory after its reorganization in 1809. Hostilities broke out in 1811 with the Native American tribes on the frontier, and the territorial capital was moved to Corydon on May 1, 1813, after Pennington suggested that it would be safer than Vincennes.<ref>Dick 2000, p. 16.</ref> For the next twelve years, Corydon was the political center of the territory and subsequent state. A state constitution was drafted in Corydon during June 1816 and after statehood the town served as the state capital until 1825.<ref name=IHI/>

The first division of the county occurred in 1814 when the northern portion of the county was separated to become Washington County. In 1818 with the western part of the county was partitioned off to become Crawford County.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 124.</ref> In 1819 Floyd County was created out of the eastern part of the county.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 129.</ref> Since that time, Harrison County's eastern border has had minor adjustments through land transactions with Floyd County; the last change occurred in 1968.

The northern part of the county is known as the barrens, named by the early settlers for its scarce timber. At first, settlers preferred the southern areas where wood was available.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 16.</ref> The barrens were swept by annual wildfires that prevented the growth of trees. The largest barren ran from the northern edge of Corydon northward to Palmyra, and from the Floyd Knobs in the east, westward to the Blue River. The [[Central Barren, Indiana|Central Barren]] covered most of the upper middle part of the county. As settlement expanded and farming grew in the early 19th&nbsp;century, settlers found the barrens to be fertile farmland, and they were quickly settled. As settlement increased, the wildfires were stopped and by the start of the 20th&nbsp;century the uninhabited parts of the barrens had become forested and have remained so until modern times.<ref>Roose 1911, pp. 17–18.</ref>

A large [[Meteorite fall|meteorite]] fell near Buena Vista on March 28, 1859. The impact site and a part of the meteorite have been preserved.<ref name=c3/>
[[File:Corydon train wreck1902.jpg|right|thumb|A train wreck at the Corydon Junction's southern trestle (January 19, 1902)]]

The first Harrison County fair was held in Corydon in 1860; it has been an annual event since then and is the state's longest continuously running fair.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 1.</ref> The county fairgrounds were built in Corydon on Edward Smith's former homesite. The original grandstand burned in 1960 and the county purchased a new grandstand from the minor league baseball team at [[Parkway Field]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>Dick 2000, p. 38.</ref>

The only Civil War battle fought in Indiana occurred in Harrison County on July 9, 1863, between the [[Indiana Legion|Harrison County Legion]] and a Confederate group under Brigadier General [[John Hunt Morgan]], during [[Morgan's Raid]].<ref name=f86/> Morgan crossed the Ohio River into Harrison County in the early hours of daylight, resisted by artillery fire from the Indiana shore and an armed river boat. Confederate artillery returned fire from the opposite shore, and the Legion retreated towards Corydon. The citizens of Mauckport fled the town carrying their valuables.<ref name=f86/> Morgan landed on the east side of Mauckport with two thousand cavalry and marched north burning homes, farms, and mills.<ref name=f86/> The county militia made a stand to block his advance on the county seat and the resulting conflict is known as the [[Battle of Corydon]]. The battle was won by the Confederates and the town of Corydon was then sacked and stores were looted and ransomed. The battle left 4&nbsp;dead, 12&nbsp;wounded, and 355&nbsp;captured.<ref name=f87>Funk 1969, p. 87.</ref> After the battle Morgan continued into northern Harrison County where he looted the New Salisbury area with the main body of troops. Crandall and Palmyra were robbed and sacked by detachments. His forces left the county the following day; they were eventually defeated and captured by Union Army forces.<ref name=f87/>
[[File:Corydonwarmememorial.jpg|left|thumb|The Harrison County memorial to the county's war casualties]]

The railroad reached Harrison County in 1869. A line was completed across the northern half of county in 1874 running from Floyd County connecting Crandall and then continuing west into Crawford County.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 11.</ref> A southward extension connecting Corydon to Crandall was completed in 1882. A train wreck killed three in 1902.<ref>Crayden 1959, p. 12.</ref> The southern extension connecting Corydon was purchased by the [[Corydon Scenic Railroad Company]] in 1989. It operated as a tourist attraction until its 2003 closing, which ended passenger service in the county.<ref>Longest 2005, p. 91.</ref>

The first county courthouse was a small log building. When Corydon became the territory capital in 1813, county and territorial officials shared the building. By 1816 a stone building had been constructed, and it served as both Harrison County Courthouse and the state capital building until the capital was moved. As more space was needed, other buildings were constructed to supplement the courthouse. In the 1920s, the latest of these office buildings was razed to make way for a new courthouse; the old building was acquired by the State of Indiana and preserved as the [[Indiana first capitol building|first state capitol building]]. The new courthouse was built from 1927 to 1928 at a cost of about $250,000.{{#tag:ref|A $250,000 capital expense in 1928 would be roughly equivalent to $14,500,000 in 2010.<ref name=\"Williamson\">Williamson, Samuel H.

The [[Harrison-Crawford State Forest]] was started in 1932 when the State of Indiana purchased land in western Harrison County. The {{convert|26000|acre|km2|adj=on}} park is the largest state forest in Indiana and surrounds the [[O'Bannon Woods State Park]] and [[Wyandotte Cave]]s, located in eastern Crawford County.

The [[Matthew E. Welsh Bridge]] was completed in 1966 in Mauckport, to connect Harrison County with neighboring [[Meade County, Kentucky|Meade County in Kentucky]]. This is the only bridge over the Ohio River between [[Tell City, Indiana|Tell City]] and [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]].<ref>Gugin 2006, p. 339.</ref> In 1969 Dr.&nbsp;Samuel P. Hays donated the {{convert|311|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Hayswood Nature Reserve]] to the county. It was developed in 1973 by the Harrison County Park Board by adding public facilities to the western part of the preserve. It is the second largest nature reserve in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harrisoncoparks.com/HNR.html|title=Hayswood Nature Reserve|publisher=Harrison County Park and Recreation Department|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}</ref>

[[Caesars Indiana]] opened a casino river boat, hotel complex, and golf course in 1998, boosting the county's tourism industry. The casino complex was purchased and became Horseshoe Southern Indiana on July 11, 2008.<ref>Harrison County Chamber of Commerce, p. 21.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Map of Harrison County, Indiana.svg|thumb|right|400px|Map of Harrison County, showing townships, settlements, and major highways]]
Harrison County is located in the far southern part of Indiana, about halfway between the state's east and west borders. The [[Ohio River]] defines the county's southern border; across the river lies the state of [[Kentucky]] and the city of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. The [[Blue River (Indiana)|Blue River]] runs along the county's western border. According to the 2010&nbsp;census, the county has a total area of {{convert|486.52|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|484.52|sqmi}} (or 99.59%) is land and {{convert|2.00|sqmi}} (or 0.41%) is water.<ref name=\"census-density\"/>

[[Harrison Spring]] is located west of Corydon; it is {{convert|60|ft|m}} in diameter and is over {{convert|40|ft|m}} deep, making it the largest and deepest spring in Indiana. It rises from a solid rock in a level spot of land, and it outputs enough water to have turned flour mills in the past. Is the largest spring by volume in Indiana producing over 3 million gallons (11 million liters) of water daily. The name recognizes William Henry Harrison, who owned this area.<ref>Roose 1911, p. 23.</ref>

Harrison County is hilly in parts. The [[Knobstone Escarpment]] begins in the southeastern part of the county, rises sharply at the Ohio River, and runs along the eastern edge of the county. The \"knobs\" are the most significant series of hills in Indiana, with the highest knobs near the Ohio River towering {{convert|610|ft|m}} over the surrounding valley.<ref>Logan 1922, p. 90.</ref> This is the greatest local relief difference in the state.<ref>Logan 1922, p. 91.</ref> The Ohio River borders the entire southeastern, southern, and southwestern part of the county. Blue River forms the western border with Indian Creek and Buck Creek as the primary internal drainage systems.

The western part of the county is preserved as the [[Harrison-Crawford State Forest]] and the [[O'Bannon Woods State Park]]. The county has extensive cave systems including Squire Boone Caverns, the Binkley Cave System ([[Indiana Caverns]]) and smaller, highly decorated caves such as Jewel Box and Devil's Graveyard caves.

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}
The county government is a constitutional body and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]] and by the [[Indiana Code]]. Executive and legislative power is vested in the Board of Commissioners, and fiscal power is vested in the County Council.<ref name = inc3623/>

The seven member county council is the fiscal branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Four representatives are elected from county districts and three are elected at-large. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council has limited authority to impose local income, property, excise and service taxes. County income and property taxes are subject to state level approval.<ref name=inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html|title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name=inc2102>{{cite web|author=Indiana Code|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2|accessdate=September 16, 2008|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

The Board of Commissioners consists of three commissioners who are elected county-wide in four–year staggered terms. One commissioner serves as president of the board. The commissioners manage the budget set forth by the council, the collection of revenue, enact and repeal ordinances, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government. The commissioners meet twice monthly.<ref name=inc3623/><ref name=inc2102/>

Harrison County has a Circuit Court and a Superior Court. The Superior Court handles adult criminal cases, small claims cases, traffic tickets, and infractions. The Circuit Court handles the rest of the cases in the county, including most of the divorce cases, juvenile matters, CHINS cases, civil proceedings, probate, estates, adoptions and civil commitments. Judges in each court serve a six-year term. The Judge of the Circuit Court appoints a referee to handle family law cases.<ref name=inc2102/>

The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[Surveying|surveyor]] and circuit [[court clerk]]. Each serves a four–year term. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name=inc2102/>

Each township has a [[Indiana Township Trustee|trustee]] who administers rural fire protection and ambulance service, provides poor relief and manages cemetery care, among other duties. The trustee is assisted in these duties by a three-member township board. The trustees and board members are elected to four-year terms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unitedtownships.org/?page_id=95|title=Government|publisher=United Township Association of Indiana|accessdate=January 20, 2012}}</ref>

An '''airport''' is an [[aerodrome]] with extended facilities, mostly for commercial air transport.<ref>Wragg, D.; ''Historical dictionary of aviation'', History Press 2008.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/airport|title=Airport – Definition of airport by Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> Airports often have facilities to store and maintain aircraft, and a [[control tower]]. An airport consists of a [[landing area]], which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a [[runway]] for a [[airplane|plane]] to take off<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/runway?show=0&t=1422938979|title=Runway – Definition of runway by Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> or a [[helipad]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/helipad|title=Helipad – Definition of helipad by Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, [[hangar]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangars|title=Hangar – Definition of hangar by Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> and [[airport terminal|terminal]]s. Larger airports may have [[airport apron]]s, [[taxiway bridge]]s, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and [[Airport lounge|lounges]], and [[emergency service]]s. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more [[fixed-base operator]]s, serving general aviation.

An airport solely serving helicopters is called a [[heliport]]. An airport for use by [[seaplane]]s and [[amphibious aircraft]] is called a [[seaplane base]]. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for [[takeoff]]s and [[landing]]s, and seaplane docks for tying-up.  

An [[international airport]] has additional facilities for customs and [[Border control|passport control]] as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with [[List of largest buildings#Largest floor area|15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area]] being airport terminals.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/38684926/design8docx/|title=design8.docx – AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT PAGE NO 1 What is an Airport An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities mostly for commercial air transport|website=coursehero.com|access-date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>

== Terminology ==
[[File:Gardemoen airport.jpg|thumb|[[Jet bridge|Air bridges]] at [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo Airport]] from an [[Icelandair]] [[Boeing 757]]-200]]
The terms ''[[aerodrome]]'', ''[[airfield]]'', and ''[[airstrip]]'' also refer to airports, and the terms ''heliport'', ''seaplane base'', and ''[[STOLport]]'' refer to airports dedicated exclusively to [[helicopters]], [[seaplanes]], and [[STOL|short take-off and landing]] aircraft.

In colloquial use in certain environments, the terms ''airport'' and ''aerodrome'' are often interchanged. However, in general, the term ''airport'' may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other [[aerodrome]]s may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, ''airport'' is a legal [[Technical terminology|term of art]] reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant [[national aviation authority]] after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.<ref>{{CFS}}</ref>

That is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between ''aerodrome'' and ''airport'', which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. In US technical/legal usage, ''landing area'' is used instead of ''aerodrome'', and ''airport'' means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\".<ref>49 U.S.C. § 40102(a) (2012)</ref>

==Management==
[[File:Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia.jpg|thumb|[[Kuala Lumpur]]'s [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] Main Terminal ]]
Smaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than {{Convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}. Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of {{Convert|2000|m|abbr=on}} or longer. Skyline Airport in [[Inkom, Idaho]] has a runway that is only {{convert|122|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/1ID9|title=AirNav: 1ID9 – Skyline Airport|website=airnav.com|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

In the United States, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths]]. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.

The [[List of longest runways|longest public-use runway]] in the world is at [[Qamdo Bamda Airport]] in China. It has a length of {{convert|5500|m|0|abbr=on}}. The world's widest paved runway is at [[Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport]] in Russia and is {{convert|105|m|0|abbr=on}} wide.

{{as of|2009}}, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the US, the US having the most in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2053.html|title=The World Factbook|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2053rank.html|title=The World Factbook|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref>

=== Airport ownership and operation ===
[[File:BBI 2010-07-23 5.JPG|thumb|The [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] is publicly financed by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg and the Federal Republic of Germany.]]

Most of the world's large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport's operation. For example, in the UK the state-owned [[Heathrow Airport Holdings|British Airports Authority]] originally operated eight of the nation's major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish [[Ferrovial]] consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany's [[Frankfurt Airport]] is managed by the quasi-private firm [[Fraport]]. While in India [[GMR Group]] operates, through joint ventures, [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi International Airport]]. [[Bengaluru International Airport]] and [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India's airports are managed by the [[Airports Authority of India]]. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the [[Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority]] except for [[Sialkot International Airport]] which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

In the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created [[Airport authority|airport authorities]] (also known as [[Port authority|port authorities]]), such as the [[Los Angeles World Airports]] authority that oversees several airports in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], including [[Los Angeles International Airport]]{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

In Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. Now most airports in Canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned.

Many US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faa|title=FAA|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> under the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Title 14 Part 139, \"Certification of Commercial Service Airports\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert/ |title=Part 139 Airport Certification |publisher=[[FAA]] |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100729055419/http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert/| archivedate= July 29, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA.

Despite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US (contrary to the [[FAA]] sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.

=== Airport funding ===

The [[Airport and Airway Trust Fund|Airport & Airway Trust Fund]] ([[Airport and Airway Trust Fund|AATF]]) was created by the [[Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970|Airport and Airway Development in 1970]] which finances aviation programs in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/budget/aatf/|title=Airport & Airway Trust Fund (AATF)|website=faa.gov|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> [[Airport Improvement Program]] (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), and Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) are the three major accounts of [[Federal Aviation Administration]] which are financed by the AATF, as well as pays for the FAA's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44749.pdf|title=The Airport and Airway Trust Fund|last=Tang|first=Rachel|date=January 31, 2017|website=Congressional Research Service}}</ref> The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. [[Airline ticket|Passenger ticket]]<nowiki/>s, [[Fuel economy in aircraft|fuel]], and [[Cargo aircraft|cargo]] tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Office|first=U.

=== Airport revenue ===
Airports revenues are divided into three major parts: [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. Aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpleflying.com/how-airports-make-money/|title=How Airports Actually Make Money|date=July 21, 2018|website=Simple Flying|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref><!--This is for US airports? It needs to specify.-->

==== Aeronautical revenue ====
Aeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guides.erau.edu/c.php?g=153797&p=1009544|title=Landing fees|website=guides.erau.edu}}</ref> [[Landing fee]]s are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://assets.flysfo.com.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/investor/SummaryChargesFY1617.pdf|title=SUMMARY OF AIRPORT CHARGES|last=Farooqui|first=Aaryan|website=assest.flysfo}}</ref> Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, [[Wi-Fi|wifi]] and shows which is paid while paying for an [[airline ticket]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there.<ref name=\"researchgate.net\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322037374_The_Current_Situation_and_Change_in_Airport_Revenues_Research_on_The_Europe's_Five_Busiest_Airports|title=The Current Situation and Change in Airport Revenues: Research on The Europe's Five Busiest Airports}}</ref> Every airport has his own rates of parking but at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F Kennedy airport]] in New York City charges $45 per hour for the plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.panynj.gov/airports/pdf/scheduleofcharges-jfk.pdf|title=SCHEDULE OF CHARGES FOR AIR TERMINALS John F. Kennedy International Airport}}</ref>

==== Non-aeronautical revenue ====
Non-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/14275/chapter/4|title=Read \"Guidebook for Managing Small Airports - Second Edition\" at NAP.edu|language=en}}</ref> Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through [[Duty-free shop|duty free]], bookstores, Restaurants and [[Foreign exchange market|money exchange]].<ref name=\"researchgate.net\"/> Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the [[Parking lot|parking facilities]] of the airport. [[O'Hare International Airport]] in Chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flychicago.com/ohare/tofrom/parking/Pages/economy.aspx|title=Economy Parking {{!}} Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)|website=www.flychicago.com|access-date=May 6, 2019}}</ref>

===Landside and airside areas===
Airports are divided into landside and airside areas. The landside area is open to the public, while access to the airside area is tightly controlled. The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are accessible only to passengers and staff. Passengers and staff must be checked by [[airport security|security]] before being permitted to enter the airside area. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through [[border control]] and customs to access the landside area, where they can exit the airport. Many major airports will issue a secure [[keycard]] called an [[airside pass]] to employees, as some roles require employees to frequently move back and forth between landside and airside as part of their duties.

==Facilities==

[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Singapore's [[Singapore Changi Airport]] Terminal 3 ]]
A [[Airport terminal|terminal]] is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of [[Gate (airport)|gates]], which provide passengers with access to the plane.

The following facilities are essential for departing passengers:
*[[Airport check-in|Check-in facilities]], including a baggage drop-off
*[[Airport security|Security clearance gates]]
*Passport control (for some international flights)
*[[Gate (airport)|Gates]]
*Waiting areas

The following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:
*Passport control (international arrivals only)
*Baggage reclaim facilities, often in the form of a [[Baggage carousel|carousel]]
*Customs (international arrivals only)
*A landside meeting place

For both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as [[jet bridge]]s or [[airstair]]s. There also needs to be a [[baggage handling system]], to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.

The area where the aircraft park to load passengers and baggage is known as an ''apron'' or ''ramp'' (or incorrectly{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, \"the tarmac\").

[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 114 Airport international terminal interior.jpg|thumb|Terminal 2 at [[Mumbai]]'s [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]].]]
Airports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.

\"[[Floating airport]]s\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as [[pneumatic stabilized platform]] technology.

===Airport security===
{{Main|Airport security}}
{{See also|Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks}}
[[File:Flughafenkontrolle.jpg|thumb|Baggage is scanned using [[X-ray generator|X-ray machines]] as passengers walk through [[metal detector]]s]]
Airport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the [[September 11 attacks]] and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.

===Products and services===
[[File:HFX Airport 5.jpg|left|thumb|Food court and shops, [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]], Canada]]
[[File:Duty Free - Suvarnabhumi Airport.jpg|thumb|Duty-free shop at [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]] in [[Bangkok]], Thailand]]
Most major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2&nbsp;billion in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel|title=Your Misery at the Airport Is Great for Business|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2017/09/why_airport_retail_is_booming.html|accessdate=September 8, 2017|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers' [[suggested retail price]] (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Apart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food or culture without leaving the airport.<ref>USA Today newspaper, October 17, 2006, p. 2D</ref>

Some airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.

Major airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the [[capsule hotel]] popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a [[sleep box]]. An even larger type is provided by the company [[YOTEL]].

=== Premium and VIP services ===
[[File:ZiaAirportVIP-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shahjalal International Airport]]'s [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Airport terminal|Terminal]], [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh ]]
Airports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express [[Airport check-in|check-in]] and dedicated check-in counters.
These services are usually reserved for [[First class (aviation)|first]] and [[business class]] passengers, premium [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flyers]], and members of the airline's clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline's frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.

Sometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.

Airline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have [[airport chair|seating]], showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, [[Wi-Fi]] and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.

Airlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.

=== Cargo and freight service ===
In addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. [[Cargo airline]]s often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.

Cargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading on the aircraft. Similarly import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.

Every cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import and interline or transshipment.
[[File:Aeroporto Internacional de Guararapes.jpg|thumb|[[Recife International Airport]] in [[Recife]], Brazil.]]

=== Access and onward travel ===
Airports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.

Many large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of [[multimodal transport]], for instance [[Frankfurt Airport]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], [[London Heathrow Airport]], [[Tokyo Haneda Airport]], [[Tokyo Narita Airport]], [[London Gatwick Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]]. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with [[rapid transit]], [[light rail]] lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the [[AirTrain JFK]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Transportation in New York City|New York]], [[Link Light Rail]] that runs from the heart of downtown [[Seattle]] to [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]], and the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|T]] at [[Boston]]'s [[Logan International Airport]] by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to [[traffic congestion]]. Large airports usually have access also through [[controlled-access highway]]s ('freeways' or 'motorways') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.

=== Internal transport ===
The distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide [[moving walkway]]s, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], [[Mexico City International Airport]] and [[London Gatwick Airport]].

== Airport operations ==
[[File:HFX Airport 4.jpg|left|thumb|The apron from the top floor observation room, Halifax International Airport, Canada]]

There are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:
*Runways, for takeoff and landing
*[[Taxiway]]s, where planes \"taxi\" (transfer to and from a runway)
*[[Airport apron|Apron]] or ramp: a surface where planes are parked, loaded, unloaded or refuelled.

=== Air traffic control ===
[[File:Torre de controle Rio de Janeiro (Galeao).jpg|thumb|Airport tower]]
[[Air traffic control]] (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.

A \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a [[Air traffic control#Air traffic control tower|control tower]] where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"[[non-towered airport|non-towered]]\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport's [[common traffic advisory frequency]] (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.

The majority of the world's airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have [[24/7]] ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under [[Area control center|area (en-route) control]]. [[Remote and virtual tower]] (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.

Air traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ''ground'' and ''tower'', though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with ''clearance delivery'', ''apron control'', and/or other specialized ATC stations.

====Ground control====
Ground control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"[[maneuvering area|movement areas]]\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.

====Tower control====
Tower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the [[controlled airspace]] immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft's position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.

=== Traffic pattern ===
{{Main|Airfield traffic pattern}}
[[File:Airport Traffic Pattern with Upwind Leg.svg|frameless|upright=1.8|right|Left-hand circuit pattern]]
At all airports the use of a [[Airfield traffic pattern|traffic pattern]] (often called a ''traffic circuit'' outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, ''provided there is no queue''. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the [[glidepath]], without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] equipment, things are very different though.

Generally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually {{convert|800|or|1000|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[above ground level]] (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are ''left-handed'', meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a [[mid-air collision]].

At controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.

=== Navigational aids ===
[[File:Vasi-1.JPG|left|thumb|Standard [[Visual Approach Slope Indicator]]]]
There are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A [[visual approach slope indicator]] (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.

Larger airports sometimes offer [[precision approach radar]] (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft's horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the [[Final approach (aviation)|approach slope]]. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.

=== Taxiway signs ===
{{Further|Taxiway#Taxiway signs}}
Airport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.

=== Lighting ===
{{Further|Taxiway#Taxiway lights|Runway#Runway lighting}}

[[File:ATL TWY B - RWY Crossing (13534655025).jpg|thumb|Airport lighting]]
Many airports have [[Runway lighting|lighting]] that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.

On runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. [[Runway edge lights|Runway edge lighting]] consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an [[approach lighting system]], or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use [[pilot-controlled lighting]] to save electricity and staffing costs.

Along taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway's edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.

=== Weather observations ===
{{See also|Surface weather observation|Weather station|Automated airport weather station|Automatic weather station}}

[[File:2008-07-09 Eureka Airport AWOS viewed from the south.jpg|thumb|Automated weather system]]
Weather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of [[automated airport weather station]], whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the [[METAR]] format, are available over the radio, through [[automatic terminal information service]] (ATIS), via the ATC or the [[flight service station]].

Planes take-off and land ''into'' the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a [[windsock]] can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.piggottsflagsandbranding.co.uk/updates/interesting-facts-industrial-windsocks/|title=Why do airports have windsocks?|date=|website=Piggotts Flags And Branding|access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>

=== Airport ground crew (ground handling) ===
{{Main|Ground support equipment}}
[[File:KLM 777 pushback.jpg|thumb|An aircraft tow tractor moving a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 777]]]]
[[File:20140308 Airport ground operations.jpg|thumb|left|Ground operations at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]]]
Most airports have [[groundcrew]] handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.

Among the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:
*A tow tractor to move the aircraft in and out of the berth.
*A [[jet bridge]] (in some airports) or stairs unit to allow passengers to embark and disembark.
*A ground power unit for supplying electricity. As the engines will be switched off, they will not be generating electricity as they do in flight.
*A cleaning service.
*A catering service to deliver food and drinks for a flight.
*A toilet waste truck to empty the tank which holds the waste from the toilets in the aircraft.
*A water truck to fill the water tanks of the aircraft.
*A refueling vehicle. The fuel may come from a tanker, or from underground fuel tanks.
*A conveyor belt unit for loading and unloading luggage.
*A vehicle to transport luggage to and from the terminal.
The length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"[[turnaround time]]\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.

=== Maintenance management ===
Like industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.<ref name=Mothes/>

To manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: [[Computerized maintenance management system|CMMS (computerized maintenance management system)]] predominate, and mainly enable a company's maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.<ref name=Mothes>{{cite web |first=Daphné |last=Mothes |title=Improve your airport maintenance with your CMMS |url=https://www.mobility-work.com/blog/improve-your-airport-maintenance-your-cmms |work=Mobility Work |date=January 15, 2019 |access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref>

=== Safety management ===
[[File:Altenburg-Nobitz Airport Rosenbauer Panther.jpg|thumb|\"FLF Panther\" airport crash tender in Germany]]
[[File:Sumburgh Airport Barrier.webm|thumb|Road crossing of ([[Shetland]]) A970 with [[Sumburgh Airport|Sumburgh]] airport's runway. The movable barrier closes when aircraft land or take off.]]
[[Aviation safety]] is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. [[Airport crash tender]] crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable [[aviation fuel]]. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]], and terrorist activities.

Hazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is [[airfield rubber removal]] which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see [[foreign object damage]]). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special [[deicing]] fluids on the wings.

Many airports are built near open fields or [[wetland]]s. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of [[bird strike]]s. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.

Some airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.

An airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any [[runway incursion|incursions]] where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.

During the 1980s, a phenomenon known as [[microburst]] became a growing concern due to [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aircraft accidents]] caused by microburst [[wind shear]], such as [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]]. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.

Some airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway ([[Blast pad|stopway]] or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like [[styrofoam]], bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.

Airports often have [[Aircraft rescue and firefighting|on-site firefighters]] to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as [[airport crash tender]]s.

== Environmental concerns and sustainability ==
[[File:Pista Congonhas01.jpg|thumb|Runway at [[Congonhas-São Paulo Airport]] in Brazil.]]
[[Aircraft noise]] is a major cause of [[Noise pollution|noise disturbance]] to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings, but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other [[Health effects from noise|noise health effects]]. Other noise and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading the airport.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catsr.ite.gmu.edu/SYST460/IntroAirportsWorkbook.pdf|title=Introduction to Airports Design and Operations|last=Sherry|first=Lance|year=2009|website=George Mason University Center for Air Transportation Systems Research|access-date=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Some of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all [[environmental protection]] measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.

A 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US [[Transportation Research Board]] showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a providing ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=National Academies of Sciences|first=Engineering|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25609/airport-greenhouse-gas-reduction-efforts|title=Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts|date=October 23, 2019|language=en}}</ref>

A growing number of airports are installing solar [[photovoltaic]] arrays to offset their electricity use.<ref>Anurag et al. [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/8/1194 General Design Procedures for Airport-Based Solar Photovoltaic Systems]. ''Energies'' 2017, 10(8), 1194; doi:10.3390/en10081194</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/2016/03/7-cool-solar-installations-at-u-s-airports/|title=7 cool solar installations at U.S. airports|date=|website=solarpowerworldonline.com}}</ref> The [[National Renewable Energy Lab]] has shown this can be done safely.<ref>A. Kandt and R. Romero . Implementing Solar Technologies at Airports. NREL Report. Available:
https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy14osti/62349.pdf</ref>

The world's first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at [[Cochin International Airport|Kochi]], India. Another airport known for considering environmental parameters is the [[Seymour Airport]] at Galapagos Islands.

== {{anchor|Military airbase}} Military air base ==
{{Main|Air base}}
[[File:French Air Contingent, NATO Baltic Air-policing.jpg|thumb|[[Fighter aircraft]] at an airbase in [[Lithuania]]]]
An airbase, sometimes referred to as an ''air station'' or ''airfield'', provides basing and support of [[military aircraft]]. Some airbases, known as ''military airports'', provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, [[RAF Brize Norton]] in the UK has a terminal which caters to passengers for the [[Royal Air Force]]'s scheduled flights to the [[Falkland Islands]]. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. [[Bardufoss Airport]], [[Bardufoss Air Station]] in Norway and [[Pune Airport]] in India are examples of this.

An [[aircraft carrier]] is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a [[Navy|naval force]] to project [[Aerial warfare|air power]] without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.

== Airport designation and naming ==
{{Further|List of airports}}

Airports are uniquely represented by their [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA airport code]] and [[International Civil Aviation Organization airport code|ICAO airport code]].

Most airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]), a monarch (e.g. [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]], [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]]), a cultural leader (e.g. [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]], [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport]], [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]]) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. [[Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport]]), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. [[Allama Iqbal International Airport]]) and explorers (e.g. [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]]).

Some airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Some airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle [[International airport|international air traffic]]. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. [[Albany International Airport]]).

== History and development ==
[[File:Kharkov Airport Sokolniki.jpg|thumb|The Kharkiv Airport in Sokolniki, [[Ukraine]] (1924).]]
The earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1JcWmb9Ik8C&pg=PA154|title=Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety|last=Thomas|first=Andrew R.|date=2011|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3677-1|page=154}}</ref> The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.

The title of \"world's oldest airport\" is disputed. [[College Park Airport]] in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by [[Wright brothers|Wilbur Wright]], is generally agreed to be the world's oldest continuously operating airfield,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgparks.com/places/historic/cpairport.html |title=College Park Airport |publisher=Pgparks.com |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531180243/http://pgparks.com/places/historic/cpairport.html |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> although it serves only [[general aviation]] traffic. 

[[Beijing Nanyuan Airport]] in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.<ref>http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2019/09/25/629668.html</ref> It was in operation until September 2019. [[Pearson Field Airport]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]], United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2020.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

[[Hamburg Airport]] opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. [[Bremen Airport]] opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted [[Civil aviation|civil aircraft]] only since December 17, 1920, allowing [[Sydney Airport]]—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world's oldest continuously operating commercial airports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |title=Sydney Airport history |format=PDF |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401043447/http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}</ref> [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport]] in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. [[Rome Ciampino Airport]], opened 1916, is also a contender, as well as the [[Don Mueang International Airport]] near Bangkok, Thailand, which opened in 1914.
Increased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.
[[File:New Orleans postcard Moissant Airport 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New Orleans International Airport]] passenger terminal building in [[New Orleans]] (1960s).]]
Following the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport]] at [[Le Bourget]], near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by [[Croydon Airport]] in March 1920.<ref>Bluffield (2009)</ref> In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at [[Kaliningrad Devau Airport|Flughafen Devau]] near what was then [[Königsberg]], East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.

The first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s [[Approach lighting system|approach lighting]] came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft's position on the [[Instrument landing system|glideslope]]. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.
[[File:Bosasairp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bender Qassim International Airport]] in [[Bosaso]], Somalia (2007).]]
After [[World War II]], airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.

An improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane's wheels.

Airport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in [[jet aircraft]] traffic. Runways were extended out to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}}. The fields were constructed out of [[reinforced concrete]] using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare#Anti-UAV defences|counter unmanned air system]] (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia [[AARTOS]] which have been installed on major international airports<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/uv-online/heathrows-picks-new-c-uas-combat-drone-disruption/ |title=Heathrow picks C-UAS to combat drone disruption |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unmannedairspace.info/counter-uas-systems-and-policies/muscat-international-airport-install-usd10-million-aaronia-counter-uas-system/ |title=Muscat International Airport to install USD10&nbsp;million Aaronia counter-UAS system |accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref>.

== Airports in entertainment ==
[[File:Washington Dulles International Airport at Dusk.jpg|thumb|[[Washington Dulles International Airport]], ostensibly the setting for ''[[Die Hard 2]]''; the movie was actually filmed at [[Los Angeles International Airport]]]]
Airports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is ''[[The Terminal]]'', a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'', ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[Die Hard 2]]'', ''[[Soul Plane]]'', ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'', ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', ''[[Liar Liar]]'', ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000), ''[[Unaccompanied Minors]]'', ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]'' and ''[[The Langoliers (TV miniseries)|The Langoliers]]''. They have also played important parts in television series like ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model, Cycle 10]]'' which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.

Several computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. These include the [[Airport Tycoon]] series, SimAirport and Airport CEO.

An airport consists of a [[landing area]], which comprises an aerially accessible open space including at least one operationally active surface such as a [[runway]] for a [[airplane|plane]] to take off<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/runway?show=0&t=1422938979|title=Runway – Definition of runway by Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> or a [[helipad]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/helipad|title=Helipad – Definition of helipad by Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> and often includes adjacent utility buildings such as control towers, [[hangar]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangars|title=Hangar – Definition of hangar by Merriam-Webster|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> and [[airport terminal|terminal]]s. Larger airports may have [[airport apron]]s, [[taxiway bridge]]s, air traffic control centres, passenger facilities such as restaurants and [[Airport lounge|lounges]], and [[emergency service]]s. In some countries, the US in particular, airports also typically have one or more [[fixed-base operator]]s, serving general aviation.

An airport solely serving helicopters is called a [[heliport]]. An airport for use by [[seaplane]]s and [[amphibious aircraft]] is called a [[seaplane base]]. Such a base typically includes a stretch of open water for [[takeoff]]s and [[landing]]s, and seaplane docks for tying-up.  Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport in USA is the busiest and biggest airport in the world. 

An [[international airport]] has additional facilities for customs and [[Border control|passport control]] as well as incorporating all the aforementioned elements. Such airports rank among the most complex and largest of all built typologies, with [[List of largest buildings#Largest floor area|15 of the top 50 buildings by floor area]] being airport terminals.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/38684926/design8docx/|title=design8.docx – AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT PAGE NO 1 What is an Airport An airport is an aerodrome with extended facilities mostly for commercial air transport|website=coursehero.com|access-date=May 7, 2019}}</ref>

== Terminology ==
[[File:Gardemoen airport.jpg|thumb|[[Jet bridge|Air bridges]] at [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo Airport]] from an [[Icelandair]] [[Boeing 757]]-200]]
The terms ''[[aerodrome]]'', ''[[airfield]]'', and ''[[airstrip]]'' also refer to airports, and the terms ''heliport'', ''seaplane base'', and ''[[STOLport]]'' refer to airports dedicated exclusively to [[helicopters]], [[seaplanes]], and [[STOL|short take-off and landing]] aircraft.

In colloquial use in certain environments, the terms ''airport'' and ''aerodrome'' are often interchanged. However, in general, the term ''airport'' may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other [[aerodrome]]s may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, ''airport'' is a legal [[Technical terminology|term of art]] reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant [[national aviation authority]] after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.<ref>{{CFS}}</ref>

That is to say, all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. In jurisdictions where there is no legal distinction between ''aerodrome'' and ''airport'', which term to use in the name of an aerodrome may be a commercial decision. In US technical/legal usage, ''landing area'' is used instead of ''aerodrome'', and ''airport'' means \"a landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging passengers or cargo\".<ref>49 U.S.C. § 40102(a) (2012)</ref>

==Management==
[[File:Kuala Lumpur International Airport, Malaysia.jpg|thumb|[[Kuala Lumpur]]'s [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] Main Terminal ]]
Smaller or less-developed airfields, which represent the vast majority, often have a single runway shorter than {{Convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}. Larger airports for airline flights generally have paved runways of {{Convert|2000|m|abbr=on}} or longer. Skyline Airport in [[Inkom, Idaho]] has a runway that is only {{convert|122|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.airnav.com/airport/1ID9|title=AirNav: 1ID9 – Skyline Airport|website=airnav.com|access-date=April 10, 2018}}</ref>

In the United States, the minimum dimensions for dry, hard landing fields are defined by the [[Federal Aviation Regulations|FAR Landing And Takeoff Field Lengths]]. These include considerations for safety margins during landing and takeoff.

The [[List of longest runways|longest public-use runway]] in the world is at [[Qamdo Bamda Airport]] in China. It has a length of {{convert|5500|m|0|abbr=on}}. The world's widest paved runway is at [[Ulyanovsk Vostochny Airport]] in Russia and is {{convert|105|m|0|abbr=on}} wide.

{{as of|2009}}, the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] stated that there were approximately 44,000 \"airports or airfields recognizable from the air\" around the world, including 15,095 in the US, the US having the most in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2053.html|title=The World Factbook|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2053rank.html|title=The World Factbook|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref>

=== Airport ownership and operation ===
[[File:BBI 2010-07-23 5.JPG|thumb|The [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] is publicly financed by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg and the Federal Republic of Germany.]]

Most of the world's large airports are owned by local, regional, or national government bodies who then lease the airport to private corporations who oversee the airport's operation. For example, in the UK the state-owned [[Heathrow Airport Holdings|British Airports Authority]] originally operated eight of the nation's major commercial airports – it was subsequently privatized in the late 1980s, and following its takeover by the Spanish [[Ferrovial]] consortium in 2006, has been further divested and downsized to operating just Heathrow. Germany's [[Frankfurt Airport]] is managed by the quasi-private firm [[Fraport]]. While in India [[GMR Group]] operates, through joint ventures, [[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] and [[Rajiv Gandhi International Airport]]. [[Bengaluru International Airport]] and [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]] are controlled by GVK Group. The rest of India's airports are managed by the [[Airports Authority of India]]. In Pakistan nearly all civilian airports are owned and operated by the [[Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority]] except for [[Sialkot International Airport]] which has the distinction of being the first privately owned public airport in Pakistan and South Asia{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

In the US, commercial airports are generally operated directly by government entities or government-created [[Airport authority|airport authorities]] (also known as [[Port authority|port authorities]]), such as the [[Los Angeles World Airports]] authority that oversees several airports in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]], including [[Los Angeles International Airport]]{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.

In Canada, the federal authority, Transport Canada, divested itself of all but the remotest airports in 1999/2000. Now most airports in Canada are owned and operated by individual legal authorities or are municipally owned.

Many US airports still lease part or all of their facilities to outside firms, who operate functions such as retail management and parking. All US commercial airport runways are certified by the FAA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/faa|title=FAA|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref> under the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] Title 14 Part 139, \"Certification of Commercial Service Airports\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert/ |title=Part 139 Airport Certification |publisher=[[FAA]] |date=June 19, 2009 |accessdate=July 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100729055419/http://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/part139_cert/| archivedate= July 29, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> but maintained by the local airport under the regulatory authority of the FAA.

Despite the reluctance to privatize airports in the US (contrary to the [[FAA]] sponsoring a privatization program since 1996), the government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) arrangement is the standard for the operation of commercial airports in the rest of the world.

=== Airport funding ===

The [[Airport and Airway Trust Fund|Airport & Airway Trust Fund]] ([[Airport and Airway Trust Fund|AATF]]) was created by the [[Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970|Airport and Airway Development in 1970]] which finances aviation programs in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/budget/aatf/|title=Airport & Airway Trust Fund (AATF)|website=faa.gov|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> [[Airport Improvement Program]] (AIP), Facilities and Equipment (F&E), and Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) are the three major accounts of [[Federal Aviation Administration]] which are financed by the AATF, as well as pays for the FAA's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) account.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44749.pdf|title=The Airport and Airway Trust Fund|last=Tang|first=Rachel|date=January 31, 2017|website=Congressional Research Service}}</ref> The funding of these accounts are dependent on the taxes the airports generate of revenues. [[Airline ticket|Passenger ticket]]<nowiki/>s, [[Fuel economy in aircraft|fuel]], and [[Cargo aircraft|cargo]] tax are the taxes that are paid by the passengers and airlines help fund these accounts.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Office|first=U.

=== Airport revenue ===
Airports revenues are divided into three major parts: [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] revenue, non-aeronautical revenue, and non-operating revenue. Aeronautical revenue makes up 56%, non-aeronautical revenue makes up 40%, and non-operating revenue makes up 4% of the total revenue of airports.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://simpleflying.com/how-airports-make-money/|title=How Airports Actually Make Money|date=July 21, 2018|website=Simple Flying|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref><!--This is for US airports? It needs to specify.-->

==== Aeronautical revenue ====
Aeronautical revenue are generated through airline rents and landing, passenger service, parking, and hangar fees. Landing fees are charged per aircraft for landing an airplane in the airport property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://guides.erau.edu/c.php?g=153797&p=1009544|title=Landing fees|website=guides.erau.edu}}</ref> [[Landing fee]]s are calculated through the landing weight and the size of the aircraft which varies but most of the airports have a fixed rate and a charge extra for extra weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://assets.flysfo.com.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/investor/SummaryChargesFY1617.pdf|title=SUMMARY OF AIRPORT CHARGES|last=Farooqui|first=Aaryan|website=assest.flysfo}}</ref> Passenger service fees are charges per passengers for the facilities used on a flight like water, food, [[Wi-Fi|wifi]] and shows which is paid while paying for an [[airline ticket]].{{cn|date=November 2019}} Aircraft parking is also a major revenue source for airports. Aircraft are parked for a certain amount of time before or after takeoff and have to pay to park there.<ref name=\"researchgate.net\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322037374_The_Current_Situation_and_Change_in_Airport_Revenues_Research_on_The_Europe's_Five_Busiest_Airports|title=The Current Situation and Change in Airport Revenues: Research on The Europe's Five Busiest Airports}}</ref> Every airport has his own rates of parking but at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F Kennedy airport]] in New York City charges $45 per hour for the plane of 100,000 pounds and the price increases with weight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.panynj.gov/airports/pdf/scheduleofcharges-jfk.pdf|title=SCHEDULE OF CHARGES FOR AIR TERMINALS John F. Kennedy International Airport}}</ref>

==== Non-aeronautical revenue ====
Non-aeronautical revenue is gained through things other than aircraft operations. It includes lease revenue from compatible land-use development, non-aeronautical building leases, retail and concession sales, rental car operations, parking and in-airport advertising.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/14275/chapter/4|title=Read \"Guidebook for Managing Small Airports - Second Edition\" at NAP.edu|language=en}}</ref> Concession revenue is one big part of non-aeronautical revenue airports makes through [[Duty-free shop|duty free]], bookstores, Restaurants and [[Foreign exchange market|money exchange]].<ref name=\"researchgate.net\"/> Car parking is a growing source of revenue for airports, as more people use the [[Parking lot|parking facilities]] of the airport. [[O'Hare International Airport]] in Chicago charges $2 per hour for every car.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flychicago.com/ohare/tofrom/parking/Pages/economy.aspx|title=Economy Parking {{!}} Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)|website=www.flychicago.com|access-date=May 6, 2019}}</ref>

===Landside and airside areas===
Airports are divided into landside and airside areas. The landside area is open to the public, while access to the airside area is tightly controlled. The airside area includes all parts of the airport around the aircraft, and the parts of the buildings that are accessible only to passengers and staff. Passengers and staff must be checked by [[airport security|security]] before being permitted to enter the airside area. Conversely, passengers arriving from an international flight must pass through [[border control]] and customs to access the landside area, where they can exit the airport. Many major airports will issue a secure [[keycard]] called an [[airside pass]] to employees, as some roles require employees to frequently move back and forth between landside and airside as part of their duties.

==Facilities==

[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Singapore's [[Singapore Changi Airport]] Terminal 3 ]]
A [[Airport terminal|terminal]] is a building with passenger facilities. Small airports have one terminal. Large ones often have multiple terminals, though some large airports like [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] still have one terminal. The terminal has a series of [[Gate (airport)|gates]], which provide passengers with access to the plane.

The following facilities are essential for departing passengers:
*[[Airport check-in|Check-in facilities]], including a baggage drop-off
*[[Airport security|Security clearance gates]]
*Passport control (for some international flights)
*[[Gate (airport)|Gates]]
*Waiting areas

The following facilities are essential for arriving passengers:
*Passport control (international arrivals only)
*Baggage reclaim facilities, often in the form of a [[Baggage carousel|carousel]]
*Customs (international arrivals only)
*A landside meeting place

For both sets of passengers, there must be a link between the passenger facilities and the aircraft, such as [[jet bridge]]s or [[airstair]]s. There also needs to be a [[baggage handling system]], to transport baggage from the baggage drop-off to departing planes, and from arriving planes to the baggage reclaim.

The area where the aircraft park to load passengers and baggage is known as an ''apron'' or ''ramp'' (or incorrectly{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}, \"the tarmac\").

[[File:Mumbai 03-2016 114 Airport international terminal interior.jpg|thumb|Terminal 2 at [[Mumbai]]'s [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]].]]
Airports with international flights have customs and immigration facilities. However, as some countries have agreements that allow travel between them without customs and immigrations, such facilities are not a definitive need for an international airport. International flights often require a higher level of physical security, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for international and domestic travel.

\"[[Floating airport]]s\" are being designed which could be located out at sea and which would use designs such as [[pneumatic stabilized platform]] technology.

===Airport security===
{{Main|Airport security}}
{{See also|Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks}}
[[File:Flughafenkontrolle.jpg|thumb|Baggage is scanned using [[X-ray generator|X-ray machines]] as passengers walk through [[metal detector]]s]]
Airport security normally requires baggage checks, metal screenings of individual persons, and rules against any object that could be used as a weapon. Since the [[September 11 attacks]] and the Real ID Act of 2005, airport security has dramatically increased and got tighter and stricter than ever before.

===Products and services===
[[File:HFX Airport 5.jpg|left|thumb|Food court and shops, [[Halifax Stanfield International Airport]], Canada]]
[[File:Duty Free - Suvarnabhumi Airport.jpg|thumb|Duty-free shop at [[Suvarnabhumi International Airport]] in [[Bangkok]], Thailand]]
Most major airports provide commercial outlets for products and services. Most of these companies, many of which are internationally known brands, are located within the departure areas. These include clothing boutiques and restaurants and in the US amounted to $4.2&nbsp;billion in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel|title=Your Misery at the Airport Is Great for Business|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/metropolis/2017/09/why_airport_retail_is_booming.html|accessdate=September 8, 2017|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=September 7, 2017}}</ref> Prices charged for items sold at these outlets are generally higher than those outside the airport. However, some airports now regulate costs to keep them comparable to \"street prices\". This term is misleading as prices often match the manufacturers' [[suggested retail price]] (MSRP) but are almost never discounted.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Apart from major fast food chains, some airport restaurants offer regional cuisine specialties for those in transit so that they may sample local food or culture without leaving the airport.<ref>USA Today newspaper, October 17, 2006, p. 2D</ref>

Some airport structures include on-site hotels built within or attached to a terminal building. Airport hotels have grown popular due to their convenience for transient passengers and easy accessibility to the airport terminal. Many airport hotels also have agreements with airlines to provide overnight lodging for displaced passengers.

Major airports in such countries as Russia and Japan offer miniature sleeping units within the airport that are available for rent by the hour. The smallest type is the [[capsule hotel]] popular in Japan. A slightly larger variety is known as a [[sleep box]]. An even larger type is provided by the company [[YOTEL]].

=== Premium and VIP services ===
[[File:ZiaAirportVIP-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shahjalal International Airport]]'s [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Airport terminal|Terminal]], [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh ]]
Airports may also contain premium and VIP services. The premium and VIP services may include express [[Airport check-in|check-in]] and dedicated check-in counters.
These services are usually reserved for [[First class (aviation)|first]] and [[business class]] passengers, premium [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flyers]], and members of the airline's clubs. Premium services may sometimes be open to passengers who are members of a different airline's frequent flyer program. This can sometimes be part of a reciprocal deal, as when multiple airlines are part of the same alliance, or as a ploy to attract premium customers away from rival airlines.

Sometimes these premium services will be offered to a non-premium passenger if the airline has made a mistake in handling of the passenger, such as unreasonable delays or mishandling of checked baggage.

Airline lounges frequently offer free or reduced cost food, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Lounges themselves typically have [[airport chair|seating]], showers, quiet areas, televisions, computer, [[Wi-Fi]] and Internet access, and power outlets that passengers may use for their electronic equipment. Some airline lounges employ baristas, bartenders and gourmet chefs.

Airlines sometimes operate multiple lounges within the one airport terminal allowing ultra-premium customers, such as first class customers, additional services, which are not available to other premium customers. Multiple lounges may also prevent overcrowding of the lounge facilities.

=== Cargo and freight service ===
In addition to people, airports move cargo around the clock. [[Cargo airline]]s often have their own on-site and adjacent infrastructure to transfer parcels between ground and air.

Cargo Terminal Facilities are areas where international airports export cargo has to be stored after customs clearance and prior to loading on the aircraft. Similarly import cargo that is offloaded needs to be in bond before the consignee decides to take delivery. Areas have to be kept aside for examination of export and import cargo by the airport authorities. Designated areas or sheds may be given to airlines or freight forward ring agencies.

Every cargo terminal has a landside and an airside. The landside is where the exporters and importers through either their agents or by themselves deliver or collect shipments while the airside is where loads are moved to or from the aircraft. In addition cargo terminals are divided into distinct areas – export, import and interline or transshipment.
[[File:Aeroporto Internacional de Guararapes.jpg|thumb|[[Recife International Airport]] in [[Recife]], Brazil.]]

=== Access and onward travel ===
Airports require parking lots, for passengers who may leave the cars at the airport for a long period of time. Large airports will also have car-rental firms, taxi ranks, bus stops and sometimes a train station.

Many large airports are located near railway trunk routes for seamless connection of [[multimodal transport]], for instance [[Frankfurt Airport]], [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]], [[London Heathrow Airport]], [[Tokyo Haneda Airport]], [[Tokyo Narita Airport]], [[London Gatwick Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]]. It is also common to connect an airport and a city with [[rapid transit]], [[light rail]] lines or other non-road public transport systems. Some examples of this would include the [[AirTrain JFK]] at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[Transportation in New York City|New York]], [[Link Light Rail]] that runs from the heart of downtown [[Seattle]] to [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]], and the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|T]] at [[Boston]]'s [[Logan International Airport]] by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA). Such a connection lowers risk of missed flights due to [[traffic congestion]]. Large airports usually have access also through [[controlled-access highway]]s ('freeways' or 'motorways') from which motor vehicles enter either the departure loop or the arrival loop.

=== Internal transport ===
The distances passengers need to move within a large airport can be substantial. It is common for airports to provide [[moving walkway]]s, buses, and rail transport systems. Some airports like [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] and [[London Stansted Airport]] have a transit system that connects some of the gates to a main terminal. Airports with more than one terminal have a transit system to connect the terminals together, such as [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], [[Mexico City International Airport]] and [[London Gatwick Airport]].

== Airport operations ==
[[File:HFX Airport 4.jpg|left|thumb|The apron from the top floor observation room, Halifax International Airport, Canada]]

There are three types of surface that aircraft operate on:
*Runways, for takeoff and landing
*[[Taxiway]]s, where planes \"taxi\" (transfer to and from a runway)
*[[Airport apron|Apron]] or ramp: a surface where planes are parked, loaded, unloaded or refuelled.

=== Air traffic control ===
[[File:Torre de controle Rio de Janeiro (Galeao).jpg|thumb|Airport tower]]
[[Air traffic control]] (ATC) is the task of managing aircraft movements and making sure they are safe, orderly and expeditious. At the largest airports, air traffic control is a series of highly complex operations that requires managing frequent traffic that moves in all three dimensions.

A \"towered\" or \"controlled\" airport has a [[Air traffic control#Air traffic control tower|control tower]] where the air traffic controllers are based. Pilots are required to maintain two-way radio communication with the controllers, and to acknowledge and comply with their instructions. A \"[[non-towered airport|non-towered]]\" airport has no operating control tower and therefore two-way radio communications are not required, though it is good operating practice for pilots to transmit their intentions on the airport's [[common traffic advisory frequency]] (CTAF) for the benefit of other aircraft in the area. The CTAF may be a Universal Integrated Community (UNICOM), MULTICOM, Flight Service Station (FSS), or tower frequency.

The majority of the world's airports are small facilities without a tower. Not all towered airports have [[24/7]] ATC operations. In those cases, non-towered procedures apply when the tower is not in use, such as at night. Non-towered airports come under [[Area control center|area (en-route) control]]. [[Remote and virtual tower]] (RVT) is a system in which ATC is handled by controllers who are not present at the airport itself.

Air traffic control responsibilities at airports are usually divided into at least two main areas: ''ground'' and ''tower'', though a single controller may work both stations. The busiest airports may subdivide responsibilities further, with ''clearance delivery'', ''apron control'', and/or other specialized ATC stations.

====Ground control====
Ground control is responsible for directing all ground traffic in designated \"[[maneuvering area|movement areas]]\", except the traffic on runways. This includes planes, baggage trains, snowplows, grass cutters, fuel trucks, stair trucks, airline food trucks, conveyor belt vehicles and other vehicles. Ground Control will instruct these vehicles on which taxiways to use, which runway they will use (in the case of planes), where they will park, and when it is safe to cross runways. When a plane is ready to takeoff it will be turned over to tower control. Conversely, after a plane has landed it will depart the runway and be \"handed over\" from Tower to Ground Control.

====Tower control====
Tower control is responsible for aircraft on the runway and in the [[controlled airspace]] immediately surrounding the airport. Tower controllers may use radar to locate an aircraft's position in 3D space, or they may rely on pilot position reports and visual observation. They coordinate the sequencing of aircraft in the traffic pattern and direct aircraft on how to safely join and leave the circuit. Aircraft which are only passing through the airspace must also contact tower control to be sure they remain clear of other traffic.

=== Traffic pattern ===
{{Main|Airfield traffic pattern}}
[[File:Airport Traffic Pattern with Upwind Leg.svg|frameless|upright=1.8|right|Left-hand circuit pattern]]
At all airports the use of a [[Airfield traffic pattern|traffic pattern]] (often called a ''traffic circuit'' outside the US) is possible. They may help to assure smooth traffic flow between departing and arriving aircraft. There is no technical need within modern commercial aviation for performing this pattern, ''provided there is no queue''. And due to the so-called SLOT-times, the overall traffic planning tend to assure landing queues are avoided. If for instance an aircraft approaches runway 17 (which has a heading of approx. 170 degrees) from the north (coming from 360/0 degrees heading towards 180 degrees), the aircraft will land as fast as possible by just turning 10 degrees and follow the [[glidepath]], without orbit the runway for visual reasons, whenever this is possible. For smaller piston engined airplanes at smaller airfields without [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] equipment, things are very different though.

Generally, this pattern is a circuit consisting of five \"legs\" that form a rectangle (two legs and the runway form one side, with the remaining legs forming three more sides). Each leg is named (see diagram), and ATC directs pilots on how to join and leave the circuit. Traffic patterns are flown at one specific altitude, usually {{convert|800|or|1000|ft|abbr=on|0}} [[above ground level]] (AGL). Standard traffic patterns are ''left-handed'', meaning all turns are made to the left. One of the main reason for this is that pilots sit on the left side of the airplane, and a Left-hand patterns improves their visibility of the airport and pattern. Right-handed patterns do exist, usually because of obstacles such as a mountain, or to reduce noise for local residents. The predetermined circuit helps traffic flow smoothly because all pilots know what to expect, and helps reduce the chance of a [[mid-air collision]].

At controlled airports, a circuit can be in place but is not normally used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request approach clearance while they are still hours away from the airport; the destination airport can then plan a queue of arrivals, and planes will be guided into one queue per active runway for a \"straight-in\" approach. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport ahead of time and is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.

=== Navigational aids ===
[[File:Vasi-1.JPG|left|thumb|Standard [[Visual Approach Slope Indicator]]]]
There are a number of aids, both visual and electronic, though not at all airports. A [[visual approach slope indicator]] (VASI) helps pilots fly the approach for landing. Some airports are equipped with a [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) to help pilots find the direction to the airport. VORs are often accompanied by a [[distance measuring equipment]] (DME) to determine the distance to the VOR. VORs are also located off airports, where they serve to provide airways for aircraft to navigate upon. In poor weather, pilots will use an [[instrument landing system]] (ILS) to find the runway and fly the correct approach, even if they cannot see the ground. The number of instrument approaches based on the use of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) is rapidly increasing and may eventually become the primary means for instrument landings.

Larger airports sometimes offer [[precision approach radar]] (PAR), but these systems are more common at military air bases than civilian airports. The aircraft's horizontal and vertical movement is tracked via radar, and the controller tells the pilot his position relative to the [[Final approach (aviation)|approach slope]]. Once the pilots can see the runway lights, they may continue with a visual landing.

=== Taxiway signs ===
{{Further|Taxiway#Taxiway signs}}
Airport guidance signs provide direction and information to taxiing aircraft and airport vehicles. Smaller aerodromes may have few or no signs, relying instead on diagrams and charts.

=== Lighting ===
{{Further|Taxiway#Taxiway lights|Runway#Runway lighting}}

[[File:ATL TWY B - RWY Crossing (13534655025).jpg|thumb|Airport lighting]]
Many airports have [[Runway lighting|lighting]] that help guide planes using the runways and taxiways at night or in rain or fog.

On runways, green lights indicate the beginning of the runway for landing, while red lights indicate the end of the runway. [[Runway edge lights|Runway edge lighting]] consists of white lights spaced out on both sides of the runway, indicating the edges. Some airports have more complicated lighting on the runways including lights that run down the centerline of the runway and lights that help indicate the approach (an [[approach lighting system]], or ALS). Low-traffic airports may use [[pilot-controlled lighting]] to save electricity and staffing costs.

Along taxiways, blue lights indicate the taxiway's edge, and some airports have embedded green lights that indicate the centerline.

=== Weather observations ===
{{See also|Surface weather observation|Weather station|Automated airport weather station|Automatic weather station}}

[[File:2008-07-09 Eureka Airport AWOS viewed from the south.jpg|thumb|Automated weather system]]
Weather observations at the airport are crucial to safe takeoffs and landings. In the US and Canada, the vast majority of airports, large and small, will either have some form of [[automated airport weather station]], whether an AWOS, ASOS, or AWSS, a human observer or a combination of the two. These weather observations, predominantly in the [[METAR]] format, are available over the radio, through [[automatic terminal information service]] (ATIS), via the ATC or the [[flight service station]].

Planes take-off and land ''into'' the wind to achieve maximum performance. Because pilots need instantaneous information during landing, a [[windsock]] can also be kept in view of the runway. Aviation windsocks are made with lightweight material, withstand strong winds and some are lit up after dark or in foggy weather. Because visibility of windsocks is limited, often multiple glow-orange windsocks are placed on both sides of the runway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.piggottsflagsandbranding.co.uk/updates/interesting-facts-industrial-windsocks/|title=Why do airports have windsocks?|date=|website=Piggotts Flags And Branding|access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref>

=== Airport ground crew (ground handling) ===
{{Main|Ground support equipment}}
[[File:KLM 777 pushback.jpg|thumb|An aircraft tow tractor moving a [[KLM]] [[Boeing 777]]]]
[[File:20140308 Airport ground operations.jpg|thumb|left|Ground operations at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]]]]
Most airports have [[groundcrew]] handling the loading and unloading of passengers, crew, baggage and other services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} Some groundcrew are linked to specific airlines operating at the airport.

Among the vehicles that serve an airliner on the ground are:
*A tow tractor to move the aircraft in and out of the berth.
*A [[jet bridge]] (in some airports) or stairs unit to allow passengers to embark and disembark.
*A ground power unit for supplying electricity. As the engines will be switched off, they will not be generating electricity as they do in flight.
*A cleaning service.
*A catering service to deliver food and drinks for a flight.
*A toilet waste truck to empty the tank which holds the waste from the toilets in the aircraft.
*A water truck to fill the water tanks of the aircraft.
*A refueling vehicle. The fuel may come from a tanker, or from underground fuel tanks.
*A conveyor belt unit for loading and unloading luggage.
*A vehicle to transport luggage to and from the terminal.
The length of time an aircraft remains on the ground in between consecutive flights is known as \"[[turnaround time]]\". Airlines pay great attention to minimizing turnaround times in an effort to keep aircraft use (flying time) high, with times scheduled as low as 25 minutes for jet aircraft operated by low-cost carriers on narrow-body aircraft.

=== Maintenance management ===
Like industrial equipment or facility management, airports require tailor-made maintenance management due to their complexity. With many tangible assets spread over a large area in different environments, these infrastructures must therefore effectively monitor these assets and store spare parts to maintain them at an optimal level of service.<ref name=Mothes/>

To manage these airport assets, several solutions are competing for the market: [[Computerized maintenance management system|CMMS (computerized maintenance management system)]] predominate, and mainly enable a company's maintenance activity to be monitored, planned, recorded and rationalized.<ref name=Mothes>{{cite web |first=Daphné |last=Mothes |title=Improve your airport maintenance with your CMMS |url=https://www.mobility-work.com/blog/improve-your-airport-maintenance-your-cmms |work=Mobility Work |date=January 15, 2019 |access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref>

=== Safety management ===
[[File:Altenburg-Nobitz Airport Rosenbauer Panther.jpg|thumb|\"FLF Panther\" airport crash tender in Germany]]
[[File:Sumburgh Airport Barrier.webm|thumb|Road crossing of ([[Shetland]]) A970 with [[Sumburgh Airport|Sumburgh]] airport's runway. The movable barrier closes when aircraft land or take off.]]
[[Aviation safety]] is an important concern in the operation of an airport, and almost every airfield includes equipment and procedures for handling emergency situations. [[Airport crash tender]] crews are equipped for dealing with airfield accidents, crew and passenger extractions, and the hazards of highly flammable [[aviation fuel]]. The crews are also trained to deal with situations such as bomb threats, [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]], and terrorist activities.

Hazards to aircraft include debris, nesting birds, and reduced friction levels due to environmental conditions such as ice, snow, or rain. Part of runway maintenance is [[airfield rubber removal]] which helps maintain friction levels. The fields must be kept clear of debris using cleaning equipment so that loose material does not become a projectile and enter an engine duct (see [[foreign object damage]]). In adverse weather conditions, ice and snow clearing equipment can be used to improve traction on the landing strip. For waiting aircraft, equipment is used to spray special [[deicing]] fluids on the wings.

Many airports are built near open fields or [[wetland]]s. These tend to attract bird populations, which can pose a hazard to aircraft in the form of [[bird strike]]s. Airport crews often need to discourage birds from taking up residence.

Some airports are located next to parks, golf courses, or other low-density uses of land. Other airports are located near densely populated urban or suburban areas.

An airport can have areas where collisions between aircraft on the ground tend to occur. Records are kept of any [[runway incursion|incursions]] where aircraft or vehicles are in an inappropriate location, allowing these \"hot spots\" to be identified. These locations then undergo special attention by transportation authorities (such as the FAA in the US) and airport administrators.

During the 1980s, a phenomenon known as [[microburst]] became a growing concern due to [[Aviation accidents and incidents|aircraft accidents]] caused by microburst [[wind shear]], such as [[Delta Air Lines Flight 191]]. Microburst radar was developed as an aid to safety during landing, giving two to five minutes' warning to aircraft in the vicinity of the field of a microburst event.

Some airfields now have a special surface known as soft concrete at the end of the runway ([[Blast pad|stopway]] or blastpad) that behaves somewhat like [[styrofoam]], bringing the plane to a relatively rapid halt as the material disintegrates. These surfaces are useful when the runway is located next to a body of water or other hazard, and prevent the planes from overrunning the end of the field.

Airports often have [[Aircraft rescue and firefighting|on-site firefighters]] to respond to emergencies. These use specialized vehicles, known as [[airport crash tender]]s.

== Environmental concerns and sustainability ==
[[File:Pista Congonhas01.jpg|thumb|Runway at [[Congonhas-São Paulo Airport]] in Brazil.]]
[[Aircraft noise]] is a major cause of [[Noise pollution|noise disturbance]] to residents living near airports. Sleep can be affected if the airports operate night and early morning flights. Aircraft noise occurs not only from take-offs and landings, but also from ground operations including maintenance and testing of aircraft. Noise can have other [[Health effects from noise|noise health effects]]. Other noise and environmental concerns are vehicle traffic causing noise and pollution on roads leading the airport.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The construction of new airports or addition of runways to existing airports, is often resisted by local residents because of the effect on countryside, historical sites, local flora and fauna. Due to the risk of collision between birds and aircraft, large airports undertake population control programs where they frighten or shoot birds.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The construction of airports has been known to change local weather patterns. For example, because they often flatten out large areas, they can be susceptible to fog in areas where fog rarely forms. In addition, they generally replace trees and grass with pavement, they often change drainage patterns in agricultural areas, leading to more flooding, run-off and erosion in the surrounding land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://catsr.ite.gmu.edu/SYST460/IntroAirportsWorkbook.pdf|title=Introduction to Airports Design and Operations|last=Sherry|first=Lance|year=2009|website=George Mason University Center for Air Transportation Systems Research|access-date=}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Some of the airport administrations prepare and publish annual environmental reports to show how they consider these environmental concerns in airport management issues and how they protect environment from airport operations. These reports contain all [[environmental protection]] measures performed by airport administration in terms of water, air, soil and noise pollution, resource conservation and protection of natural life around the airport.

A 2019 report from the Cooperative Research Programs of the US [[Transportation Research Board]] showed all airports have a role to play in advancing greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction initiatives. Small airports have demonstrated leadership by using their less complex organizational structure to implement newer technologies and to serve as a providing ground for their feasibility. Large airports have the economic stability and staff resources necessary to grow in-house expertise and fund comprehensive new programs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=National Academies of Sciences|first=Engineering|url=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25609/airport-greenhouse-gas-reduction-efforts|title=Airport Greenhouse Gas Reduction Efforts|date=October 23, 2019|language=en}}</ref>

A growing number of airports are installing solar [[photovoltaic]] arrays to offset their electricity use.<ref>Anurag et al. [http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/8/1194 General Design Procedures for Airport-Based Solar Photovoltaic Systems].

The world's first airport to be fully powered by solar energy is located at [[Cochin International Airport|Kochi]], India. Another airport known for considering environmental parameters is the [[Seymour Airport]] at Galapagos Islands.

{{Main|Air base}}
[[File:French Air Contingent, NATO Baltic Air-policing.jpg|thumb|[[Fighter aircraft]] at an airbase in [[Lithuania]]]]
An airbase, sometimes referred to as an ''air station'' or ''airfield'', provides basing and support of [[military aircraft]]. Some airbases, known as ''military airports'', provide facilities similar to their civilian counterparts. For example, [[RAF Brize Norton]] in the UK has a terminal which caters to passengers for the [[Royal Air Force]]'s scheduled flights to the [[Falkland Islands]]. Some airbases are co-located with civilian airports, sharing the same ATC facilities, runways, taxiways and emergency services, but with separate terminals, parking areas and hangars. [[Bardufoss Airport]], [[Bardufoss Air Station]] in Norway and [[Pune Airport]] in India are examples of this.

An [[aircraft carrier]] is a warship that functions as a mobile airbase. Aircraft carriers allow a [[Navy|naval force]] to project [[Aerial warfare|air power]] without having to depend on local bases for land-based aircraft. After their development in World War I, aircraft carriers replaced the battleship as the centrepiece of a modern fleet during World War II.

== Airport designation and naming ==
{{Further|List of airports}}

Airports are uniquely represented by their [[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA airport code]] and [[International Civil Aviation Organization airport code|ICAO airport code]].

Most airport names include the location. Many airport names honour a public figure, commonly a politician (e.g., [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]], [[George Bush Intercontinental Airport]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]), a monarch (e.g. [[Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport]], [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]]), a cultural leader (e.g. [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]], [[Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino Airport]], [[Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport]]) or a prominent figure in aviation history of the region (e.g. [[Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport]]), sometimes even famous writers (e.g. [[Allama Iqbal International Airport]]) and explorers (e.g. [[Venice Marco Polo Airport]]).

Some airports have unofficial names, possibly so widely circulated that its official name is little used or even known.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Some airport names include the word \"International\" to indicate their ability to handle [[International airport|international air traffic]]. This includes some airports that do not have scheduled international airline services (e.g. [[Albany International Airport]]).

== History and development ==
[[File:Kharkov Airport Sokolniki.jpg|thumb|The Kharkiv Airport in Sokolniki, [[Ukraine]] (1924).]]
The earliest aircraft takeoff and landing sites were grassy fields.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1JcWmb9Ik8C&pg=PA154|title=Soft Landing: Airline Industry Strategy, Service, and Safety|last=Thomas|first=Andrew R.|date=2011|publisher=Apress|isbn=978-1-4302-3677-1|page=154}}</ref> The plane could approach at any angle that provided a favorable wind direction. A slight improvement was the dirt-only field, which eliminated the drag from grass. However, these functioned well only in dry conditions. Later, concrete surfaces would allow landings regardless of meteorological conditions.

The title of \"world's oldest airport\" is disputed. [[College Park Airport]] in Maryland, US, established in 1909 by [[Wright brothers|Wilbur Wright]], is generally agreed to be the world's oldest continuously operating airfield,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgparks.com/places/historic/cpairport.html |title=College Park Airport |publisher=Pgparks.com |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531180243/http://pgparks.com/places/historic/cpairport.html |archivedate=May 31, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> although it serves only [[general aviation]] traffic. 

[[Beijing Nanyuan Airport]] in China, which was built to accommodate planes in 1904, and airships in 1907, opened in 1910.<ref>http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2019/09/25/629668.html</ref> It was in operation until September 2019. [[Pearson Field Airport]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]], United States, was built to accommodate planes in 1905 and airships in 1911, and is still in use as of January 2020.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

[[Hamburg Airport]] opened in January 1911, making it the oldest commercial airport in the world which is still in operation. [[Bremen Airport]] opened in 1913 and remains in use, although it served as an American military field between 1945 and 1949. [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] opened on September 16, 1916, as a military airfield, but has accepted [[Civil aviation|civil aircraft]] only since December 17, 1920, allowing [[Sydney Airport]]—which started operations in January 1920—to claim to be one of the world's oldest continuously operating commercial airports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |title=Sydney Airport history |format=PDF |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401043447/http://www.sydneyairport.com.au/NR/rdonlyres/353DC91E-A259-449B-8B68-C8E88CB58691/0/FactSheetHistory1.pdf |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}</ref> [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport]] in the US opened in 1920 and has been in continuous commercial service since. It serves about 35,000,000 passengers each year and continues to expand, recently opening a new 11,000-foot (3,355 m) runway. Of the airports constructed during this early period in aviation, it is one of the largest and busiest that is still currently operating. [[Rome Ciampino Airport]], opened 1916, is also a contender, as well as the [[Don Mueang International Airport]] near Bangkok, Thailand, which opened in 1914.
Increased aircraft traffic during World War I led to the construction of landing fields. Aircraft had to approach these from certain directions and this led to the development of aids for directing the approach and landing slope.
[[File:New Orleans postcard Moissant Airport 1960s.jpg|thumb|left|The [[New Orleans International Airport]] passenger terminal building in [[New Orleans]] (1960s).]]
Following the war, some of these military airfields added civil facilities for handling passenger traffic. One of the earliest such fields was [[Paris – Le Bourget Airport]] at [[Le Bourget]], near Paris. The first airport to operate scheduled international commercial services was [[Hounslow Heath Aerodrome]] in August 1919, but it was closed and supplanted by [[Croydon Airport]] in March 1920.<ref>Bluffield (2009)</ref> In 1922, the first permanent airport and commercial terminal solely for commercial aviation was opened at [[Kaliningrad Devau Airport|Flughafen Devau]] near what was then [[Königsberg]], East Prussia. The airports of this era used a paved \"apron\", which permitted night flying as well as landing heavier aircraft.

The first lighting used on an airport was during the latter part of the 1920s; in the 1930s [[Approach lighting system|approach lighting]] came into use. These indicated the proper direction and angle of descent. The colours and flash intervals of these lights became standardized under the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). In the 1940s, the slope-line approach system was introduced. This consisted of two rows of lights that formed a funnel indicating an aircraft's position on the [[Instrument landing system|glideslope]]. Additional lights indicated incorrect altitude and direction.
[[File:Bosasairp.jpg|thumb|The [[Bender Qassim International Airport]] in [[Bosaso]], Somalia (2007).]]
After [[World War II]], airport design became more sophisticated. Passenger buildings were being grouped together in an island, with runways arranged in groups about the terminal. This arrangement permitted expansion of the facilities. But it also meant that passengers had to travel further to reach their plane.

An improvement in the landing field was the introduction of grooves in the concrete surface. These run perpendicular to the direction of the landing aircraft and serve to draw off excess rainwater that could build up in front of the plane's wheels.

Airport construction boomed during the 1960s with the increase in [[jet aircraft]] traffic. Runways were extended out to {{convert|3000|m|abbr=on}}. The fields were constructed out of [[reinforced concrete]] using a slip-form machine that produces a continuous slab with no disruptions along the length. The early 1960s also saw the introduction of jet bridge systems to modern airport terminals, an innovation which eliminated outdoor passenger boarding. These systems became commonplace in the United States by the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}

The malicious use of UAVs has led to the deployment of [[Anti-aircraft warfare#Anti-UAV defences|counter unmanned air system]] (C-UAS) technologies such as the Aaronia [[AARTOS]] which have been installed on major international airports<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/uv-online/heathrows-picks-new-c-uas-combat-drone-disruption/ |title=Heathrow picks C-UAS to combat drone disruption |accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.unmannedairspace.info/counter-uas-systems-and-policies/muscat-international-airport-install-usd10-million-aaronia-counter-uas-system/ |title=Muscat International Airport to install USD10&nbsp;million Aaronia counter-UAS system |accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref>.

== Airports in entertainment ==
[[File:Washington Dulles International Airport at Dusk.jpg|thumb|[[Washington Dulles International Airport]], ostensibly the setting for ''[[Die Hard 2]]''; the movie was actually filmed at [[Los Angeles International Airport]]]]
Airports have played major roles in films and television programs due to their very nature as a transport and international hub, and sometimes because of distinctive architectural features of particular airports. One such example of this is ''[[The Terminal]]'', a film about a man who becomes permanently grounded in an airport terminal and must survive only on the food and shelter provided by the airport. They are also one of the major elements in movies such as ''[[The V.I.P.s (film)|The V.I.P.s]]'', ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'', ''[[Airplane!]]'', ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), ''[[Die Hard 2]]'', ''[[Soul Plane]]'', ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'', ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', ''[[Liar Liar]]'', ''[[Passenger 57]]'', ''[[Final Destination (film)|Final Destination]]'' (2000), ''[[Unaccompanied Minors]]'', ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', ''[[Rendition (film)|Rendition]]'' and ''[[The Langoliers (TV miniseries)|The Langoliers]]''. They have also played important parts in television series like ''[[Lost (2004 TV series)|Lost]]'', ''[[The Amazing Race]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model, Cycle 10]]'' which have significant parts of their story set within airports. In other programmes and films, airports are merely indicative of journeys, e.g. ''[[Good Will Hunting]]''.

Several computer simulation games put the player in charge of an airport. These include the [[Airport Tycoon]] series, SimAirport and Airport CEO.

'''Assassination''' is the murder of a prominent person, usually for political, religious, or monetary reasons.<ref>Black's Law Dictionary \"the act of deliberately killing someone especially a public figure, usually for hire or for political reasons\" (''Legal Research, Analysis and Writing'' by William H. Putman [https://books.google.com/books?id=M0nlVU6M26AC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 215] and [http://hir.harvard.edu/leadership/on-the-offensive Assassination Policy Under International Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206230433/http://hir.harvard.edu/leadership/on-the-offensive |date=December 6, 2010 }}, Harvard International Review, May 6, 2006 by Kristen Eichensehr).</ref>

An assassination may be prompted by religious, political or military [[Motive (law)|motives]]. It is an act that may be done for [[contract killing|financial gain]], to [[revenge|avenge]] a [[grievance]], from a desire to acquire [[celebrity|fame]] or [[infamy|notoriety]], or because of a military, security, insurgent or [[secret police]] group's command to carry out the [[homicide]]. Acts of assassination have been performed since [[Ancient history|ancient times]].

The word ''assassin'' is often believed to derive from the word ''[[hashshashin]]'' (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also hashishin, hashashiyyin, or assassins),<ref>''American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77–83</ref>  and shares its etymological roots with ''[[hashish]]'' ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|ˈ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|حشيش}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥashīsh}}'').<ref name=\"The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam\">''The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam'' – Bernard Lewis, pp. 11–12</ref> It referred to a group of [[Nizari|Nizari Ismailis]] known as [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] who worked against various political targets.

Founded by [[Hassan-i Sabbah]], the Assassins were active in the fortress of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] in Persia from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and later expanded by capturing forts in Syria. The group killed members of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]], and Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] elite for political and religious reasons.<ref>Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Altair Cassell Illustrated, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-84403-416-1}}</ref>

Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of [[hashish]] during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate as to whether these claims have merit, with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name.<ref name=\"C:AH\">{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cannabis:+A+History#v=onepage&q=hashishiyya&f=false | author= Martin Booth | title= Cannabis: A History |year= 2004 | publisher= Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-42494-7}}</ref>

Assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]].  It dates back at least as far as recorded history.

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].  Strangling in the bathtub was the most commonly used method. With the [[Renaissance]], [[tyrannicide]]—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe. High medieval sources mention the assassination of King [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] (1089), dying at the hands of his own people, who objected to a proposition by the pope to go on a campaign to aid the [[Byzantine]]s against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks. This account is, however, contentious among historians, it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the \"Curse of King Zvonimir\" is based on the legend of his assassination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.hr/pov/pov2/files/3zavod/radovi38/nemet38.pdf |title=FFZG.hr |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref> In 1192, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the ''[[de facto]]'' [[King of Jerusalem]], was killed by an [[Order of Assassins|assassin]].

The reigns of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland (1296), [[William the Silent]] of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1589) and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1610) were all ended by assassins.

===Modern history===
In the modern world, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the [[propaganda of the deed]]. In [[Russian Empire|Russia]] alone, two emperors, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and his grandson [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], were assassinated within 80 years.

===As a military and foreign policy doctrine===
{{See also|Manhunt (military)}}
[[File:Hokusai-sketches---hokusai-manga-vol6-crop.jpg|thumb|The functions of the [[ninja]] included [[espionage]], [[sabotage]] and assassination.]]

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused – [[Sun Tzu]], writing around 500&nbsp;BC, argued in favor of using assassination in his book ''[[The Art of War]]''. Nearly 2000 years later, in his book ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also advises rulers to assassinate enemies whenever possible so they won't pose a threat.<ref>Machiavelli, Niccolò (1985), The Prince, University of Chicago Press. Translated by Harvey Mansfield</ref> An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.

For similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of [[foreign policy]].  The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute, especially when they depend upon the policies of a successor, and one study has found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in this area, such that decisions made to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.<ref name=\"iraja\">{{cite journal | title=Decision Making in Using Assassinations in International Relations | url=http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19545 | journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] | volume=131| issue=3 | date=Fall 2016 | pages= 503–539 | last=Schilling | first=Warner R. | authorlink=Warner R. Schilling | last2= Schilling | first2=Jonathan L. |doi = 10.1002/polq.12487}}</ref>

In both military and foreign policy assassinations, there is the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader, or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will \"[[Martyr (politics)|martyr]]\" a leader and lead to greater support of his or her cause (by showing the ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a tool:

* The [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]] in Prague on May 27, 1942 by the British and Czechoslovak government-in-exile.  This case illustrates the difficulty of comparing the benefits of a foreign policy goal (strengthening the legitimacy and influence of the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] in London) against the possible costs resulting from an assassination (the [[Lidice massacre]]).<ref name=\"iraja\"/>
* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.
* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as \"The Desert Fox\").<ref name=\"Skor\">''Commando Extraordinary'' – Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155</ref>

Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:
* During the [[Vietnam War]], partly in response to [[Viet Cong]] assassinations of government leaders, the U.S. engaged in the [[Phoenix Program]] in order to assassinate Viet Cong leaders and sympathizers, and it killed between 6,000 and 41,000 people, with official 'targets' of 1,800 per month. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}
* With the [[2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike|Baghdad International Airport airstrike]] the US assassinated the commander of Iran's [[Quds Force]] General [[Qasem Soleimani]] and the commander of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]] along with 8 other high-ranking military personnel. The assassination of these military leaders was part of [[2019–20 Persian Gulf crisis|escalating tensions between the US and Iran]] and the [[American-led intervention in Iraq (2014–present)|American-led intervention in Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Qassem Suleimani: 'Death to America' chants at Baghdad funeral procession | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/huge-crowds-expected-in-baghdad-for-funeral-of-iranian-general-killed-by-us | first=Ghait|last=Abdul-Ahat|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date= January 4, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Iran Says It Has Decided How to React to U.S. Strike That Killed Soleimani | url=https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/four-rockets-hit-military-base-near-baghdad-airport-report-says-1.8350357 | first=Amos|last=Harel|newspaper=[[Haaretz]]|date= January 4, 2020}}</ref>

===As a tool of insurgents===
Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.

The [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919–21 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit – [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] – for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969–1998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|Unionist]] politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing the Conservative Party Conference]] in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the President of the Government of Spain [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.

The [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' – Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970</ref>

==Psychology==
A major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.<ref name=\"SS\"/>

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.<ref name=\"SS\"/>

==Techniques==

===Modern methods===

With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival since they could quickly flee the scene.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,<ref>''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' – [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004</ref> as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

A [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain pragmatic difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.<ref name=\"Austria\">''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' – [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007</ref>

Despite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<ref name=\"SS\"/>

In the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella].

==Targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]; sometimes used in targeted killings]]
Targeted killing is the intentional killing–by a government or its agents–of a civilian or \"[[unlawful combatant]]\" who is not in the government's custody.  The target is a person asserted to be taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]].<ref name=\"google1\"/> Note that this is a different term and concept from that of \"targeted violence\" as used by specialists who study violence.

On the other hand, [[Georgetown University Law Center|Georgetown Law]] Professor [[Gary D. Solis|Gary Solis]], in his 2010 book entitled ''The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War'',<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=6FKf0ocxEPAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Law+of+Armed+Conflict:+International+Humanitarian+Law+in+War#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The law of armed conflict&nbsp;... – Gary D.

Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], former federal judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], wrote on the subject:

<blockquote>When people call a targeted killing an \"assassination,\" they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States&nbsp;... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests&nbsp;... But killings in self-defense are no more \"assassinations\" in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.<ref name=\"sfgate2004\"/></blockquote>

Author and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued that \"there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing&nbsp;... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination.  Assassination&nbsp;... constitutes an illegal killing.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QP1Bq7HVQtwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Impact+of+9/11+and+the+New+Legal+Landscape:+The+Day+That+Changed+Everything#v=onepage&q=major%20difference%20between%20assassination%20and%20targeted%20killing&f=false|author=Matthew J.

On the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states on its website, \"A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Targeting Killing &#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref>
Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article \"By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'\"<ref name=\"Stein\">{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Yael |title=By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to \"Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing\" |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120314201721/http%3A//www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860%2Ehtml |website=Carnegie Council |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=2003}}</ref>
<blockquote>\"The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether\".</blockquote>

==Counter-measures==

===Early forms===
[[File:Sattar Bodyguard.JPG|thumb|left|upright=.5|This bodyguard was killed by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]] during [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha#Death|Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha's assassination]] in 2007]]
One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing [[bodyguard]]s. Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,<ref name=\"SS\">''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620171200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf |date=June 20, 2006 }}'' – Fein, Robert A. & Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999</ref><ref>[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.

Notable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]—though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).

Another notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.

===Modern strategies===
[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].<ref>''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103071805/http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php |date=January 3, 2007 }}'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)</ref> [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  – so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;<ref name=\"Report\">[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]].

[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[Popemobile]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil]]
The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[MRAP]]-like [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.<ref name=\"Report\"/>

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then [[makeup|made up]], and in some cases [[plastic surgery|altered]] to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high risk situations.  According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, [[Fidel Castro]] used body doubles.<ref name=\"FOX\">{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |title=It's Bin Laden&nbsp;... or Is It? |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=December 20, 2001 |first=Catherine |last=Donaldson-Evans |access-date=December 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805130250/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,41210,00.html |archive-date=August 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

An assassination may be prompted by religious, political or military [[Motive (law)|motives]]. It is an act that may be done for [[contract killing|financial gain]], to [[revenge|avenge]] a [[grievance]], from a desire to acquire [[celebrity|fame]] or [[infamy|notoriety]], or because of a military, security, insurgent or [[secret police]] group's command to carry out the [[homicide]]. Acts of assassination have been performed since [[Ancient history|ancient times]].

[[File:Assassination of Nizam al-Mulk.jpg|thumb|260px|left|14th-century painting of the successful assassination of [[Nizam al-Mulk]], the ''de facto'' ruler of the [[Seljuq Empire]], by an Assassin.]]
The word ''assassin'' is often believed to derive from the word ''[[hashshashin]]'' (Arabic: حشّاشين, ħashshāshīyīn, also hashishin, hashashiyyin, or assassins),<ref>''American Speech'' – McCarthy, Kevin M. Volume 48, pp. 77–83</ref>  and shares its etymological roots with ''[[hashish]]'' ({{IPAc-en|h|æ|ˈ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ʃ|iː|ʃ}}; from [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|حشيش}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ḥashīsh}}'').<ref name=\"The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam\">''The Assassins: a radical sect in Islam'' – Bernard Lewis, pp. 11–12</ref> It referred to a group of [[Nizari|Nizari Ismailis]] known as [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] who worked against various political targets.

Founded by [[Hassan-i Sabbah]], the Assassins were active in the fortress of [[Alamut Castle|Alamut]] in Persia from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and later expanded by capturing forts in Syria. The group killed members of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]], [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]], and Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] elite for political and religious reasons.<ref>Secret Societies Handbook, Michael Bradley, Altair Cassell Illustrated, 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-84403-416-1}}</ref>

Although it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of [[hashish]] during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate as to whether these claims have merit, with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name.<ref name=\"C:AH\">{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O7AoY6ljSygC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Cannabis:+A+History#v=onepage&q=hashishiyya&f=false | author= Martin Booth | title= Cannabis: A History |year= 2004 | publisher= Macmillan| isbn = 978-0-312-42494-7}}</ref>

The earliest known use of the verb \"to assassinate\" in printed English was by [[Matthew Sutcliffe]] in ''A Briefe Replie to a Certaine Odious and Slanderous Libel, Lately Published by a Seditious Jesuite'', a pamphlet printed in 1600, five years before it was used in ''[[Macbeth]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] (1605).<ref>''A briefe replie to a certaine odious and slanderous libel, lately published by a seditious Iesuite.''

Assassination is one of the oldest tools of [[power politics]].  It dates back at least as far as recorded history.

In the [[Old Testament]], King [[Jehoash of Judah|Joash]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] was assassinated by his own servants;<ref>2 Kings 12:19-21</ref> [[Joab]] assassinated [[Absalom]], [[King David]]'s son;<ref>2 Samuel 3:26-28 RSV</ref> and King [[Sennacherib]] of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons.<ref>2 Chronicles 32:21</ref>

[[Chanakya]] (c. 350–283 BC) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise ''[[Arthashastra]]''. His student [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of the [[Maurya Empire]], later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies, including two of [[Alexander the Great]]'s generals, [[Nicanor (satrap)|Nicanor]] and [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip.]]<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink = Roger Boesche | first = Roger | last = Boesche |date=January 2003 | title = Kautilya's ''Arthaśāstra'' on War and Diplomacy in Ancient India | journal = The Journal of Military History | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–37 | doi = 10.1353/jmh.2003.0006 | url=http://muse.jhu.edu/demo/journal_of_military_history/v067/67.1boesche.pdf}}</ref> Other famous victims are [[Philip II of Macedon]] (336&nbsp;BC), the father of Alexander the Great, and Roman dictator [[Julius Caesar]] (44&nbsp;BC).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kloWAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=famous+assassinations#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Famous assassinations of history&nbsp;... |date=March 3, 2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2010|last1=Johnson|first1=Francis}}</ref> [[Emperors of Rome]] often met their end in this way, as did many of the Muslim [[Shia Imam]]s hundreds of years later. The practice was also well known in ancient China, as in [[Jing Ke]]'s failed assassination of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] king [[Qin Shi Huang|Ying Zheng]] in 227&nbsp;BC. Whilst many assassinations were performed by individuals or small groups, there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination. The earliest were the [[sicarii]] in 6 AD, who predated the Middle Eastern [[Order of Assassins|assassins]] and Japanese [[shinobi]]s by centuries.<ref>Pichtel, John, ''Terrorism and WMDs: Awareness and Response'', CRC Press (April 25, 2011) p.3-4. {{ISBN|978-1439851753}}</ref><ref name=\"Ross\">Ross, Jeffrey Ian, ''Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present'', Routledge (January 15, 2011), Chapter: Sicarii. 978-0765620484</ref>

In the [[Middle Ages]], [[regicide]] was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].  Strangling in the bathtub was the most commonly used method. With the [[Renaissance]], [[tyrannicide]]—or assassination for personal or political reasons—became more common again in Western Europe. High medieval sources mention the assassination of King [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] (1089), dying at the hands of his own people, who objected to a proposition by the pope to go on a campaign to aid the [[Byzantine]]s against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Turks. This account is, however, contentious among historians, it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the \"Curse of King Zvonimir\" is based on the legend of his assassination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ffzg.hr/pov/pov2/files/3zavod/radovi38/nemet38.pdf |title=FFZG.hr |accessdate=December 29, 2013}}</ref> In 1192, [[Conrad of Montferrat]], the ''[[de facto]]'' [[King of Jerusalem]], was killed by an [[Order of Assassins|assassin]].

The reigns of King [[Przemysł II]] of Poland (1296), [[William the Silent]] of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1589) and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1610) were all ended by assassins.

===Modern history===
In the modern world, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the [[propaganda of the deed]]. In [[Russian Empire|Russia]] alone, two emperors, [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] and his grandson [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], were assassinated within 80 years.

[[File:Hokusai-sketches---hokusai-manga-vol6-crop.jpg|thumb|The functions of the [[ninja]] included [[espionage]], [[sabotage]] and assassination.]]

Assassination for military purposes has long been espoused – [[Sun Tzu]], writing around 500&nbsp;BC, argued in favor of using assassination in his book ''[[The Art of War]]''. Nearly 2000 years later, in his book ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccolò Machiavelli|Machiavelli]] also advises rulers to assassinate enemies whenever possible so they won't pose a threat.<ref>Machiavelli, Niccolò (1985), The Prince, University of Chicago Press. Translated by Harvey Mansfield</ref> An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a [[cult of personality|particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader]], whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.

For similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of [[foreign policy]].  The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute, especially when they depend upon the policies of a successor, and one study has found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in this area, such that decisions made to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.<ref name=\"iraja\">{{cite journal | title=Decision Making in Using Assassinations in International Relations | url=http://www.psqonline.org/article.cfm?IDArticle=19545 | journal=[[Political Science Quarterly]] | volume=131| issue=3 | date=Fall 2016 | pages= 503–539 | last=Schilling | first=Warner R. | authorlink=Warner R.

In both military and foreign policy assassinations, there is the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader, or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will \"[[Martyr (politics)|martyr]]\" a leader and lead to greater support of his or her cause (by showing the ruthlessness of the assassins). Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, this possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian [[Alcibiades]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. A number of additional examples from [[World War II]] show how assassination was used as a tool:

* The [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Reinhard Heydrich]] in Prague on May 27, 1942 by the British and Czechoslovak government-in-exile.  This case illustrates the difficulty of comparing the benefits of a foreign policy goal (strengthening the legitimacy and influence of the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] in London) against the possible costs resulting from an assassination (the [[Lidice massacre]]).<ref name=\"iraja\"/>
* The American interception of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]]'s plane during World War II, after his travel route had been decrypted.
* [[Operation Gaff]] was a planned British commando raid to capture or kill the German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (also known as \"The Desert Fox\").<ref name=\"Skor\">''Commando Extraordinary'' – Foley, Charles; Legion for the Survival of Freedom, 1992, page 155</ref>

Use of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:

===As a tool of insurgents===
Insurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups, namely the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.

The [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] guerrillas of 1919–21 killed many [[Royal Irish Constabulary|RIC]] Police Intelligence officers during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]] set up a special unit – [[The Squad (IRA unit)|the Squad]] – for this purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in [[Dublin]] on [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1920.

This tactic was used again by the [[Provisional IRA]] during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland (1969–1998). Killing of [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers and assassination of [[Unionism in the United Kingdom|Unionist]] politicians was one of a number of methods used in the [[Provisional IRA campaign 1969–1997]]. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] by [[Brighton hotel bombing|bombing the Conservative Party Conference]] in a [[Brighton]] hotel. [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalist paramilitaries]] retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating [[Irish nationalist]] politicians.

[[Basque people|Basque]] terrorists [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] in Spain have assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the President of the Government of Spain [[Luis Carrero Blanco]], 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. Since the early 1990s, they have also targeted academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with them.

The [[Red Brigades]] in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures, as to a lesser extent, did the [[Red Army Faction]] in Germany in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the [[Vietnam War]], Communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] regime to collapse before the U.S. intervention.<ref>''Viet Cong'' – Pike, Douglas, The MIT Press; New Ed edition, Wednesday December 16, 1970</ref>

==Psychology==
A major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely a case of 'impulsive' action.<ref name=\"SS\"/>

However, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be [[delusion]]al, a figure that rose to 60% with 'near-lethal approachers' (people apprehended before reaching their target). This shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-age assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempt. The report also found that around two-thirds of attackers had previously been arrested (not necessarily for related offenses), that 44% had a history of serious depression, and that 39% had a history of substance abuse.<ref name=\"SS\"/>

==Techniques==

===Modern methods===

With the advent of effective [[ranged weaponry]], and later [[firearm]]s, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. [[Bodyguard]]s were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to directly engage or even subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distance dramatically increased the chances of an assassin's survival since they could quickly flee the scene.  The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were the [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Regent Moray of Scotland]] in 1570, and [[William the Silent]], the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands in 1584. [[Gunpowder]] and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.

Explosives, especially the [[car bomb]], become far more common in modern history, with [[grenade]]s and remote-triggered [[land mine]]s also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]]'s life was with a grenade). With heavy weapons, the [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), while Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles,<ref>''[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/04/17/mideast.violence/index.html Hamas leader killed in Israeli airstrike]'' – [[CNN]], Saturday April 17, 2004</ref> as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.

[[File:Oswaldrifle.jpg|thumb|Rifle of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of President [[John F. Kennedy]]]]
[[File:Booth deringer.jpg|thumb|[[Derringer]] of [[John Wilkes Booth]], the assassin of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]
A [[sniper]] with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain pragmatic difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line-of-sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated [[sniper rifle]] is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and hand-finishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.<ref name=\"Austria\">''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1542559/Iraqi-insurgents-using-Austrian-rifles-from-Iran.html Iraqi insurgents using Austrian rifles from Iran]'' – [[The Daily Telegraph]], Tuesday February 13, 2007</ref>

Despite their comparative disadvantages, [[handgun]]s are more easily concealable, and consequentially much more commonly used than rifles. Of 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the U.S. in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (usage of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).<ref name=\"SS\"/>

In the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. [[Georgi Markov]], a [[Bulgaria]]n dissident was assassinated by [[ricin]] poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed [[Bulgarian umbrella|umbrella]]. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and [[KGB]] have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the USSR, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected said the agency assisted in the murder.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/history/story/2007/01/070117_markov.shtml The case of the poisoned umbrella]. [[BBC]] World Service, 2007.</ref> The [[CIA]] made several [[Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro|attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro]], many of the schemes involving poisoning his cigars. In the late 1950s, KGB assassin [[Bohdan Stashynsky]] killed Ukrainian nationalist leaders [[Lev Rebet]] and [[Stepan Bandera]] with a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed [[cyanide]] ampule, making their deaths look like heart attacks.<ref>Christopher Andrew and [[Vasili Mitrokhin]].

==Targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
[[File:MQ-1 Predator unmanned aircraft.jpg|thumb|[[MQ-1 Predator|Predator]] [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]]; sometimes used in targeted killings]]
Targeted killing is the intentional killing–by a government or its agents–of a civilian or \"[[unlawful combatant]]\" who is not in the government's custody.  The target is a person asserted to be taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, whether by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the [[Third Geneva Convention]].<ref name=\"google1\"/> Note that this is a different term and concept from that of \"targeted violence\" as used by specialists who study violence.

Sofaer|Abraham Sofaer]], former federal judge for the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]], wrote on the subject:

<blockquote>When people call a targeted killing an \"assassination,\" they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States&nbsp;... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests&nbsp;... But killings in self-defense are no more \"assassinations\" in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.<ref name=\"sfgate2004\"/></blockquote>

Author and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan has argued that \"there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing&nbsp;... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination.  Assassination&nbsp;... constitutes an illegal killing.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QP1Bq7HVQtwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Impact+of+9/11+and+the+New+Legal+Landscape:+The+Day+That+Changed+Everything#v=onepage&q=major%20difference%20between%20assassination%20and%20targeted%20killing&f=false|author=Matthew J.

On the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states on its website, \"A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/national-security/frequently-asked-questions-about-targeting-killing |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Targeting Killing &#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref>
Yael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also states in her article \"By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'\"<ref name=\"Stein\">{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Yael |title=By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to \"Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing\" |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120314201721/http%3A//www.carnegiecouncil.org/resources/journal/17_1/debate/860%2Ehtml |website=Carnegie Council |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=2003}}</ref>
<blockquote>\"The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether\".</blockquote>

==Counter-measures==

===Early forms===
[[File:Sattar Bodyguard.JPG|thumb|left|upright=.5|This bodyguard was killed by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]] during [[Abdul Sattar Abu Risha#Death|Sheik Abdul Sattar Abu Risha's assassination]] in 2007]]
One of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing [[bodyguard]]s. Bodyguards act as a shield for the potential target, keeping lookout for potential attackers (sometimes in advance, for example on a parade route), and putting themselves in harm's way—both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target,<ref name=\"SS\">''[http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf Assassination in the United States: An Operational Study] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620171200/http://www.secretservice.gov/ntac/ntac_jfs.pdf |date=June 20, 2006 }}'' – Fein, Robert A. & Vossekuil, Brian, ''[[Journal of Forensic Sciences]]'', Volume 44, Number 2, March 1999</ref><ref>[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html Lincoln] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> and by shielding the target during any attack. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.

Notable examples of bodyguards include the Roman [[Praetorian Guard]] or the Ottoman [[Janissary|Janissaries]]—though, in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the [[head of state]] a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders they were supposed to protect. The fidelity of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties led to the assassination of [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Indira Gandhi]], assassinated by two [[Sikh]] bodyguards in 1984.

This bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, leading assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as [[poison]] (which risk was answered by having [[food taster|another person taste the leader's food]] first).

Another notable measure is the use of a [[political decoy|body double]], a person who looks like the leader and who pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.

===Modern strategies===
[[File:Reagan assassination attempt 4 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Assassination attempt on President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]
With the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination (via bombs or firearms) became possible. One of the first reactions was to simply increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader; another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present, to the point where entire sections of a city might be shut down.

As the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, [[Armored car (VIP)|armored cars or limousines]] were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to [[small arms]] fire, smaller bombs and [[Land mine|mines]].<ref>''[http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php How to choose the appropriate bulletproof cars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103071805/http://www.alpha-armouring.com/bulletproof/cars.php |date=January 3, 2007 }}'' (from Alpha-armouring.com website, includes examples of protection levels available)</ref> [[Bulletproof vest]]s also began to be used, which were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected  – so they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.

Access to famous persons, too, became more and more restricted;<ref name=\"Report\">[https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/appendix7.html The Need For Protection Further Demonstrated] – Appendix 7, Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, 1964</ref> potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially given the common use of [[metal detector|metal]] and [[Bomb disposal|bomb detectors]].

Most modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] and former [[Pakistan]]i Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], or as part of [[Coup d'état|coups d'état]] where security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]].

[[File:Popemobil Mai 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Pope Benedict XVI]] in a modified [[Mercedes-Benz M-Class]] [[Popemobile]] in [[São Paulo]], Brazil]]
The methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear [[bulletproof glass]], such as the [[MRAP]]-like [[Popemobile]] of [[Pope John Paul II]], built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent this need for separation, sometimes sending their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons; U.S. President [[William McKinley]] did this at the public reception where he was assassinated.<ref name=\"Report\"/>

Other potential targets go into seclusion, and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer [[Salman Rushdie]]. A related form of protection is the use of [[political decoy|body doubles]], people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate.

===Jewish biblical tradition===
Jewish tradition holds that Tiberias was built on the site of the ancient Israelite village of ''[[Rakkath]]'' or ''Rakkat'', first mentioned in the [[Book of Joshua]].<ref name=\"JewishEnc2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=205&letter=T|title=TIBERIAS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|Joshua|19:35}}</ref> In [[Talmud]]ic times, the Jews still referred to it by this name.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Megillah 5b</ref>

===Herodian period===
Tiberias was founded sometime around 20 CE in the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|Herodian Tetrarchy]] of Galilee and [[Peraea]] by the Roman [[Client state|client king]] [[Herod Antipas]], son of [[Herod the Great]]. Herod Antipas made it the capital of his realm in the Galilee and named it for the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius]].<ref name=\"JewishEnc2\" /> The city was built in immediate proximity to a spa which had developed around 17 natural mineral hot springs, Hammat Tiberias. Tiberias was at first a strictly pagan city, but later became populated mainly by Jews, with its growing spiritual and religious status exerting a strong influence on [[Balneotherapy|balneological]] practices.<ref name=\"Erfurt-CooperCooper20092\" />{{dubious|... and highly so. Judaism and balneotherapy do not mix.|date=August 2016}} Conversely, in ''[[The Antiquities of the Jews]]'', the Roman-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] calls the village with hot springs [[Emmaus (disambiguation)|Emmaus]], today's Hammat Tiberias, located near Tiberias.<ref name=\"JAoJ2\" /> This name also appears in his work ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''.<ref>Josephus, Flavius, The Jewish Wars, translated by William Whiston, Book 4, chapter 1, paragraph 3</ref>

In the days of Herod Antipas, some of the most religiously orthodox [[Jews]], who were struggling against the process of [[Hellenization]], which had affected even some [[Kohen|priestly groups]], refused to settle there: the presence of a [[cemetery]] rendered the site ritually unclean for the Jews and particularly for the priestly [[caste]]. Antipas settled many non-Jews there from rural Galilee and other parts of his domains in order to populate his new capital, and built a palace on the [[acropolis]].<ref name=\"MDotB2\" />{{dubious|Acropolis usually implies a height, which is not the case for Tib.|date=August 2016}} The prestige of Tiberias was so great that the Sea of Galilee soon came to be named the Sea of Tiberias; however, the Jewish population continued to call it 'Yam Ha-Kineret', its traditional name.<ref name=\"MDotB2\" /> The city was governed by a city council of 600 with a committee of 10 until [[44 CE]] when a [[Procurator (Roman)|Roman procurator]] was set over the city after the death of [[Herod Agrippa I]].<ref name=\"MDotB2\" />

===Roman period===
Tiberias is mentioned in {{bibleverse||John|6:23|NKJV}} as the location from which boats had sailed to the opposite, eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. The crowd seeking [[Jesus]] after the miraculous [[Feeding the multitude|feeding of the 5000]] used these boats to travel back to [[Capernaum]] on the north-western part of the lake.

Under the [[Roman Empire]], the city was known by its [[Greek language|Greek]] name '''Τιβεριάς''' (''Tiberiás'', [[Modern Greek]] Τιβεριάδα ''Tiveriáda''), {{cn span|date=April 2020|an adaptation of the [[Taw (letter)|taw]]-suffixed [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] form that preserved its [[Grammatical gender|feminine grammatical gender]].}} In [[AD 61|61 CE]] [[Herod Agrippa II]] annexed the city to his kingdom whose capital was [[Banias|Caesarea Philippi]].<ref name=\"DW IH2\">Winter, Dave (1999) ''Israel Handbook: With the Palestinian Authority Areas'' Footprint Travel Guides, {{ISBN|1-900949-48-2}}, pp 660–661</ref>

During the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the seditious took control of the city and destroyed Herod's palace, and were able to prevent the city from being pillaged by the army of [[Agrippa II]], the Jewish ruler who had remained loyal to Rome.<ref name=\"MDotB2\" /><ref>Crossan, John Dominic (1999) Birth of Christianity: Discovering What Happened in the Years Immediately After the Execution of Christ. Continuum International Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-567-08668-2}}, p 232</ref> Eventually, the seditious were expelled from Tiberias, and while most other cities in the provinces of Judaea, Galilee and [[Edom|Idumea]] were razed, Tiberias was spared this fate because its inhabitants had decided not to fight against Rome.<ref name=\"MDotB2\" /><ref>Thomson, 1859, vol 2, p. [https://archive.org/stream/landandbookorbi08thomgoog#page/n84/mode/1up 72]</ref> It became a mixed city after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE; with Judea subdued, the surviving southern Jewish population migrated to the Galilee.<ref>Safrai Zeev (1994) ''The Economy of Roman Palestine'' Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-10243-X}}, p 199</ref><ref name=\"ERBRiP2\">Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, p.

There is no direct indication that Tiberias, as well as the rest of Galilee, took part in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132–136 CE, thus allowing it to exist, despite a heavy economic decline due to the war. Following the expulsion of Jews from Judea after 135 CE, Tiberias and its neighbour [[Sepphoris]] (Hebrew name: Tzippori) became the major Jewish cultural centres.

According to the Talmud, in 145 CE, [[Rabbi]] [[Simeon bar Yochai]], who was very familiar with the Galilee, hiding there for over a decade, \"cleansed the city of ritual impurity\",<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> allowing the Jewish leadership to resettle there from the Judea, which they were forced to leave as fugitives. The [[Sanhedrin]], the Jewish court, also fled from Jerusalem during the Great Jewish Revolt against Rome, and after several attempted moves, in search of stability, eventually settled in Tiberias in about 150 CE.<ref name=\"MDotB2\">Mercer Dictionary of the Bible Edited by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard, Mercer University Press, (1998) {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} p 917</ref><ref name=\"ERBRiP2\" /> It was to be its final meeting place before its disbanding in the Early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. When [[Johanan bar Nappaha]] (d. 279) settled in Tiberias, the city became the focus of Jewish religious scholarship in the land. The [[Mishnah]], the collected theological discussions of generations of rabbis in the [[Land of Israel]] – primarily in the academies of Tiberias and [[Caesarea]] – was probably compiled in Tiberias by Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] around 200 CE.{{dubious|Same claim usually made for Bet She'arim and Sepphoris.|date=August 2016}} The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] would follow being compiled by Rabbi Jochanan between 230–270 CE.<ref name=\"ERBRiP2\" /> Tiberias' 13 synagogues served the spiritual needs of a growing Jewish population.<ref name=\"MDotB2\" />

===Byzantine period===
In the 6th century Tiberias was still the seat of Jewish religious learning. In light of this, a [[Letter of Simeon of Beth Arsham|letter]] of Syriac bishop Simeon of [[Beth Arsham]] urged the Christians of Palaestina to seize the leaders of Judaism in Tiberias, to put them to the rack, and to compel them to command the Jewish king, [[Dhu Nuwas]], to desist from persecuting the Christians in [[Najran]].<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia: Tiberias2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=205&letter=T#ixzz0RkgRIUUe|title=TIBERIAS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref>

In 614, Tiberias was the site where, during the final [[Revolt against Heraclius|Jewish revolt]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]], parts of the Jewish population supported the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian]] invaders; the Jewish rebels were financed by [[Benjamin of Tiberias]], a man of immense wealth; according to Christian sources, during the revolt Christians were massacred and churches destroyed. In 628, the Byzantine army returned to Tiberias upon the surrender of Jewish rebels and the end of the Persian occupation after they were defeated in the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|battle of Nineveh]]. A year later, influenced by radical Christian monks, Emperor [[Heraclius]] instigated a wide-scale slaughter of the Jews, which practically emptied Galilee of most its Jewish population, with survivors fleeing to Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Early Muslim period===
Tiberias, or Tabariyyah in Arab transcription, was \"conquered by (the Arab commander) [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana|Shurahbil]] in the year 634/15 [CE/AH] by capitulation; one half of the houses and churches were to belong to the Muslims, the other half to the Christians.\"<ref>Le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/340/mode/1up 340], quoting [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yakut]]</ref> Since 636 CE, Tiberias served as the regional capital, until [[Beit She'an]] took its place, following the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] conquest. The Caliphate allowed 70 Jewish families from Tiberias to form the core of a renewed Jewish presence in Jerusalem and the importance of Tiberias to Jewish life declined.<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> The caliphs of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Dynasty built one of its square-plan palaces on the waterfront to the north of Tiberias, at [[Khirbat al-Minya]]. Tiberias was revitalised in 749, after Bet Shean was destroyed in an earthquake.<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> An imposing mosque, {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=off}} long by {{convert|78|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide, resembling the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque]] of [[Damascus]], was raised at the foot of Mount Berenice next to a Byzantine church, to the south of the city, as the eighth century ushered in Tiberias's golden age, when the multicultural city may have been the most tolerant of the Middle East.<ref name=\"Hasson2\">Nir Hasson, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/in-excavation-of-ancient-mosque-volunteers-dig-up-israeli-city-s-golden-age.premium-1.458874 'In excavation of ancient mosque, volunteers dig up Israeli city's Golden Age,'] at Haaretz, 17 August 2012.</ref> Jewish scholarship flourished from the beginning of the 8th century to the end of the 10th., when the oral traditions of ancient [[Hebrew]], still in use today, were codified. One of the leading members of the Tiberian masoretic community was [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]], who refined the oral tradition now known as [[Tiberian Hebrew]]. Ben Asher is also credited with putting the finishing touches on the [[Aleppo Codex]], the most accurate existing manuscript of the Hebrew scriptures.

The Arab geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] writing in 985, describes Tiberias as a hedonistic city afflicted by heat:-'For two months they dance; for two months they gobble; for two months they swat; for two months they go about naked; for two months they play the reed flute; and for two months they wallow in the mud.<ref name=\"Hasson2\" /> As \"the capital of Jordan Province, and a city in the Valley of Canaan...The town is narrow, hot in summer and unhealthy...There are here eight natural hot baths, where no fuel need be used, and numberless basins besides of boiling water. The [[mosque]] is large and fine, and stands in the market-place. Its floor is laid in pebbles, set on stone drums, placed close one to another.\" According to Muqaddasi, those who suffered from scab or ulcers, and other such diseases came to Tiberias to bathe in the hot springs for three days. \"Afterwards they dip in another spring which is cold, whereupon...they become cured.\"<ref>Muk. p.161 and 185, quoted in Le Strange, 1890, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/334/mode/1up 334]- [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/337/mode/1up 337]</ref>

In 1033 Tiberias was again destroyed by an earthquake.<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> A further earthquake in 1066 toppled the great mosque.<ref name=\"Hasson2\" /> [[Nasir Khusraw|Nasir-i Khusrou]] visited Tiberias in 1047, and describes a city with a \"strong wall\" which begins at the border of the lake and goes all around the town except on the water-side. Furthermore, he describes
: <blockquote>numberless buildings erected in the very water, for the bed of the lake in this part is rock; and they have built pleasure houses that are supported on columns of [[marble]], rising up out of the water. The lake is very full of fish. [] The Friday Mosque is in the midst of the town. At the gate of the mosque is a spring, over which they have built a hot bath. [] On the western side of the town is a mosque known as the Jasmine Mosque (Masjid-i-Yasmin). It is a fine building and in the middle part rises a great platform (dukkan), where they have their [[mihrab]]s (or prayer-niches). All round those they have set [[jasmine]]-shrubs, from which the mosque derives its name.<ref>Le Strange, 1890, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/336/mode/1up 336]-7</ref></blockquote>

===Crusader period===
[[File:The_Doctor_House_-_The_Scots_Hotel.JPG|thumb|The Scots Hotel in the restored former hospital of Dr. Torrance]]

During the [[First Crusade]] Tiberias was occupied by the [[Franks]] soon after the capture of [[Jerusalem]]. The city was given in fief to [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]], who made it his capital of the [[Principality of Galilee]] in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; the region was sometimes called the Principality of Tiberias, or the Tiberiad.<ref>Richard, Jean (1999) ''The Crusades c. 1071-c 1291'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-62369-3}} p 71</ref> In 1099 the original site of the city was abandoned, and settlement shifted north to the present location.<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> [[St. Peter's Church, Tiberias|St. Peter's Church]], originally built by the Crusaders, is still standing today, although the building has been altered and reconstructed over the years.

In the late 12th century Tiberias' Jewish community numbered 50 Jewish families, headed by rabbis,<ref>\"Journy of [[Benjamin of Tudela]] in Palestine and Syria, {{circa|1170}}\" in Yaari, p.[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36832&st=%D7%98%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94&pgnum=43&hilite= 44]</ref> and at that time the best manuscripts of the [[Torah]] were said to be found there.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia: Tiberias2\" /> In the 12th-century, the city was the subject of negative undertones in Islamic tradition. A ''[[hadith]]'' recorded by Ibn Asakir of Damascus (d. 1176) names Tiberias as one of the \"four cities of hell.\"<ref name=\"LaiouMottahedeh20012\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTAhPw3SjxIC&pg=PA63|title=The Crusades from the perspective of Byzantium and the Muslim world|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|year=2001|isbn=978-0-88402-277-0|page=63|quote=This hadith is also found in the bibliographical work of the Damascene Ibn ‘Asakir (d. 571/1176), although slightly modified: the four cities of paradise are Mecca, Medina, Jerusalem and Damascus; and the four cities of hell are Constantinople, Tabariyya, Antioch and San'a.\"|author1=Angeliki E. Laiou|author2=Roy P.

In 1187, [[Saladin]] ordered his son [[Al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din|al-Afdal]] to send an envoy to Count [[Raymond III of Tripoli|Raymond of Tripoli]] requesting safe passage through his fiefdom of Galilee and Tiberias. Raymond was obliged to grant the request under the terms of his treaty with Saladin. Saladin's force left [[Caesarea Philippi]] to engage the fighting force of the [[Knights Templar]]. The Templar force was destroyed in [[Battle of Cresson|the encounter]]. Saladin then [[Siege|besieged]] Tiberias; after six days the town fell. On July 4, 1187 Saladin defeated the Crusaders coming to relieve Tiberias at the [[Battle of Hattin]], {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} outside the city.<ref>Wilson, John Francis. (2004) Caesarea Philippi: Banias, the Lost City of Pan I.B.Tauris, {{ISBN|1-85043-440-9}} p 148</ref> However, during the [[Third Crusade]], the Crusaders drove the Muslims out of the city and reoccupied it.

Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, ([[Maimonides]]) also known as Rambam, a leading Jewish legal scholar, philosopher and physician of his period, died in 1204 in [[Egypt]] and was later buried in Tiberias. His tomb is one of the city's important pilgrimage sites. [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yakut]], writing in the 1220s, described Tiberias as a small town, long and narrow. He also describes the \"hot salt springs, over which they have built [[Turkish bath|Hammams]] which use no fuel.\"

===Mamluk period===
{{Expand section|date=April 2018}}
In 1265 the [[Crusaders]] were driven from the city by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluks]], who ruled Tiberias until the Ottoman conquest in 1516.<ref name=\"DW IH2\" />

During the 16th century, Tiberias was a small village. Italian Rabbi [[Moses ben Mordecai Bassola|Moses Bassola]] visited Tiberias during his trip to Palestine in 1522. He said on Tiberias that \"...it was a big city... and now it is ruined and desolate\". He described the village there, in which he said there were \"ten or twelve\" Muslim households. The area, according to Bassola, was dangerous \"because of the Arabs\", and in order to stay there, he had to pay the local governor for his protection.<ref>Yaari, pp.[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36832&st=%D7%98%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94&pgnum=154&hilite=155]–156</ref>

As the [[Ottoman Empire]] expanded along the southern Mediterranean coast under Great Sultan [[Selim I]], the ''Reyes Católicos'' ([[Catholic Monarchs]]) began establishing [[Inquisition]] commissions. Many [[Converso|''Conversos'']], ([[Marrano|''Marranos'']] and [[Morisco|''Moriscos'']]) and [[Sephardi Jews]] fled in fear to the Ottoman provinces, settling at first in [[Constantinople]], [[Salonika]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Sofia]] and [[Anatolia]].

===British Mandate===
At the inception of the British Mandate (1922), the city already had a Jewish majority.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Tiberias |title = Tiberias &#124; Israel}}</ref> Initially the relationship between Arabs and Jews in Tiberias was good, with few incidents occurring in the [[1920 Palestine riots|Nebi Musa riots]] and the disturbances throughout [[1929 Palestine riots|Palestine in 1929]].<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> The first modern spa was built in 1929.<ref name=\"Erfurt-CooperCooper20092\" />

The landscape of the modern town was shaped by the great flood of November 11, 1934. Deforestation on the slopes above the town combined with the fact that the city had been built as a series of closely packed houses and buildings – usually sharing walls – built in narrow roads paralleling and closely hugging the shore of the lake. Flood waters carrying mud, stones, and boulders rushed down the slopes and filled the streets and buildings with water so rapidly that many people did not have time to escape; the loss of life and property was great. The city rebuilt on the slopes and the British Mandatory government planted the [[Swiss Forest]] on the slopes above the town to hold the soil and prevent similar disasters from recurring. A new seawall was constructed, moving the shoreline several yards out from the former shore.<ref>Mandated landscape: British imperial rule in Palestine, 1929–1948, Roza El-Eini, (Routledge, 2006) p. 250</ref><ref>The Changing Land: Between the Jordan and the Sea: Aerial Photographs from 1917 to the Present, Benjamin Z.

Between the April 8–9, 1948, sporadic shooting broke out between the Jewish and Arab neighborhoods of Tiberias. The Arab population  of Tiberias cut the main road linking the Jewish settlements of Upper Galilee with those of the Jordan Valley and besieged the ancient Jewish quarter on the lakes hore within the walled city<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Tiberias |title = Tiberias &#124; Israel}}</ref> On April 10, the Haganah launched a mortar barrage, killing some Arab residents.<ref name=\"morris1832\">Morris, 2004, pp. 183–185</ref> The local National Committee refused the offer of the [[Arab Liberation Army]] to take over defense of the city, but a small contingent of outside irregulars moved in.<ref name=\"morris1832\" /> During April 10–17, the Haganah attacked the city and refused to negotiate a truce, while the British refused to intervene.

[[File:Dover tverya17.jpg|thumb|Tiberias and the [[Sea of Galilee]]]]
The city of Tiberias has been almost entirely Jewish since 1948. Many [[Sephardic]] and [[Mizrahi]] Jews settled in the city, following the [[Jewish exodus from Arab countries]] in late 1940s and the early 1950s. Over time, government housing was built to accommodate much of the new population, like in many other [[development town]]s.

In 1959, during [[Wadi Salib riots]], the \"''Union des Nords-africains'' led by David Ben Haroush, organised a large-scale procession walking towards the nice suburbs of [[Haifa]] creating little damage but a great fear within the population. This small incident was taken as an occasion to express the social malaise of the different [[Mizrahi Jews in Israel|Oriental communities in Israel]] and riots spread quickly to other parts of the country; mostly in towns with a high percentage of the population having North African origins like in Tiberias, in [[Beer-Sheva]], in [[Migdal HaEmek|Migdal-Haemek]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Allouche|title=The Oriental Communities in Israel 1948-2003|url=http://doczz.fr/doc/96608/the-oriental-communities-in-israel--1948-2003|page= 35}}</ref>

Over time, the city came to rely on tourism, becoming a major Galileean center for Christian pilgrims and internal Israeli tourism. The ancient cemetery of Tiberias and its old synagogues are also drawing religious Jewish pilgrims during religious holidays. PM [[Yitzhak Rabin]] mentioned the town in his memoirs on the occasion of signing the historic peace agreement with Egypt in 1979; and again at the Casablanca Conference in 1994.<ref>M.Gilbert, p.566, 578</ref>

Tiberias consists of a small port on the shores of the Galilee lake for both fishing and tourist activities. Since the 1990s, the importance of the port for fishing was gradually decreasing, with the decline of the Tiberias lake level, due to continuing droughts and increased pumping of fresh water from the lake. It is expected that the lake of Tiberias will regain its original level (almost {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=off}} higher than today), with the full operational capacity of Israeli desalination facilities by 2014.

Plans are underway to expand the city with a new neighborhood, Kiryat Sanz, built on a slope on the western side of the Kinneret and catering exclusively to [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/new-ultra-orthodox-neighborhood-to-be-built-in-israel-s-north-1.422255 New ultra-Orthodox neighborhood to be built in Israel's north], Apr. 3, 2012, Haaretz</ref>

==Demographics==
According to the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Central Bureau of Statistics]] (CBS), as of December 2011, 41,700 inhabitants lived in Tiberias. According to CBS, as of December 2010 the city was rated 5 out of 10 on the socio-economic scale. The average monthly salary of an employee for the year 2009 was 4,845 NIS.<ref>http://www.cbs.gov.il/publications12/local_authorities10/pdf/198_6700.pdf</ref> Almost all of the population is Jewish, in modern times, as the Arab population of Tiberias was evacuated under British military protection on 18 April 1948. Among the Jews, many are [[Mizrahi Jews in Israel|Mizrahi]] and Sephardic.

==Infrastructure==

===Urban renewal and preservation===
[[File:Tiberias_hotels.JPG|thumb|Beachfront of modern Tiberias]]

Ancient and medieval Tiberias was destroyed by a series of devastating earthquakes, and much of what was built after the major earthquake of 1837 was destroyed or badly damaged in the great flood of 1934. Houses in the newer parts of town, uphill from the waterfront, survived. In 1949, 606 houses, comprising almost all of the built-up area of the old quarter other than religious buildings, were demolished over the objections of local Jews who owned about half the houses.<ref name=\"Golan2\">Arnon Golan, The Politics of Wartime Demolition and Human Landscape Transformation, ''War in History'', vol 9 (2002), pp 431–445.</ref> Wide-scale development began after the [[Six-Day War]], with the construction of a waterfront promenade, open parkland, shopping streets, restaurants and modern hotels. Carefully preserved were several churches, including one with foundations dating from the Crusader period, the city's two Ottoman-era mosques, and several [[Ancient synagogues of Tiberias|ancient synagogues]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1137820.html|title=Old Tiberias synagogue to regain its former glory|publisher=www.haaretz.com}}</ref> The city's old masonry buildings constructed of local black basalt with white limestone windows and trim have been designated historic landmarks. Also preserved are parts of the ancient wall, the Ottoman-era citadel, historic hotels, Christian pilgrim hostels, convents and schools.

===Archaeology===
A 2,000 year-old Roman theatre was discovered {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off}} under layers of debris and refuse at the foot of Mount Bernike south of modern Tiberias.

In 2004, excavations in Tiberias conducted by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] uncovered a structure dating to the 3rd century CE that may have been the seat of the [[Sanhedrin]].

===Earthquakes===
Tiberias has been severely damaged by earthquakes since antiquity. Earthquakes are known to have occurred in 30, 33, 115, 306, [[Galilee earthquake of 363|363]], 419, 447, 631–32 (aftershocks continued for a month), 1033, 1182, 1202, 1546, [[Near East earthquakes of 1759|1759]], [[Galilee earthquake of 1837|1837]], 1927 and 1943.<ref>[[Haim Watzman|Watzman, Haim]] (29 May 2007). ''A Crack in the Earth: A Journey Up Israel's Rift Valley''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. {{ISBN|978-0374130589}}. p. 161. </ref>

The city is located above the [[Dead Sea Transform]] and is one of the cities in Israel that is most at risk to [[earthquake]]s (along with [[Safed]], [[Beit She'an]], [[Kiryat Shmona]], and [[Eilat]]).<ref>Avraham, Rachel (22 October 2013). \"[http://unitedwithisrael.org/experts-warn-major-earthquake-could-hit-israel-any-time Experts Warn: Major Earthquake Could Hit Israel Any Time]\".

[[File:Bodek_Architects_Tiberias_Football_Stadium_AA.jpg|thumb|[[Tiberias Football Stadium]] (under construction), designed by [[Moti Bodek]] Architects]]

[[Hapoel Tiberias F.C.|Hapoel Tiberias]] represented the city in the [[Israeli Premier League|top division]] of football for several seasons in the 1960s and 1980s, but eventually dropped into the regional leagues and folded due to financial difficulties. Following Hapoel's demise, a new club, [[Ironi Tiberias F.C.|Ironi Tiberias]], was established, which currently plays in [[Liga Alef]]. [[6 Nations Championship]] and [[Heineken Cup]] winner [[Jamie Heaslip]] was born in Tiberias.

The [[Tiberias Marathon]] is an annual road race held along the Sea of Galilee in Israel with a field in recent years of approximately 1000 competitors. The course follows an out-and-back format around the southern tip of the sea, and was run concurrently with a 10k race along an abbreviated version of the same route. In 2010 the 10k race was moved to the afternoon before the marathon. At approximately {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=off}} below [[sea level]], this is the lowest course in the world.

: ''See [[Diocese of Tiberias]] for [[Church history|ecclesiastical history]]''

===Jewish biblical tradition===
Jewish tradition holds that Tiberias was built on the site of the ancient Israelite village of ''[[Rakkath]]'' or ''Rakkat'', first mentioned in the [[Book of Joshua]].<ref name=\"JewishEnc2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=205&letter=T|title=TIBERIAS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse|Joshua|19:35}}</ref> In [[Talmud]]ic times, the Jews still referred to it by this name.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Megillah 5b</ref>

===Herodian period===
Tiberias was founded sometime around 20 CE in the [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|Herodian Tetrarchy]] of Galilee and [[Peraea]] by the Roman [[Client state|client king]] [[Herod Antipas]], son of [[Herod the Great]]. Herod Antipas made it the capital of his realm in the Galilee and named it for the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Tiberius]].<ref name=\"JewishEnc2\" /> The city was built in immediate proximity to a spa which had developed around 17 natural mineral hot springs, Hammat Tiberias. Tiberias was at first a strictly pagan city, but later became populated mainly by Jews, with its growing spiritual and religious status exerting a strong influence on [[Balneotherapy|balneological]] practices.<ref name=\"Erfurt-CooperCooper20092\" />{{dubious|... and highly so. Judaism and balneotherapy do not mix.|date=August 2016}} Conversely, in ''[[The Antiquities of the Jews]]'', the Roman-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] calls the village with hot springs [[Emmaus (disambiguation)|Emmaus]], today's Hammat Tiberias, located near Tiberias.<ref name=\"JAoJ2\" /> This name also appears in his work ''[[The Wars of the Jews]]''.<ref>Josephus, Flavius, The Jewish Wars, translated by William Whiston, Book 4, chapter 1, paragraph 3</ref>

In the days of Herod Antipas, some of the most religiously orthodox [[Jews]], who were struggling against the process of [[Hellenization]], which had affected even some [[Kohen|priestly groups]], refused to settle there: the presence of a [[cemetery]] rendered the site ritually unclean for the Jews and particularly for the priestly [[caste]]. Antipas settled many non-Jews there from rural Galilee and other parts of his domains in order to populate his new capital, and built a palace on the [[acropolis]].<ref name=\"MDotB2\" />{{dubious|Acropolis usually implies a height, which is not the case for Tib.|date=August 2016}} The prestige of Tiberias was so great that the Sea of Galilee soon came to be named the Sea of Tiberias; however, the Jewish population continued to call it 'Yam Ha-Kineret', its traditional name.<ref name=\"MDotB2\" /> The city was governed by a city council of 600 with a committee of 10 until [[44 CE]] when a [[Procurator (Roman)|Roman procurator]] was set over the city after the death of [[Herod Agrippa I]].<ref name=\"MDotB2\" />

===Roman period===
Tiberias is mentioned in {{bibleverse||John|6:23|NKJV}} as the location from which boats had sailed to the opposite, eastern side of the Sea of Galilee. The crowd seeking [[Jesus]] after the miraculous [[Feeding the multitude|feeding of the 5000]] used these boats to travel back to [[Capernaum]] on the north-western part of the lake.

Under the [[Roman Empire]], the city was known by its [[Greek language|Greek]] name '''Τιβεριάς''' (''Tiberiás'', [[Modern Greek]] Τιβεριάδα ''Tiveriáda''), an adaptation of the [[Taw (letter)|taw]]-suffixed [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] form that preserved its [[Grammatical gender|feminine grammatical gender]]. In [[AD 61|61 CE]] [[Herod Agrippa II]] annexed the city to his kingdom whose capital was [[Banias|Caesarea Philippi]].<ref name=\"DW IH2\">Winter, Dave (1999) ''Israel Handbook: With the Palestinian Authority Areas'' Footprint Travel Guides, {{ISBN|1-900949-48-2}}, pp 660–661</ref>

During the [[First Jewish–Roman War]], the seditious took control of the city and destroyed Herod's palace, and were able to prevent the city from being pillaged by the army of [[Agrippa II]], the Jewish ruler who had remained loyal to Rome.<ref name=\"MDotB2\" /><ref>Crossan, John Dominic (1999) Birth of Christianity: Discovering What Happened in the Years Immediately After the Execution of Christ. Continuum International Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0-567-08668-2}}, p 232</ref> Eventually, the seditious were expelled from Tiberias, and while most other cities in the provinces of Judaea, Galilee and [[Edom|Idumea]] were razed, Tiberias was spared this fate because its inhabitants had decided not to fight against Rome.<ref name=\"MDotB2\" /><ref>Thomson, 1859, vol 2, p. [https://archive.org/stream/landandbookorbi08thomgoog#page/n84/mode/1up 72]</ref> It became a mixed city after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE; with Judea subdued, the surviving southern Jewish population migrated to the Galilee.<ref>Safrai Zeev (1994) ''The Economy of Roman Palestine'' Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-10243-X}}, p 199</ref><ref name=\"ERBRiP2\">Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, p.

There is no direct indication that Tiberias, as well as the rest of Galilee, took part in the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] of 132–136 CE, thus allowing it to exist, despite a heavy economic decline due to the war. Following the expulsion of Jews from Judea after 135 CE, Tiberias and its neighbour [[Sepphoris]] (Hebrew name: Tzippori) became the major Jewish cultural centres.

According to the Talmud, in 145 CE, [[Rabbi]] [[Simeon bar Yochai]], who was very familiar with the Galilee, hiding there for over a decade, \"cleansed the city of ritual impurity\",<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> allowing the Jewish leadership to resettle there from the Judea, which they were forced to leave as fugitives. The [[Sanhedrin]], the Jewish court, also fled from Jerusalem during the Great Jewish Revolt against Rome, and after several attempted moves, in search of stability, eventually settled in Tiberias in about 150 CE.<ref name=\"MDotB2\">Mercer Dictionary of the Bible Edited by Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard, Mercer University Press, (1998) {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} p 917</ref><ref name=\"ERBRiP2\" /> It was to be its final meeting place before its disbanding in the Early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period. When [[Johanan bar Nappaha]] (d. 279) settled in Tiberias, the city became the focus of Jewish religious scholarship in the land. The [[Mishnah]], the collected theological discussions of generations of rabbis in the [[Land of Israel]] – primarily in the academies of Tiberias and [[Caesarea]] – was probably compiled in Tiberias by Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] around 200 CE.{{dubious|Same claim usually made for Bet She'arim and Sepphoris.|date=August 2016}} The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] would follow being compiled by Rabbi Jochanan between 230–270 CE.<ref name=\"ERBRiP2\" /> Tiberias' 13 synagogues served the spiritual needs of a growing Jewish population.<ref name=\"MDotB2\" />

===Byzantine period===
In the 6th century Tiberias was still the seat of Jewish religious learning. In light of this, a [[Letter of Simeon of Beth Arsham|letter]] of Syriac bishop Simeon of [[Beth Arsham]] urged the Christians of Palaestina to seize the leaders of Judaism in Tiberias, to put them to the rack, and to compel them to command the Jewish king, [[Dhu Nuwas]], to desist from persecuting the Christians in [[Najran]].<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia: Tiberias2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=205&letter=T#ixzz0RkgRIUUe|title=TIBERIAS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref>

In 614, Tiberias was the site where, during the final [[Revolt against Heraclius|Jewish revolt]] against the [[Byzantine Empire]], parts of the Jewish population supported the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian]] invaders; the Jewish rebels were financed by [[Benjamin of Tiberias]], a man of immense wealth; according to Christian sources, during the revolt Christians were massacred and churches destroyed. In 628, the Byzantine army returned to Tiberias upon the surrender of Jewish rebels and the end of the Persian occupation after they were defeated in the [[Battle of Nineveh (627)|battle of Nineveh]]. A year later, influenced by radical Christian monks, Emperor [[Heraclius]] instigated a wide-scale slaughter of the Jews, which practically emptied Galilee of most its Jewish population, with survivors fleeing to Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Tiberias, or Tabariyyah in Arab transcription, was \"conquered by (the Arab commander) [[Shurahbil ibn Hasana|Shurahbil]] in the year 634/15 [CE/AH] by capitulation; one half of the houses and churches were to belong to the Muslims, the other half to the Christians.\"<ref>Le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/340/mode/1up 340], quoting [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yakut]]</ref> Since 636 CE, Tiberias served as the regional capital, until [[Beit She'an]] took its place, following the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] conquest. The Caliphate allowed 70 Jewish families from Tiberias to form the core of a renewed Jewish presence in Jerusalem and the importance of Tiberias to Jewish life declined.<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> The caliphs of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] Dynasty built one of its square-plan palaces on the waterfront to the north of Tiberias, at [[Khirbat al-Minya]].

Ben Asher is also credited with putting the finishing touches on the [[Aleppo Codex]], the most accurate existing manuscript of the Hebrew scriptures.

The Arab geographer [[al-Muqaddasi]] writing in 985, describes Tiberias as a hedonistic city afflicted by heat:-'For two months they dance; for two months they gobble; for two months they swat; for two months they go about naked; for two months they play the reed flute; and for two months they wallow in the mud.<ref name=\"Hasson2\" /> As \"the capital of Jordan Province, and a city in the Valley of Canaan...The town is narrow, hot in summer and unhealthy...There are here eight natural hot baths, where no fuel need be used, and numberless basins besides of boiling water. The [[mosque]] is large and fine, and stands in the market-place. Its floor is laid in pebbles, set on stone drums, placed close one to another.\" According to Muqaddasi, those who suffered from scab or ulcers, and other such diseases came to Tiberias to bathe in the hot springs for three days. \"Afterwards they dip in another spring which is cold, whereupon...they become cured.\"<ref>Muk. p.161 and 185, quoted in Le Strange, 1890, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/334/mode/1up 334]- [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/337/mode/1up 337]</ref>

In 1033 Tiberias was again destroyed by an earthquake.<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> A further earthquake in 1066 toppled the great mosque.<ref name=\"Hasson2\" /> [[Nasir Khusraw|Nasir-i Khusrou]] visited Tiberias in 1047, and describes a city with a \"strong wall\" which begins at the border of the lake and goes all around the town except on the water-side. Furthermore, he describes
: <blockquote>numberless buildings erected in the very water, for the bed of the lake in this part is rock; and they have built pleasure houses that are supported on columns of [[marble]], rising up out of the water. The lake is very full of fish. [] The Friday Mosque is in the midst of the town. At the gate of the mosque is a spring, over which they have built a hot bath. [] On the western side of the town is a mosque known as the Jasmine Mosque (Masjid-i-Yasmin). It is a fine building and in the middle part rises a great platform (dukkan), where they have their [[mihrab]]s (or prayer-niches). All round those they have set [[jasmine]]-shrubs, from which the mosque derives its name.<ref>Le Strange, 1890, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/336/mode/1up 336]-7</ref></blockquote>

===Crusader period===
[[File:The_Doctor_House_-_The_Scots_Hotel.JPG|thumb|The Scots Hotel in the restored former hospital of Dr. Torrance]]

During the [[First Crusade]] Tiberias was occupied by the [[Franks]] soon after the capture of [[Jerusalem]]. The city was given in fief to [[Tancred, Prince of Galilee|Tancred]], who made it his capital of the [[Principality of Galilee]] in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; the region was sometimes called the Principality of Tiberias, or the Tiberiad.<ref>Richard, Jean (1999) ''The Crusades c. 1071-c 1291'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-62369-3}} p 71</ref> In 1099 the original site of the city was abandoned, and settlement shifted north to the present location.<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> [[St. Peter's Church, Tiberias|St. Peter's Church]], originally built by the Crusaders, is still standing today, although the building has been altered and reconstructed over the years.

In the late 12th century Tiberias' Jewish community numbered 50 Jewish families, headed by rabbis,<ref>\"Journy of [[Benjamin of Tudela]] in Palestine and Syria, {{circa|1170}}\" in Yaari, p.[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36832&st=%D7%98%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94&pgnum=43&hilite= 44]</ref> and at that time the best manuscripts of the [[Torah]] were said to be found there.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia: Tiberias2\" /> In the 12th-century, the city was the subject of negative undertones in Islamic tradition.

In 1187, [[Saladin]] ordered his son [[Al-Afdal ibn Salah ad-Din|al-Afdal]] to send an envoy to Count [[Raymond III of Tripoli|Raymond of Tripoli]] requesting safe passage through his fiefdom of Galilee and Tiberias. Raymond was obliged to grant the request under the terms of his treaty with Saladin. Saladin's force left [[Caesarea Philippi]] to engage the fighting force of the [[Knights Templar]]. The Templar force was destroyed in [[Battle of Cresson|the encounter]]. Saladin then [[Siege|besieged]] Tiberias; after six days the town fell. On July 4, 1187 Saladin defeated the Crusaders coming to relieve Tiberias at the [[Battle of Hattin]], {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} outside the city.<ref>Wilson, John Francis.

Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon, ([[Maimonides]]) also known as Rambam, a leading Jewish legal scholar, philosopher and physician of his period, died in 1204 in [[Egypt]] and was later buried in Tiberias. His tomb is one of the city's important pilgrimage sites. [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yakut]], writing in the 1220s, described Tiberias as a small town, long and narrow. He also describes the \"hot salt springs, over which they have built [[Turkish bath|Hammams]] which use no fuel.\"

During the 16th century, Tiberias was a small village. Italian Rabbi [[Moses ben Mordecai Bassola|Moses Bassola]] visited Tiberias during his trip to Palestine in 1522. He said on Tiberias that \"...it was a big city... and now it is ruined and desolate\". He described the village there, in which he said there were \"ten or twelve\" Muslim households. The area, according to Bassola, was dangerous \"because of the Arabs\", and in order to stay there, he had to pay the local governor for his protection.<ref>Yaari, pp.[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36832&st=%D7%98%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94&pgnum=154&hilite=155]–156</ref>

As the [[Ottoman Empire]] expanded along the southern Mediterranean coast under Great Sultan [[Selim I]], the ''Reyes Católicos'' ([[Catholic Monarchs]]) began establishing [[Inquisition]] commissions. Many [[Converso|''Conversos'']], ([[Marrano|''Marranos'']] and [[Morisco|''Moriscos'']]) and [[Sephardi Jews]] fled in fear to the Ottoman provinces, settling at first in [[Constantinople]], [[Salonika]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Sofia]] and [[Anatolia]].

===British Mandate===
At the inception of the British Mandate (1922), the city already had a Jewish majority.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Tiberias |title = Tiberias &#124; Israel}}</ref> Initially the relationship between Arabs and Jews in Tiberias was good, with few incidents occurring in the [[1920 Palestine riots|Nebi Musa riots]] and the disturbances throughout [[1929 Palestine riots|Palestine in 1929]].<ref name=\"DW IH2\" /> The first modern spa was built in 1929.<ref name=\"Erfurt-CooperCooper20092\" />

The landscape of the modern town was shaped by the great flood of November 11, 1934. Deforestation on the slopes above the town combined with the fact that the city had been built as a series of closely packed houses and buildings – usually sharing walls – built in narrow roads paralleling and closely hugging the shore of the lake. Flood waters carrying mud, stones, and boulders rushed down the slopes and filled the streets and buildings with water so rapidly that many people did not have time to escape; the loss of life and property was great. The city rebuilt on the slopes and the British Mandatory government planted the [[Swiss Forest]] on the slopes above the town to hold the soil and prevent similar disasters from recurring. A new seawall was constructed, moving the shoreline several yards out from the former shore.<ref>Mandated landscape: British imperial rule in Palestine, 1929–1948, Roza El-Eini, (Routledge, 2006) p. 250</ref><ref>The Changing Land: Between the Jordan and the Sea: Aerial Photographs from 1917 to the Present, Benjamin Z.

Between the April 8–9, 1948, sporadic shooting broke out between the Jewish and Arab neighborhoods of Tiberias. The Arab population  of Tiberias cut the main road linking the Jewish settlements of Upper Galilee with those of the Jordan Valley and besieged the ancient Jewish quarter on the lakes hore within the walled city<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Tiberias |title = Tiberias &#124; Israel}}</ref> On April 10, the Haganah launched a mortar barrage, killing some Arab residents.<ref name=\"morris1832\">Morris, 2004, pp. 183–185</ref> The local National Committee refused the offer of the [[Arab Liberation Army]] to take over defense of the city, but a small contingent of outside irregulars moved in.<ref name=\"morris1832\" /> During April 10–17, the Haganah attacked the city and refused to negotiate a truce, while the British refused to intervene.

[[File:Dover tverya17.jpg|thumb|Tiberias and the [[Sea of Galilee]]]]
The city of Tiberias has been almost entirely Jewish since 1948. Many [[Sephardic]] and [[Mizrahi]] Jews settled in the city, following the [[Jewish exodus from Arab countries]] in late 1940s and the early 1950s. Over time, government housing was built to accommodate much of the new population, like in many other [[development town]]s.

In 1959, during [[Wadi Salib riots]], the \"''Union des Nords-africains'' led by David Ben Haroush, organised a large-scale procession walking towards the nice suburbs of [[Haifa]] creating little damage but a great fear within the population. This small incident was taken as an occasion to express the social malaise of the different [[Mizrahi Jews in Israel|Oriental communities in Israel]] and riots spread quickly to other parts of the country; mostly in towns with a high percentage of the population having North African origins like in Tiberias, in [[Beer-Sheva]], in [[Migdal HaEmek|Migdal-Haemek]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Allouche|title=The Oriental Communities in Israel 1948-2003|url=http://doczz.fr/doc/96608/the-oriental-communities-in-israel--1948-2003|page= 35}}</ref>

Over time, the city came to rely on tourism, becoming a major Galileean center for Christian pilgrims and internal Israeli tourism. The ancient cemetery of Tiberias and its old synagogues are also drawing religious Jewish pilgrims during religious holidays. PM [[Yitzhak Rabin]] mentioned the town in his memoirs on the occasion of signing the historic peace agreement with Egypt in 1979; and again at the Casablanca Conference in 1994.<ref>M.Gilbert, p.566, 578</ref>

Tiberias consists of a small port on the shores of the Galilee lake for both fishing and tourist activities. Since the 1990s, the importance of the port for fishing was gradually decreasing, with the decline of the Tiberias lake level, due to continuing droughts and increased pumping of fresh water from the lake. It is expected that the lake of Tiberias will regain its original level (almost {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=off}} higher than today), with the full operational capacity of Israeli desalination facilities by 2014.

Plans are underway to expand the city with a new neighborhood, Kiryat Sanz, built on a slope on the western side of the Kinneret and catering exclusively to [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/new-ultra-orthodox-neighborhood-to-be-built-in-israel-s-north-1.422255 New ultra-Orthodox neighborhood to be built in Israel's north], Apr. 3, 2012, Haaretz</ref>

It was reported that the Jewish inhabitants of Tiberias enjoyed more peace and security than those of [[Safed]] to the north.<ref>M.Gilbert, Israel: A History (1998), p.3</ref> In 1863, it was recorded that the Christian and Muslim elements made up three-quarters of the population (2,000 to 4,000).<ref>Smith, William (1863) ''A Dictionary of the Bible: Comprising Its Antiquities, Biography, and Natural History'' Little, Brown, p 149</ref> A population list from about 1887 showed that  Tiberias had a population of about 3,640; 2,025 Jews, 30 Latins, 215 Catholics, 15 Greek Catholics, and 1,355 Muslims.<ref>Schumacher, 1888, p.

==Infrastructure==

===Urban renewal and preservation===
[[File:Tiberias_hotels.JPG|thumb|Beachfront of modern Tiberias]]

Ancient and medieval Tiberias was destroyed by a series of devastating earthquakes, and much of what was built after the major earthquake of 1837 was destroyed or badly damaged in the great flood of 1934. Houses in the newer parts of town, uphill from the waterfront, survived. In 1949, 606 houses, comprising almost all of the built-up area of the old quarter other than religious buildings, were demolished over the objections of local Jews who owned about half the houses.<ref name=\"Golan2\">Arnon Golan, The Politics of Wartime Demolition and Human Landscape Transformation, ''War in History'', vol 9 (2002), pp 431–445.</ref> Wide-scale development began after the [[Six-Day War]], with the construction of a waterfront promenade, open parkland, shopping streets, restaurants and modern hotels. Carefully preserved were several churches, including one with foundations dating from the Crusader period, the city's two Ottoman-era mosques, and several [[Ancient synagogues of Tiberias|ancient synagogues]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1137820.html|title=Old Tiberias synagogue to regain its former glory|publisher=www.haaretz.com}}</ref> The city's old masonry buildings constructed of local black basalt with white limestone windows and trim have been designated historic landmarks. Also preserved are parts of the ancient wall, the Ottoman-era citadel, historic hotels, Christian pilgrim hostels, convents and schools.

===Archaeology===
A 2,000 year-old Roman theatre was discovered {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off}} under layers of debris and refuse at the foot of Mount Bernike south of modern Tiberias. It once seated over 7,000 people.<ref>[http://haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1115642.html 2,000-year-old amphitheater] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922201708/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1115642.html |date=2009-09-22 }}</ref>

In 2004, excavations in Tiberias conducted by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] uncovered a structure dating to the 3rd century CE that may have been the seat of the [[Sanhedrin]]. At the time it was called Beit Hava'ad.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/researchers-say-tiberias-basilica-may-have-housed-sanhedrin-1.117483|title=Researchers Say Tiberias Basilica May Have Housed Sanhedrin|first=Eli|last=Ashkenazi|date=22 March 2004|publisher=|newspaper=Haaretz}}</ref>

In June 2018, an underground Jewish mausoleum has been discovered. Archaeologist said that the mausoleum is between 1,900 to 2,000 years old as of 2018.

===Earthquakes===
Tiberias has been severely damaged by earthquakes since antiquity. Earthquakes are known to have occurred in 30, 33, 115, 306, [[Galilee earthquake of 363|363]], 419, 447, 631–32 (aftershocks continued for a month), 1033, 1182, 1202, 1546, [[Near East earthquakes of 1759|1759]], [[Galilee earthquake of 1837|1837]], 1927 and 1943.<ref>[[Haim Watzman|Watzman, Haim]] (29 May 2007). ''A Crack in the Earth: A Journey Up Israel's Rift Valley''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. {{ISBN|978-0374130589}}. p. 161. </ref>

The city is located above the [[Dead Sea Transform]] and is one of the cities in Israel that is most at risk to [[earthquake]]s (along with [[Safed]], [[Beit She'an]], [[Kiryat Shmona]], and [[Eilat]]).<ref>Avraham, Rachel (22 October 2013). \"[http://unitedwithisrael.org/experts-warn-major-earthquake-could-hit-israel-any-time Experts Warn: Major Earthquake Could Hit Israel Any Time]\".

==Sports==
[[File:Bodek_Architects_Tiberias_Football_Stadium_AA.jpg|thumb|[[Tiberias Football Stadium]] (under construction), designed by [[Moti Bodek]] Architects]]

[[Hapoel Tiberias F.C.|Hapoel Tiberias]] represented the city in the [[Israeli Premier League|top division]] of football for several seasons in the 1960s and 1980s, but eventually dropped into the regional leagues and folded due to financial difficulties. Following Hapoel's demise, a new club, [[Ironi Tiberias F.C.|Ironi Tiberias]], was established, which currently plays in [[Liga Alef]]. [[6 Nations Championship]] and [[Heineken Cup]] winner [[Jamie Heaslip]] was born in Tiberias.

The [[Tiberias Marathon]] is an annual road race held along the Sea of Galilee in Israel with a field in recent years of approximately 1000 competitors. The course follows an out-and-back format around the southern tip of the sea, and was run concurrently with a 10k race along an abbreviated version of the same route. In 2010 the 10k race was moved to the afternoon before the marathon. At approximately {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=off}} below [[sea level]], this is the lowest course in the world.

The '''Eisenhower dollar''' was a one-dollar coin issued by the [[United States Mint]] from 1971 to 1978; it was the first [[dollar coin (United States)|coin of that denomination]] issued by the Mint since the [[Peace dollar]] series ended in 1935. The coin depicts [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], and a stylized image honoring the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] Moon mission on the reverse, with both sides designed by [[Frank Gasparro]] (the reverse is based on the Apollo 11 mission patch designed by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]). It is the only large-size U.S. dollar coin whose circulation strikes contained no silver.

In 1965, because of rises in bullion prices, the Mint began to strike copper-nickel [[cladding (metalworking)|clad]] coins instead of silver. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, but beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died that March, there were a number of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President [[Richard Nixon]], who had served as [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing mintage of the new coin on December 31, 1970.

Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars failed to circulate to any degree, except in and around [[Nevada]] casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams in honor of the [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial of American independence]]. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]], struck beginning in 1979, but that coin also failed to circulate. Given their modest cost and the short length of the series, complete sets of Eisenhower dollars are inexpensive to assemble and are becoming more popular among coin collectors.

==Background==
{{Further|Peace dollar#Striking of 1964-D dollars|Coinage Act of 1965#Coin shortage}}
The silver dollar had never been a popular coin, circulating little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The [[Peace dollar]], the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]]. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2842–2846}}

On August 3, 1964, [[88th United States Congress|Congress]] passed legislation providing for the striking of 45 million silver dollars. This legislation was enacted when coins vanished from circulation as the price of silver rose past $1.29 per ounce, making silver dollars worth more as bullion than as currency. The new pieces were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where \"hard money\" was popular. Numismatic periodicals complained that striking the dollars was a waste of resources.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=461}} The law had been passed at the urging of the [[Senate Majority Leader]], [[Mike Mansfield]] (Democrat–Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=78}} Despite the efforts of Mint Director [[Eva Adams]] and her staff to persuade him, Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay, and on May 12, 1965 the [[Denver Mint]] began striking 1964-D Peace dollars{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=86}}—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 13, 1964}}

A public announcement of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965,{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=87–88}} only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources at a time of severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, [[89th United States Congress|Congress]] inserted a provision in the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=98–101}} That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=36}}

==Inception==
[[File:1964 Peace dollar restrike.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An unofficially produced 1964-D Peace dollar, struck over a genuine silver dollar by a private mint]]
In 1969, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] Mint Director [[Mary Brooks]] sought the reissuance of the dollar coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the [[Kennedy half dollar]], but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]], [[Wright Patman]], who had been persuaded, against his better judgment, by Nixon's predecessor, [[Lyndon Johnson]], to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=37}}

On March 28, 1969, former president and World War II general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] died. Soon after, New Jersey Representative [[Florence Dwyer]], like Eisenhower, a Republican, suggested that the proposed dollar coin bear his likeness. She spoke to Democratic Missouri Representative [[Leonor Sullivan]], who agreed that the dollar should bear a portrait of Eisenhower as \"equal time\" to the half dollar, which bore the likeness of Democratic president [[John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}} A bill was filed by Connecticut Congressman [[Robert N. Giaimo]] to authorize an Eisenhower dollar, to be struck without silver content. The [[Joint Commission on the Coinage]], drawing members from the administration and from Congress, including Giaimo, recommended the dollar in spring<!-- I can show it is in the Northern Hemisphere spring as the article was published on June 15 and Eisenhower died on March 28, so it had to be.  However, the source does not date the meeting closer than that.  IAR --> 1969. It also called for the elimination of silver from the half dollar, and for the transfer from the Treasury to the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) of quantities of rare silver dollars, so they could be sold. Giaimo noted that the coin would be useful in casinos, which were striking their own tokens in the absence of circulating dollar coins, and in the vending industry, which was starting to sell higher-priced items.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|June 15, 1969}}

On October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed legislation for a silverless Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating that he hoped to have it approved by the full House in time for the late president's birthday on October 14.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 4, 1969}} On October 6, the bill's sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against the manner in which the legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman [[H. R. Gross]] objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: \"You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal.\"{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 7, 1969}} Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower's birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator [[Peter Dominick]], calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from [[Mamie Eisenhower]], recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 15, 1969}}{{sfn|''The Bulletin''|October 15, 1969}} Idaho Senator [[James A. McClure|James McClure]] stated, \"It is somehow beneath the dignity of a great president like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin.\" On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative [[Robert R. Casey]] introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent [[Apollo 11]] [[Moon landing]]. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2860}} Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, \"We came in peace for all mankind,\" to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.{{sfn|Ike Group|p=57}}

In March 1970, the two houses reached a compromise whereby 150 million dollars would be struck in the 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|March 8, 1970}} The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, with the aid of Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as \"a lot less than the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get.\" {{sfn|''Spokane Daily Chronicle''|March 6, 1970}} The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=29}}

Although the compromise passed the Senate in March 1970,{{sfn|''The Spokesman-Review''|March 20, 1970}} it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who was determined to end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a [[conference committee]] and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as [[91st United States Congress|Congress]] had adjourned, not signing the bill would [[pocket veto]] it, on December 31, 1970, Nixon hastily signed it only minutes before the midnight deadline.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}}{{sfn|Gilkes}}{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 17, 1970}}

==Design==
[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|left|The [[Apollo 11]] mission insignia, designed by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], served as the basis of the Eisenhower dollar's reverse.]]
For Mint Chief Engraver [[Frank Gasparro]], the opportunity to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro had been one of more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, [[Mamie Eisenhower]], as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the [[Washington quarter]].{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}}

Before the legislation passed, Gasparro had prepared two reverses, the one actually used, and a reverse with a more formal [[spreadeagle (heraldry)|heraldic eagle]], which numismatic historian and coin dealer [[Q. David Bowers]] finds reminiscent of [[pattern coin]]s prepared in the 1870s. At Congress's insistence, the chief engraver created a design in commemoration of the [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing, based on the [[mission patch]] conceived by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] and others. Bowers deems the choice of the lunar landing \"a stroke of genius,\" allowing the dollar, which would be little-used in commerce, to be a commemorative both of Eisenhower and of the Moon mission.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The reverse depicts an eagle (representing the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar lander]], ''Eagle'') swooping low over the Moon's surface, holding an olive branch, token of peace, in its claws.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}

The use of Collins' mission patch design had initially been opposed by some government officials because of the fierce expression of the eagle; Gasparro's initial concept met similar objections. The Mint Director recalled that Gasparro had gone to the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] to look at eagles, and on his return had prepared a design which she felt emphasized the eagle's predatory nature.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=34}} Brooks informed Gasparro that the eagle was \"too fierce, too warlike, a little too aggressive\" and asked that the expression be made friendlier. Gasparro, who reportedly was unhappy at having to change the eagle,{{sfn|Ike Group|p=58}} described the final version as \"pleasant looking.\"{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] also feared that the eagle's expression might offend, and sought a neutral visage.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The distant Earth may be seen above the bird, and there are 13 stars in honor of the original states.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}

Bowers deems the bust of Eisenhower \"well modeled\" by Gasparro, and notes that the fact that the eagle on the reverse holds only an olive branch, rather than arrows as well (token of war), \"meant that the public would like the design.\"{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} Nevertheless, he notes that Eisenhower's stern expression was widely criticized as not typical of a man noted for geniality.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}} Numismatic author David Lange opines that \"the Eisenhower dollar is one of the poorest products to emanate from the U.S. Mint.\"{{sfn|Lange}} Lange writes that, although Gasparro had designed only one side of the coin for the Kennedy half dollar and [[Lincoln cent#Lincoln Memorial design (1959–2008)|Lincoln Memorial reverse]] for the cent, \"the Eisenhower dollar was his design alone and should have served as a showcase for his talent. Sadly, it is a mediocre design that reveals his typically unnatural treatment of Ike's hair and the eagle's feathers.\"{{sfn|Lange}} Some collectors complained after the release that the Earth was not fully shown, not realizing that Gasparro had carefully followed the mission badge. The chief engraver responded by clarifying the design.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}

==Release==
[[File:Eisenhower design.png|thumb|right|The Eisenhower dollar's design as released by the Treasury in January 1971 (probably from photographs of the galvano)]]
Two prototype dollars were struck at the [[Philadelphia Mint]] on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}} However, collectors have found at least two 1971-S coins that have been certified as prototypes.<ref>[http://www.ikegroup.info/chapter34/chapter34.pdf THE LYDSTON AND CHATHAM 1971-S PROTOTYPE IKES]</ref>  Striking such large pieces of tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier [[reducing lathe]] to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore at least some of the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief.{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58–59}} This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=6–7}} Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2860, 2864}} The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the [[San Francisco Mint]]) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to [[David Eisenhower]] (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.{{sfn|''The Press-Courier''|April 1, 1971}}

[[File:Brown Ike.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1974-S \"brown Ike\", partially open to show the coin and holder]]
On January 29, 1971, the Mint announced the prices for the 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced [[proof coinage|proof pieces]], with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early.{{sfn|Bailey|p=94}} [[United States Mint coin sets|Mint sets]] of the circulating coinage for 1971 did not include the Eisenhower dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2860}}

The first proof strikes, at San Francisco, took place in July.{{sfn|Bailey|p=94}} The proof pieces were sold in a plastic holder inside a brown box with a gold eagle seal; the uncirculated silver pieces were encased in pliofilm inside a blue envelope. These were dubbed \"brown Ikes\" and \"blue Ikes\" and are still known by those terms.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2866}} On July 27, 1971, President Nixon presented the first piece to be struck to Mamie Eisenhower at a White House ceremony.{{sfn|Toledo ''Blade''|July 28, 1971}} Sales of the 40% silver pieces were ended on October 8; the first proof coins were mailed to collectors on October 14, President Eisenhower's birthday.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}}

The clad circulation strikes of the Eisenhower dollar, the largest clad coin ever issued by the US Mint,{{sfn|Morgan}} were available to the general public through banks beginning on November 1, 1971. Many were hoarded by collectors; there was initially sufficient demand for the coins that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to purchase rolls in search of better specimens. An oily film was found on a large number of the coins; these coins were cleaned by collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}{{sfn|''Youngstown Vindicator''|November 4, 1971}}

Though there was initially strong
public interest in the new dollar, from the very start the coin still failed to circulate. In 1976, a Treasury study done in conjunction with a private-sector firm found that the Eisenhower dollar had a near-100 percent attrition rate, that is, almost always, a coin was used in only one transaction, and then stopped circulating (by comparison, the attrition rate of the quarter was close to zero). This was because of the coin's bulky size and weight, and the lack of potential uses for it.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=40}} Even so, it was successful in quickly replacing private-issue tokens in Nevada casinos.{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} According to numismatist Randy Camper, over 70% of \"circulating\" Eisenhower dollars were used in casinos.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}}<!-- Essay by Camper in volume --> Although the vending machine industry lobbied for the Eisenhower dollar, few machines were modified to accept the coins.{{sfn|Herbert}} Lange recalled, \"The fact is that these coins never circulated outside of casinos and nearby areas, and I don't recall ever seeing a vending machine that accepted them.\"{{sfn|Lange}}

==Production==
===Early years (1971–1974)===
[[File:1973-S Blue Ike.jpg|thumb|right|1973-S \"blue Ike\": envelope, pliofilm coin holder, and printed insert]]
The Mint struck over 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than doubling its largest annual production for a dollar coin. Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what ''CoinAge'' magazine termed \"near-heroic measures on the part of the Mint\", the piece did not circulate.{{sfn|CoinAge May 1979}}  In a 1974 article for ''[[COINage]]'', numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, \"the circulation value of the coin has been nil\".{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2870}} Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 24, 1971}} More than 11 million of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2866}} In May 1972, Treasury Secretary [[John Connally]], testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as \"just unconscionable\", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.{{sfn|Toledo ''Blade''|May 11, 1972}}

The 1972 silver pieces were again struck at San Francisco. Sales dropped considerably, to just under 2.2 million specimens in uncirculated and 1.8 million in proof.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2874}} The part-silver 1972-S Eisenhower dollars were available for sale by mail order, with the ordering period from May 1 to July 15 for the proof coins and August 1 to October 16 for the uncirculated version.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}}

With ample supplies of Eisenhower dollars, the Federal Reserve had no need to order any in 1973, and none were struck for circulation.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 2, 1973}} The 1973 and 1973-D were the first Eisenhower dollars struck for inclusion in mint sets, and were, in theory, only available that way. Over the years, many 1973 and 1973-D dollar coins have been found in circulation, leading to speculation that the 230,798 pieces which were reported melted after the Mint failed to sell as many mint sets as anticipated, were released into circulation.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2877, 2880}} John Wexler, Bill Crawford, and Kevin Flynn, in their volume on Eisenhower dollars, deny this, citing a 1974 letter from Assistant Director of the Mint for Public Services Roy C. Cahoon, which stated that all 1973 Eisenhower dollars from unsold mint sets were melted.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}} The 1973-S was struck for inclusion in base-metal proof sets, as well as for the regular \"blue Ikes\" and \"brown Ikes\". Sales of the part-silver pieces dipped to a total of just under 2.9 million. The coin was struck again for circulation in 1974, was included in mint sets and proof sets, and was available in proof and uncirculated silver clad from San Francisco.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=464}}{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=344, 349}} Congress ordered that some of the money from the sale of 1974-S silver pieces be used to support [[Eisenhower College]] in [[Seneca Falls, New York]]. Coin collectors felt that this set a bad precedent, but about $9 million was paid to the college between 1974 and 1978;{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}} yet, despite the infusion of money, the college closed its doors in 1982.{{sfn|Lange|p=24}}

The United States had issued commemorative coins between 1892 and 1954, as a means for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.{{sfn|Breen|1988|pp=581–582}}

The American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) was established by Congress in 1966 as an oversight body for the 1976 two-hundredth anniversary of American independence (the \"Bicentennial\"). In 1970, its coins and medals advisory committee recommended the issuance of a special half dollar, and subsequently the committee sought the temporary redesign of circulating American coins. Brooks and the Mint initially opposed legislation to effect these proposals, but eventually Brooks supported legislation to redesign the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar coins, and to issue special collector's sets in silver clad. Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975 and before December 31, 1976 would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776–1976. A total of 15 million sets (45 million) coins in all would be struck in silver clad for sale to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=371}}{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=502}}{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=422}}

The reverse designs for the three Bicentennial coins were determined by a design competition open to the public. This competition closed in January 1974, and in March, a design submitted by 22-year-old art student Dennis R. Williams was selected for the dollar. Williams, the youngest person to that point to design a U.S. coin, had submitted a design depicting the [[Liberty Bell]] superimposed against the Moon. Gasparro slightly modified the design, simplifying the features visible on the lunar surface, and altering the lettering and the bell.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=424}} Williams and the designers of the other denominations operated the presses to strike the first coins on August 12, 1974; a set of these prototypes was later given to the new president, [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=472}}{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|pp=424–425}} Williams' design was liked by the public but attracted criticism from some numismatists as the Liberty Bell had been previously used on coinage (for example, on the [[Franklin half dollar]]).{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}} Fearing that a low-mintage 1975 piece would be hoarded, the Mint obtained legislation in December 1974 allowing it to continue coining 1974-dated pieces until it began coinage of Bicentennial pieces.{{sfn|Ganz|1976|pp=66–68}}

The Bicentennial dollars were the first of the three denominations to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=10}} The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975.{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=503}} The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=8}}{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=232–233}}{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=42}} The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2897}} Over 220 million were struck.{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|p=233}} The Bicentennial design was not used after 1976;{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2852, 2854}} sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=542}}

One proof Bicentennial coin in silver clad and lacking a mint mark, similar to the dollar in the prototype set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the [[Woodward & Lothrop]] department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for ''[[Coin World]]'', spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and, therefore, not available to numismatists. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2901}}

By 1975, the Treasury was concerned about the drain on resources from striking the dollar, which did not circulate. It engaged a private firm to study the six current denominations of U.S. coinage, and make recommendations. The firm concluded in its report that the Eisenhower dollar was too large and heavy to circulate effectively, but if the diameter was reduced by about a third, and the weight by two-thirds, it might be used.{{sfn|CoinAge May 1979}} That report found that \"the Eisenhower dollar has not been widely accepted by the public because of its large size and weight\".{{sfn|Logan July 1979|p=42}} In January 1977, just prior to leaving office, Ford's Treasury Secretary, [[William E. Simon]], proposed the elimination of the cent and half dollar, and a reduction in size of the dollar.{{sfn|Ganz October 1979|p=44}} According to Bowers, the Treasury had come to believe that a coin as large as the Eisenhower dollar simply would not circulate in the United States.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2954}}

The Mint struck pattern pieces of the smaller size, with various shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have differentiated it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.{{sfn|Logan July 1979|p=46}}

As the Eisenhower dollar awaited its demise, approximately 50 million per year were struck, using the eagle design for the reverse. In both years, the majority coined were at Denver. No silver collector's edition was issued; the blue and brown Ikes ended with 1974.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2914–2927}}

The new Treasury Secretary, [[Michael Blumenthal]], supported Gasparro's design in testimony before Congress; Wisconsin Senator [[William Proxmire]] dubbed Blumenthal's position a \"cop-out\".{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2929}} Proxmire refused to introduce the bill, which would have left the choice of design up to Blumenthal or his successor, instead introducing his own legislation to commemorate early women's rights leader [[Susan B. Anthony]].{{sfn|Ganz July 1979|pp=49, 52}} Many in the new Congress and in the Carter Administration were social progressives, and supported [[women's lib]]. Ohio Representative [[Mary Rose Oakar]] also introduced legislation for a [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] in October 1978; it proceeded rapidly through [[95th United States Congress|Congress]] and was signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Gasparro was given photographs of Anthony and told to reproduce her appearance exactly on the coin. Anthony's stern expression caused some to dub it the \"Susan B. Agony\" dollar. The Eisenhower dollar's reverse was used for the Anthony dollar. Convinced that the public would hoard the new pieces, the Mint Bureau produced half a billion before its official release to the public on July 2, 1979. It need not have worried; the public quickly rejected the new coin as too close in size and weight to the quarter dollar, and production for circulation ceased after 1980.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2929–2930}} Mint Director [[Stella Hackel Sims]] stated, \"people are accustomed to the Eisenhower dollar, but in time, they'll become accustomed to the Susan\".{{sfn|Logan October 1979|p=101}} Attempts were made to give the new smaller dollars out as change in postal transactions, and to force their use by U.S. military personnel in Europe; both failed.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2930}}

Collected by date and mint mark, no Eisenhower dollar is rare, and a complete set may be acquired without difficulty. However, many were badly struck, without full detail, especially in 1971 and 1972, and most pieces acquired nicks, scratches or \"bag marks\" from contact with each other soon after striking. Although lower-grade silver coins can be melted, this is not practical for Eisenhower dollars due to the lack of precious metal content, and dealers often try to get any premium they can on face value. Completing a set of highest-grade specimens may be difficult and expensive, especially for the 1971 and 1972 from Philadelphia or Denver, which were not sold in mint sets, and thus only came to collectors through banks.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2858}} A 1973-D piece, tied with ten other specimens for the finest known of that date and mint mark in near-pristine [[coin grading|MS-67]] condition sold in June 2013 for $12,925. According to numismatic writer Steve Reach, \"as more people submit modern-era coins like Eisenhower dollars for third-party certification, the true rarity of many issues in top-grades is becoming clear.\"{{sfn|Reach}}

Some of the 1971-D pieces exhibit a variety in which (among several differences) the eagle lacks brow lines, these have been dubbed by Eisenhower dollar specialists the \"Friendly Eagle Pattern\".{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58–59}} The 1972 dollar struck at Philadelphia is broken down into three varieties, which were made as Gasparro adjusted the design to take advantage of better steel being used in the Mint's dies. A midyear change in the design was announced by Brooks at the [[American Numismatic Association]]'s 1972 convention in New Orleans, although she did not state exactly what was being changed. The three varieties may be differentiated by examining the depiction of the Earth on the reverse. Type I dollars show the Earth somewhat flattened, Florida pointing to the southeast, with the islands mostly to the southeast of the tip of the peninsula. The Earth is round and Florida points to the south on the Type II, with a single, large island to the southeast. The Type III is similar to the Type II, except that there are two islands directly to the south of the peninsula.{{sfn|1972 varieties}} The Type II is from a single reverse die, used in March 1972, and erroneously placed in service at Philadelphia—it is identical to and should have been used for the silver proof strikes at San Francisco. The Type III was placed in service, replacing the Type I, in September 1972.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=7}} The Type I is most common; the Type III design was used in 1973 and after. The 1972 Type II is expensive in top grades, as is the 1776–1976 Type I from Philadelphia, which was only available in mint sets.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Hicks|p=644}}

Some 1971-S proof pieces (and a few uncirculated 1971-S) have the [[serif]]s at the foot of the \"R\" in \"LIBERTY\" missing; this is dubbed the \"peg leg\" variety.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}} The serifs are missing on all 1972-S, both uncirculated and proof. After the Mint obtained better steel for dies, the serifs returned for all of the remaining non-Bicentennial coinage, from all mints, though the leg of the R was shortened, and also for the Type II Bicentennial (the Type I lacks serifs on the R). Gasparro was often trying to improve the detail of Eisenhower's head during the coin's tenure, and as the R is the letter closest to it, these changes were most likely made in an effort to improve the flow of metal as the coins were struck.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=182–184}}

In 1974 and again in 1977, the [[Denver Mint]] struck a small number of pieces on silver-clad planchets, or blanks. Both times, these came from planchets which had been shipped from the San Francisco Assay Office to Denver. The first ones in 1974 were found independently by two Las Vegas blackjack dealers.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2852, 2890, 2917}} The 1974 planchets were initially intended to be used for \"brown Ike\" proof strikings; Mint policy then was that rejected silver proof planchets were to be used for uncirculated \"blue Ikes\", but these were placed in the bin for rejected copper-nickel proof planchets, intended to be shipped to be coined for circulation at Denver. The 1977 pieces resulted from pieces rejected for Bicentennial silver proof use, which were again placed in the wrong bin (they should have been melted, as the Mint was no longer striking silver uncirculated Eisenhower dollars). Between 10 and 20 of each date are known. Wexler, Crawford, and Flynn report an even rarer 1776–1976-D dollar in silver, but state that none have been offered at auction or submitted to the major coin grading services.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=8}}

Bowers notes that the [[Morgan dollar]] (struck between 1878 and 1921) was not widely collected at the time, only to become very popular later, and suggests that one day, the turn of the Eisenhower dollar will come.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2857}} Numismatist Charles Morgan said of the Eisenhower dollar in 2012,

{{quote |
It stands today as the greatest achievement in clad coinage in U.S. history. It was the most technically challenging coin ever attempted&nbsp; ... Researching the Eisenhower Dollar is vital for numismatic historians who want to understand what the post-silver era was like. The Eisenhower Dollar was a noble failure. In this respect, it truly is a perfect collectible coin.{{sfn|Morgan}}

The '''Eisenhower dollar''' was a one-dollar coin issued by the [[United States Mint]] from 1971 to 1978; it was the first [[dollar coin (United States)|coin of that denomination]] issued by the Mint since the [[Peace dollar]] series ended in 1935. The coin depicts [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], and a stylized image honoring the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] Moon mission on the reverse, with both sides designed by [[Frank Gasparro]] (the reverse is based on the Apollo 11 mission patch designed by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]). It is the only large-size U.S. dollar coin whose circulation strikes contained no silver.

In 1965, because of rises in bullion prices, the Mint began to strike copper-nickel [[cladding (metalworking)|clad]] coins instead of silver. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, but beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died that March, there were a number of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President [[Richard Nixon]], who had served as [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing mintage of the new coin on December 31, 1970.

Although the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars failed to circulate to any degree, except in and around [[Nevada]] casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776–1976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams in honor of the [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial of American independence]]. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]], struck beginning in 1979, but that coin also failed to circulate. Given their modest cost and the short length of the series, complete sets of Eisenhower dollars are inexpensive to assemble and are becoming more popular among coin collectors. 

==Background==
{{Further|Peace dollar#Striking of 1964-D dollars|Coinage Act of 1965#Coin shortage}}
The silver dollar had never been a popular coin, circulating little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The [[Peace dollar]], the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]]. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2842–2846}}

On August 3, 1964, [[88th United States Congress|Congress]] passed legislation providing for the striking of 45 million silver dollars. This legislation was enacted when coins vanished from circulation as the price of silver rose past $1.29 per ounce, making silver dollars worth more as bullion than as currency. The new pieces were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where \"hard money\" was popular. Numismatic periodicals complained that striking the dollars was a waste of resources.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=461}} The law had been passed at the urging of the [[Senate Majority Leader]], [[Mike Mansfield]] (Democrat–Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=78}} Despite the efforts of Mint Director [[Eva Adams]] and her staff to persuade him, Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay, and on May 12, 1965 the [[Denver Mint]] began striking 1964-D Peace dollars{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=86}}—the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 13, 1964}}

A public announcement of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965,{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=87–88}} only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources at a time of severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, [[89th United States Congress|Congress]] inserted a provision in the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=98–101}} That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=36}}

==Inception==
[[File:1964 Peace dollar restrike.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An unofficially produced 1964-D Peace dollar, struck over a genuine silver dollar by a private mint]]
In 1969, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] Mint Director [[Mary Brooks]] sought the reissuance of the dollar coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the [[Kennedy half dollar]], but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]], [[Wright Patman]], who had been persuaded, against his better judgment, by Nixon's predecessor, [[Lyndon Johnson]], to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=37}}

On March 28, 1969, former president and World War II general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] died. Soon after, New Jersey Representative [[Florence Dwyer]], like Eisenhower, a Republican, suggested that the proposed dollar coin bear his likeness. She spoke to Democratic Missouri Representative [[Leonor Sullivan]], who agreed that the dollar should bear a portrait of Eisenhower as \"equal time\" to the half dollar, which bore the likeness of Democratic president [[John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}} A bill was filed by Connecticut Congressman [[Robert N. Giaimo]] to authorize an Eisenhower dollar, to be struck without silver content. The [[Joint Commission on the Coinage]], drawing members from the administration and from Congress, including Giaimo, recommended the dollar in spring<!-- I can show it is in the Northern Hemisphere spring as the article was published on June 15 and Eisenhower died on March 28, so it had to be.  However, the source does not date the meeting closer than that.  IAR --> 1969. It also called for the elimination of silver from the half dollar, and for the transfer from the Treasury to the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) of quantities of rare silver dollars, so they could be sold. Giaimo noted that the coin would be useful in casinos, which were striking their own tokens in the absence of circulating dollar coins, and in the vending industry, which was starting to sell higher-priced items.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|June 15, 1969}}

On October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed legislation for a silverless Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating that he hoped to have it approved by the full House in time for the late president's birthday on October 14.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 4, 1969}} On October 6, the bill's sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against the manner in which the legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman [[H. R. Gross]] objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: \"You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal.\"{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 7, 1969}} Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower's birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator [[Peter Dominick]], calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from [[Mamie Eisenhower]], recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 15, 1969}}{{sfn|''The Bulletin''|October 15, 1969}} Idaho Senator [[James A. McClure|James McClure]] stated, \"It is somehow beneath the dignity of a great president like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin.\" On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative [[Robert R. Casey]] introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent [[Apollo 11]] [[Moon landing]]. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2860}} Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, \"We came in peace for all mankind,\" to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.{{sfn|Ike Group|p=57}}

In March 1970, the two houses reached a compromise whereby 150 million dollars would be struck in the 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|March 8, 1970}} The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, with the aid of Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as \"a lot less than the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get.\" {{sfn|''Spokane Daily Chronicle''|March 6, 1970}} The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=29}}

Although the compromise passed the Senate in March 1970,{{sfn|''The Spokesman-Review''|March 20, 1970}} it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who was determined to end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a [[conference committee]] and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as [[91st United States Congress|Congress]] had adjourned, not signing the bill would [[pocket veto]] it, on December 31, 1970, Nixon hastily signed it only minutes before the midnight deadline.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}}{{sfn|Gilkes}}{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 17, 1970}}

==Design==
[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|left|The [[Apollo 11]] mission insignia, designed by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], served as the basis of the Eisenhower dollar's reverse.]]
For Mint Chief Engraver [[Frank Gasparro]], the opportunity to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro had been one of more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, [[Mamie Eisenhower]], as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the [[Washington quarter]].{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}}

Before the legislation passed, Gasparro had prepared two reverses, the one actually used, and a reverse with a more formal [[spreadeagle (heraldry)|heraldic eagle]], which numismatic historian and coin dealer [[Q. David Bowers]] finds reminiscent of [[pattern coin]]s prepared in the 1870s. At Congress's insistence, the chief engraver created a design in commemoration of the [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing, based on the [[mission patch]] conceived by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] and others. Bowers deems the choice of the lunar landing \"a stroke of genius,\" allowing the dollar, which would be little-used in commerce, to be a commemorative both of Eisenhower and of the Moon mission.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The reverse depicts an eagle (representing the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar lander]], ''Eagle'') swooping low over the Moon's surface, holding an olive branch, token of peace, in its claws.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}

The use of Collins' mission patch design had initially been opposed by some government officials because of the fierce expression of the eagle; Gasparro's initial concept met similar objections. The Mint Director recalled that Gasparro had gone to the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] to look at eagles, and on his return had prepared a design which she felt emphasized the eagle's predatory nature.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=34}} Brooks informed Gasparro that the eagle was \"too fierce, too warlike, a little too aggressive\" and asked that the expression be made friendlier. Gasparro, who reportedly was unhappy at having to change the eagle,{{sfn|Ike Group|p=58}} described the final version as \"pleasant looking.\"{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] also feared that the eagle's expression might offend, and sought a neutral visage.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The distant Earth may be seen above the bird, and there are 13 stars in honor of the original states.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}

Bowers deems the bust of Eisenhower \"well modeled\" by Gasparro, and notes that the fact that the eagle on the reverse holds only an olive branch, rather than arrows as well (token of war), \"meant that the public would like the design.\"{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} Nevertheless, he notes that Eisenhower's stern expression was widely criticized as not typical of a man noted for geniality.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}} Numismatic author David Lange opines that \"the Eisenhower dollar is one of the poorest products to emanate from the U.S. Mint.\"{{sfn|Lange}} Lange writes that, although Gasparro had designed only one side of the coin for the Kennedy half dollar and [[Lincoln cent#Lincoln Memorial design (1959–2008)|Lincoln Memorial reverse]] for the cent, \"the Eisenhower dollar was his design alone and should have served as a showcase for his talent. Sadly, it is a mediocre design that reveals his typically unnatural treatment of Ike's hair and the eagle's feathers.\"{{sfn|Lange}} Some collectors complained after the release that the Earth was not fully shown, not realizing that Gasparro had carefully followed the mission badge. The chief engraver responded by clarifying the design.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}

==Release==
[[File:Eisenhower design.png|thumb|right|The Eisenhower dollar's design as released by the Treasury in January 1971 (probably from photographs of the galvano)]]
Two prototype dollars were struck at the [[Philadelphia Mint]] on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}} However, collectors have found at least two 1971-S coins that have been certified as prototypes.<ref>[http://www.ikegroup.info/chapter34/chapter34.pdf THE LYDSTON AND CHATHAM 1971-S PROTOTYPE IKES]</ref>  Striking such large pieces of tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier [[reducing lathe]] to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore at least some of the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief.{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58–59}} This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=6–7}} Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2860, 2864}} The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the [[San Francisco Mint]]) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to [[David Eisenhower]] (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.{{sfn|''The Press-Courier''|April 1, 1971}}

On January 29, 1971, the Mint announced the prices for the 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced [[proof coinage|proof pieces]], with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer. Order forms for the public were shipped to 44,000 post offices and 33,000 banks, with instructions not to hand them out until June 18. The Mint returned some orders for being sent in too early.{{sfn|Bailey|p=94}} [[United States Mint coin sets|Mint sets]] of the circulating coinage for 1971 did not include the Eisenhower dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2860}}

The first proof strikes, at San Francisco, took place in July.{{sfn|Bailey|p=94}} The proof pieces were sold in a plastic holder inside a brown box with a gold eagle seal; the uncirculated silver pieces were encased in pliofilm inside a blue envelope. These were dubbed \"brown Ikes\" and \"blue Ikes\" and are still known by those terms.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2866}} On July 27, 1971, President Nixon presented the first piece to be struck to Mamie Eisenhower at a White House ceremony.{{sfn|Toledo ''Blade''|July 28, 1971}} Sales of the 40% silver pieces were ended on October 8; the first proof coins were mailed to collectors on October 14, President Eisenhower's birthday.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}}

The clad circulation strikes of the Eisenhower dollar, the largest clad coin ever issued by the US Mint,{{sfn|Morgan}} were available to the general public through banks beginning on November 1, 1971. Many were hoarded by collectors; there was initially sufficient demand for the coins that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to purchase rolls in search of better specimens. An oily film was found on a large number of the coins; these coins were cleaned by collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}{{sfn|''Youngstown Vindicator''|November 4, 1971}}

Though there was initially strong
public interest in the new dollar, from the very start the coin still failed to circulate. In 1976, a Treasury study done in conjunction with a private-sector firm found that the Eisenhower dollar had a near-100 percent attrition rate, that is, almost always, a coin was used in only one transaction, and then stopped circulating (by comparison, the attrition rate of the quarter was close to zero). This was because of the coin's bulky size and weight, and the lack of potential uses for it.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=40}} Even so, it was successful in quickly replacing private-issue tokens in Nevada casinos.{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} According to numismatist Randy Camper, over 70% of \"circulating\" Eisenhower dollars were used in casinos.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}}<!-- Essay by Camper in volume --> Although the vending machine industry lobbied for the Eisenhower dollar, few machines were modified to accept the coins.{{sfn|Herbert}} Lange recalled, \"The fact is that these coins never circulated outside of casinos and nearby areas, and I don't recall ever seeing a vending machine that accepted them.\"{{sfn|Lange}}

==Production==
===Early years (1971–1974)===
[[File:1973-S Blue Ike.jpg|thumb|right|1973-S \"blue Ike\": envelope, pliofilm coin holder, and printed insert]]
The Mint struck over 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than doubling its largest annual production for a dollar coin. Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what ''CoinAge'' magazine termed \"near-heroic measures on the part of the Mint\", the piece did not circulate.{{sfn|CoinAge May 1979}}  In a 1974 article for ''[[COINage]]'', numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, \"the circulation value of the coin has been nil\".{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2870}} Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 24, 1971}} More than 11 million of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2866}} In May 1972, Treasury Secretary [[John Connally]], testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as \"just unconscionable\", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.{{sfn|Toledo ''Blade''|May 11, 1972}}

The 1972 silver pieces were again struck at San Francisco. Sales dropped considerably, to just under 2.2 million specimens in uncirculated and 1.8 million in proof.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2874}} The part-silver 1972-S Eisenhower dollars were available for sale by mail order, with the ordering period from May 1 to July 15 for the proof coins and August 1 to October 16 for the uncirculated version.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}}

With ample supplies of Eisenhower dollars, the Federal Reserve had no need to order any in 1973, and none were struck for circulation.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 2, 1973}} The 1973 and 1973-D were the first Eisenhower dollars struck for inclusion in mint sets, and were, in theory, only available that way. Over the years, many 1973 and 1973-D dollar coins have been found in circulation, leading to speculation that the 230,798 pieces which were reported melted after the Mint failed to sell as many mint sets as anticipated, were released into circulation.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2877, 2880}} John Wexler, Bill Crawford, and Kevin Flynn, in their volume on Eisenhower dollars, deny this, citing a 1974 letter from Assistant Director of the Mint for Public Services Roy C. Cahoon, which stated that all 1973 Eisenhower dollars from unsold mint sets were melted.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}} The 1973-S was struck for inclusion in base-metal proof sets, as well as for the regular \"blue Ikes\" and \"brown Ikes\". Sales of the part-silver pieces dipped to a total of just under 2.9 million. The coin was struck again for circulation in 1974, was included in mint sets and proof sets, and was available in proof and uncirculated silver clad from San Francisco.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=464}}{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=344, 349}} Congress ordered that some of the money from the sale of 1974-S silver pieces be used to support [[Eisenhower College]] in [[Seneca Falls, New York]]. Coin collectors felt that this set a bad precedent, but about $9 million was paid to the college between 1974 and 1978;{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}} yet, despite the infusion of money, the college closed its doors in 1982.{{sfn|Lange|p=24}}

The United States had issued commemorative coins between 1892 and 1954, as a means for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.{{sfn|Breen|1988|pp=581–582}}

The American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) was established by Congress in 1966 as an oversight body for the 1976 two-hundredth anniversary of American independence (the \"Bicentennial\"). In 1970, its coins and medals advisory committee recommended the issuance of a special half dollar, and subsequently the committee sought the temporary redesign of circulating American coins. Brooks and the Mint initially opposed legislation to effect these proposals, but eventually Brooks supported legislation to redesign the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar coins, and to issue special collector's sets in silver clad. Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975 and before December 31, 1976 would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776–1976. A total of 15 million sets (45 million) coins in all would be struck in silver clad for sale to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=371}}{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=502}}{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=422}}

The reverse designs for the three Bicentennial coins were determined by a design competition open to the public. This competition closed in January 1974, and in March, a design submitted by 22-year-old art student Dennis R. Williams was selected for the dollar. Williams, the youngest person to that point to design a U.S. coin, had submitted a design depicting the [[Liberty Bell]] superimposed against the Moon. Gasparro slightly modified the design, simplifying the features visible on the lunar surface, and altering the lettering and the bell.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=424}} Williams and the designers of the other denominations operated the presses to strike the first coins on August 12, 1974; a set of these prototypes was later given to the new president, [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=472}}{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|pp=424–425}} Williams' design was liked by the public but attracted criticism from some numismatists as the Liberty Bell had been previously used on coinage (for example, on the [[Franklin half dollar]]).{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}} Fearing that a low-mintage 1975 piece would be hoarded, the Mint obtained legislation in December 1974 allowing it to continue coining 1974-dated pieces until it began coinage of Bicentennial pieces.{{sfn|Ganz|1976|pp=66–68}}

The Bicentennial dollars were the first of the three denominations to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=10}} The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975.{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=503}} The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof sets are Type I; all those included in 1976 proof sets are Type II.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=8}}{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=232–233}}{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=42}} The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2897}} Over 220 million were struck.{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|p=233}} The Bicentennial design was not used after 1976;{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2852, 2854}} sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=542}}

One proof Bicentennial coin in silver clad and lacking a mint mark, similar to the dollar in the prototype set given to President Ford, is known. This piece supposedly came from a cash register drawer at the [[Woodward & Lothrop]] department store in Washington, D.C. Thomas K. DeLorey, who was then a reporter for ''[[Coin World]]'', spoke to the discoverer and was suspicious of the story, thinking it more likely the coin was surreptitiously obtained from the government. He declined to question the origin then, fearing it might be seized and, therefore, not available to numismatists. The piece brought almost $30,000 by private sale in 1987.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2901}}

===Final years and replacement (1977–1978)===
{{Main|Susan B. Anthony dollar}}

By 1975, the Treasury was concerned about the drain on resources from striking the dollar, which did not circulate. It engaged a private firm to study the six current denominations of U.S. coinage, and make recommendations. The firm concluded in its report that the Eisenhower dollar was too large and heavy to circulate effectively, but if the diameter was reduced by about a third, and the weight by two-thirds, it might be used.{{sfn|CoinAge May 1979}} That report found that \"the Eisenhower dollar has not been widely accepted by the public because of its large size and weight\".{{sfn|Logan July 1979|p=42}} In January 1977, just prior to leaving office, Ford's Treasury Secretary, [[William E. Simon]], proposed the elimination of the cent and half dollar, and a reduction in size of the dollar.{{sfn|Ganz October 1979|p=44}} According to Bowers, the Treasury had come to believe that a coin as large as the Eisenhower dollar simply would not circulate in the United States.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2954}}

The Mint struck pattern pieces of the smaller size, with various shapes and compositions. An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have differentiated it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition. Gasparro prepared, for the circulating pieces, a design showing [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] with flowing hair, similar to early American coins.{{sfn|Logan July 1979|p=46}}

As the Eisenhower dollar awaited its demise, approximately 50 million per year were struck, using the eagle design for the reverse. In both years, the majority coined were at Denver. No silver collector's edition was issued; the blue and brown Ikes ended with 1974.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2914–2927}}

The new Treasury Secretary, [[Michael Blumenthal]], supported Gasparro's design in testimony before Congress; Wisconsin Senator [[William Proxmire]] dubbed Blumenthal's position a \"cop-out\".{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2929}} Proxmire refused to introduce the bill, which would have left the choice of design up to Blumenthal or his successor, instead introducing his own legislation to commemorate early women's rights leader [[Susan B. Anthony]].{{sfn|Ganz July 1979|pp=49, 52}} Many in the new Congress and in the Carter Administration were social progressives, and supported [[women's lib]]. Ohio Representative [[Mary Rose Oakar]] also introduced legislation for a [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] in October 1978; it proceeded rapidly through [[95th United States Congress|Congress]] and was signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Gasparro was given photographs of Anthony and told to reproduce her appearance exactly on the coin. Anthony's stern expression caused some to dub it the \"Susan B. Agony\" dollar. The Eisenhower dollar's reverse was used for the Anthony dollar. Convinced that the public would hoard the new pieces, the Mint Bureau produced half a billion before its official release to the public on July 2, 1979. It need not have worried; the public quickly rejected the new coin as too close in size and weight to the quarter dollar, and production for circulation ceased after 1980.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2929–2930}} Mint Director [[Stella Hackel Sims]] stated, \"people are accustomed to the Eisenhower dollar, but in time, they'll become accustomed to the Susan\".{{sfn|Logan October 1979|p=101}} Attempts were made to give the new smaller dollars out as change in postal transactions, and to force their use by U.S. military personnel in Europe; both failed.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2930}}

Collected by date and mint mark, no Eisenhower dollar is rare, and a complete set may be acquired without difficulty. However, many were badly struck, without full detail, especially in 1971 and 1972, and most pieces acquired nicks, scratches or \"bag marks\" from contact with each other soon after striking. Although lower-grade silver coins can be melted, this is not practical for Eisenhower dollars due to the lack of precious metal content, and dealers often try to get any premium they can on face value. Completing a set of highest-grade specimens may be difficult and expensive, especially for the 1971 and 1972 from Philadelphia or Denver, which were not sold in mint sets, and thus only came to collectors through banks.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2858}} A 1973-D piece, tied with ten other specimens for the finest known of that date and mint mark in near-pristine [[coin grading|MS-67]] condition sold in June 2013 for $12,925. According to numismatic writer Steve Reach, \"as more people submit modern-era coins like Eisenhower dollars for third-party certification, the true rarity of many issues in top-grades is becoming clear.\"{{sfn|Reach}}

Some of the 1971-D pieces exhibit a variety in which (among several differences) the eagle lacks brow lines, these have been dubbed by Eisenhower dollar specialists the \"Friendly Eagle Pattern\".{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58–59}} The 1972 dollar struck at Philadelphia is broken down into three varieties, which were made as Gasparro adjusted the design to take advantage of better steel being used in the Mint's dies. A midyear change in the design was announced by Brooks at the [[American Numismatic Association]]'s 1972 convention in New Orleans, although she did not state exactly what was being changed. The three varieties may be differentiated by examining the depiction of the Earth on the reverse. Type I dollars show the Earth somewhat flattened, Florida pointing to the southeast, with the islands mostly to the southeast of the tip of the peninsula. The Earth is round and Florida points to the south on the Type II, with a single, large island to the southeast. The Type III is similar to the Type II, except that there are two islands directly to the south of the peninsula.{{sfn|1972 varieties}} The Type II is from a single reverse die, used in March 1972, and erroneously placed in service at Philadelphia—it is identical to and should have been used for the silver proof strikes at San Francisco. The Type III was placed in service, replacing the Type I, in September 1972.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=7}} The Type I is most common; the Type III design was used in 1973 and after. The 1972 Type II is expensive in top grades, as is the 1776–1976 Type I from Philadelphia, which was only available in mint sets.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Hicks|p=644}}

Some 1971-S proof pieces (and a few uncirculated 1971-S) have the [[serif]]s at the foot of the \"R\" in \"LIBERTY\" missing; this is dubbed the \"peg leg\" variety.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}} The serifs are missing on all 1972-S, both uncirculated and proof. After the Mint obtained better steel for dies, the serifs returned for all of the remaining non-Bicentennial coinage, from all mints, though the leg of the R was shortened, and also for the Type II Bicentennial (the Type I lacks serifs on the R). Gasparro was often trying to improve the detail of Eisenhower's head during the coin's tenure, and as the R is the letter closest to it, these changes were most likely made in an effort to improve the flow of metal as the coins were struck.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=182–184}}

In 1974 and again in 1977, the [[Denver Mint]] struck a small number of pieces on silver-clad planchets, or blanks. Both times, these came from planchets which had been shipped from the San Francisco Assay Office to Denver. The first ones in 1974 were found independently by two Las Vegas blackjack dealers.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2852, 2890, 2917}} The 1974 planchets were initially intended to be used for \"brown Ike\" proof strikings; Mint policy then was that rejected silver proof planchets were to be used for uncirculated \"blue Ikes\", but these were placed in the bin for rejected copper-nickel proof planchets, intended to be shipped to be coined for circulation at Denver. The 1977 pieces resulted from pieces rejected for Bicentennial silver proof use, which were again placed in the wrong bin (they should have been melted, as the Mint was no longer striking silver uncirculated Eisenhower dollars). Between 10 and 20 of each date are known. Wexler, Crawford, and Flynn report an even rarer 1776–1976-D dollar in silver, but state that none have been offered at auction or submitted to the major coin grading services.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=8}}

Bowers notes that the [[Morgan dollar]] (struck between 1878 and 1921) was not widely collected at the time, only to become very popular later, and suggests that one day, the turn of the Eisenhower dollar will come.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2857}} Numismatist Charles Morgan said of the Eisenhower dollar in 2012,

{{quote |
It stands today as the greatest achievement in clad coinage in U.S. history. It was the most technically challenging coin ever attempted&nbsp; ... Researching the Eisenhower Dollar is vital for numismatic historians who want to understand what the post-silver era was like. The Eisenhower Dollar was a noble failure. In this respect, it truly is a perfect collectible coin.{{sfn|Morgan}}

The '''Angevins''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|dʒ|ɪ|v|ɪ|n|z}}; \"from [[Anjou]]\") were a royal house of French origin that ruled England in the 12th and early 13th centuries; its monarchs were [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. In the 10 years from 1144, two successive [[count of Anjou|counts of Anjou]] in France, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] and his son, the future Henry II, won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western Europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as the [[Angevin Empire]]. As a political entity this was structurally different from the preceding [[House of Normandy|Norman]] and subsequent [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] realms. Geoffrey became [[Duke of Normandy]] in 1144 and died in 1151. In 1152 his heir, Henry, added Aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Henry also inherited the claim of his mother, [[Empress Matilda]], the daughter of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], to the English throne, to which he succeeded in 1154 following the death of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=1}}</ref>

Henry was succeeded by his third son, [[Richard I of England|Richard]], whose reputation for martial prowess won him the epithet \"{{lang|fr|Cœur de Lion}}\" or \"Lionheart\".<ref name=\"Turner & Heiser 71\">{{harvnb|Turner|Heiser|2000|p=71}}</ref> He was born and raised in England but spent very little time there during his adult life, perhaps as little as six months. Despite this Richard remains an enduring [[icon]]ic figure both in England and in France, and is one of very few kings of England remembered by his nickname as opposed to [[regnal number]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|1948|p=58}}.</ref>

When Richard died, his brother John – Henry's fifth and only surviving son – took the throne. In 1204 John lost much of the Angevins' continental territories, including Anjou, to the French crown. He and his successors were still recognized as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|dukes of Aquitaine]]. The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the rationale behind John's son, [[Henry III of England]], being considered the first [[Plantagenet]] {{ndash}} a name derived from the nickname of his great-grandfather, Geoffrey. Where no distinction is made between the Angevins{{mdash}}and Angevin era{{mdash}}and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king.<ref>{{harvnb| Blockmans|Hoppenbrouwers |2014|p=173}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=15–23}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|2007|pp=85–86}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1991|pp=228–229}}</ref> From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] before dividing into two competing [[cadet branch]]es, the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]].

== Terminology ==

===Angevin===
The adjective Angevin is especially used in English history to refer to the kings who were also counts of Anjou{{mdash}}beginning with Henry II{{mdash}}descended from Geoffrey and Matilda; their characteristics, descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid-twelfth to early-thirteenth centuries. In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou, or any sovereign, government derived from this. As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler. As such Angevin is also used for other [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou]]; including the three kings' ancestors, their cousins who held the crown of [[King of Jerusalem#House of Anjou|Jerusalem]] and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and the [[Valois House of Anjou]].<ref>{{OED|Angevin}}</ref>

===Angevin Empire===

The term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined in 1887 by [[Kate Norgate]]. As far as it is known there was no contemporary name for this assemblage of territories which were referred to{{mdash}}if at all{{mdash}}by clumsy circumlocutions such as ''our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be'' or ''the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father''. Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial. In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term ''espace Plantagenet'' was acceptable.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=2–5}}</ref>

==Origins==

[[Image:The Children of Henry2 England.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=An illuminated diagram showing the Angevins; coloured lines connect the two to show the lineal descent|Thirteenth-century depiction of the Angevins ([[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his legitimate children): (''left to right'') [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]] and [[John, King of England|John]]]]
The Angevins descend from [[Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais]] and [[Ermengarde of Anjou, Duchess of Burgundy|Ermengarde of Anjou]]. In 1060 this couple inherited, via [[cognatic kinship]], the county of Anjou from an older line dating from 870 and a noble called [[Ingelger]].<ref name=Davies1997p190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref><ref name=\"vauchezsixtyfive\">{{harvnb|Vauchez|2000|p=65}}</ref> The marriage of Count Geoffrey to Matilda, the only surviving legitimate child of [[Henry I of England]], was part of a struggle for power during the tenth and eleventh centuries among the lords of [[Normandy]], [[Brittany]], [[Poitou]], [[Blois]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and the kings of France. It was from this marriage that Geoffrey's son, Henry, inherited the claims to England, Normandy and Anjou that marks the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.<ref name=Gillingham7>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=7}}</ref>  This was the third attempt by Geoffrey's father [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V]] to build a political alliance with Normandy. The first was by marrying his daughter [[Matilda of Anjou|Matilda]] to Henry's heir [[William Adelin]], who drowned in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]''. Fulk then married his daughter [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]] to [[William Clito]], heir to Henry's older brother [[Robert Curthose]], but Henry had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to his lands.<ref name=Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}</ref>

==Inheritance custom and Angevin practice==

As society became more prosperous and stable in the 11th century, inheritance customs developed  that allowed daughters (in the absence of sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph de Diceto]] noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=7–8}}</ref> The marriage of Geoffrey to the daughter of a king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context.  It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito's rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]] or [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]] who in the event did seize King Henry's English crown. King Henry's great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as \"the heir to the Kingdom\", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother, [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=10–12}}</ref>

According to [[William of Newburgh]] writing in the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey's early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the paternal and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=18}}</ref> Henry's brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 21\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=21}}</ref>

The unity of Henry's assemblage of domains was largely dependent on the ruling family, influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure. The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation. Indeed, if Henry II's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young, the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered. Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together. For example, in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John. This was complicated by the Angevins' being subjects of the kings of France, who felt these feudal rights of homage and the right of allegiance more legally belonged to them. This was particularly true when the wardship of Geoffrey's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204. On the Young King's death in 1183, Richard became heir in chief, but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance. More by accident than design this meant that, while Richard inherited the patrimony, John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany. By the mid-thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an ''Angevin Empire'' as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=119–121}}</ref>

[[File:France 1154-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Multi-coloured map of 12th-century France and southern England|Henry's continental holdings in 1154, showing the lands known as the Angevin Empire in shades of red.]]
Henry I of England named his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] heir; but when he died in 1135 Matilda was far from England in Anjou or Maine, while her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] was closer in Boulogne, giving him the advantage he needed to race to England and have himself crowned and anointed king of England.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=13}}</ref>  Matilda's husband Geoffrey, though he had little interest in England, commenced a long struggle for the duchy of Normandy.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=7}}.</ref> To create a second front Matilda landed in England during 1139 to challenge Stephen, instigating the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. In 1141 she captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|battle of Lincoln]], prompting the collapse of his support.  While Geoffrey pushed on with the conquest of Normandy over the next four years, Matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory. She was even forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], allowing Stephen to resume control of much of England. Geoffrey never visited England to offer practical assistance but instead sent Henry as a male figurehead{{mdash}}beginning in 1142 when Henry was only 9{{mdash}}with a view that if England was conquered it would be Henry that would become king. In 1150 Geoffrey also transferred the title of Duke of Normandy to Henry but retained the dominant role in governance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=15–18}}</ref> Three fortuitous events allowed Henry to finally bring the conflict to a successful conclusion:
* In 1151 Count Geoffrey died before having time to complete his plan to divide his inheritance between his sons Henry and [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], who would have received England and Anjou respectively.
* [[Louis VII of France]] divorced [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] whom Henry quickly married, greatly increasing his resources and power with the acquisition of [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].
* In 1153 Stephen's son [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] died. The disheartened Stephen, who had also recently been widowed, gave up the fight and, with the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], repeated the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142: Stephen would be king for life, Henry his successor, preserving Stephen's second son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]]'s rights to his family estates. Stephen did not live long and so Henry inherited in late 1154.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=19–20}}</ref>

Henry faced many challenges to secure possession of his father's and grandfathers’ lands that required the reassertion and extension of old suzerainties.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=23}}</ref>  In 1162 [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], died, and Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish what he saw as his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend [[Thomas Becket]] to succeed him.  Instead, Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors.  Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly: over church tenures, Henry's brother's marriage and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket, and other members of the English episcopate, to recognise sixteen ancient customs{{mdash}}governing relations between the king, his courts, and the church{{mdash}}in writing for the first time in the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to Becket's time as chancellor. In response Becket fled into exile for five years. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry's son as [[coregent]] by the [[Archbishop of York]] as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. When he heard the news, Henry said: \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk.\" Three of Henry's men killed Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him. Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death. The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry a pariah, so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks.<ref>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=142}}</ref>

In 1171 Henry invaded Ireland to assert his overlordship following alarm at the success of knights he had allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales who had assumed the role of colonisers and accrued autonomous power, including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given Henry a papal [[Laudabiliter|blessing]] to expand his power into Ireland to reform the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=53}}.</ref>  Originally this would have allowed some territory to be granted to Henry's brother, William, but other matters had distracted Henry and William was now dead. Instead Henry's designs were made plain when he gave the lordship of Ireland to his youngest son, John.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=28–29}}</ref>

In 1172 Henry II tried to give his landless youngest son John a wedding gift of the three castles  of [[Château de Chinon|Chinon]], [[Loudun]] and [[Mirebeau]]. This angered the 18-year-old Young King who had yet to receive any lands from his father and prompted a [[Revolt of 1173–1174|rebellion]] by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons. [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] supported the rebellion to destabilise Henry II. [[William the Lion]] and other subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt and it took 18 months for Henry to force the rebels to submit to his authority.<ref name=Jones2012p82>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=82–92}}</ref> In Le Mans in 1182, Henry II gathered his children to plan a [[partible inheritance]] in which his eldest son (also called Henry) would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; [[Richard I of England|Richard]] the Duchy of Aquitaine; [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] Brittany, and John Ireland. This degenerated into further conflict. [[Henry the Young King|The younger Henry]] rebelled again before he died of [[dysentery]] and, in 1186, Geoffrey died after a tournament accident. In 1189 Richard and [[Philip II of France]] took advantage of Henry's failing health and forced him to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard as his sole heir.<ref name=Jones2012p109>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=109}}</ref> Two days later the old king died, defeated and miserable in the knowledge that even his favoured son John had rebelled. This fate was seen as the price he paid for the murder of Beckett.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=40}}</ref>

[[File:Seal - Richard I of England.jpg|thumb|alt=Man on horseback, wielding a sword|[[Richard I of England|King Richard I]]'s [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] of 1189.

Opinions of Richard by his contemporaries varied. He had rejected and humiliated the king of France's sister; deposed the king of Cyprus and sold the island; insulted and refused to give spoils from the Third Crusade to [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]], and allegedly arranged the assassination of [[Conrad of Montferrat]]. His cruelty was exemplified by the massacre of 2,600 prisoners in Acre.<ref name=Jones2012p128>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=128}}</ref> However, Richard was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners. Despite victories in the [[Third Crusade]] he failed to capture Jerusalem, retreating from the Holy Land with a small band of followers.<ref name=\"rich\">{{harvnb|Carlton|2003|p=42}}</ref>

Richard was captured by Leopold on his return journey.

His failure to produce an heir caused a succession crisis. Anjou, Brittany, Maine and Touraine chose Richard's nephew [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]] as heir, while John succeeded in England and Normandy. Philip II of France again destabilised the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland, supporting his vassal Arthur's claim to the English crown. Eleanor supported her son John, who was victorious at the [[Battle of Mirebeau]] and captured the rebel leadership.<ref name=Turnet1994p100>{{harvnb|Turner|1994|pp=100}}</ref>

Arthur was murdered (allegedly by John), and his sister [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]] would spend the rest of her life in captivity. John's behaviour drove a number of French barons to side with Philip, and the resulting rebellions by Norman and Angevin barons ended John's control of his continental possessions—the ''de facto'' end of the Angevin Empire, although Henry III would maintain his claim until 1259.<ref name=Jones2012p161>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=161–169}}</ref>

After re-establishing his authority in England, John planned to retake Normandy and Anjou by drawing the French from Paris while another army (under [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]) attacked from the north. However, his allies were defeated at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in one of the most decisive battles in French history.<ref name=Favier>{{harvnb|Favier|1993|p=176}}</ref><ref name=Contramine>{{harvnb|Contramine|1992|p=83}}</ref> John's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown, with John agreeing to a five-year truce.

John's French defeats weakened his position in England. The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in ''[[Magna Carta]]'', which limited royal power and established [[common law]].

==Legacy==

===House of Plantagenet===

Historians use the period of Prince Louis's invasion to mark the end of the Angevin period and the beginning of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] dynasty. The outcome of the military situation was uncertain at John's death; William Marshall saved the dynasty, forcing Louis to renounce his claim with a military victory.<ref name=Jones221/> However, Philip had captured all the Angevin possessions in France except [[Gascony]]. This collapse had several causes, including long-term changes in economic power, growing cultural differences between England and Normandy and (in particular) the fragile, familial nature of Henry's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=31}}</ref> Henry III continued his attempts to reclaim Normandy and Anjou until 1259, but John's continental losses and the consequent growth of [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian power]] during the 13th century marked a \"turning point in European history\".<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=270}}</ref>

[[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] adopted \"Plantagenet\" as a family name for himself and his descendants during the 15th century. ''Plantegenest'' (or ''Plante Genest'') was Geoffrey's nickname, and his emblem may have been the [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]] (''planta genista'' in medieval Latin).<ref name=plant2007>{{harvnb|Plant|2007}}</ref> It is uncertain why Richard chose the name, but it emphasised Richard's hierarchal status as Geoffrey's (and six English kings') patrilineal descendant during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The retrospective use of the name for Geoffrey's male descendants was popular during the [[Tudor period]], perhaps encouraged by the added legitimacy it gave Richard's great-grandson [[Henry VIII of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|2001|p=206}}</ref>

===Descent===
Through John, descent from the Angevins (legitimate and illegitimate) is widespread  and includes all subsequent monarchs of England and the United Kingdom. He had five legitimate children with Isabella:
* Henry III – king of England for most of the 13th century
* [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] – a noted European leader and [[King of the Romans]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=223}}</ref>
* [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Scotland|Joan]] – married [[Alexander II of Scotland]], becoming his queen consort.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=277}}</ref>
* [[Isabella of England|Isabella]] – married the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=344}}</ref>
* [[Eleanor of Leicester|Eleanor]] – married William Marshal's son (also called [[William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|William]]) and, later, English rebel [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=306}}</ref>

John also had illegitimate children with a number of mistresses, including nine sons—[[Richard FitzRoy|Richard]], Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and (probably) Philip—and three daughters—[[Joan, Lady of Wales|Joan]], Maud and (probably) Isabel.<ref>{{harvnb|Richardson|2004|p=9}}</ref> Of these Joan was the best known, since she married Prince [[Llywelyn the Great]] of Wales.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=328}}</ref>

===Contemporary opinion===
The chronicler [[Gerald of Wales]] borrowed elements of the [[Melusine]] legend to give the Angevins a demonic origin, and the kings were said to tell jokes about the stories.<ref name=Warren>{{harvnb|Warren|1978|p=2}}</ref>
[[File:Henry-eleanor-tomb.jpg|thumb|alt=Painted statues of reclining king and queen|Tomb of Henry and Eleanor in [[Fontevraud Abbey]]]]Henry was an unpopular king, and few grieved his death;<ref>{{harvnb|Strickland|2007|p=187}}</ref> William of Newburgh wrote during the 1190s, \"In his own time he was hated by almost everyone\".

Chroniclers [[Richard of Devizes]], [[William of Newburgh]], [[Roger of Hoveden]] and [[Ralph de Diceto]] were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard, but more tolerant of the earliest years of John's reign.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 2\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=2}}</ref> Accounts of the middle and later years of his reign are limited to [[Gervase of Canterbury]] and [[Ralph of Coggeshall]], neither of whom were satisfied with John's performance as king.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|2000|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=15}}</ref> His later negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death: [[Roger of Wendover]] and [[Matthew Paris]]. The latter claimed that John attempted to convert to Islam, but this is not believed by modern historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|2000|pp=11, 14}}</ref>

===Constitutional impact===
Many of the changes Henry introduced during his rule had long-term consequences. His legal innovations form part of the basis for [[English law]], with the [[Exchequer of Pleas]] a forerunner of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Bench]] at Westminster.<ref>{{harvnb|Brand|2007|p=216}}</ref> Henry's itinerant justices also influenced his contemporaries' legal reforms: Philip Augustus' creation of itinerant ''bailli'', for example, drew on Henry's model.<ref>{{harvnb|HallamEverard|2001|p=211}}</ref> Henry's intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland had a significant long-term impact on the development of their societies and governments.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1990|pp=22–23}}</ref> John's reign, despite its flaws, and his signing of ''Magna Carta'', were seen by [[Whig history|Whig historians]] as positive steps in the constitutional development of England and part of a progressive and [[Universalism|universalist]] course of political and economic development in medieval England.<ref>{{harvnb| Dyer |2009|p=4}}</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] said, \"[W]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns\".<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1958|p=190}}</ref> ''Magna Carta'' was reissued by the Marshal Protectorate and later as a foundation of future government.<ref name=DanzigerGillingham/>

===Architecture, language and literature===

[[Image:Richard1TombFntrvd.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tomb of Richard I of England and Isabella of Angoulême (at back)]]
There was no distinct Angevin or Plantagenet culture that would distinguish or set them apart from their neighbours in this period. [[Robert of Torigni]] recorded that Henry built or renovated castles throughout his domain in Normandy, England, Aquitaine, Anjou, Maine and Torraine. However this patronage had no distinctive style except in the use of circular or octagonal kitchens of the Fontevraud type. Similarly amongst the multiple vernaculars{{mdash}}French, English and [[Occitan Language|Occitan]]{{mdash}}there was not a unifying literature. [[French language|French]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the secular elite and [[Latin language|Latin]] or the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=118}}</ref>

The Angevins were closely associated with the [[Fontevraud Abbey]] in Anjou. Henry's [[Matilda of Anjou|aunt]] was [[Abbess]], Eleanor retired there to be a nun and the abbey was originally the site of his grave and those of Eleanor, Richard, his daughter [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Sicily|Joan]],  grandson [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]] and John's wife{{mdash}}[[Isabella of Angoulême]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=75}}</ref> Henry III visited the abbey in 1254 to reorder these tombs and requested his heart be buried with them.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=115}}</ref>

The book's title is in the centre and various scenes from the book are depicted around it.|[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]'' (official title ''Acts and Monuments'') viewed John's reign positively.]]According to historian [[John Gillingham]], Henry and his reign have attracted historians for many years and Richard (whose reputation has \"fluctuated wildly\")<ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=484}}</ref> is remembered largely because of his military exploits. [[Steven Runciman]], in the third volume of the ''History of the Crusades'', wrote: \"He was a bad son, a bad husband, and a bad king, but a gallant and splendid soldier.\" <ref>{{harvnb| Runciman |1954|p=484}}</ref>

Eighteenth-century historian [[David Hume]] wrote that the Angevins were pivotal in creating a genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 2\"/> Interpretations of ''Magna Carta'' and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been revised; although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, for most historians it is a failed peace agreement between factions.<ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2005|p=174}}</ref> John's opposition to the papacy and his promotion of royal rights and prerogatives won favour from 16th-century Tudors. [[John Foxe]], [[William Tyndale]] and [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] viewed John as an early Protestant hero, and Foxe included the king in his ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]''.<ref name=\"Bevington 2002 432\">{{harvnb|Bevington|2002|p=432}}</ref> [[John Speed]]'s 1632 ''Historie of Great Britaine'' praised John's \"great renown\" as king, blaming biased medieval chroniclers for the king's poor reputation.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=4}}</ref> Similarly, later [[Protestant]] historians view Henry's role in Thomas Becket's death and his disputes with the French as worthy of praise.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=3}}</ref> Similarly, increased access to contemporary records during the late [[Victorian era]] led to a recognition of Henry's contributions to the evolution of English law and the exchequer.<ref name=\"harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=10\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=10}}</ref> [[William Stubbs]] called Henry a \"legislator king\" because of his responsibility for major, long-term reforms in England; in contrast, Richard was \"a bad son, a bad husband, a selfish ruler, and a vicious man\".<ref name=\"harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=10\"/><ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|p=3}}</ref> {{Quote box

The growth of the [[British Empire]] led historian [[Kate Norgate]] to begin detailed research into Henry's continental possessions and create the term \"Angevin Empire\" during the 1880s.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=16}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=15}}</ref> However, 20th-century historians challenged many of these conclusions. During the 1950s, Jacques Boussard, John Jolliffe and others focused on the nature of Henry's \"empire\"; French scholars, in particular, analysed the mechanics of royal power during this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=19}}</ref> Anglocentric aspects of many histories of Henry's reign were challenged beginning in the 1980s, with efforts to unite British and French historical analyses of the period.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 21\"/> Detailed study of Henry's written records has cast doubt on earlier interpretations; Robert Eyton's 1878 volume (tracing Henry's itinerary by deductions from [[pipe roll]]s), for example, has been criticised for not acknowledging uncertainty.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=279–281}}</ref> Although many of Henry's [[royal charter]]s have been identified, their interpretation, the financial information in the pipe rolls and broad economic data from his reign has proven more challenging than once thought.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007|pp=286, 299}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barratt|2007|pp=248–294}}</ref> Significant gaps in the historical analysis of Henry remain, particularly about his rule in Anjou and the south of France.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=22}}</ref>

Interest in the morality of historical figures and scholars waxed during the Victorian period, leading to increased criticism of Henry's behaviour and Becket's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=5–7}}</ref> Historians relied on the judgement of  chroniclers to focus on John's ethos. Norgate wrote that John's downfall was due not to his military failures but his \"almost superhuman wickedness\", and James Ramsay blamed John's family background and innate cruelty for his downfall.<ref>{{harvnb|Norgate|1902|p=286}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ramsay|1903|p=502}}</ref>

Richard's sexuality has been controversial since the 1940s, when John Harvey challenged what he saw as \"the conspiracy of silence\" surrounding the king's [[homosexuality]] with chronicles of Richard's behaviour, two public confessions, penances and childless marriage.<ref name=\"Gillingham 1994 119–139.\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=119–139}}</ref> Opinion remains divided, with Gillingham arguing against Richard's homosexuality<ref name=\"Gillingham 1994 119–139.\"/> and Jean Flori acknowledging its possibility.<ref name=\"Gillingham 1994 119–139.\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=448}}</ref>

According to recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, although John was an unsuccessful monarch his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradbury|2007|p=353}}</ref> [[Jim Bradbury]] echoes the contemporary consensus that John was a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\" with, as Turner suggests, \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\".<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|1994|p=23}}</ref> John Gillingham (author of a biography of Richard I) agrees and judges John to be a less-effective general than Turner and Warren do. Bradbury takes a middle view, suggesting that modern historians have been overly lenient in evaluating John's flaws.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradbury|2007|p=361}}</ref> Popular historian [[Frank McLynn]] wrote that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is \"bizarre\" and, as a monarch, John \"fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set\".<ref>{{harvnb|McLynn|2007|pp=472–473}}</ref>

[[Image:BritLibRoyal14CVIIFol006rMattParisSelfPort.jpg|thumb|alt=A medieval sketch of Matthew Paris, dressed as a monk and on his hands and knees.|Matthew Paris, a historian during John's early reign]]Henry II appears as a fictionalised character in several modern plays and films. The king is a central character in [[James Goldman]]'s play ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'' (1966), depicting an imaginary encounter between Henry's family and Philip Augustus over Christmas 1183 at [[Chinon]]. Philip's strong character contrasts with John, an \"effete weakling\".<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2011|pp=109–110}}</ref> In the [[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|1968 film]], Henry is a sacrilegious, fiery and determined king.<ref>{{harvnb| Martinson |2007|p=263}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb| Palmer |2007|p=46}}</ref> Henry also appears in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s play ''[[Becket]]'', which was [[Becket (1964 film)|filmed in 1964]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anouilh|2005|p=xxiv}}</ref> The Becket conflict is the basis for [[T.

[[Image:FirstFolioKingJohn.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of the first page of Shakespeare's play \"King John\", with two columns of text below.|Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'']]
During the Tudor period, popular representations of John emerged.<ref name=\"Bevington 2002 432\"/> He appeared as a \"proto-Protestant martyr\" in the anonymous play ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]'' and [[John Bale]]'s morality play ''[[John Bale#Kynge Johan|Kynge Johan]]'', in which John attempts to save England from the \"evil agents of the Roman Church\".<ref name=\"Curren-Aquino 1989 19\">{{harvnb|Curren-Aquino|1989|p=19}}</ref> Shakespeare's anti-Catholic ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' draws on ''The Troublesome Reign'', offering a \"balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler\".<ref>{{harvnb|Curren-Aquino|1989|p=19}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bevington|2002|p=454}}</ref> [[Anthony Munday]]'s plays ''[[The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington]]'' demonstrate many of John's negative traits, but approve of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|p=70}}</ref>

Richard is the subject of two operas: in 1719 [[George Frideric Handel]] used Richard's invasion of Cyprus as the plot for ''[[Riccardo Primo]]'' and in 1784 [[André Grétry]] wrote ''[[Richard Coeur-de-lion (opera)|Richard Coeur-de-lion]]''.

====Robin Hood====

The earliest ballads of [[Robin Hood]] such as those compiled in ''[[A Gest of Robyn Hode]]'' associated the character with a king named \"Edward\" and the setting is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th or the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|DobsonTaylor|1997|pp=14–16}}</ref> As the historian [[J.C. Holt]] notes at some time around the 16th century, tales of Robin Hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of Richard, Robin being driven to outlawry during John's misrule, while in the narratives Richard was largely absent, away at the Third Crusade.<ref name=\"Holt 1982 170\">{{harvnb|Holt|1982|p=170}}</ref> Plays such as [[Robert Davenport (dramatist)|Robert Davenport]]'s ''[[King John and Matilda]]'' further developed the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] works in the mid-17th century, focussing on John's tyranny and transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Maley|2010|p=50}}</ref>  Graham Tulloch noted that unfavourable 19th-century fictionalised depictions of John were influenced by Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s historical romance ''[[Ivanhoe]]''. They, in turn, influenced the children's author [[Howard Pyle]]'s ''[[The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1883) which cast John as the principal villain of the [[Robin Hood]] narrative. During the 20th century, John also appeared in fictional books and films with Robin Hood. [[Sam De Grasse]]'s John, in the [[Robin Hood (1922 film)|1922 film version]], commits atrocities and acts of torture.<ref>{{harvnb|Aberth|2003|p=166}}</ref> [[Claude Rains]]' John, in the [[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|1938 version]] with [[Errol Flynn]], began a cinematic trend in which John was an \"effeminate&nbsp;... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|p=210}}</ref> John's character highlights Richard's virtues and contrasts with [[Guy of Gisbourne]], the \"swashbuckling villain\" opposing Robin. In the [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Disney cartoon version]], John (voiced by [[Peter Ustinov]]) is a \"cowardly, thumbsucking lion\".<ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|p=218}}</ref>

During the 13th century, a folktale developed in which Richard's minstrel [[Blondel de Nesle|Blondel]] roamed (singing a song known only to him and Richard) to find Richard's prison.<ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=191–192}}</ref> This story was the foundation of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s opera ''Richard Coeur-de-Lion'', and inspired the opening of [[Richard Thorpe]]'s film version of ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]''. Sixteenth-century tales of [[Robin Hood]] began describing him as a contemporary (and supporter) of Richard the Lionheart; Robin became an outlaw during the reign of Richard's evil brother, John, while Richard was fighting in the Third Crusade.<ref name=\"Holt 1982 170\"/>

The '''Angevins''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|dʒ|ɪ|v|ɪ|n|z}}; \"from [[Anjou]]\") were a royal house of French origin that ruled England in the 12th and early 13th centuries; its monarchs were [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] and [[John, King of England|John]]. In the 10 years from 1144, two successive [[count of Anjou|counts of Anjou]] in France, [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey]] and his son, the future Henry II, won control of a vast assemblage of lands in western Europe that would last for 80 years and would retrospectively be referred to as the [[Angevin Empire]]. As a political entity this was structurally different from the preceding [[House of Normandy|Norman]] and subsequent [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] realms. Geoffrey became [[Duke of Normandy]] in 1144 and died in 1151. In 1152 his heir, Henry, added Aquitaine by virtue of his marriage to [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]]. Henry also inherited the claim of his mother, [[Empress Matilda]], the daughter of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]], to the English throne, to which he succeeded in 1154 following the death of [[Stephen, King of England|King Stephen]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=1}}</ref>

Henry was succeeded by his third son, [[Richard I of England|Richard]], whose reputation for martial prowess won him the epithet \"{{lang|fr|Cœur de Lion}}\" or \"Lionheart\".<ref name=\"Turner & Heiser 71\">{{harvnb|Turner|Heiser|2000|p=71}}</ref> He was born and raised in England but spent very little time there during his adult life, perhaps as little as six months. Despite this Richard remains an enduring [[icon]]ic figure both in England and in France, and is one of very few kings of England remembered by his nickname as opposed to [[regnal number]].<ref>{{harvnb|Harvey|1948|p=58}}.</ref>

When Richard died, his brother John – Henry's fifth and only surviving son – took the throne. In 1204 John lost much of the Angevins' continental territories, including Anjou, to the French crown. He and his successors were still recognized as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|dukes of Aquitaine]]. The loss of Anjou from which the dynasty is named is the rationale behind John's son, [[Henry III of England]], being considered the first [[Plantagenet]] {{ndash}} a name derived from the nickname of his great-grandfather, Geoffrey. Where no distinction is made between the Angevins{{mdash}}and Angevin era{{mdash}}and subsequent English Kings, Henry II is the first Plantagenet king.<ref>{{harvnb| Blockmans|Hoppenbrouwers |2014|p=173}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=15–23}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Power|2007|pp=85–86}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warren|1991|pp=228–229}}</ref> From John the dynasty continued successfully and unbroken in the senior male line until the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] before dividing into two competing [[cadet branch]]es, the [[House of Lancaster]] and the [[House of York]].

== Terminology ==

===Angevin===
The adjective Angevin is especially used in English history to refer to the kings who were also counts of Anjou{{mdash}}beginning with Henry II{{mdash}}descended from Geoffrey and Matilda; their characteristics, descendants and the period of history which they covered from the mid-twelfth to early-thirteenth centuries. In addition it is also used pertaining to Anjou, or any sovereign, government derived from this. As a noun it is used for any native of Anjou or Angevin ruler. As such Angevin is also used for other [[Counts and Dukes of Anjou]]; including the three kings' ancestors, their cousins who held the crown of [[King of Jerusalem#House of Anjou|Jerusalem]] and unrelated later members of the French royal family who were granted the titles to form different dynasties amongst which were the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] and the [[Valois House of Anjou]].<ref>{{OED|Angevin}}</ref>

===Angevin Empire===

The term \"Angevin Empire\" was coined in 1887 by [[Kate Norgate]]. As far as it is known there was no contemporary name for this assemblage of territories which were referred to{{mdash}}if at all{{mdash}}by clumsy circumlocutions such as ''our kingdom and everything subject to our rule whatever it may be'' or ''the whole of the kingdom which had belonged to his father''. Whereas the Angevin part of this term has proved uncontentious the empire portion has proved controversial. In 1986 a convention of historical specialists concluded that there had been no Angevin state and no empire but the term ''espace Plantagenet'' was acceptable.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|pp=2–5}}</ref>

==Origins==

[[Image:The Children of Henry2 England.jpg|thumb|right|350px|alt=An illuminated diagram showing the Angevins; coloured lines connect the two to show the lineal descent|Thirteenth-century depiction of the Angevins ([[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his legitimate children): (''left to right'') [[William IX, Count of Poitiers|William]], [[Henry the Young King|Henry]], [[Richard I of England|Richard]], [[Matilda of England, Duchess of Saxony|Matilda]], [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]], [[Eleanor of England, Queen of Castile|Eleanor]], [[Joan of England, Queen of Sicily|Joan]] and [[John, King of England|John]]]]
The Angevins descend from [[Geoffrey II, Count of Gâtinais]] and [[Ermengarde of Anjou, Duchess of Burgundy|Ermengarde of Anjou]]. In 1060 this couple inherited, via [[cognatic kinship]], the county of Anjou from an older line dating from 870 and a noble called [[Ingelger]].<ref name=Davies1997p190>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|p=190}}</ref><ref name=\"vauchezsixtyfive\">{{harvnb|Vauchez|2000|p=65}}</ref> The marriage of Count Geoffrey to Matilda, the only surviving legitimate child of [[Henry I of England]], was part of a struggle for power during the tenth and eleventh centuries among the lords of [[Normandy]], [[Brittany]], [[Poitou]], [[Blois]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and the kings of France. It was from this marriage that Geoffrey's son, Henry, inherited the claims to England, Normandy and Anjou that marks the beginning of the Angevin and Plantagenet dynasties.<ref name=Gillingham7>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=7}}</ref>  This was the third attempt by Geoffrey's father [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk V]] to build a political alliance with Normandy. The first was by marrying his daughter [[Matilda of Anjou|Matilda]] to Henry's heir [[William Adelin]], who drowned in the wreck of the ''[[White Ship]]''. Fulk then married his daughter [[Sibylla of Anjou|Sibylla]] to [[William Clito]], heir to Henry's older brother [[Robert Curthose]], but Henry had the marriage annulled to avoid strengthening William's rival claim to his lands.<ref name=Davies1999p309>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=309}}</ref>

==Inheritance custom and Angevin practice==

As society became more prosperous and stable in the 11th century, inheritance customs developed  that allowed daughters (in the absence of sons) to succeed to principalities as well as landed estates. The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph de Diceto]] noted that the counts of Anjou extended their dominion over their neighbours by marriage rather than conquest.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=7–8}}</ref> The marriage of Geoffrey to the daughter of a king (and widow of an emperor) occurred in this context.  It is unknown whether King Henry intended to make Geoffrey his heir, but it is known that the threat presented by William Clito's rival claim to the duchy of Normandy made his negotiating position very weak. Even so, it is probable that, should the marriage be childless, King Henry would have attempted to be succeeded by one of his Norman kinsmen such as [[Theobald II, Count of Champagne]] or [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]] who in the event did seize King Henry's English crown. King Henry's great relief in 1133 at the birth of a son to the couple, described as \"the heir to the Kingdom\", is understandable in the light of this situation. Following this the birth of a second son raised the question of whether custom would be followed with the maternal inheritance passing to first born and the paternal inheritance going to his brother, [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=10–12}}</ref>

According to [[William of Newburgh]] writing in the 1190s, the plan failed because of Geoffrey's early death in 1151. The dying Geoffrey decided that Henry would have the paternal and maternal inheritances while he needed the resources to overcome Stephen, and left instructions that his body would not be buried until Henry swore an oath that once England and Normandy were secured the younger Geoffrey would have Anjou.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=18}}</ref> Henry's brother Geoffrey died in 1154, too soon to receive Anjou, but not before being installed count in Nantes after Henry aided a rebellion by its citizens against their previous lord.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 21\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=21}}</ref>

The unity of Henry's assemblage of domains was largely dependent on the ruling family, influencing the opinion of most historians that this instability made it unlikely to endure. The French custom of partible inheritance at the time would lead to political fragmentation. Indeed, if Henry II's sons Henry the Young King and Geoffrey of Brittany had not died young, the inheritance of 1189 would have been fundamentally altered. Henry and Richard both planned for partition on their deaths while attempting to provide overriding sovereignty to hold the lands together. For example, in 1173 and 1183 Henry tried to force Richard to acknowledge allegiance to his older brother for the duchy of Aquitaine and later Richard would confiscate Ireland from John. This was complicated by the Angevins' being subjects of the kings of France, who felt these feudal rights of homage and the right of allegiance more legally belonged to them. This was particularly true when the wardship of Geoffrey's son Arthur and lordship of Brittany was contended between 1202 and 1204. On the Young King's death in 1183, Richard became heir in chief, but refused to give up Aquitaine to give John an inheritance. More by accident than design this meant that, while Richard inherited the patrimony, John would become lord of Ireland and Arthur would be duke of Brittany. By the mid-thirteenth century there was a clear unified patrimony and Plantagenet empire but this cannot be called an ''Angevin Empire'' as by this date Anjou and most of the continental lands had been lost.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=119–121}}</ref>

[[File:France 1154-en.svg|thumb|right|alt=Multi-coloured map of 12th-century France and southern England|Henry's continental holdings in 1154, showing the lands known as the Angevin Empire in shades of red.]]
Henry I of England named his daughter [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]] heir; but when he died in 1135 Matilda was far from England in Anjou or Maine, while her cousin [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] was closer in Boulogne, giving him the advantage he needed to race to England and have himself crowned and anointed king of England.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=13}}</ref>  Matilda's husband Geoffrey, though he had little interest in England, commenced a long struggle for the duchy of Normandy.<ref name=\"Grant\">{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=7}}.</ref> To create a second front Matilda landed in England during 1139 to challenge Stephen, instigating the civil war known as [[the Anarchy]]. In 1141 she captured Stephen at the [[Battle of Lincoln (1141)|battle of Lincoln]], prompting the collapse of his support.  While Geoffrey pushed on with the conquest of Normandy over the next four years, Matilda threw away her position through arrogance and inability to be magnanimous in victory. She was even forced to release Stephen in a hostage exchange for her half-brother [[Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester]], allowing Stephen to resume control of much of England. Geoffrey never visited England to offer practical assistance but instead sent Henry as a male figurehead{{mdash}}beginning in 1142 when Henry was only 9{{mdash}}with a view that if England was conquered it would be Henry that would become king. In 1150 Geoffrey also transferred the title of Duke of Normandy to Henry but retained the dominant role in governance.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=15–18}}</ref> Three fortuitous events allowed Henry to finally bring the conflict to a successful conclusion:
* In 1151 Count Geoffrey died before having time to complete his plan to divide his inheritance between his sons Henry and [[Geoffrey, Count of Nantes|Geoffrey]], who would have received England and Anjou respectively.
* [[Louis VII of France]] divorced [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] whom Henry quickly married, greatly increasing his resources and power with the acquisition of [[Duchy of Aquitaine]].
* In 1153 Stephen's son [[Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne|Eustace]] died. The disheartened Stephen, who had also recently been widowed, gave up the fight and, with the [[Treaty of Wallingford]], repeated the peace offer that Matilda had rejected in 1142: Stephen would be king for life, Henry his successor, preserving Stephen's second son [[William I, Count of Boulogne|William]]'s rights to his family estates. Stephen did not live long and so Henry inherited in late 1154.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=19–20}}</ref>

Henry faced many challenges to secure possession of his father's and grandfathers’ lands that required the reassertion and extension of old suzerainties.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=23}}</ref>  In 1162 [[Theobald of Bec|Theobald]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], died, and Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish what he saw as his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend [[Thomas Becket]] to succeed him.  Instead, Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors.  Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly: over church tenures, Henry's brother's marriage and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket, and other members of the English episcopate, to recognise sixteen ancient customs{{mdash}}governing relations between the king, his courts, and the church{{mdash}}in writing for the first time in the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]]. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to Becket's time as chancellor. In response Becket fled into exile for five years. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry's son as [[coregent]] by the [[Archbishop of York]] as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. When he heard the news, Henry said: \"What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk.\" Three of Henry's men killed Becket in [[Canterbury Cathedral]] after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him. Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death. The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry a pariah, so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks.<ref>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=142}}</ref>

In 1171 Henry invaded Ireland to assert his overlordship following alarm at the success of knights he had allowed to recruit soldiers in England and Wales who had assumed the role of colonisers and accrued autonomous power, including [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]]. [[Pope Adrian IV]] had given Henry a papal [[Laudabiliter|blessing]] to expand his power into Ireland to reform the Irish church.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=53}}.</ref>  Originally this would have allowed some territory to be granted to Henry's brother, William, but other matters had distracted Henry and William was now dead. Instead Henry's designs were made plain when he gave the lordship of Ireland to his youngest son, John.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=28–29}}</ref>

In 1172 Henry II tried to give his landless youngest son John a wedding gift of the three castles  of [[Château de Chinon|Chinon]], [[Loudun]] and [[Mirebeau]]. This angered the 18-year-old Young King who had yet to receive any lands from his father and prompted a [[Revolt of 1173–1174|rebellion]] by Henry II's wife and three eldest sons. [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] supported the rebellion to destabilise Henry II. [[William the Lion]] and other subjects of Henry II also joined the revolt and it took 18 months for Henry to force the rebels to submit to his authority.<ref name=Jones2012p82>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=82–92}}</ref> In Le Mans in 1182, Henry II gathered his children to plan a [[partible inheritance]] in which his eldest son (also called Henry) would inherit England, Normandy and Anjou; [[Richard I of England|Richard]] the Duchy of Aquitaine; [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]] Brittany, and John Ireland. This degenerated into further conflict. [[Henry the Young King|The younger Henry]] rebelled again before he died of [[dysentery]] and, in 1186, Geoffrey died after a tournament accident. In 1189 Richard and [[Philip II of France]] took advantage of Henry's failing health and forced him to accept humiliating peace terms, including naming Richard as his sole heir.<ref name=Jones2012p109>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=109}}</ref> Two days later the old king died, defeated and miserable in the knowledge that even his favoured son John had rebelled. This fate was seen as the price he paid for the murder of Beckett.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=40}}</ref>

=={{anchor|Angevin decline}}Decline==
{{Main|Richard I of England|John, King of England}}
[[File:Seal - Richard I of England.jpg|thumb|alt=Man on horseback, wielding a sword|[[Richard I of England|King Richard I]]'s [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]] of 1189. Exhibited in History Museum of Vendee.]]On the day of Richard's English coronation there was a mass slaughter of Jews, described by [[Richard of Devizes]] as a \"holocaust\".<ref name=Ackroyd2000>{{harvnb|Ackroyd|2000|p=54}}</ref> After his coronation, Richard put the Angevin Empire's affairs in order before joining the [[Third Crusade]] to the Middle East in early 1190. Opinions of Richard by his contemporaries varied. He had rejected and humiliated the king of France's sister; deposed the king of Cyprus and sold the island; insulted and refused to give spoils from the Third Crusade to [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria]], and allegedly arranged the assassination of [[Conrad of Montferrat]]. His cruelty was exemplified by the massacre of 2,600 prisoners in Acre.<ref name=Jones2012p128>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=128}}</ref> However, Richard was respected for his military leadership and courtly manners. Despite victories in the [[Third Crusade]] he failed to capture Jerusalem, retreating from the Holy Land with a small band of followers.<ref name=\"rich\">{{harvnb|Carlton|2003|p=42}}</ref>

Richard was captured by Leopold on his return journey. He was transferred to [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], and a 25-percent tax on goods and income was required to pay his 150,000-[[Mark (unit)|mark]] ransom.<ref name=Jones2012133>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=133}}</ref><ref name=Davies351>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|p=351}}</ref> Philip II of France had overrun Normandy, while [[John, King of England|John of England]] controlled much of Richard's remaining lands.<ref name=Jones2012139>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=139}}</ref> However, when Richard returned to England he forgave John and re-established his control.<ref name=Jones2012140>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=140–141}}</ref> Leaving England permanently in 1194, Richard fought Philip for five years for the return of holdings seized during his incarceration.<ref name=Jones2012145>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=145}}</ref> On the brink of victory, he was wounded by an arrow during the siege of [[Château de Châlus-Chabrol]] and died ten days later.<ref name=Jones2012146>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=146}}</ref>

His failure to produce an heir caused a succession crisis. Anjou, Brittany, Maine and Touraine chose Richard's nephew [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]] as heir, while John succeeded in England and Normandy. Philip II of France again destabilised the Plantagenet territories on the European mainland, supporting his vassal Arthur's claim to the English crown. Eleanor supported her son John, who was victorious at the [[Battle of Mirebeau]] and captured the rebel leadership.<ref name=Turnet1994p100>{{harvnb|Turner|1994|pp=100}}</ref>

Arthur was murdered (allegedly by John), and his sister [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]] would spend the rest of her life in captivity. John's behaviour drove a number of French barons to side with Philip, and the resulting rebellions by Norman and Angevin barons ended John's control of his continental possessions—the ''de facto'' end of the Angevin Empire, although Henry III would maintain his claim until 1259.<ref name=Jones2012p161>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=161–169}}</ref>

After re-establishing his authority in England, John planned to retake Normandy and Anjou by drawing the French from Paris while another army (under [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]) attacked from the north. However, his allies were defeated at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in one of the most decisive battles in French history.<ref name=Favier>{{harvnb|Favier|1993|p=176}}</ref><ref name=Contramine>{{harvnb|Contramine|1992|p=83}}</ref> John's nephew Otto retreated and was soon overthrown, with John agreeing to a five-year truce. Philip's victory was crucial to the political order in England and France, and the battle was instrumental in establishing [[absolute monarchy in France]].<ref name=Smedley1836>{{harvnb|Smedley|1836|p=72}}</ref>

[[File:Magna Carta (British Library Cotton MS Augustus II.106).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Old manuscript|One of only four surviving [[Exemplified copy|exemplifications]] of the 1215 text of ''[[Magna Carta'']] ]]

John's French defeats weakened his position in England. The rebellion of his English vassals resulted in ''[[Magna Carta]]'', which limited royal power and established [[common law]]. This would form the basis of every constitutional battle of the 13th and 14th centuries.<ref>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=217}}</ref> The barons and the crown failed to abide by ''Magna Carta'', leading to the [[First Barons' War]] when rebel barons provoked an invasion by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis]]. Many historians use John's death and William Marshall's appointment as protector of nine-year-old [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] to mark the end of the Angevin period and the beginning of the Plantagenet dynasty.<ref name=TheAngevins/> Marshall won the war with victories at [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Dover (1217)|Dover]] in 1217, leading to the [[Treaty of Lambeth]] in which Louis renounced his claims.<ref name=Jones221>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=221–222}}</ref> In victory, the Marshal Protectorate reissued ''Magna Carta'' as the basis of future government.<ref name=DanzigerGillingham>{{harvnb|Danziger|Gillingham|2003|p=271}}</ref>

==Legacy==

===House of Plantagenet===

Historians use the period of Prince Louis's invasion to mark the end of the Angevin period and the beginning of the [[House of Plantagenet|Plantagenet]] dynasty. The outcome of the military situation was uncertain at John's death; William Marshall saved the dynasty, forcing Louis to renounce his claim with a military victory.<ref name=Jones221/> However, Philip had captured all the Angevin possessions in France except [[Gascony]]. This collapse had several causes, including long-term changes in economic power, growing cultural differences between England and Normandy and (in particular) the fragile, familial nature of Henry's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|p=31}}</ref> Henry III continued his attempts to reclaim Normandy and Anjou until 1259, but John's continental losses and the consequent growth of [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian power]] during the 13th century marked a \"turning point in European history\".<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=270}}</ref>

[[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard of York]] adopted \"Plantagenet\" as a family name for himself and his descendants during the 15th century. ''Plantegenest'' (or ''Plante Genest'') was Geoffrey's nickname, and his emblem may have been the [[Cytisus scoparius|common broom]] (''planta genista'' in medieval Latin).<ref name=plant2007>{{harvnb|Plant|2007}}</ref> It is uncertain why Richard chose the name, but it emphasised Richard's hierarchal status as Geoffrey's (and six English kings') patrilineal descendant during the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The retrospective use of the name for Geoffrey's male descendants was popular during the [[Tudor period]], perhaps encouraged by the added legitimacy it gave Richard's great-grandson [[Henry VIII of England]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wagner|2001|p=206}}</ref>

===Descent===
Through John, descent from the Angevins (legitimate and illegitimate) is widespread  and includes all subsequent monarchs of England and the United Kingdom. He had five legitimate children with Isabella:
* Henry III – king of England for most of the 13th century
* [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] – a noted European leader and [[King of the Romans]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=223}}</ref>
* [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Scotland|Joan]] – married [[Alexander II of Scotland]], becoming his queen consort.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=277}}</ref>
* [[Isabella of England|Isabella]] – married the Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=344}}</ref>
* [[Eleanor of Leicester|Eleanor]] – married William Marshal's son (also called [[William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|William]]) and, later, English rebel [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=306}}</ref>

John also had illegitimate children with a number of mistresses, including nine sons—[[Richard FitzRoy|Richard]], Oliver, John, Geoffrey, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Eudes, Bartholomew and (probably) Philip—and three daughters—[[Joan, Lady of Wales|Joan]], Maud and (probably) Isabel.<ref>{{harvnb|Richardson|2004|p=9}}</ref> Of these Joan was the best known, since she married Prince [[Llywelyn the Great]] of Wales.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=328}}</ref>

===Contemporary opinion===
The chronicler [[Gerald of Wales]] borrowed elements of the [[Melusine]] legend to give the Angevins a demonic origin, and the kings were said to tell jokes about the stories.<ref name=Warren>{{harvnb|Warren|1978|p=2}}</ref>
[[File:Henry-eleanor-tomb.jpg|thumb|alt=Painted statues of reclining king and queen|Tomb of Henry and Eleanor in [[Fontevraud Abbey]]]]Henry was an unpopular king, and few grieved his death;<ref>{{harvnb|Strickland|2007|p=187}}</ref> William of Newburgh wrote during the 1190s, \"In his own time he was hated by almost everyone\". He was widely criticised by contemporaries, even in his own court.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|p=213}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Vincent|2007b|p=330}}</ref> Henry's son Richard's contemporary image was more nuanced, since he was the first king who was also a [[knight]].<ref name=\"flori484\">{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=484–485}}</ref> Known as a valiant, competent and generous military leader, he was criticised by chroniclers for taxing the clergy for the Crusade and his ransom; clergy were usually exempt from taxes.<ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=322}}</ref>

Chroniclers [[Richard of Devizes]], [[William of Newburgh]], [[Roger of Hoveden]] and [[Ralph de Diceto]] were generally unsympathetic to John's behaviour under Richard, but more tolerant of the earliest years of John's reign.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 2\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=2}}</ref> Accounts of the middle and later years of his reign are limited to [[Gervase of Canterbury]] and [[Ralph of Coggeshall]], neither of whom were satisfied with John's performance as king.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|2000|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=15}}</ref> His later negative reputation was established by two chroniclers writing after the king's death: [[Roger of Wendover]] and [[Matthew Paris]]. The latter claimed that John attempted to convert to Islam, but this is not believed by modern historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren|2000|pp=11, 14}}</ref>

===Constitutional impact===
Many of the changes Henry introduced during his rule had long-term consequences. His legal innovations form part of the basis for [[English law]], with the [[Exchequer of Pleas]] a forerunner of the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Bench]] at Westminster.<ref>{{harvnb|Brand|2007|p=216}}</ref> Henry's itinerant justices also influenced his contemporaries' legal reforms: Philip Augustus' creation of itinerant ''bailli'', for example, drew on Henry's model.<ref>{{harvnb|HallamEverard|2001|p=211}}</ref> Henry's intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland had a significant long-term impact on the development of their societies and governments.<ref>{{harvnb|Davies|1990|pp=22–23}}</ref> John's reign, despite its flaws, and his signing of ''Magna Carta'', were seen by [[Whig history|Whig historians]] as positive steps in the constitutional development of England and part of a progressive and [[Universalism|universalist]] course of political and economic development in medieval England.<ref>{{harvnb| Dyer |2009|p=4}}</ref> [[Winston Churchill]] said, \"[W]hen the long tally is added, it will be seen that the British nation and the English-speaking world owe far more to the vices of John than to the labours of virtuous sovereigns\".<ref>{{harvnb|Churchill|1958|p=190}}</ref> ''Magna Carta'' was reissued by the Marshal Protectorate and later as a foundation of future government.<ref name=DanzigerGillingham/>

===Architecture, language and literature===

[[Image:Richard1TombFntrvd.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Tomb of Richard I of England and Isabella of Angoulême (at back)]]
There was no distinct Angevin or Plantagenet culture that would distinguish or set them apart from their neighbours in this period. [[Robert of Torigni]] recorded that Henry built or renovated castles throughout his domain in Normandy, England, Aquitaine, Anjou, Maine and Torraine. However this patronage had no distinctive style except in the use of circular or octagonal kitchens of the Fontevraud type. Similarly amongst the multiple vernaculars{{mdash}}French, English and [[Occitan Language|Occitan]]{{mdash}}there was not a unifying literature. [[French language|French]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the secular elite and [[Latin language|Latin]] or the church.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=118}}</ref>

The Angevins were closely associated with the [[Fontevraud Abbey]] in Anjou. Henry's [[Matilda of Anjou|aunt]] was [[Abbess]], Eleanor retired there to be a nun and the abbey was originally the site of his grave and those of Eleanor, Richard, his daughter [[Joan of England, Queen consort of Sicily|Joan]],  grandson [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]] and John's wife{{mdash}}[[Isabella of Angoulême]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=75}}</ref> Henry III visited the abbey in 1254 to reorder these tombs and requested his heart be buried with them.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2001|p=115}}</ref>

===Historiography===
[[Image:Foxe's Book of Martyrs title page.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A photograph of the wood block print of the Book of Martyrs. The book's title is in the centre and various scenes from the book are depicted around it.|[[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]'' (official title ''Acts and Monuments'') viewed John's reign positively.]]According to historian [[John Gillingham]], Henry and his reign have attracted historians for many years and Richard (whose reputation has \"fluctuated wildly\")<ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=484}}</ref> is remembered largely because of his military exploits. [[Steven Runciman]], in the third volume of the ''History of the Crusades'', wrote: \"He was a bad son, a bad husband, and a bad king, but a gallant and splendid soldier.\" <ref>{{harvnb| Runciman |1954|p=484}}</ref>

Eighteenth-century historian [[David Hume]] wrote that the Angevins were pivotal in creating a genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 2\"/> Interpretations of ''Magna Carta'' and the role of the rebel barons in 1215 have been revised; although the charter's symbolic, constitutional value for later generations is unquestionable, for most historians it is a failed peace agreement between factions.<ref>{{harvnb|Huscroft|2005|p=174}}</ref> John's opposition to the papacy and his promotion of royal rights and prerogatives won favour from 16th-century Tudors. [[John Foxe]], [[William Tyndale]] and [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] viewed John as an early Protestant hero, and Foxe included the king in his ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Book of Martyrs]]''.<ref name=\"Bevington 2002 432\">{{harvnb|Bevington|2002|p=432}}</ref> [[John Speed]]'s 1632 ''Historie of Great Britaine'' praised John's \"great renown\" as king, blaming biased medieval chroniclers for the king's poor reputation.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=4}}</ref> Similarly, later [[Protestant]] historians view Henry's role in Thomas Becket's death and his disputes with the French as worthy of praise.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=3}}</ref> Similarly, increased access to contemporary records during the late [[Victorian era]] led to a recognition of Henry's contributions to the evolution of English law and the exchequer.<ref name=\"harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=10\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=10}}</ref> [[William Stubbs]] called Henry a \"legislator king\" because of his responsibility for major, long-term reforms in England; in contrast, Richard was \"a bad son, a bad husband, a selfish ruler, and a vicious man\".<ref name=\"harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=10\"/><ref>{{harvnb|White|2000|p=3}}</ref> {{Quote box
 | quote=He was a bad king: his great exploits, his military skill, his splendour and extravagance, his poetical tastes, his adventurous spirit, do not serve to cloak his entire want of sympathy, or even consideration, for his people. He was no Englishman, but it does not follow that he gave to Normandy, Anjou, or Aquitaine the love or care that he denied to his kingdom. His ambition was that of a mere warrior: he would fight for anything whatever, but he would sell everything that was worth fighting for. The glory that he sought was that of victory rather than conquest. | source=William Stubbs, on Richard<ref>{{harvnb|Stubbs|1874|pp=550–551}}</ref>

The growth of the [[British Empire]] led historian [[Kate Norgate]] to begin detailed research into Henry's continental possessions and create the term \"Angevin Empire\" during the 1880s.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=16}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=15}}</ref> However, 20th-century historians challenged many of these conclusions. During the 1950s, Jacques Boussard, John Jolliffe and others focused on the nature of Henry's \"empire\"; French scholars, in particular, analysed the mechanics of royal power during this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=19}}</ref> Anglocentric aspects of many histories of Henry's reign were challenged beginning in the 1980s, with efforts to unite British and French historical analyses of the period.<ref name=\"Gillingham 2007 21\"/> Detailed study of Henry's written records has cast doubt on earlier interpretations; Robert Eyton's 1878 volume (tracing Henry's itinerary by deductions from [[pipe roll]]s), for example, has been criticised for not acknowledging uncertainty.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=279–281}}</ref> Although many of Henry's [[royal charter]]s have been identified, their interpretation, the financial information in the pipe rolls and broad economic data from his reign has proven more challenging than once thought.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb| Gillingham |2007|pp=286, 299}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Barratt|2007|pp=248–294}}</ref> Significant gaps in the historical analysis of Henry remain, particularly about his rule in Anjou and the south of France.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|p=22}}</ref>

Interest in the morality of historical figures and scholars waxed during the Victorian period, leading to increased criticism of Henry's behaviour and Becket's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Gillingham|2007|pp=5–7}}</ref> Historians relied on the judgement of  chroniclers to focus on John's ethos. Norgate wrote that John's downfall was due not to his military failures but his \"almost superhuman wickedness\", and James Ramsay blamed John's family background and innate cruelty for his downfall.<ref>{{harvnb|Norgate|1902|p=286}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ramsay|1903|p=502}}</ref>

Richard's sexuality has been controversial since the 1940s, when John Harvey challenged what he saw as \"the conspiracy of silence\" surrounding the king's [[homosexuality]] with chronicles of Richard's behaviour, two public confessions, penances and childless marriage.<ref name=\"Gillingham 1994 119–139.\">{{harvnb|Gillingham|1994|pp=119–139}}</ref> Opinion remains divided, with Gillingham arguing against Richard's homosexuality<ref name=\"Gillingham 1994 119–139.\"/> and Jean Flori acknowledging its possibility.<ref name=\"Gillingham 1994 119–139.\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|p=448}}</ref>

According to recent biographers Ralph Turner and Lewis Warren, although John was an unsuccessful monarch his failings were exaggerated by 12th- and 13th-century chroniclers.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradbury|2007|p=353}}</ref> [[Jim Bradbury]] echoes the contemporary consensus that John was a \"hard-working administrator, an able man, an able general\" with, as Turner suggests, \"distasteful, even dangerous personality traits\".<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|1994|p=23}}</ref> John Gillingham (author of a biography of Richard I) agrees and judges John to be a less-effective general than Turner and Warren do. Bradbury takes a middle view, suggesting that modern historians have been overly lenient in evaluating John's flaws.<ref>{{harvnb|Bradbury|2007|p=361}}</ref> Popular historian [[Frank McLynn]] wrote that the king's modern reputation amongst historians is \"bizarre\" and, as a monarch, John \"fails almost all those [tests] that can be legitimately set\".<ref>{{harvnb|McLynn|2007|pp=472–473}}</ref>

The king is a central character in [[James Goldman]]'s play ''[[The Lion in Winter]]'' (1966), depicting an imaginary encounter between Henry's family and Philip Augustus over Christmas 1183 at [[Chinon]]. Philip's strong character contrasts with John, an \"effete weakling\".<ref>{{harvnb|Elliott|2011|pp=109–110}}</ref> In the [[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|1968 film]], Henry is a sacrilegious, fiery and determined king.<ref>{{harvnb| Martinson |2007|p=263}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb| Palmer |2007|p=46}}</ref> Henry also appears in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s play ''[[Becket]]'', which was [[Becket (1964 film)|filmed in 1964]].<ref>{{harvnb|Anouilh|2005|p=xxiv}}</ref> The Becket conflict is the basis for [[T.

[[Image:FirstFolioKingJohn.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A photograph of the first page of Shakespeare's play \"King John\", with two columns of text below.|Shakespeare's ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'']]
During the Tudor period, popular representations of John emerged.<ref name=\"Bevington 2002 432\"/> He appeared as a \"proto-Protestant martyr\" in the anonymous play ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]'' and [[John Bale]]'s morality play ''[[John Bale#Kynge Johan|Kynge Johan]]'', in which John attempts to save England from the \"evil agents of the Roman Church\".<ref name=\"Curren-Aquino 1989 19\">{{harvnb|Curren-Aquino|1989|p=19}}</ref> Shakespeare's anti-Catholic ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' draws on ''The Troublesome Reign'', offering a \"balanced, dual view of a complex monarch as both a proto-Protestant victim of Rome's machinations and as a weak, selfishly motivated ruler\".<ref>{{harvnb|Curren-Aquino|1989|p=19}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bevington|2002|p=454}}</ref> [[Anthony Munday]]'s plays ''[[The Downfall and The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington]]'' demonstrate many of John's negative traits, but approve of the king's stand against the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|p=70}}</ref>

Richard is the subject of two operas: in 1719 [[George Frideric Handel]] used Richard's invasion of Cyprus as the plot for ''[[Riccardo Primo]]'' and in 1784 [[André Grétry]] wrote ''[[Richard Coeur-de-lion (opera)|Richard Coeur-de-lion]]''.

====Robin Hood====

The earliest ballads of [[Robin Hood]] such as those compiled in ''[[A Gest of Robyn Hode]]'' associated the character with a king named \"Edward\" and the setting is usually attributed by scholars to either the 13th or the 14th century.<ref>{{harvnb|DobsonTaylor|1997|pp=14–16}}</ref> As the historian [[J.C. Holt]] notes at some time around the 16th century, tales of Robin Hood started to mention him as a contemporary and supporter of Richard, Robin being driven to outlawry during John's misrule, while in the narratives Richard was largely absent, away at the Third Crusade.<ref name=\"Holt 1982 170\">{{harvnb|Holt|1982|p=170}}</ref> Plays such as [[Robert Davenport (dramatist)|Robert Davenport]]'s ''[[King John and Matilda]]'' further developed the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] works in the mid-17th century, focussing on John's tyranny and transferring the role of Protestant champion to the barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Maley|2010|p=50}}</ref>  Graham Tulloch noted that unfavourable 19th-century fictionalised depictions of John were influenced by Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s historical romance ''[[Ivanhoe]]''. They, in turn, influenced the children's author [[Howard Pyle]]'s ''[[The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood]]'' (1883) which cast John as the principal villain of the [[Robin Hood]] narrative. During the 20th century, John also appeared in fictional books and films with Robin Hood. [[Sam De Grasse]]'s John, in the [[Robin Hood (1922 film)|1922 film version]], commits atrocities and acts of torture.<ref>{{harvnb|Aberth|2003|p=166}}</ref> [[Claude Rains]]' John, in the [[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|1938 version]] with [[Errol Flynn]], began a cinematic trend in which John was an \"effeminate&nbsp;... arrogant and cowardly stay-at-home\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|p=210}}</ref> John's character highlights Richard's virtues and contrasts with [[Guy of Gisbourne]], the \"swashbuckling villain\" opposing Robin. In the [[Robin Hood (1973 film)|Disney cartoon version]], John (voiced by [[Peter Ustinov]]) is a \"cowardly, thumbsucking lion\".<ref>{{harvnb|Potter|1998|p=218}}</ref>

During the 13th century, a folktale developed in which Richard's minstrel [[Blondel de Nesle|Blondel]] roamed (singing a song known only to him and Richard) to find Richard's prison.<ref>{{harvnb|Flori|1999|pp=191–192}}</ref> This story was the foundation of [[André Ernest Modeste Grétry]]'s opera ''Richard Coeur-de-Lion'', and inspired the opening of [[Richard Thorpe]]'s film version of ''[[Ivanhoe (1952 film)|Ivanhoe]]''. Sixteenth-century tales of [[Robin Hood]] began describing him as a contemporary (and supporter) of Richard the Lionheart; Robin became an outlaw during the reign of Richard's evil brother, John, while Richard was fighting in the Third Crusade.<ref name=\"Holt 1982 170\"/>

'''''Charles de Gaulle''''' is the [[flagship]] of the [[French Navy]] (''Marine Nationale''). The ship is the tenth French [[aircraft carrier]], the first French [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] surface vessel, and the only nuclear-powered carrier completed outside of the [[United States Navy]]. She is named after French statesman and general [[Charles de Gaulle]].

The ship carries a complement of [[Dassault Rafale|Dassault Rafale&nbsp;M]] and [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E&#8209;2C Hawkeye]] aircraft, [[Eurocopter EC725|EC725 Caracal]] and [[Eurocopter AS532 Cougar|AS532 Cougar]] helicopters for [[combat search and rescue]], as well as modern electronics and [[MBDA Aster|Aster]] missiles. She is a [[CATOBAR]]-type carrier that uses two 75&nbsp;m C13‑3 steam catapults of a shorter version of the catapult system installed on the U.S. {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|0}} aircraft carriers, one catapult at the bow and one across the front of the landing area.<ref name=gs/> As of May 2019, ''Charles de Gaulle'' is the only non-American carrier-vessel that has a catapult launch system, which has allowed for operation of [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]s<ref name=\"F/A 18E-CDG\">{{cite news |url=http://theaviationist.com/2014/01/20/hornet-on-french-carrier/ |title=U.S. F/A-18E Hornet operates from French Aircraft Carrier |date=20 January 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514230235/http://theaviationist.com/2014/01/20/hornet-on-french-carrier/ |archive-date=14 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Grumman C-2 Greyhound|C-2 Greyhound]]s of the US Navy.<ref name=\"C2 Greyhound-CDG\">{{cite news |url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/operations/libye-un-aeronef-americain-apponte-sur-le-charles-de-gaulle/ |title=Libye : un aéronef américain apponte sur le Charles de Gaulle |date=7 June 2011 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074257/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/operations/libye-un-aeronef-americain-apponte-sur-le-charles-de-gaulle/ |archive-date=18 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Rafale-US-Carrier\">{{cite news |url=http://theaviationist.com/2014/01/15/rafale-operate-uss-truman/ |title=French Rafale fighter jets operate from U.S. aircraft carrier |work=theaviationist.com |date=15 January 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518030520/http://theaviationist.com/2014/01/15/rafale-operate-uss-truman/ |archive-date=18 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Development==

===Construction===
The carrier replaced {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Foch|R99|2}}, a conventionally powered aircraft carrier, in 2001. {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Clemenceau|R98|2}} and ''Foch'' were completed in 1961 and 1963 respectively; the requirement for a replacement was identified in the mid-1970s.

The hull was laid down in April 1989 at the [[DCNS (company)|DCNS]] [[Brest, France|Brest]] naval shipyard. The carrier was launched in May 1994 and at 42,000&nbsp;tonnes (full load)<ref name=\"secretdefense20080604\"/> was the largest warship launched in Western Europe since {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1950. She was to be named ''Richelieu'' in 1986 by the French president at the time, [[François Mitterrand]], after the famous French statesman [[Cardinal Richelieu|Armand-Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu]].<ref name=\"roche-2-423\" /><ref name=\"senat.fr\">{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.senat.fr/rap/r99-358/r99-3583.html senat.fr] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326000127/http://www.senat.fr/rap/r99-358/r99-3583.html |date=26 March 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"qSEQ861103467\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.senat.fr/questions/base/1986/qSEQ861103467.html|title=Nom du futur porte-avions nucléaire - Sénat|website=www.senat.fr|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref><ref group=note>Following the traditional name [[French ship Richelieu|''Richelieu'']] for capital ships in the French Navy, previously the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}} of the Second World War.</ref> On 18 May 1987, however, the name of the ship was changed to ''Charles de Gaulle'' by the [[Gaullist]] Prime Minister at the time, [[Jacques Chirac]].<ref name=\"qSEQ861103467\" />

Construction quickly fell behind schedule as the project was starved of funding, which was worsened by the economic recession in the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Total costs for the vessel would top €3&nbsp;billion. Work on the ship was suspended altogether on four occasions: 1990, 1991, 1993, and 1995.<ref name=\"senat.fr\" /> The ship was commissioned on 18 May 2001, five years behind the projected deadline.

===Alleged spying incident===
In 1993, it was alleged by ''[[The Guardian]]'' that a group of engineers inspecting the vessel during her construction were British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) operatives, believed to have been learning the method of shielding the nuclear reactors, amongst other technical details.<ref>{{cite news | first = Paul | last = Webster |author2=Norton-Taylor, Richard | title = French Foil MI6 Carrier Snoop | work=The Guardian | page = 1 | date = 23 August 1993 }}</ref> However, the newspaper published a denial by both the British government and the ''[[Direction de la surveillance du territoire]]'' (DST) (in English: ''Directorate of Territorial Surveillance'') that there had been any incident.<ref>{{cite news | last = | title = MI6 Carrier Affair Denied | work=The Guardian | page = 3 | date = 24 August 1993 }}</ref>

===Trials and technical problems===
[[File:USS Enterprise FS Charles de Gaulle.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} (left), the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and ''Charles de Gaulle'' (right), at that time the newest nuclear carrier, both steaming in the Mediterranean Sea on 16 May 2001.]]
''Charles de Gaulle'' entered sea trials in 1999. These identified the need to extend the flight deck to safely operate the E-2C Hawkeye. This operation sparked negative publicity, however, as the same tests had been conducted on both ''Foch'' and ''Clemenceau'' when the [[Vought F-8 Crusader|F&#8209;8E (FN) Crusader]] fighter had been introduced. The 5&nbsp;million francs for the extension was 0.025% of the total budget for the ''Charles de Gaulle'' project.

===Refitting===
[[File:FS CDG bridge3.jpg|thumb|Command bridge of ''Charles de Gaulle'']]
On 16 September 2001 the French press reported slightly higher than acceptable radioactivity levels aboard ''Charles de Gaulle'', thought to be caused by a faulty isolation element. It was later discovered that the radioactivity levels matched the design, but that the regulations concerning acceptable radioactivity levels had changed. While the United States was preparing its response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the form of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.

On 11 October 2001, the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Cassard|D 614|2}}, four [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft and ''Charles de Gaulle'' were involved in a successful trial of the [[Link 16]] high-bandwidth secure data network. The network allows real-time monitoring of the airspace from the South of England to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The collected data were also transmitted in real time to the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Jean Bart|D615|2}} through the older [[MIL-STD-6011]] system.

===Afghanistan===
On 21 November 2001, France decided to send ''Charles de Gaulle'' to the Indian Ocean in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] against [[Taliban]]-controlled [[Afghanistan]]. [[Task Force 473]], with 2,900 men under the command of [[Counter Admiral|Contre-Amiral]] François Cluzel, sailed on 1 December 2001. The task force was composed of ''Charles de Gaulle'', frigates {{ship|French frigate|Lamotte-Picquet|D645|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Jean de Vienne|D643|2}} and {{ship|French frigate|Jean Bart|D615|2}}, the nuclear [[attack submarine]] {{ship|French submarine|Rubis|S601|2}}, the tanker {{ship|French tanker|Meuse||2}} and the {{Sclass-|D'Estienne d'Orves|aviso}} {{ship|French aviso|Commandant Ducuing||2}}.

Embarked air power comprised sixteen [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard|Super Étendards]], one E-2C Hawkeye, two Rafale Ms and several helicopters. The Super Étendards carried out their first missions above Afghanistan on 19 December, executing reconnaissance and bombing missions, covering over 3,000&nbsp;kilometres. Overall they carried out 140 missions, averaging 12 per day.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Approximately 770 sorties were carried out from the carrier.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-54010305.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924181458/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-54010305.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 September 2015|title=French aircraft carrier returns home after mission near Afghanistan|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=1 July 2002|accessdate=24 June 2015|url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref>

On 18 February 2002, a [[Helios 1B|Helios]] observation satellite spotted abnormal activities near [[Gardez]]. The next day, after [[American Special Forces]] in the region confirmed these observations, ''Charles de Gaulle'' launched two reconnaissance Super Étendards. On 20 February 2002, British and US forces entered the valley and [[Operation Anaconda]] began in early March 2002.

In March 2002, Super Étendards and six land-based [[Mirage 2000]] aircraft carried out airstrikes against targets claimed to be [[al Qaeda]]. A few targets suggested by U.S.&nbsp;forces were denied out of fear of hitting civilians. Nevertheless, French involvement was complimented on 11 March 2002 by US President [[George W. Bush]], who mentioned \"our good ally, France, has deployed nearly one-fourth of its navy to support Operation Enduring Freedom\".<ref>\"[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020311-1.html President Thanks World Coalition for Anti-Terrorism Efforts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226144301/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020311-1.html |date=26 February 2012 }}\", The White House, 11 March 2002.

''Charles de Gaulle'''s first major [[Refueling and Overhaul|overhaul]] began in September 2007. The highlight of this 15-month refit was the [[Refueling and Overhaul|refueling of the nuclear power plant]], a necessary step after six years in service, during which ''Charles de Gaulle'' sailed the equivalent of 12&nbsp;times around the world, spent 900 days at sea, and performed 19,000 catapult launches.<ref>\"[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/marine/content/download/100314/884733/version/1/file/071210%2BDP.pdf Entretien et Modernisation du Charles de Gaulle]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}\" (PDF).

These allow ''Charles de Gaulle'' to reach her design speed of {{convert|27|kn|km/h}}, replacing the vintage propellers used as a stop-gap since 2001. Aircraft maintenance and weapons stores were also upgraded to allow operation of new [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] F3 fighters armed with [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée|ASMP&#8209;A]] nuclear missiles and [[Storm Shadow|SCALP EG]] cruise missiles, and satellite communications bandwidth will be increased tenfold. This refit increased displacement to 42500 tonnes <ref name=\"secretdefense20080604\"/> and was completed in December 2008. After technical problems in March 2009 the carrier was back in Toulon for repairs. An intensive work&#8209;up period was planned to bring ''Charles de Gaulle'' and her airgroup back to operational status.

On 14 October 2010, a four-month cruise was cut down to a single day when the ship suffered an electrical fault in its propulsion system.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4904778&c=EUR&s=SEA French Carrier Heads Home a Day into Anti-Piracy, Afghan Mission]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE, 14 October 2010</ref>

===Integration in the future navy===

The French Navy aimed to be a two-carrier navy, mainly to ensure that at least one ship is operational at all times even when the other is under repair. This scheme requires another aircraft carrier to be built; however, ''Charles de Gaulle'' is the only aircraft carrier currently serving.

Cost considerations have made equipment standardization a necessity. In this context, there is a possibility of collaboration with Britain for future aircraft carriers. [[Thales Group|Thales UK]] (with BMT) made the design for the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|aircraft carrier|1}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thalesgroup.com/Portfolio/Defence/naval_productpage_CVF/?pid=1568 |title=Aircraft Carriers - Queen Elizabeth-Class Aircraft Carriers |publisher=Thales Group |accessdate=7 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925073115/http://www.thalesgroup.com/Portfolio/Defence/naval_productpage_CVF/?pid=1568 |archive-date=25 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> suitable for construction for France as the [[French aircraft carrier PA2]]. Steps were taken by both countries to make such a scenario possible: the new carrier had to be conventionally propelled to meet the requirements of the [[Royal Navy]]. France favoured nuclear propulsion, and a study was conducted to see if it was more cost efficient than gas turbines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga/equipement/naval/le-porte-avions-2-pa2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120191448/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/dga/equipement/naval/le-porte-avions-2-pa2 |archivedate=20 November 2011 |df=dmy }} [[Ministère de la Défense|French Ministry of Defence]]</ref> However, by 2013 French Defence White Paper, the plan for a second carrier were cancelled.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/livre-blanc-2013 |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502002158/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/livre-blanc-2013 |archive-date=2 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/defence-and-security-blog/2013/apr/30/defence-budget-trident | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=Pressures mount on UK defence spending | date=30 April 2013 | accessdate=7 January 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140807175048/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/defence-and-security-blog/2013/apr/30/defence-budget-trident | archive-date=7 August 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Air group==
French Navy operates three 12 aircraft Rafale-M squadrons and one 3 aircraft E-2C Hawkeye squadron. Typically two Rafale squadrons are expected to rotate in CdG carrier air group. A pair of E-2C would supplement them. In peacetime number of planes on board may be probably lower: 14/24 Rafale M, 2 E-2C Hawkeye and 2/4 AS365 Dauphin helicopters. Although 24 Rafales, divided into two squadrons, are expected to be embarked usually some aircraft remain in France for upgrade or training. US Navy F-18 Hornets and C-2 Greyhounds conduct regularly qualification traps and launches from CdG. In June 2011 two US Navy C-2A(R) Greyhounds were assigned to French Navy to conduct operational carrier on-board delivery (COD) missions for CdG during the NATO intervention in Libya.

In 2019 CdG operated 35 aircraft during exercises, its record: two Dauphin helicopters, thirty Rafale M, two E-2C Hawkeye and one NH90 NFH Caiman. In event of war CdG is expected to operate close to full complement of 40 aircraft. CdG air group took part in combat operations in Afghanistan, Syria  and Libya.

'''''Charles de Gaulle''''' is the [[flagship]] of the [[French Navy]] (''Marine Nationale''). The ship is the tenth French [[aircraft carrier]], the first French [[Nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] surface vessel, and the only nuclear-powered carrier completed outside of the [[United States Navy]]. She is named after French statesman and general [[Charles de Gaulle]].

The ship carries a complement of [[Dassault Rafale|Dassault Rafale&nbsp;M]] and [[Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E&#8209;2C Hawkeye]] aircraft, [[Eurocopter EC725|EC725 Caracal]] and [[Eurocopter AS532 Cougar|AS532 Cougar]] helicopters for [[combat search and rescue]], as well as modern electronics and [[MBDA Aster|Aster]] missiles. She is a [[CATOBAR]]-type carrier that uses two 75&nbsp;m C13‑3 steam catapults of a shorter version of the catapult system installed on the U.S. {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier|0}} aircraft carriers, one catapult at the bow and one across the front of the landing area.<ref name=gs/> As of May 2019, ''Charles de Gaulle'' is the only non-American carrier-vessel that has a catapult launch system, which has allowed for operation of [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]s<ref name=\"F/A 18E-CDG\">{{cite news |url=http://theaviationist.com/2014/01/20/hornet-on-french-carrier/ |title=U.S. F/A-18E Hornet operates from French Aircraft Carrier |date=20 January 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514230235/http://theaviationist.com/2014/01/20/hornet-on-french-carrier/ |archive-date=14 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Grumman C-2 Greyhound|C-2 Greyhound]]s of the US Navy.<ref name=\"C2 Greyhound-CDG\">{{cite news |url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/operations/libye-un-aeronef-americain-apponte-sur-le-charles-de-gaulle/ |title=Libye : un aéronef américain apponte sur le Charles de Gaulle |date=7 June 2011 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518074257/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/operations/libye-un-aeronef-americain-apponte-sur-le-charles-de-gaulle/ |archive-date=18 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Rafale-US-Carrier\">{{cite news |url=http://theaviationist.com/2014/01/15/rafale-operate-uss-truman/ |title=French Rafale fighter jets operate from U.S. aircraft carrier |work=theaviationist.com |date=15 January 2014 |accessdate=8 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518030520/http://theaviationist.com/2014/01/15/rafale-operate-uss-truman/ |archive-date=18 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Development==

===Construction===
The carrier replaced {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Foch|R99|2}}, a conventionally powered aircraft carrier, in 2001. {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Clemenceau|R98|2}} and ''Foch'' were completed in 1961 and 1963 respectively; the requirement for a replacement was identified in the mid-1970s.

The hull was laid down in April 1989 at the [[DCNS (company)|DCNS]] [[Brest, France|Brest]] naval shipyard. The carrier was launched in May 1994 and at 42,000&nbsp;tonnes (full load)<ref name=\"secretdefense20080604\"/> was the largest warship launched in Western Europe since {{HMS|Ark Royal|R09|6}} in 1950. She was to be named ''Richelieu'' in 1986 by the French president at the time, [[François Mitterrand]], after the famous French statesman [[Cardinal Richelieu|Armand-Jean du Plessis, Cardinal Richelieu]].<ref name=\"roche-2-423\" /><ref name=\"senat.fr\">{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.senat.fr/rap/r99-358/r99-3583.html senat.fr] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080326000127/http://www.senat.fr/rap/r99-358/r99-3583.html |date=26 March 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"qSEQ861103467\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.senat.fr/questions/base/1986/qSEQ861103467.html|title=Nom du futur porte-avions nucléaire - Sénat|website=www.senat.fr|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref><ref group=note>Following the traditional name [[French ship Richelieu|''Richelieu'']] for capital ships in the French Navy, previously the battleship {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu||2}} of the Second World War.</ref> On 18 May 1987, however, the name of the ship was changed to ''Charles de Gaulle'' by the [[Gaullist]] Prime Minister at the time, [[Jacques Chirac]].<ref name=\"qSEQ861103467\" />

Construction quickly fell behind schedule as the project was starved of funding, which was worsened by the economic recession in the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Total costs for the vessel would top €3&nbsp;billion. Work on the ship was suspended altogether on four occasions: 1990, 1991, 1993, and 1995.<ref name=\"senat.fr\" /> The ship was commissioned on 18 May 2001, five years behind the projected deadline.

===Alleged spying incident===
In 1993, it was alleged by ''[[The Guardian]]'' that a group of engineers inspecting the vessel during her construction were British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) operatives, believed to have been learning the method of shielding the nuclear reactors, amongst other technical details.<ref>{{cite news | first = Paul | last = Webster |author2=Norton-Taylor, Richard | title = French Foil MI6 Carrier Snoop | work=The Guardian | page = 1 | date = 23 August 1993 }}</ref> However, the newspaper published a denial by both the British government and the ''[[Direction de la surveillance du territoire]]'' (DST) (in English: ''Directorate of Territorial Surveillance'') that there had been any incident.<ref>{{cite news | last = | title = MI6 Carrier Affair Denied | work=The Guardian | page = 3 | date = 24 August 1993 }}</ref>

===Trials and technical problems===
[[File:USS Enterprise FS Charles de Gaulle.jpg|thumb|left|{{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}} (left), the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, and ''Charles de Gaulle'' (right), at that time the newest nuclear carrier, both steaming in the Mediterranean Sea on 16 May 2001.]]
''Charles de Gaulle'' entered sea trials in 1999. These identified the need to extend the flight deck to safely operate the E-2C Hawkeye. This operation sparked negative publicity, however, as the same tests had been conducted on both ''Foch'' and ''Clemenceau'' when the [[Vought F-8 Crusader|F&#8209;8E (FN) Crusader]] fighter had been introduced. The 5&nbsp;million francs for the extension was 0.025% of the total budget for the ''Charles de Gaulle'' project. On 28 February 2000, a nuclear reactor trial triggered the combustion of additional isolation elements, producing a smoke incident.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

The ship left [[Toulon]] for her fourteenth and final sea trial on 24 October 2000. During the night of 9–10 November, in the Western Atlantic while en route toward [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]], the [[Port (nautical)|port]] propeller broke, and the ship had to return to Toulon to have a replacement fitted.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Muradian|first=Vago|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66960447.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924162105/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66960447.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 September 2015|title=French Carrier Cancels U.S. Visit Over Broken Prop, Incident May Delay Commissioning|work=Defense Daily|date=14 November 2000|accessdate=23 June 2015|url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> The investigations that followed showed similar structural faults in the other propeller and in the spare propellers: bubbles in the one-piece [[copper]]-[[aluminium alloy]] propellers near the centre.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Although the supplier, Atlantic Industrie, was not believed to have intentionally been at fault, it was nevertheless blamed for poor-quality construction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68740252.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924162539/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-68740252.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 September 2015|title=France Faults De Gaulle Prop Failure On Manufacturer, To Seek Second Source|work=Defense Daily|date=3 January 2001|accessdate=23 June 2015|url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref> A few hours after the French defense minister ordered an investigation on quality management, a fire destroyed the archives of the supplier.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/societe/20001222.OBS0479/charles-de-gaulle-la-fonderie-impliquee.html|title=Charles-de-Gaulle : la fonderie impliquée|work=L'Obs|access-date=2018-07-25|language=fr-FR|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725184125/https://www.nouvelobs.com/societe/20001222.OBS0479/charles-de-gaulle-la-fonderie-impliquee.html|archive-date=25 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> As a temporary solution, the less advanced spare propellers of ''Clemenceau'' and ''Foch'' were used, limiting the maximum speed to 24&nbsp;knots (44&nbsp;km/h) instead of the contractual 27&nbsp;knots (50&nbsp;km/h).

On 5 March 2001, ''Charles de Gaulle'' went back to sea with two older propellers and sailed at 25.2&nbsp;knots (47&nbsp;km/h) on her trials. Between July and October, she had to be refitted once more due to abnormal noises, as loud as 100&nbsp;[[Decibel|dB]], near the starboard propeller, which had rendered the aft part of the ship uninhabitable.{{cn|date=May 2019}}

==Operational service==

===Refitting===
[[File:FS CDG bridge3.jpg|thumb|Command bridge of ''Charles de Gaulle'']]
On 16 September 2001 the French press reported slightly higher than acceptable radioactivity levels aboard ''Charles de Gaulle'', thought to be caused by a faulty isolation element. It was later discovered that the radioactivity levels matched the design, but that the regulations concerning acceptable radioactivity levels had changed. While the United States was preparing its response to the [[September 11 attacks]] in the form of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], French media complained about the lack of deployable French military power. At the same time, the Defence Commission reported the maintenance of the Fleet to be substandard. In this context, ''Charles de Gaulle'', then under repairs, was again an object of criticism, with former President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] describing it as a \"half-aircraft-carrier\" and requesting launching of the second carrier vessel (named PA2) in order to guarantee an availability rate of 100%.

===Link 16===
{{main|Link 16}}
On 11 October 2001, the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Cassard|D 614|2}}, four [[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]] aircraft and ''Charles de Gaulle'' were involved in a successful trial of the [[Link 16]] high-bandwidth secure data network. The network allows real-time monitoring of the airspace from the South of England to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The collected data were also transmitted in real time to the frigate {{ship|French frigate|Jean Bart|D615|2}} through the older [[MIL-STD-6011]] system.

===Afghanistan===
On 21 November 2001, France decided to send ''Charles de Gaulle'' to the Indian Ocean in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] against [[Taliban]]-controlled [[Afghanistan]]. [[Task Force 473]], with 2,900 men under the command of [[Counter Admiral|Contre-Amiral]] François Cluzel, sailed on 1 December 2001. The task force was composed of ''Charles de Gaulle'', frigates {{ship|French frigate|Lamotte-Picquet|D645|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Jean de Vienne|D643|2}} and {{ship|French frigate|Jean Bart|D615|2}}, the nuclear [[attack submarine]] {{ship|French submarine|Rubis|S601|2}}, the tanker {{ship|French tanker|Meuse||2}} and the {{Sclass-|D'Estienne d'Orves|aviso}} {{ship|French aviso|Commandant Ducuing||2}}.

Embarked air power comprised sixteen [[Dassault-Breguet Super Étendard|Super Étendards]], one E-2C Hawkeye, two Rafale Ms and several helicopters. The Super Étendards carried out their first missions above Afghanistan on 19 December, executing reconnaissance and bombing missions, covering over 3,000&nbsp;kilometres. Overall they carried out 140 missions, averaging 12 per day.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} Approximately 770 sorties were carried out from the carrier.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-54010305.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924181458/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-54010305.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 September 2015|title=French aircraft carrier returns home after mission near Afghanistan|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=1 July 2002|accessdate=24 June 2015|url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}</ref>

On 18 February 2002, a [[Helios 1B|Helios]] observation satellite spotted abnormal activities near [[Gardez]]. The next day, after [[American Special Forces]] in the region confirmed these observations, ''Charles de Gaulle'' launched two reconnaissance Super Étendards. On 20 February 2002, British and US forces entered the valley and [[Operation Anaconda]] began in early March 2002.

In March 2002, Super Étendards and six land-based [[Mirage 2000]] aircraft carried out airstrikes against targets claimed to be [[al Qaeda]]. A few targets suggested by U.S.&nbsp;forces were denied out of fear of hitting civilians. Nevertheless, French involvement was complimented on 11 March 2002 by US President [[George W. Bush]], who mentioned \"our good ally, France, has deployed nearly one-fourth of its navy to support Operation Enduring Freedom\".<ref>\"[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020311-1.html President Thanks World Coalition for Anti-Terrorism Efforts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226144301/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/03/20020311-1.html |date=26 February 2012 }}\", The White House, 11 March 2002.

From February 2002, the air wings of ''Charles de Gaulle'' and {{USS|John C. Stennis|CVN-74|6}} landed on each other's decks as a means of strengthening the ties between the allies.

On 2 May 2002, ''Charles de Gaulle'' arrived in [[Singapore]] for relief, and returned to [[Oman]] on 18 May 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forecastinternational.com/archive/disp_pdf.cfm?DACH_RECNO=775|title=Charles de Gaulle Class|last=|first=|date=2005-11-01|website=Forcast international|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>

===Continuing operations===
''Charles de Gaulle'' participated in further actions as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in 2005. She returned to Southwest Asia in May 2006 and shortly after supported coalition efforts over Afghanistan.

===First major overhaul===
[[File:CdG-photo116.jpg|thumb|''Charles de Gaulle'' refitting in the southwestern dock of Vauban industrial zone in 2008]]
''Charles de Gaulle'''s first major [[Refueling and Overhaul|overhaul]] began in September 2007. The highlight of this 15-month refit was the [[Refueling and Overhaul|refueling of the nuclear power plant]], a necessary step after six years in service, during which ''Charles de Gaulle'' sailed the equivalent of 12&nbsp;times around the world, spent 900 days at sea, and performed 19,000 catapult launches.<ref>\"[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/marine/content/download/100314/884733/version/1/file/071210%2BDP.pdf Entretien et Modernisation du Charles de Gaulle]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}\" (PDF). French Navy Press Release'. Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref> Several improvements were also made, including the installation of new propellers. These allow ''Charles de Gaulle'' to reach her design speed of {{convert|27|kn|km/h}}, replacing the vintage propellers used as a stop-gap since 2001. Aircraft maintenance and weapons stores were also upgraded to allow operation of new [[Dassault Rafale|Rafale]] F3 fighters armed with [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée|ASMP&#8209;A]] nuclear missiles and [[Storm Shadow|SCALP EG]] cruise missiles, and satellite communications bandwidth will be increased tenfold. This refit increased displacement to 42500 tonnes <ref name=\"secretdefense20080604\"/> and was completed in December 2008.

An intensive work&#8209;up period was planned to bring ''Charles de Gaulle'' and her airgroup back to operational status.

===Integration in the future navy===

The French Navy aimed to be a two-carrier navy, mainly to ensure that at least one ship is operational at all times even when the other is under repair. This scheme requires another aircraft carrier to be built; however, ''Charles de Gaulle'' is the only aircraft carrier currently serving.

Cost considerations have made equipment standardization a necessity. In this context, there is a possibility of collaboration with Britain for future aircraft carriers. [[Thales Group|Thales UK]] (with BMT) made the design for the {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|aircraft carrier|1}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thalesgroup.com/Portfolio/Defence/naval_productpage_CVF/?pid=1568 |title=Aircraft Carriers - Queen Elizabeth-Class Aircraft Carriers |publisher=Thales Group |accessdate=7 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925073115/http://www.thalesgroup.com/Portfolio/Defence/naval_productpage_CVF/?pid=1568 |archive-date=25 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> suitable for construction for France as the [[French aircraft carrier PA2]]. Steps were taken by both countries to make such a scenario possible: the new carrier had to be conventionally propelled to meet the requirements of the [[Royal Navy]].

===Midlife upgrade===
The aircraft carrier underwent an 18-month midlife upgrade and refit begun in February 2017 and returned to service in September 2018.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Tomkins|first1=Richard|title=Carrier Charles de Gaulle undergoing refit and upgrade|url=http://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2017/02/08/Carrier-Charles-de-Gaulle-undergoing-refit-and-upgrade/5721486576719/|accessdate=2 March 2017|work=UPI|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224211802/http://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2017/02/08/Carrier-Charles-de-Gaulle-undergoing-refit-and-upgrade/5721486576719/|archive-date=24 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.usni.org/2018/04/30/33210|title=French, U.S. Naval Aviators Learn to Work Together Ahead of Middle East Deployment|date=30 April 2018|access-date=1 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501224417/https://news.usni.org/2018/04/30/33210|archive-date=1 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=French Aircraft Carrier Charles de Gaulle Returns to Sea Following Midlife Upgrade and Refit |url=https://defpost.com/french-aircraft-carrier-charles-de-gaulle-returns-sea-following-midlife-upgrade-refit/ |accessdate=24 October 2018 |work=DefPost |date=17 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024113253/https://defpost.com/french-aircraft-carrier-charles-de-gaulle-returns-sea-following-midlife-upgrade-refit/ |archive-date=24 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> The nuclear reactor was refueled, standard maintenance was completed, and the ship's combat system was modernized, in order to better communicate with allies and support the Rafale fighters employed by the carrier.

=== Mission Clemenceau ===
The aircraft carrier led the carrier strike group Task Force 473 on a five-month long operation that began in March 2019, through the Mediterranean Sea. Aircraft from ''Charles de Gaulle'' participated in the last major combat against the Islamic State in the [[Battle of Baghuz Fawqani]] and then sailed for the Indian Ocean. Arriving in Singapore on 28 May, the aircraft carrier participated in a bilateral exercise with the Singapore Armed Forces.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/france-aircraft-carrier-charles-de-gaulle-arrives-in-singapore-11572958|title=France's Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier arrives in Singapore|website=CNA|language=en|access-date=2019-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529075942/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/france-aircraft-carrier-charles-de-gaulle-arrives-in-singapore-11572958|archive-date=29 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Future replacement===
Following completion of the midlife upgrade, in October 2018 the French armed forces minister announced an 18-month study to determine the requirements for a future carrier. The size requirements, propulsion options{{snd}}both conventional and nuclear{{snd}}and aircraft-launching capabilities will be assessed before a decision is made in 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=France begins deliberations on new aircraft carrier |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1MX1CE |accessdate=24 October 2018 |work=Reuters |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024113212/https://af.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idAFKCN1MX1CE |archive-date=24 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Air group==
French Navy operates three 12 aircraft Rafale-M squadrons and one 3 aircraft E-2C Hawkeye squadron. Typically two Rafale squadrons are expected to rotate in CdG carrier air group. A pair of E-2C would supplement them. In peacetime number of planes on board may be probably lower: 14/24 Rafale M, 2 E-2C Hawkeye and 2/4 AS365 Dauphin helicopters. Although 24 Rafales, divided into two squadrons, are expected to be embarked usually some aircraft remain in France for upgrade or training. US Navy F-18 Hornets and C-2 Greyhounds conduct regularly qualification traps and launches from CdG. In June 2011 two US Navy C-2A(R) Greyhounds were assigned to French Navy to conduct operational carrier on-board delivery (COD) missions for CdG during the NATO intervention in Libya.

In 2019 CdG operated 35 aircraft during exercises, its record: two Dauphin helicopters, thirty Rafale M, two E-2C Hawkeye and one NH90 NFH Caiman. In event of war CdG is expected to operate close to full complement of 40 aircraft. CdG air group took part in combat operations in Afghanistan, Syria  and Libya.

'''Accordions''' (from 19th-century German ''Akkordeon'', from ''Akkord''—\"musical chord, concord of sounds\")<ref>'''[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=accordion&searchmode=none accordion]''', entry in [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]</ref> are a family of box-shaped [[musical instrument]]s of the [[bellows]]-driven [[free reed aerophone|free-reed aerophone]] type, colloquially referred to as a [[squeezebox]]. A person who plays the accordion is called an ''accordionist''.  The [[concertina]] and [[Bandoneon|bandoneón]] are related. The [[harmonium]] and [[American reed organ]] are in the same family, but are typically larger than an accordion and sit on a surface or the floor.

The accordion is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or [[Musical keyboard|keys]], causing ''pallets'' to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called ''[[reed (instrument)|reeds]]''. These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block.<ref group=\"notes\">For the accordion's place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorski's [http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/description/taxonomy.html ''Taxonomy of Musical Instruments'' (''The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.'')] Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigott's ''The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones''</ref>  The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand [[manual (music)|manual]], and the [[accompaniment]], consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual. The term for a large collection of accordions is a \"Scream\"

The accordion is widely spread across the world. In some countries (for example Brazil,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blognejo.com.br/blognejo-informa/top-five-os-maiores-sanfoneiros-da-musica-sertaneja-atual|title=TOP FIVE – OS MAIORES SANFONEIROS DA MÚSICA SERTANEJA ATUAL – Blognejo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://divirta-se.uai.com.br/app/noticia/musica/2013/05/22/noticia_musica,142451/o-dono-da-festa.shtml|title=Novo disco de Michel Teló junta sanfona, música sertaneja, eletrônica e ritmos dançantes|work=Divirta-se – Tudo sobre entretenimento, cinema, shows, celebridades e promoções}}</ref> Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama) it is used in popular music (for example Gaucho, [[Forró]] and [[Música sertaneja|Sertanejo]] in Brazil, [[Vallenato]] in Colombia, and [[Norteño (music)|norteño]] in Mexico), whereas in other regions (such as Europe, North America and other countries in South America) it tends to be more used for [[dance-pop]] and [[folk music]] and is often used in folk music in Europe, North America and South America. In Europe and North America, [[Accordion#Use in popular music|some popular music acts]] also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is used in [[Cajun music|cajun]], [[zydeco]], [[jazz music]] and in both solo and orchestral performances of [[classical music]].
The [[piano accordion]] is the official city instrument of [[San Francisco]], California.<ref>{{cite news|title=City Makes Accordion San Francisco's Official Instrument|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/City-Makes-Accordion-San-Francisco-s-Official-Instrument/id-376dd5a7b608f64b18abf834aaafc0fd|accessdate=24 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Associated Press|date=24 April 1990}}</ref>   Many conservatories in Europe have classical accordion departments.  The oldest name for this group of instruments is ''harmonika'', from the Greek ''harmonikos'', meaning \"harmonic, musical\". Today, native versions of the name ''accordion'' are more common. These names refer to the type of accordion [[Accordion#History|patented by Cyrill Demian]], which concerned \"automatically coupled chords on the bass side\".<ref>Dyremose, Jeanette & Lars, ''Det levende bælgspil'' (2003), p.133</ref>

==Construction==
[[File:Spirk.ogv|thumb|right|A [[diatonic button accordion]] being played]]
Accordions have many configurations and types. What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another:
* Some accordions are ''bisonoric'', producing different [[pitch (music)|pitches]] depending on the direction of bellows movement.
* Others are ''unisonoric'' and produce the same pitch in both directions. The pitch also depends on its size.
* Some use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.
* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.
* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual.
* Some can play in different [[register (music)|registers]].
* Craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently, \"personalizing\" the end result, such as how an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might voice a particular instrument or tune [[Voix céleste|celeste]] ranks.

===Universal components===

The [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.<ref>[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike's Accordion</ref> It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] and producing sound by their vibrations, applied pressure increases the volume.

The keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows. Bellows effects include:
* Volume control, including swells  and fades
* Repeated short, rapid changes of direction (\"bellows shake\"), which has been popularized by musicians such as Renato Borghete (gaucho music) and [[Luiz Gonzaga]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340 |title= Luiz Gonzaga:Biography by John Dougan |first=John |last=Dougan |website=All Music |publisher=RhythmOne group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130122258/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340/biography |archive-date=30 November 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> and extensively used in [[Forró]], called ''resfulengo'' in Brazil
* Constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals
* Constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance
* Subtly changing the intonation to mimic the expressiveness of a singer
* Using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving (\"whooshing\"), which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions for this instrument

====Body====
[[File:Petosa - showroom 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Petosa accordion shop showroom.]]
The accordion's body consists of two wooden boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May–June 1948)</ref>

The size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.

====Pallet mechanism====
The accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:<ref group=\"notes\">Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende bælgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette & Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)</ref>

[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|A side view of the pallet mechanism in a piano accordion. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. A similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions, as well as for bass mechanisms such as the Stradella ''bass machine'' that translates a single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of a chord.|alt=Accordion; cross-sectional view]]

===Variable components===
The term ''accordion'' covers a wide range of instruments, with varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format, apart from reedless [[digital accordion]]s. Not all have switches to change registers or ranks, as some have only one treble register and one bass register. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in musical traditions including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, and Argentinian tango music.

====Right-hand manual systems====
[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]
Different systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody (while it can also play chords). Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits<ref name=\"pianovschromatic\">{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":
* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).
* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions—that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7–9 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzerörgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].
* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows.
**The rarely used bass accordion only has a right-hand keyboard, with ranks of 8', 16', and 32' reeds, with the lowest note being the deepest pitch on a pipe organ [[pedal keyboard]] (pedal C). The bass accordion is intended to perform [[bassline]]s in an accordion orchestra.
**The rarely used piccolo accordion also only has a right-hand keyboard.
* 6-plus-6 accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement, generally known as a [[Jankó keyboard]]. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].

====Left-hand manual systems====
[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|300px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]
Different systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:
[[File:Bassmechanics.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bass buttons trigger a complex mechanism of wires, rods, and levers, which is normally hidden inside the instrument.]]
* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for bass notes and additional rows of single buttons for preset major, minor, dominant seventh, and diminished [[chord (music)|chords]]. The dominant seventh and diminished chords are three-note chord voicings that omit the fifths of the chords. 
* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was rarely used outside of its native Belgium.
* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies and complex [[bassline]]s on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords note-by-note. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.

====Reed ranks and switches====
{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}
[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]

Inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples. All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.

====Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions====
In describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 treble keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. A second aspect of size is the width of the white keys, which means that even accordions with the same number of keys have keyboards of different lengths, ranging from {{convert|14|in|cm}} for a child's accordion to {{convert|19|in|cm}} for an adult-sized instrument. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. 

Price is also affected by the use of costly woods, luxury decorations, and features such as a palm switch, grille mute, and so on. Some accordion makers sell the same model in a range of different models, from a less-expensive base model to a more costly luxury model. Typically, the register switches are described as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" or \"full organ\" switch on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side. Another factor affecting the price is the presence of electronics, such as condenser microphones, volume and tone controls, or MIDI sensors and connections. 

[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]

====Straps====
The larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing. Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.

====Electronic and digital====
{{Main|Digital accordion}}
[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound playing a Roland digital V-Accordion. The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]
In the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.

As an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.

Acoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.

===Unusual accordions===
[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]
Various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities — only a few have remained in use:
* The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion
* The [[Steirische Harmonika]], a type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the Alpine folk music of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian South Tyrol
* The [[schwyzerörgeli]] or Swiss organ, which usually has a three-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement —  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass – that travel parallel to the bellows motion
* The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]], which has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass
* The [[British Chromatic Accordion|British chromatic accordion]], the favoured diatonic accordion in Scotland. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Howard |date=2003 |title=An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments |location=Stockport |publisher=Robaccord Publications |isbn=978-0-9546711-0-5}}</ref>
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedal harmony|pl|3=Harmonia pedałowa}}, a type of accordion used sometimes in Polish folk music, which has a pair of [[pump organ]]-like bellows attached

[[File:Dillner-accordion.jpg|thumb|Zitat Dillner Akkordeon]]

The earliest history of the accordion in Russia is poorly documented. Nevertheless, according to Russian researchers, the earliest known simple accordions were made in [[Tula, Russia]], by [[:ru:Сизов, Иван Евстратьевич|Ivan Sizov]] and [[:ru:Воронцов, Тимофей Пименович|Timofey Vorontsov]] around 1830, after they received an early accordion from Germany.<ref>Mirek, Alfred. ''Garmonika. Proshloe i nastoiashchee. Nauchno-istoricheskaia entsyklopedicheskaia kniga.'' Moscow, 1994. p.50</ref> By the late 1840s, the instrument was already very widespread;<ref>''[http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/__Raritetnye_knigi/IRGO_Etnograficheskij_sbornik_02_1854.pdf Etnograficheskii sbornik Russkogo geograficheskogo obshchestva.'' Vol.2], Saint Petersburg, 1854. p.26, 162.''</ref> together the factories of the two masters were producing 10,000 instruments a year. By 1866, over 50,000 instruments were being produced yearly by Tula and neighbouring villages, and by 1874 the yearly production was over 700,000.<ref>Mirek, Alfred. ''Iz istorii akkordeona i baiana.'' Moscow, 1967. p.43-45</ref> By the 1860s, [[Novgorod Governorate|Novgorod]], [[Vyatka Governorate|Vyatka]] and [[Saratov Governorate|Saratov]] governorates also had significant accordion production. By the 1880s, the list included [[Oryol Governorate|Oryol]], [[Ryazan Governorate|Ryazan]], [[Moscow Governorate|Moscow]], [[Tver Governorate|Tver]], [[Vologda Governorate|Vologda]], [[Kostroma Governorate|Kostroma]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Governorate|Nizhny Novgorod]] and [[Simbirsk Governorate|Simbirsk]], and many of these places created their own varieties of the instrument.<ref>{{cite book |last=Banin |first=A.A. |title=Russkaia instrumentalnaia muzyka folklornoi traditsii |language=Russian |location=Moscow |date=1997 |page=144}}</ref>

The accordion is one of several European inventions of the early 19th century that use free reeds driven by a bellows. An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]].<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 – 19 Jun 9 Using Way Back Machine to Display: The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref> Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action). At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, läßt sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so daß man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne Töne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, muß ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, würde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.\"
Translation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively. Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195131/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref>

The accordion was introduced from Germany into Britain in about the year 1828.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol I, A–Arcesilaus'', London, George Woodfall and Son, 1847, p.107.</ref> The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' in 1831 as one new to British audiences<ref>The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, [[Johann Sedlatzek|Mr. Sedlatzek]]) \"At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.\"</ref> and was not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.<ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : “GREAT CONCERT-ROOM – KING’S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called “a concertina,” an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.\"</ref> It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s.<ref>''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': “While we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days\"(i.e. mid-1840s) \"accordions were the real attraction to the public\".</ref>

After Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the right-handed keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a ''[[concertina]]'' also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.

[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The first pages in Adolph Müller's accordion book]]
The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book ''Schule für Accordion''. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.

Jeune's ''[[flutina]]'' resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone colour]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.

Further innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability. Modern accordions may incorporate electronics such as condenser microphones and tone and volume controls, so that the accordion can be plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] for live shows. Some 2010s-era accordions may incorporate [[digital accordion|MIDI sensors and circuitry]], enabling the accordion to be plugged into a [[synth module]] and produce accordion sounds or other synthesized instrument sounds, such as piano or organ.

==Use in various music genres==
{{main|Accordion music genres}}
The accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock and pop-rock,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.

===Use in traditional music===
{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}

The accordion's popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was propagated by Europeans who emigrated around the world. The accordion in both button and piano forms became a favorite of folk musicians<ref>Christoph Wagner, \"A Brief History of How the Accordion Changed the World,\" CD booklet notes for Planet Squeezebox, performed by various artists, (Roslyn, New York: Ellipsis Arts, 1995), 6</ref> and has been integrated into [[traditional music]] styles all over the world: see the [[list of music styles that incorporate the accordion]].

===Use in jazz===
Jazz accordionists from the United States include [[Steve Bach (musician)|Steve Bach]], [[Milton DeLugg]], [[Orlando DiGirolamo]], [[Dominic Frontiere]], [[Guy Klucevsek]], [[Yuri Lemeshev]], [[Frank Marocco]], [[John Serry Sr.]], [[Lee Tomboulian]], and [[Art Van Damme]].

[[Richard Galliano]] is an internationally known accordionist whose repertoire covers jazz, tango nuevo, latin, and classical. Some popular bands use the instrument to create distinctive sounds. A notable example is [[Grammy Award|Grammy Award-winning]] [[Parody music|parodist]] [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], who plays the accordion on many of his musical tracks, particularly his [[polka]]s. Yankovic was trained in the accordion as a child.<ref name=\"GraffDurchholz2012\">{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel|title=Rock 'n' Roll Myths: The True Stories Behind the Most Infamous Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWlSUYbiUXUC&pg=PT152|year=2012|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61058-571-2|page=152}}</ref>

The accordion has also been used in the rock genre, most notably by [[John Linnell]] of [[They Might Be Giants]], featuring more prominently in the band's earlier works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tmbw.net/wiki/Accordion|title=Accordion – TMBW: The They Might Be Giants Knowledge Base|website=tmbw.net|language=en|access-date=10 June 2018}}</ref> The instrument is still frequently used during live performances, and continues to make appearances in their studio albums. Accordion is also used in the music of the [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Gogol Bordello]].

Accordionists in [[heavy metal music]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances. The Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] used to have a full-time accordionist, employing classical and polka sensibilities alongside a violinist. One of their accordionists, Netta Skog, is now a member of [[Ensiferum]], another folk-metal band. Another Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]], invokes a type of Finnish polka called [[humppa]], and also has a full-time accordionist. Sarah Kiener, the former [[hurdy-gurdy]] player for the Swiss melodic-death-folk metal band [[Eluveitie]], played a [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] accordion known as a ''zugerörgeli''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Use in classical music===
{{Main|Accordion music genres#Use in classical music|l1=Accordion in classical music}}

Although best known as a folk instrument, it has grown in popularity among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is ''{{lang|fr|Thême varié très brillant pour accordéon methode Reisner}}'', written in 1836 by Louise Reisner of Paris. Other composers, including the Russian [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], the Italian [[Umberto Giordano]], and the American [[Charles Ives]], wrote works for the diatonic button accordion.

[[File:Эса Пакаринен.png|thumb|Finnish accordionist [[Esa Pakarinen]] (Feeliks Esaias Pakarinen (1911–1989)]]
The first composer to write specifically for the [[chromatic music|chromatic]] accordion was [[Paul Hindemith]].<ref>[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm ''Accordion Composers in German''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107190534/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm |date=7 November 2007 }} Accordion Online</ref> In 1922, the Austrian [[Alban Berg]] included an accordion in ''[[Wozzeck]]'', Op. 7. In 1937 the first [[accordion concerto]] was composed in Russia. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Henry Doktorski, \"The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music,\" The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.

Perry]] featured the accordion in his orchestral suite ''Six Title Themes in Search of a Movie'' (2008). The experimental composer [[Howard Skempton]] began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it. In his work ''Drang'' (1999), British composer [http://www.johnpalmer.org John Palmer]  pushed the expressive possibilities of the accordion/bayan. [[Luciano Berio]] wrote ''Sequenza XIII'' (1995) for accordionist Teodoro Anzellotti.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universaledition.com/composers-and-works/luciano-berio-54/works/sequenza-xiii-4612|title=Luciano Berio: Sequenza XIII|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Accordionists like [[Mogens Ellegaard]], [[Joseph Macerollo]], [[Friedrich Lips]], [[Hugo Noth]], [[Stefan Hussong]], [[Italo Salizzato]], [[Teodoro Anzellotti]], [[Mie Miki]], and [[Geir Draugsvoll]], encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion (solo and chamber music) and also started playing baroque music on the free bass accordion.

French composer [[Henri Dutilleux]] used an accordion in both his late song cycles ''Correspondances'' (2003) and ''[[Le Temps l'horloge|Le Temps l'Horloge]]'' (2009).  Russian-born composer [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] has composed solos, concertos, and chamber works for accordion. Astor Piazzolla's concert tangos are performed widely. Piazzolla performed on the bandoneon, but his works are performed on either bandoneon or accordion.

===Australia===
The earliest mention of the novel accordion instrument in [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] occurs in the 1830s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article172895152 |title=THE COLONIAL TIDES. THE REGATTA DINNER. |newspaper=[[Trumpeter General]] |volume= |issue=29 |location=Tasmania |date=7 March 1834 |accessdate=2 December 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>
The accordion initially competed against cheaper and more convenient reed instruments such as mouth organ, concertina and melodeon.
Frank Fracchia was an Australian accordion composer<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article42462163 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[Cairns Post]] |issue=13,660 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=12 December 1945 |accessdate=2 December 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and copies of his works \"My dear, can you come out tonight\"<ref>{{Citation | author1=Fracchia, F | author2=Sproule, Nellie | title=My dear, can you come out tonight | date=1930 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/191726251 | accessdate=2 December 2018 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and \"Dancing with you\"<ref>{{Citation | author1=Fracchia, F | author2=Sproule, Nellie | title=Dancing with you | date=1944 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/193500216 | accessdate=2 December 2018 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> are preserved in Australian libraries.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The accordion is a traditional instrument in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is the dominant instrument used in [[sevdalinka]], a traditional genre of folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is also considered a national instrument of the country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Brazil===
[[File:Dominguinhos de Morais.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Brazilian accordionist [[Dominguinhos]] (José Domingos de Morais (1941–2013)]]
The accordion was brought to Brazil by settlers and immigrants from Europe, especially from Italy and Germany, who mainly settled in the south (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana). The first instrument brought was a \"Concertina\" (a 120 button chromatic accordion).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ciadoacordeon.com.br/cia-do-acordeon-historia.html|title=Cia do Acordeon – História do Acordeon|website=ciadoacordeon.com.br|language=pt|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> The instrument was popular in the 1950s, and was common to find several accordions in the same house. There are many different configurations and tunes which were adapted from the cultures that came from Europe.

Accordion is the official symbol instrument of the Rio Grande do Sul state, where was voted by unanimity in the deputy chamber.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.al.rs.gov.br/dal/Sess%C3%A3oPlen%C3%A1ria/DetalheVotacao/tabid/5627/Default.aspx?idProjeto=6484|title=DetalheVotacao|last=Legislativo|first=Departamento de Assessoramento|website=www2.al.rs.gov.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref>
During the boom of accordions there were around 65 factories in Brazil, where most of them (52) in the south, in Rio Grande do Sul state, with only 7 outside the south. One of the most famous and genuinely Brazilian brands was Acordeões Todeschini from Bento Gonçalves-RS, closed in 1973. The Todeschini accordion is very appreciated today and survives with very few maintainers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acordeom.com.br/menu/not2.php?id=1|title=noticias|website=www.acordeom.com.br|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lojamanomonteiro.com.br/interna.php?cod=17770|title=Todeschini a História|website=www.lojamanomonteiro.com.br|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> The most notable musicians of button accordions are Renato Borghetti, Adelar Bertussi, Albino Manique and Edson Dutra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ciadoacordeon.com.br/cia-do-acordeon-historia.html|title=Cia do Acordeon – História do Acordeon|website=ciadoacordeon.com.br|language=pt|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref>

Compared to many other countries, the instrument is very popular in mainstream pop music. In some parts of the country, such as the northeast it is the most popular melodic instrument. As opposed to most European folk accordions, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil. Outside the south, the accordion (predominantly the piano accordion) is used in almost all styles of [[Forró]] (in particular in the subgenres of Xote and [[baião (music)|Baião]]) as the principal instrument, [[Luiz Gonzaga]] (the \"King of the [[baião (music)|Baião]]\") and [[Dominguinhos]] being among the notable musicians in this style from the northeast.  In this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[zabumba]] (a type of drum). This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the southeast of the country (in the Forró Universitário genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada). Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the São João Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music. It is an important instrument in [[Música sertaneja|Sertanejo]] (and Caipira) music, which originated in the midwest and southeast of Brazil, and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country.

===Colombia===
The accordion is also a traditional instrument in Colombia, commonly associated with the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] genres. The accordion has been used by [[tropipop]] musicians such as [[Carlos Vives]], [[Andrés Cabas]], [[Fonseca (singer)]] and [[Bacilos]], as well as rock musicians such as [[Juanes]] and pop musicians as [[Shakira]]. Vallenato, who emerged in the early twentieth century in a city known as Valledupar, and have come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Every year in April, Colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country: the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]]. The festival holds contests for best accordion player. Once every decade, the \"King of Kings\" accordion competition takes place, where winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player: the ''Pilonera Mayor'' prize.<ref>Smithsonian Channel, [https://archive.is/20130630080628/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/sn/show.do?show=134604 \"The Accordion Kings\"], 15 August 2010.</ref> This is the world's largest competitive accordion festival.

===Mexico===
[[File:Tijuana-performers.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Norteño band, including an accordion]]
[[Norteño (music)|Norteño]] heavily relies on the accordion, it is a genre related to polka. [[Ramón Ayala]] known in Mexico as the \"King of the Accordion\" is a norteño musician. [[Cumbia]] which features the accordion is also popular with musicians such as [[Celso Piña]] creating a more contemporary style. U.S. born Mexican musician [[Julieta Venegas]] incorporates the sound of the instrument into rock, pop and folk. She was influenced by her fellow Chicanos [[Los Lobos]] who also use the music of the accordion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Julieta-Venegas-6839928.php|title=Julieta Venegas: Life and songs in two cultures}}</ref>

===North Korea===
According to [[Barbara Demick]] in ''[[Nothing to Envy]]'', the accordion is known as \"the people's instrument\" and all North Korean teachers were expected to learn the accordion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/north-korea/galleries/what-you-didn-t-know-about-north-korea/accordians/|title=20 incredible things you didn't know about North Korea|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Manufacturing process==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017|small=yes}}
[[File:Petosa - Seattle - workshop 02.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The workshop of [[Petosa]] accordions, an accordion maker based in Seattle.]]
The most expensive{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} accordions are typically fully hand-made, particularly the reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a better tonal quality than even the best automatically-manufactured ones. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure{{clarify|date=June 2017}} sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by Yutaka Usui,<ref>[http://www.irishdancemaster.com/ Yutaka Usuai], Japanese-born accordion craftsman.</ref>{{irrelevant citation|reason=adds nothing to the article, except a gratuitous link to an external website, possibly for promotional purposes|date=June 2017}} a Japanese-born craftsman.

The manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. In a sense{{clarify|date=June 2017}}, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. The general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226093126/http://enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/accordion |archive-date=26 December 2008 |url=http://enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/accordion |title=How Products are Made: Accordion |publisher=eNotes.com |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

Famous{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} {{peacock term|date=June 2017}} centres of production are the Italian cities of [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]] and [[Castelfidardo]], with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter. Castelfidardo honours{{clarify|date=June 2017}} the memory of Paolo Soprani who was one of the first large-scale producers. The French town of [[Tulle]] has hosted{{clarify|date=June 2017}} Maugein Freres since 1919, and the company is now the last complete-process{{clarify|date=June 2017}} manufacturer of accordions in France. German companies such as [[Hohner]] and [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Weltmeister]] made large numbers of accordions, but production diminished by the end of the 20th century.  Hohner still manufactures its top-end models{{clarify|date=June 2017}} in Germany, and ''Weltmeister'' instruments are still handmade by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|HARMONA Akkordeon GmbH]] in [[Klingenthal]]. Cheaper student models{{clarify|date=June 2017}} are often made in China.

'''Accordions''' (from 19th-century German ''Akkordeon'', from ''Akkord''—\"musical chord, concord of sounds\")<ref>'''[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=accordion&searchmode=none accordion]''', entry in [[Online Etymology Dictionary]]</ref> are a family of box-shaped [[musical instrument]]s of the [[bellows]]-driven [[free reed aerophone|free-reed aerophone]] type, colloquially referred to as a [[squeezebox]]. A person who plays the accordion is called an ''accordionist''.  The [[concertina]] and [[Bandoneon|bandoneón]] are related. The [[harmonium]] and [[American reed organ]] are in the same family, but are typically larger than an accordion and sit on a surface or the floor.

The accordion is played by compressing or expanding the bellows while pressing buttons or [[Musical keyboard|keys]], causing ''pallets'' to open, which allow air to flow across strips of brass or steel, called ''[[reed (instrument)|reeds]]''. These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block.<ref group=\"notes\">For the accordion's place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorski's [http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/description/taxonomy.html ''Taxonomy of Musical Instruments'' (''The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.'')] Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigott's ''The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones''</ref>  The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand [[manual (music)|manual]], and the [[accompaniment]], consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.

The accordion is widely spread across the world. In some countries (for example Brazil,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blognejo.com.br/blognejo-informa/top-five-os-maiores-sanfoneiros-da-musica-sertaneja-atual|title=TOP FIVE – OS MAIORES SANFONEIROS DA MÚSICA SERTANEJA ATUAL – Blognejo}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://divirta-se.uai.com.br/app/noticia/musica/2013/05/22/noticia_musica,142451/o-dono-da-festa.shtml|title=Novo disco de Michel Teló junta sanfona, música sertaneja, eletrônica e ritmos dançantes|work=Divirta-se – Tudo sobre entretenimento, cinema, shows, celebridades e promoções}}</ref> Colombia, Dominican Republic, Mexico and Panama) it is used in popular music (for example Gaucho, [[Forró]] and [[Música sertaneja|Sertanejo]] in Brazil, [[Vallenato]] in Colombia, and [[Norteño (music)|norteño]] in Mexico), whereas in other regions (such as Europe, North America and other countries in South America) it tends to be more used for [[dance-pop]] and [[folk music]] and is often used in folk music in Europe, North America and South America. In Europe and North America, [[Accordion#Use in popular music|some popular music acts]] also make use of the instrument. Additionally, the accordion is used in [[Cajun music|cajun]], [[zydeco]], [[jazz music]] and in both solo and orchestral performances of [[classical music]].
The [[piano accordion]] is the official city instrument of [[San Francisco]], California.<ref>{{cite news|title=City Makes Accordion San Francisco's Official Instrument|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/City-Makes-Accordion-San-Francisco-s-Official-Instrument/id-376dd5a7b608f64b18abf834aaafc0fd|accessdate=24 December 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Associated Press|date=24 April 1990}}</ref>   Many conservatories in Europe have classical accordion departments.  The oldest name for this group of instruments is ''harmonika'', from the Greek ''harmonikos'', meaning \"harmonic, musical\". Today, native versions of the name ''accordion'' are more common. These names refer to the type of accordion [[Accordion#History|patented by Cyrill Demian]], which concerned \"automatically coupled chords on the bass side\".<ref>Dyremose, Jeanette & Lars, ''Det levende bælgspil'' (2003), p.133</ref>

==Construction==
[[File:Spirk.ogv|thumb|right|A [[diatonic button accordion]] being played]]
Accordions have many configurations and types. What may be technically possible to do with one accordion could be impossible with another:
* Some accordions are ''bisonoric'', producing different [[pitch (music)|pitches]] depending on the direction of bellows movement.
* Others are ''unisonoric'' and produce the same pitch in both directions. The pitch also depends on its size.
* Some use a [[chromatic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.
* Others use a [[diatonic]] buttonboard for the right-hand manual.
* Yet others use a [[piano]]-style [[musical keyboard]] for the right-hand manual.
* Some can play in different [[register (music)|registers]].
* Craftsmen and technicians may tune the same registers differently, \"personalizing\" the end result, such as how an [[organ (instrument)|organ]] technician might voice a particular instrument or tune [[Voix céleste|celeste]] ranks.

===Universal components===
====Bellows====

The [[bellows]] is the most recognizable part of the instrument, and the primary means of [[articulation (music)|articulation]]. Similar to a [[violin]]'s bow, the production of sound in an accordion is in direct proportion to the motion of the player. The bellows is located between the right- and left-hand manuals, and is made from [[pleat]]ed layers of cloth and cardboard, with added leather and metal.<ref>[http://1accordion.net/bellows.htm How To Repair Bellows] Ike's Accordion</ref> It is used to create pressure and vacuum, driving air across the internal [[reed (instrument)|reeds]] and producing sound by their vibrations, applied pressure increases the volume.

The keyboard touch is not [[keyboard expression|expressive]] and does not affect [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]]: all expression is effected through the bellows. Bellows effects include:
* Volume control, including swells  and fades
* Repeated short, rapid changes of direction (\"bellows shake\"), which has been popularized by musicians such as Renato Borghete (gaucho music) and [[Luiz Gonzaga]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340 |title= Luiz Gonzaga:Biography by John Dougan |first=John |last=Dougan |website=All Music |publisher=RhythmOne group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130122258/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340/biography |archive-date=30 November 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> and extensively used in [[Forró]], called ''resfulengo'' in Brazil
* Constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals
* Constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance
* Subtly changing the intonation to mimic the expressiveness of a singer
* Using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving (\"whooshing\"), which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions for this instrument

====Body====
[[File:Petosa - showroom 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Petosa accordion shop showroom.]]
The accordion's body consists of two wooden boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May–June 1948)</ref>

The size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.

====Pallet mechanism====
The accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:<ref group=\"notes\">Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende bælgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette & Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)</ref>

[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|A side view of the pallet mechanism in a piano accordion. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. A similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions, as well as for bass mechanisms such as the Stradella ''bass machine'' that translates a single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of a chord.|alt=Accordion; cross-sectional view]]

===Variable components===
The term ''accordion'' covers a wide range of instruments, with varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format, apart from reedless [[digital accordion]]s. Not all have switches to change registers or ranks, as some have only one treble register and one bass register. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in musical traditions including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, and Argentinian tango music.

====Right-hand manual systems====
[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]
Different systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody (while it can also play chords). Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits<ref name=\"pianovschromatic\">{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":
* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).
* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions—that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7–9 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzerörgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].
* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows.
**The rarely used bass accordion only has a right-hand keyboard, with ranks of 8', 16', and 32' reeds, with the lowest note being the deepest pitch on a pipe organ [[pedal keyboard]] (pedal C). The bass accordion is intended to perform [[bassline]]s in an accordion orchestra.
**The rarely used piccolo accordion also only has a right-hand keyboard.
* 6-plus-6 accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement, generally known as a [[Jankó keyboard]]. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].

====Left-hand manual systems====
[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|300px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]
Different systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:
[[File:Bassmechanics.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bass buttons trigger a complex mechanism of wires, rods, and levers, which is normally hidden inside the instrument.]]
* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for bass notes and additional rows of single buttons for preset major, minor, dominant seventh, and diminished [[chord (music)|chords]]. The dominant seventh and diminished chords are three-note chord voicings that omit the fifths of the chords. 
* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was rarely used outside of its native Belgium.
* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies and complex [[bassline]]s on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords note-by-note. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.

====Reed ranks and switches====
{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}
[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]

Inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples. All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.

====Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions====
In describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 treble keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. A second aspect of size is the width of the white keys, which means that even accordions with the same number of keys have keyboards of different lengths, ranging from {{convert|14|in|cm}} for a child's accordion to {{convert|19|in|cm}} for an adult-sized instrument. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. 

Price is also affected by the use of costly woods, luxury decorations, and features such as a palm switch, grille mute, and so on. Some accordion makers sell the same model in a range of different models, from a less-expensive base model to a more costly luxury model. Typically, the register switches are described as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" or \"full organ\" switch on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side. Another factor affecting the price is the presence of electronics, such as condenser microphones, volume and tone controls, or MIDI sensors and connections. 

[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]

====Straps====
The larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing. Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.

====Electronic and digital====
{{Main|Digital accordion}}
[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound playing a Roland digital V-Accordion. The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]
In the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.

As an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.

Acoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.

===Unusual accordions===
[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]
Various hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities — only a few have remained in use:
* The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion
* The [[Steirische Harmonika]], a type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the Alpine folk music of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian South Tyrol
* The [[schwyzerörgeli]] or Swiss organ, which usually has a three-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement —  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass – that travel parallel to the bellows motion
* The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]], which has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass
* The [[British Chromatic Accordion|British chromatic accordion]], the favoured diatonic accordion in Scotland. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Howard |date=2003 |title=An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments |location=Stockport |publisher=Robaccord Publications |isbn=978-0-9546711-0-5}}</ref>
* {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedal harmony|pl|3=Harmonia pedałowa}}, a type of accordion used sometimes in Polish folk music, which has a pair of [[pump organ]]-like bellows attached

The earliest history of the accordion in Russia is poorly documented. Nevertheless, according to Russian researchers, the earliest known simple accordions were made in [[Tula, Russia]], by [[:ru:Сизов, Иван Евстратьевич|Ivan Sizov]] and [[:ru:Воронцов, Тимофей Пименович|Timofey Vorontsov]] around 1830, after they received an early accordion from Germany.<ref>Mirek, Alfred. ''Garmonika. Proshloe i nastoiashchee. Nauchno-istoricheskaia entsyklopedicheskaia kniga.'' Moscow, 1994. p.50</ref> By the late 1840s, the instrument was already very widespread;<ref>''[http://publ.lib.ru/ARCHIVES/__Raritetnye_knigi/IRGO_Etnograficheskij_sbornik_02_1854.pdf Etnograficheskii sbornik Russkogo geograficheskogo obshchestva.'' Vol.2], Saint Petersburg, 1854. p.26, 162.''</ref> together the factories of the two masters were producing 10,000 instruments a year. By 1866, over 50,000 instruments were being produced yearly by Tula and neighbouring villages, and by 1874 the yearly production was over 700,000.<ref>Mirek, Alfred. ''Iz istorii akkordeona i baiana.'' Moscow, 1967. p.43-45</ref> By the 1860s, [[Novgorod Governorate|Novgorod]], [[Vyatka Governorate|Vyatka]] and [[Saratov Governorate|Saratov]] governorates also had significant accordion production. By the 1880s, the list included [[Oryol Governorate|Oryol]], [[Ryazan Governorate|Ryazan]], [[Moscow Governorate|Moscow]], [[Tver Governorate|Tver]], [[Vologda Governorate|Vologda]], [[Kostroma Governorate|Kostroma]], [[Nizhny Novgorod Governorate|Nizhny Novgorod]] and [[Simbirsk Governorate|Simbirsk]], and many of these places created their own varieties of the instrument.<ref>{{cite book |last=Banin |first=A.A. |title=Russkaia instrumentalnaia muzyka folklornoi traditsii |language=Russian |location=Moscow |date=1997 |page=144}}</ref>

The accordion is one of several European inventions of the early 19th century that use free reeds driven by a bellows. An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]].<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 – 19 Jun 9 Using Way Back Machine to Display: The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref> Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action). At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, läßt sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so daß man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne Töne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, muß ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, würde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.\"
Translation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively. Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195131/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref>

The accordion was introduced from Germany into Britain in about the year 1828.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol I, A–Arcesilaus'', London, George Woodfall and Son, 1847, p.107.</ref> The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' in 1831 as one new to British audiences<ref>The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, [[Johann Sedlatzek|Mr. Sedlatzek]]) \"At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.\"</ref> and was not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.<ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : “GREAT CONCERT-ROOM – KING’S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called “a concertina,” an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.\"</ref> It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s.<ref>''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': “While we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days\"(i.e. mid-1840s) \"accordions were the real attraction to the public\".</ref>

After Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the right-handed keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a ''[[concertina]]'' also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.

[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The first pages in Adolph Müller's accordion book]]
The musician Adolph Müller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book ''Schule für Accordion''. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.

Jeune's ''[[flutina]]'' resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone colour]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.

Further innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability. Modern accordions may incorporate electronics such as condenser microphones and tone and volume controls, so that the accordion can be plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] for live shows. Some 2010s-era accordions may incorporate [[digital accordion|MIDI sensors and circuitry]], enabling the accordion to be plugged into a [[synth module]] and produce accordion sounds or other synthesized instrument sounds, such as piano or organ.

==Use in various music genres==
{{main|Accordion music genres}}
The accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock and pop-rock,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.

===Use in traditional music===
{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}

The accordion's popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was propagated by Europeans who emigrated around the world. The accordion in both button and piano forms became a favorite of folk musicians<ref>Christoph Wagner, \"A Brief History of How the Accordion Changed the World,\" CD booklet notes for Planet Squeezebox, performed by various artists, (Roslyn, New York: Ellipsis Arts, 1995), 6</ref> and has been integrated into [[traditional music]] styles all over the world: see the [[list of music styles that incorporate the accordion]].

[[Richard Galliano]] is an internationally known accordionist whose repertoire covers jazz, tango nuevo, latin, and classical. Some popular bands use the instrument to create distinctive sounds. A notable example is [[Grammy Award|Grammy Award-winning]] [[Parody music|parodist]] [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]], who plays the accordion on many of his musical tracks, particularly his [[polka]]s. Yankovic was trained in the accordion as a child.<ref name=\"GraffDurchholz2012\">{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel|title=Rock 'n' Roll Myths: The True Stories Behind the Most Infamous Legends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWlSUYbiUXUC&pg=PT152|year=2012|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61058-571-2|page=152}}</ref>

The accordion has also been used in the rock genre, most notably by [[John Linnell]] of [[They Might Be Giants]], featuring more prominently in the band's earlier works.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tmbw.net/wiki/Accordion|title=Accordion – TMBW: The They Might Be Giants Knowledge Base|website=tmbw.net|language=en|access-date=10 June 2018}}</ref> The instrument is still frequently used during live performances, and continues to make appearances in their studio albums. Accordion is also used in the music of the [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Gogol Bordello]].

Accordionists in [[heavy metal music]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances. The Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] used to have a full-time accordionist, employing classical and polka sensibilities alongside a violinist. One of their accordionists, Netta Skog, is now a member of [[Ensiferum]], another folk-metal band. Another Finnish metal band, [[Korpiklaani]], invokes a type of Finnish polka called [[humppa]], and also has a full-time accordionist. Sarah Kiener, the former [[hurdy-gurdy]] player for the Swiss melodic-death-folk metal band [[Eluveitie]], played a [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] accordion known as a ''zugerörgeli''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Use in classical music===
{{Main|Accordion music genres#Use in classical music|l1=Accordion in classical music}}

Although best known as a folk instrument, it has grown in popularity among classical composers. The earliest surviving concert piece is ''{{lang|fr|Thême varié très brillant pour accordéon methode Reisner}}'', written in 1836 by Louise Reisner of Paris. Other composers, including the Russian [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], the Italian [[Umberto Giordano]], and the American [[Charles Ives]], wrote works for the diatonic button accordion.

[[File:Эса Пакаринен.png|thumb|Finnish accordionist [[Esa Pakarinen]] (Feeliks Esaias Pakarinen (1911–1989)]]
The first composer to write specifically for the [[chromatic music|chromatic]] accordion was [[Paul Hindemith]].<ref>[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm ''Accordion Composers in German''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107190534/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/english.htm |date=7 November 2007 }} Accordion Online</ref> In 1922, the Austrian [[Alban Berg]] included an accordion in ''[[Wozzeck]]'', Op. 7. In 1937 the first [[accordion concerto]] was composed in Russia. Other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century.<ref>Henry Doktorski, \"The Classical Squeezebox: A Short History of the Accordion and Other Free-Reed Instruments in Classical Music,\" The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.

Perry]] featured the accordion in his orchestral suite ''Six Title Themes in Search of a Movie'' (2008). The experimental composer [[Howard Skempton]] began his musical career as an accordionist, and has written numerous solo works for it. In his work ''Drang'' (1999), British composer [http://www.johnpalmer.org John Palmer]  pushed the expressive possibilities of the accordion/bayan. [[Luciano Berio]] wrote ''Sequenza XIII'' (1995) for accordionist Teodoro Anzellotti.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universaledition.com/composers-and-works/luciano-berio-54/works/sequenza-xiii-4612|title=Luciano Berio: Sequenza XIII|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Accordionists like [[Mogens Ellegaard]], [[Joseph Macerollo]], [[Friedrich Lips]], [[Hugo Noth]], [[Stefan Hussong]], [[Italo Salizzato]], [[Teodoro Anzellotti]], [[Mie Miki]], and [[Geir Draugsvoll]], encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion (solo and chamber music) and also started playing baroque music on the free bass accordion.

French composer [[Henri Dutilleux]] used an accordion in both his late song cycles ''Correspondances'' (2003) and ''[[Le Temps l'horloge|Le Temps l'Horloge]]'' (2009).  Russian-born composer [[Sofia Gubaidulina]] has composed solos, concertos, and chamber works for accordion. Astor Piazzolla's concert tangos are performed widely. Piazzolla performed on the bandoneon, but his works are performed on either bandoneon or accordion.

===Australia===
The earliest mention of the novel accordion instrument in [[Music of Australia|Australian music]] occurs in the 1830s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article172895152 |title=THE COLONIAL TIDES. THE REGATTA DINNER. |newspaper=[[Trumpeter General]] |volume= |issue=29 |location=Tasmania |date=7 March 1834 |accessdate=2 December 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>
The accordion initially competed against cheaper and more convenient reed instruments such as mouth organ, concertina and melodeon.
Frank Fracchia was an Australian accordion composer<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article42462163 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[Cairns Post]] |issue=13,660 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=12 December 1945 |accessdate=2 December 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and copies of his works \"My dear, can you come out tonight\"<ref>{{Citation | author1=Fracchia, F | author2=Sproule, Nellie | title=My dear, can you come out tonight | date=1930 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/191726251 | accessdate=2 December 2018 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and \"Dancing with you\"<ref>{{Citation | author1=Fracchia, F | author2=Sproule, Nellie | title=Dancing with you | date=1944 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/193500216 | accessdate=2 December 2018 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> are preserved in Australian libraries.

The popularity of the accordion peaked in the late 1930s<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article83703103 |title=ACCORDION CRAZE |newspaper=[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]] |volume=LI |issue=17,892 |location=Western Australia |date=16 July 1932 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |page=4 (HOME (SEMI-FINAL) EDITION) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and continued until the 1950s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article167728833 |title=Piano Accordion Club Popular |newspaper=[[Southern Cross]] |volume=LXII |issue=3105 |location=South Australia |date=10 March 1950 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The accordion is a traditional instrument in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is the dominant instrument used in [[sevdalinka]], a traditional genre of folk music from Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is also considered a national instrument of the country.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

===Brazil===
[[File:Dominguinhos de Morais.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Brazilian accordionist [[Dominguinhos]] (José Domingos de Morais (1941–2013)]]
The accordion was brought to Brazil by settlers and immigrants from Europe, especially from Italy and Germany, who mainly settled in the south (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina and Parana). The first instrument brought was a \"Concertina\" (a 120 button chromatic accordion).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ciadoacordeon.com.br/cia-do-acordeon-historia.html|title=Cia do Acordeon – História do Acordeon|website=ciadoacordeon.com.br|language=pt|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> The instrument was popular in the 1950s, and was common to find several accordions in the same house. There are many different configurations and tunes which were adapted from the cultures that came from Europe.

Accordion is the official symbol instrument of the Rio Grande do Sul state, where was voted by unanimity in the deputy chamber.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.al.rs.gov.br/dal/Sess%C3%A3oPlen%C3%A1ria/DetalheVotacao/tabid/5627/Default.aspx?idProjeto=6484|title=DetalheVotacao|last=Legislativo|first=Departamento de Assessoramento|website=www2.al.rs.gov.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref>
During the boom of accordions there were around 65 factories in Brazil, where most of them (52) in the south, in Rio Grande do Sul state, with only 7 outside the south. One of the most famous and genuinely Brazilian brands was Acordeões Todeschini from Bento Gonçalves-RS, closed in 1973. The Todeschini accordion is very appreciated today and survives with very few maintainers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acordeom.com.br/menu/not2.php?id=1|title=noticias|website=www.acordeom.com.br|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lojamanomonteiro.com.br/interna.php?cod=17770|title=Todeschini a História|website=www.lojamanomonteiro.com.br|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref> The most notable musicians of button accordions are Renato Borghetti, Adelar Bertussi, Albino Manique and Edson Dutra.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ciadoacordeon.com.br/cia-do-acordeon-historia.html|title=Cia do Acordeon – História do Acordeon|website=ciadoacordeon.com.br|language=pt|access-date=1 November 2018}}</ref>

Compared to many other countries, the instrument is very popular in mainstream pop music. In some parts of the country, such as the northeast it is the most popular melodic instrument. As opposed to most European folk accordions, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil. Outside the south, the accordion (predominantly the piano accordion) is used in almost all styles of [[Forró]] (in particular in the subgenres of Xote and [[baião (music)|Baião]]) as the principal instrument, [[Luiz Gonzaga]] (the \"King of the [[baião (music)|Baião]]\") and [[Dominguinhos]] being among the notable musicians in this style from the northeast.  In this musical style the typical combination is a trio of accordion, [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]] and [[zabumba]] (a type of drum). This style has gained popularity recently, in particular among the student population of the southeast of the country (in the Forró Universitário genre, with important exponents today being Falamansa, and trios such as Trio Dona Zefa, Trio Virgulino and Trio Alvorada). Moreover, the accordion is the principal instrument in Junina music (music of the São João Festival), with Mario Zan having been a very important exponent of this music. It is an important instrument in [[Música sertaneja|Sertanejo]] (and Caipira) music, which originated in the midwest and southeast of Brazil, and subsequently has gained popularity throughout the country.

===Colombia===
The accordion is also a traditional instrument in Colombia, commonly associated with the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] genres. The accordion has been used by [[tropipop]] musicians such as [[Carlos Vives]], [[Andrés Cabas]], [[Fonseca (singer)]] and [[Bacilos]], as well as rock musicians such as [[Juanes]] and pop musicians as [[Shakira]]. Vallenato, who emerged in the early twentieth century in a city known as Valledupar, and have come to symbolize the folk music of Colombia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

Every year in April, Colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country: the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]]. The festival holds contests for best accordion player. Once every decade, the \"King of Kings\" accordion competition takes place, where winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player: the ''Pilonera Mayor'' prize.<ref>Smithsonian Channel, [https://archive.is/20130630080628/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/site/sn/show.do?show=134604 \"The Accordion Kings\"], 15 August 2010.</ref> This is the world's largest competitive accordion festival.

===Mexico===
[[File:Tijuana-performers.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Norteño band, including an accordion]]
[[Norteño (music)|Norteño]] heavily relies on the accordion, it is a genre related to polka. [[Ramón Ayala]] known in Mexico as the \"King of the Accordion\" is a norteño musician. [[Cumbia]] which features the accordion is also popular with musicians such as [[Celso Piña]] creating a more contemporary style. U.S. born Mexican musician [[Julieta Venegas]] incorporates the sound of the instrument into rock, pop and folk. She was influenced by her fellow Chicanos [[Los Lobos]] who also use the music of the accordion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Julieta-Venegas-6839928.php|title=Julieta Venegas: Life and songs in two cultures}}</ref>

===North Korea===
According to [[Barbara Demick]] in ''[[Nothing to Envy]]'', the accordion is known as \"the people's instrument\" and all North Korean teachers were expected to learn the accordion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/north-korea/galleries/what-you-didn-t-know-about-north-korea/accordians/|title=20 incredible things you didn't know about North Korea|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2 April 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Manufacturing process==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017|small=yes}}
[[File:Petosa - Seattle - workshop 02.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The workshop of [[Petosa]] accordions, an accordion maker based in Seattle.]]
The most expensive{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} accordions are typically fully hand-made, particularly the reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a better tonal quality than even the best automatically-manufactured ones. Some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure{{clarify|date=June 2017}} sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by Yutaka Usui,<ref>[http://www.irishdancemaster.com/ Yutaka Usuai], Japanese-born accordion craftsman.</ref>{{irrelevant citation|reason=adds nothing to the article, except a gratuitous link to an external website, possibly for promotional purposes|date=June 2017}} a Japanese-born craftsman.

The manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. In a sense{{clarify|date=June 2017}}, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. The general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226093126/http://enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/accordion |archive-date=26 December 2008 |url=http://enotes.com/how-products-encyclopedia/accordion |title=How Products are Made: Accordion |publisher=eNotes.com |accessdate=8 April 2020}}</ref>

Famous{{according to whom|date=June 2017}} {{peacock term|date=June 2017}} centres of production are the Italian cities of [[Stradella, Lombardy|Stradella]] and [[Castelfidardo]], with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter. Castelfidardo honours{{clarify|date=June 2017}} the memory of Paolo Soprani who was one of the first large-scale producers. The French town of [[Tulle]] has hosted{{clarify|date=June 2017}} Maugein Freres since 1919, and the company is now the last complete-process{{clarify|date=June 2017}} manufacturer of accordions in France. German companies such as [[Hohner]] and [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Weltmeister]] made large numbers of accordions, but production diminished by the end of the 20th century.  Hohner still manufactures its top-end models{{clarify|date=June 2017}} in Germany, and ''Weltmeister'' instruments are still handmade by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|HARMONA Akkordeon GmbH]] in [[Klingenthal]]. Cheaper student models{{clarify|date=June 2017}} are often made in China.

== History ==
LaPorte County was formed in 1832. ''La porte'' means \"the door\" or \"the port\" in [[French language|French]].<ref name=\"origin\"/> French travelers or explorers so named the area after discovering a natural opening in the dense forests that used to exist in this region, providing a gateway to lands further west.<ref>Calumet Beginnings: Schoon, Kenneth J. (2003)</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S. Peale & co.|year=1875|location=Indiana|title=An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDIUAAAAYAAJ| pages=560}}</ref>

Before European-American settlement, all of the land that forms modern-day LaPorte County, and adjacent [[Starke County, Indiana|Starke County]] to the south belonged to the [[Potawatomi people|Potawatomi]] Indian nation. These Indians were forcibly removed to Kansas by the United States government in 1838, and many died on what survivors called the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death|Trail of Death]].<ref name=\"La Porte County Historical Society\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517164346/http://laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|url-status=dead|title=La Porte County Historical Society|archivedate=May 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potawatomi-tda.org/ptodhist.htm|title=History of 1838 Trail of Death|work=potawatomi-tda.org}}</ref>

LaPorte County's initial [[European-American]] settlers were [[Yankee]] migrants, that is to say they were from [[New England]] or were from [[upstate New York]] and had parents who were from [[New England]], and were descended from the [[English American|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled [[New England]] in the colonial era.  They were part of a wave of [[New England]] settlers moving west into what was then the [[Northwest Territory]] after the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] through the Mohawk Valley of New York State.

These first settlers in LaPorte County specifically hailed from the [[Massachusetts]] towns of Granville, Boston, Bridgewater, West Bridgewater, Andover, Nantucket Island, and [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]]; the [[Connecticut]] towns of Colchester, Wethersfield, Granby, and New Haven; the [[New Hampshire]] towns of [[Bradford, New Hampshire|Bradford]], [[Amherst, New Hampshire|Amherst]] and Goffstown; the Vermont villages of Dorset, Albany and Fairfax; many also came from [[Orange County, Vermont]], [[Caledonia County, Vermont]] and [[Penobscot County, Maine]].  They were mainly members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]]. As result of the [[Second Great Awakening]], many became [[Baptists]] and many also converted to [[Pentecostalism]] and [[Methodism]].  When they arrived in what is now LaPorte County, there was nothing but virgin forest and prairie. The [[New England]] settlers cleared roads and brush, developed farms, constructed churches, erected government buildings, and established post routes.  As a result of this migration, La Porte County was partially culturally continuous with early [[New England]] culture for many years.<ref>''The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865'', by Lois Kimball Matthews, pp. 201-202</ref>

But by 1850, the three Eastern states that had contributed the most residents to LaPorte County were New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia, surpassing those migrants from New England. LaPorte County had the largest number of Southerners north of the Wabash Valley.<ref>Lang, Elfrieda. “Southern Migration to Northern Indiana Before 1850.” ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 50, Issue 4, pp 349-356. 1954.

During the Civil War, the ''Louisville Journal'' noted that the 29th Indiana Regiment (mustered out of LaPorte) \"may almost be regarded as a Kentucky regiment for a large majority of its members are either natives or descendants of native Kentuckians\".<ref>''La Porte Herald,'' 19 October 1861, p. 2</ref>

When the county was initially proposed and organized, its boundaries did not extend as far south or east as they do today.  A section of land north of the [[Kankakee River]] originally belonged to Starke County.  However, residents living in that area had difficulty crossing the river in order to reach the rest of the county.  It was necessary to travel some distance east to Lemon's bridge, before making the journey south.  Effectively isolated from the rest of Starke County, these residents asked that their land be annexed to LaPorte County, which was completed on January 28, 1842.  Thereafter, the Kankakee River formed the southern boundary of the county.  Finally, on January 10, 1850, some twenty sections of land were annexed from [[St. Joseph County, Indiana|St. Joseph County]] to the east, giving LaPorte County the boundaries that essentially exist to this day.<ref name=\"La Porte County Historical Society\" />

Whether the correct spelling of the city and county is \"La Porte\" or \"LaPorte\" is disputed,<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Stephens |format= |coauthors= |title=La(?)Porte's Space Odyssey |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/southbendtribune/access/2570281421.html?FMT=ABS |work=[[South Bend Tribune]] |publisher= |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2012-01-26 }}</ref> although state law refers to \"LaPorte County.\"<ref>[http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title33/ar33/ch46.pdf Indiana Code 33-33-46].</ref><ref>[http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar3/ch5.html Indiana Code 3-3-5].</ref>

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

== History ==
LaPorte County was formed in 1832. ''La porte'' means \"the door\" or \"the port\" in [[French language|French]].<ref name=\"origin\"/> French travelers or explorers so named the area after discovering a natural opening in the dense forests that used to exist in this region, providing a gateway to lands further west.<ref>Calumet Beginnings: Schoon, Kenneth J. (2003)</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=De Witt Clinton Goodrich & Charles Richard Tuttle|publisher=R. S. Peale & co.|year=1875|location=Indiana|title=An Illustrated History of the State of Indiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YDIUAAAAYAAJ| pages=560}}</ref>

Before European-American settlement, all of the land that forms modern-day LaPorte County, and adjacent [[Starke County, Indiana|Starke County]] to the south belonged to the [[Potawatomi people|Potawatomi]] Indian nation. These Indians were forcibly removed to Kansas by the United States government in 1838, and many died on what survivors called the [[Potawatomi Trail of Death|Trail of Death]].<ref name=\"La Porte County Historical Society\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517164346/http://laportecountyhistory.org/history.htm|url-status=dead|title=La Porte County Historical Society|archivedate=May 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.potawatomi-tda.org/ptodhist.htm|title=History of 1838 Trail of Death|work=potawatomi-tda.org}}</ref>

LaPorte County's initial [[European-American]] settlers were [[Yankee]] migrants, that is to say they were from [[New England]] or were from [[upstate New York]] and had parents who were from [[New England]], and were descended from the [[English American|English]] [[Puritans]] who settled [[New England]] in the colonial era.  They were part of a wave of [[New England]] settlers moving west into what was then the [[Northwest Territory]] after the completion of the [[Erie Canal]] through the Mohawk Valley of New York State.

These first settlers in LaPorte County specifically hailed from the [[Massachusetts]] towns of Granville, Boston, Bridgewater, West Bridgewater, Andover, Nantucket Island, and [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]]; the [[Connecticut]] towns of Colchester, Wethersfield, Granby, and New Haven; the [[New Hampshire]] towns of [[Bradford, New Hampshire|Bradford]], [[Amherst, New Hampshire|Amherst]] and Goffstown; the Vermont villages of Dorset, Albany and Fairfax; many also came from [[Orange County, Vermont]], [[Caledonia County, Vermont]] and [[Penobscot County, Maine]].  They were mainly members of the [[Congregational church|Congregational Church]]. As result of the [[Second Great Awakening]], many became [[Baptists]] and many also converted to [[Pentecostalism]] and [[Methodism]].  When they arrived in what is now LaPorte County, there was nothing but virgin forest and prairie. The [[New England]] settlers cleared roads and brush, developed farms, constructed churches, erected government buildings, and established post routes.  As a result of this migration, La Porte County was partially culturally continuous with early [[New England]] culture for many years.<ref>''The Expansion of New England: The Spread of New England Settlement and Institutions to the Mississippi River, 1620-1865'', by Lois Kimball Matthews, pp. 201-202</ref>

But by 1850, the three Eastern states that had contributed the most residents to LaPorte County were New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia, surpassing those migrants from New England. LaPorte County had the largest number of Southerners north of the Wabash Valley.<ref>Lang, Elfrieda. “Southern Migration to Northern Indiana Before 1850.” ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 50, Issue 4, pp 349-356. 1954.

Rose, Gregory C.” Upland Southerners: The County Origins of Southern Migrants.” ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' Volume 82, Issue 3, September 1991.</ref>

During the Civil War, the ''Louisville Journal'' noted that the 29th Indiana Regiment (mustered out of LaPorte) \"may almost be regarded as a Kentucky regiment for a large majority of its members are either natives or descendants of native Kentuckians\".<ref>''La Porte Herald,'' 19 October 1861, p. 2</ref>

When the county was initially proposed and organized, its boundaries did not extend as far south or east as they do today.  A section of land north of the [[Kankakee River]] originally belonged to Starke County.  However, residents living in that area had difficulty crossing the river in order to reach the rest of the county.  It was necessary to travel some distance east to Lemon's bridge, before making the journey south.  Effectively isolated from the rest of Starke County, these residents asked that their land be annexed to LaPorte County, which was completed on January 28, 1842.  Thereafter, the Kankakee River formed the southern boundary of the county.  Finally, on January 10, 1850, some twenty sections of land were annexed from [[St. Joseph County, Indiana|St. Joseph County]] to the east, giving LaPorte County the boundaries that essentially exist to this day.<ref name=\"La Porte County Historical Society\" />

Whether the correct spelling of the city and county is \"La Porte\" or \"LaPorte\" is disputed,<ref>{{cite news |first=Dave |last=Stephens |format= |coauthors= |title=La(?)Porte's Space Odyssey |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/southbendtribune/access/2570281421.html?FMT=ABS |work=[[South Bend Tribune]] |publisher= |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2012-01-26 }}</ref> although state law refers to \"LaPorte County.\"<ref>[http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title33/ar33/ch46.pdf Indiana Code 33-33-46].</ref><ref>[http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar3/ch5.html Indiana Code 3-3-5].</ref>

LaPorte County is noted for being the place of the [[Belle Gunness]] serial murders<!-- year? -->. Gunness lived on a farm on the outskirts of the county.

==Government==
{{see also|Government of Indiana}}

The county government is a constitutional body, and is granted specific powers by the [[Constitution of Indiana]], and by the [[Indiana Code]].

'''County Council:''' The county council is the legislative branch of the county government and controls all the spending and revenue collection in the county. Representatives are elected from county districts. The council members serve four-year terms. They are responsible for setting salaries, the annual budget, and special spending. The council also has limited authority to impose local taxes, in the form of an income and property tax that is subject to state level approval, excise taxes, and service taxes.<ref name = inc3623>{{cite web|author=[[Indiana Code]]|url=http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title36/ar2/ch3.html |title=Title 36, Article 2, Section 3|accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref><ref name = inc2102>{{cite web|author= [[Indiana Code]] |url= http://www.in.gov/legislative/ic/code/title3/ar10/ch2.pdf |format=PDF|title= Title 2, Article 10, Section 2 |accessdate=2008-09-16|publisher=IN.gov}}</ref>

'''Board of Commissioners:''' The executive body of the county is made of a board of commissioners. The commissioners are elected county-wide, in staggered terms, and each serves a four-year term. One of the commissioners, typically the most senior, serves as president. The commissioners are charged with executing the acts legislated by the council, collecting revenue, and managing the day-to-day functions of the county government.<ref name = inc3623/><ref name = inc2102/>

'''Court:''' The county has five elected trial court judges. They include the LaPorte Circuit Court and Superior Courts one through four.  The judges are elected to six-year terms on partisan ballots. Superior Courts three and four maintain small claims dockets. Decisions from any trial court may be appealed to the [[Indiana Court of Appeals]].<ref name = inc2102/> The Circuit Court and Superior court three are located in the city of La Porte; Superior courts one, two and four are located in Michigan City.

'''County Officials:''' The county has several other elected offices, including [[sheriff]], [[coroner]], [[auditor]], [[treasurer]], [[Recorder of deeds|recorder]], [[surveying|surveyor]], and circuit court [[Court clerk|clerk]]. Each of these elected officers serves a term of four years and oversees a different part of county government. Members elected to county government positions are required to declare [[political party|party]] affiliations and to be residents of the county.<ref name = inc2102/>

Winchester developed from the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town of [[Venta Belgarum]], which in turn developed from an [[Iron Age]] [[oppidum]]. Winchester's major landmark is [[Winchester Cathedral]], one of the largest cathedrals in Europe, with the distinction of having the longest nave and overall length of all [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals in Europe. The city is home to the [[University of Winchester]] and [[Winchester College]], the oldest public school in the United Kingdom still using its original buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==History==

===Prehistory===
The area around Winchester has been inhabited since [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistoric times]], with three [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[British hillforts|hillforts]], [[Oram's Arbour]], [[St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire|St. Catherine's Hill]], and Worthy Down all nearby. In the [[Late Iron Age]], a more urban settlement type developed, known as an ''[[oppidum]]'', although the archaeology of this phase remains obscure. It was overrun by the confederation of [[Gauls|Gaulish]] [[list of Celtic tribes|tribes]] known as the [[Belgae]] sometime in the 1st century BCE. It seems to have been known as '''Wentā''' or '''Venta''', derived from the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] for \"town\" or \"meeting place\",<ref>Matasović, Ranko. [http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/lemma.html?id=17429 \"wentā\" in the ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'' at ''Indo-European Etymological Dictionaries Online''. Brill Online, 2014.

===Roman period===
{{Main|Venta Belgarum}}
After the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], the settlement served as the capital ({{lang-la|civitas}}) of the Belgae and was distinguished as '''Venta Belgarum''', \"Venta of the Belgae\". Although in the early years of the Roman province it was of subsidiary importance to [[Silchester Roman Town|Silchester]] and [[Noviomagus Reginorum|Chichester]], Venta eclipsed them both by the latter half of the second century.<ref>Cunliffe B. ''Wessex to AD 1000'' 1997</ref> At the beginning of the third century, Winchester was given protective stone walls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-uk.com/DestinationsUK/Winchester.htm |title=Winchester |publisher=Historic-uk.com |date= |accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> At around this time the city covered an area of {{convert|144|acres}}, making it among the largest towns in Roman Britain by surface area.<ref name=\"Roman towns\">{{cite web|title=Major Roman Settlements|url=http://www.british-towns.net/maps/roman-roads-map |publisher=British towns|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref> There was a limited suburban area outside the walls.<ref>{{cite web|title=PJO archaeology|url=http://www.pjoarchaeology.co.uk/academic-consultancy/report-winchester-roman-cemeteries-and-suburbs.html|accessdate=22 January 2011}}</ref> Like many other Roman towns however, Winchester began to decline in the later fourth century.<ref name=\"Roman towns\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/winchester.html |title=A History of Winchester |publisher=Localhistories.org |date= |accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref>

===Medieval period===
After the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in 410, urban life seems to have continued at Venta Belgarum until around 450, and a small administrative centre might have continued after that on the site of the later Anglo-Saxon palace. [[David Nash Ford|Ford]] identifies the community as the {{nowrap|'''Cair Guinntguic'''}}<ref>[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}). [[Theodor Mommsen]] ({{abbr|ed.|Editor}}).

[[File:Anglo-Saxon Chronicle - Wintan ceastre (British Library Cotton MS Tiberius A VI, folio 12r).jpg|thumb|left|A mention of Wintan-ceastre in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'']]
The city became known as '''Wintan-ceastre''' (\"Fort Venta\") in [[Old English]].<ref name=\"Anglo-Saxon Dictionary\">{{cite web|title='Wintan-ceaster'|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/035936|website=Anglo Saxon Dictionary|publisher=Bosworth-Toller|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref> In 648, [[King Cenwalh of Wessex|King Cenwalh]] of [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]] erected the Church of SS Peter and Paul, later known as the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]]. This became a cathedral in the 660s when the West Saxon bishopric was transferred from [[Dorchester-on-Thames]]. The present form of the city dates from reconstruction in the late 9th century, when [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred the Great]] obliterated the Roman street plan in favour of a new grid in order to provide better defence against the [[Viking invasions of Britain|Vikings]]. The city's first mint appears to date from this period.<ref name=WB>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England|year=2014|edition=2nd|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|isbn=978-0-631-22492-1|title=Winchester|first=John|last=Crook|editor=Lapidge, Michael |display-editors=etal }}</ref>

In the early 10th century there were two new ecclesiastical establishments: the convent of [[Nunnaminster]], founded by Alfred's widow [[Ealhswith]],<ref>*{{cite encyclopedia |first=Marios|last =Costambeys |authorlink=| publisher = Oxford University Press | encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title= Ealhswith (d. 902)| year = 2004 | url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/39226 | accessdate= 21 June 2014|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/39226 }} {{ODNBsub}}</ref> and the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]]. Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] was a leading figure in the monastic reform movement of the later 10th century. He expelled the secular canons of both minsters and replaced them with monks. He created the drainage system, the \"Lockburn\", which served as the town drain until 1875, and still survives. Also in the late 10th century, the Old Minster was enlarged as a centre of the cult of the 9th century [[Bishop of Winchester]], Saint [[Swithun]]. The three minsters were the home of what architectural historian John Crook describes as \"the supreme artistic achievements\" of the ''Winchester School''.<ref name=WB/>

The consensus among historians of Anglo-Saxon England is that the court was mobile in this period and there was no fixed capital.<ref>{{cite book |last= Stenton|first= Frank M.|authorlink=Frank Stenton| title= Anglo-Saxon England|year= 1971|edition=3rd| publisher= Clarendon Press|page=539|isbn=978-0-19-280139-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Foot | first = Sarah | authorlink=Sarah Foot| title=Æthelstan: the first king of England|publisher=Yale University Press| year = 2011 |page=78|isbn= 978-0-300-12535-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Naismith |first=Rory |authorlink= |title=Citadel of the Saxons: The Rise of Early London|page=11 |publisher=I.

[[File:The Buttercross in Winchester.jpg|thumb|left|The Winchester [[Buttercross]] ]]
There was a fire in the city in 1141 during the [[Rout of Winchester]]. Much later, [[William of Wykeham]] played a role in the city's restoration. As [[Bishop of Winchester]] he was responsible for much of the current structure of the cathedral, and he founded the still extant public school [[Winchester College]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the city was an important centre of the wool trade, before going into a slow decline.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The [[curfew bell]] in the bell tower (near the clock in the picture), still sounds at 8:00 pm each evening.

Jews lived in Winchester from at least 1148, and in the 13th century the Jewish community in the city was one of the most important in England. There was an [[Archa (document store)|archa]] in the city, and the Jewish quarter was located in the city's heart (present day Jewry street). There were a series of [[blood libel]] claims against the Jewish community in the 1220s and 1230s, which likely was the cause of the hanging of the community's leader, Abraham Pinch, in front of the synagogue of which he was the head. [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] ransacked the Jewish quarter in 1264, and in 1290 all Jews were [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled]] from England.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Winchester |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/winchester |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>

===Modern period===
The City Cross (also known as the [[Buttercross]]) has been dated to the 15th century, and features 12 statues of the [[Virgin Mary]], other saints and various historical figures. Several statues appear to have been added throughout the structure's history. In 1770, [[Thomas Dummer]] purchased the Buttercross from the Corporation of Winchester, intending to have it re-erected at [[Cranbury Park]], near [[Otterbourne]]. When his workmen arrived to dismantle the cross, they were prevented from doing so by the people of the city, who \"organised a small riot\",<ref>{{cite web |title= The Buttercross, Winchester |url=http://www.cityofwinchester.co.uk/history/html/buttercross.html |year= 1998| publisher= City of Winchester |accessdate= 23 September 2009}}</ref> and they were forced to abandon their task. The agreement with the city was cancelled and Dummer erected a [[lath and plaster]] facsimile, which stood in the park for about sixty years before it was destroyed by the weather.<ref name = \"Yonge8\">{{cite web |last=Yonge |first=Charlotte M. |title= Chapter 8: Old Otterbourne |url= http://www.online-literature.com/charlotte-yonge/john-keble/8/ |year= 1898|work= [[John Keble]]'s Parishes |publisher= Online literature |accessdate=23 September 2009 |authorlink = Charlotte M.

It is now a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].<ref>{{cite web |title= City Cross or 'Butter Cross', Winchester |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1002938 | publisher= [[Historic England]] |accessdate= 16 December 2016}}</ref>

Three notable bronze sculptures can be seen in or from the High Street by major sculptors of the 19th and 20th centuries, the earliest a monumental statue of [[Queen Victoria]], now in the [[Great Hall]], by [[Sir Alfred Gilbert]] (also known as the sculptor of '[[Eros]]' in London's Piccadilly Circus), [[King Alfred]], facing the city with raised sword from the centre of The Broadway, by [[Hamo Thornycroft]] and the modern striking ''[[Horse and Rider (Frink)|Horse and Rider]]'' by [[Dame Elizabeth Frink]] at the entrance to the Law Courts.

In 2013, businesses involved in the housing market were reported by a local newspaper as saying that the city's architectural and historical interest, and its fast links to other towns and cities, had led Winchester to become one of the most expensive and desirable areas of the country and {{Fix|text=who?}}ranked Winchester as one of the least deprived areas in England and Wales.<ref name=WinchesterGreatest>{{cite news|title=Winchester hits top ten list of places to live in the UK|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/10898665.Winchester_hits_top_ten_list_of_places_to_live_in_the_UK/|accessdate=18 June 2014 |work=Hampshire Chronicle |date=26 December 2013}}</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|City of Winchester#Governance}}
[[File:Winchester proper ward borders.svg|thumb|Map of the wards of Winchester itself within the wider [[City of Winchester]] District]]

===Cathedral===
{{Main|Winchester Cathedral}}
[[File:WinCath30Je6-4836wiki.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Winchester Cathedral.]]
[[Winchester Cathedral]] was originally built in 1079 and remains the longest Gothic cathedral in Europe. It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th centuries and is the place of interment of numerous [[Bishop of Winchester|Bishops of Winchester]] (such as [[William of Wykeham]]), [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs (such as [[Egbert of Wessex]]) and later monarchs such as King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]].<ref name=\"RTGB\">{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Aidan |title=The Royal Tombs of Great Britain |location=London |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co. |year=2004}}</ref> It was once an important [[pilgrim]]age centre and housed the [[shrine]] of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]]. The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name=\"RTGB\" />) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.

Winchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.

The earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of [[The Pilgrims' School]], the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete{{clarify|date=September 2019}} rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals etc.

Entrance for pedestrians to the North [[garth (architecture)|garth]] of the cathedral is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice's tower, in the High Street.<ref>Hampshire Churches, Margaret Green,Winton Pubs.Ltd.1967. Page 90.</ref>

===Wolvesey Castle and Palace===
{{Main|Wolvesey Castle}}
[[Wolvesey Castle]] was the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] bishop's palace, dating from 1110, but standing on the site of an earlier Saxon structure. It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their wedding in the Cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.

===Castle===
{{Main|Winchester Castle}}
[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The \"Winchester Round Table\" in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]
Winchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}</ref> (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, based at the [[Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence training\">{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>

===Hospital of St Cross===
{{Main|Hospital of St Cross}}
[[File:The Hospital of St Cross.jpg|alt=The Hospital of St Cross|thumb|The Hospital of St Cross]]
The [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s. Since at least the 14th century, and still available today, a 'wayfarer's dole' of ale and bread has been handed out there. It was supposedly instigated to aid pilgrims on their way to [[Canterbury]].

== Winchester in fiction ==

===Medieval===
In the medieval narrative poem, [[Sir Orfeo]], the main character Sir Orfeo is King of Winchester, which is said to be the modern name of [[Thrace]]. The final combat of the romance hero [[Guy of Warwick]] against the giant [[Colbrand (giant)|Colbrand]] takes place outside the walls of Winchester.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] author [[Sir Thomas Malory]] identified Winchester as the mythical home of [[Camelot]] and [[King Arthur]] in [[Le Morte d'Arthur]], his collection of medieval legends about the Arthurian myths.  (Malory's editor [[William Caxton]] disputed this, insisting that Camelot must be in [[Wales]]).

===19th century===
A scene in ''[[The History of Henry Esmond|Henry Esmond]]'' (1852) by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] is set in the choir of Winchester cathedral. Winchester is in part the model for ''Barchester'' in the ''[[Chronicles of Barsetshire|Barsetshire]]'' novels of [[Anthony Trollope]], who attended Winchester College; ''[[The Warden]]'' (1855) is said to be based on a scandal at the [[Hospital of St Cross]]. A fictionalised Winchester appears as ''Wintoncester'' in [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]]'s ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891). Some of the action in [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Adventure of the Copper Beeches]]'' (1892) takes place in the city—the Black Swan hotel mentioned in the story formerly stood at the end of Southgate St and is still acknowledged by a figure on the outside of the building.

In [[Charles Kingsley]]'s romantic history ''[[Hereward the Wake (novel)|Hereward the Wake]]'' (1866), Hereward smashes his ash lance against the doors of the [[Westgate, Winchester]] showing by the strength of his arm that it is he. William the Conqueror is so impressed that he pardons him.

Winchester developed from the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town of [[Venta Belgarum]], which in turn developed from an [[Iron Age]] [[oppidum]]. Winchester's major landmark is [[Winchester Cathedral]], one of the largest cathedrals in Europe, with the distinction of having the longest nave and overall length of all [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals in Europe. The city is home to the [[University of Winchester]] and [[Winchester College]], the oldest public school in the United Kingdom still using its original buildings.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==History==

===Prehistory===
The area around Winchester has been inhabited since [[Prehistoric Britain|prehistoric times]], with three [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] [[British hillforts|hillforts]], [[Oram's Arbour]], [[St. Catherine's Hill, Hampshire|St. Catherine's Hill]], and Worthy Down all nearby. In the [[Late Iron Age]], a more urban settlement type developed, known as an ''[[oppidum]]'', although the archaeology of this phase remains obscure. It was overrun by the confederation of [[Gauls|Gaulish]] [[list of Celtic tribes|tribes]] known as the [[Belgae]] sometime in the 1st century BCE. It seems to have been known as '''Wentā''' or '''Venta''', derived from the [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] for \"town\" or \"meeting place\",<ref>Matasović, Ranko. [http://iedo.brillonline.nl/dictionaries/lemma.html?id=17429 \"wentā\" in the ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic'' at ''Indo-European Etymological Dictionaries Online''. Brill Online, 2014.

===Roman period===
{{Main|Venta Belgarum}}
After the [[Roman conquest of Britain]], the settlement served as the capital ({{lang-la|civitas}}) of the Belgae and was distinguished as '''Venta Belgarum''', \"Venta of the Belgae\". Although in the early years of the Roman province it was of subsidiary importance to [[Silchester Roman Town|Silchester]] and [[Noviomagus Reginorum|Chichester]], Venta eclipsed them both by the latter half of the second century.<ref>Cunliffe B.

===Medieval period===
After the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain]] in 410, urban life seems to have continued at Venta Belgarum until around 450, and a small administrative centre might have continued after that on the site of the later Anglo-Saxon palace. [[David Nash Ford|Ford]] identifies the community as the {{nowrap|'''Cair Guinntguic'''}}<ref>[[Nennius]] ({{abbr|attrib.|Traditional attribution}}). [[Theodor Mommsen]] ({{abbr|ed.|Editor}}).

The city became known as '''Wintan-ceastre''' (\"Fort Venta\") in [[Old English]].<ref name=\"Anglo-Saxon Dictionary\">{{cite web|title='Wintan-ceaster'|url=http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/035936|website=Anglo Saxon Dictionary|publisher=Bosworth-Toller|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref> In 648, [[King Cenwalh of Wessex|King Cenwalh]] of [[Kingdom of Wessex|Wessex]] erected the Church of SS Peter and Paul, later known as the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]]. This became a cathedral in the 660s when the West Saxon bishopric was transferred from [[Dorchester-on-Thames]]. The present form of the city dates from reconstruction in the late 9th century, when [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred the Great]] obliterated the Roman street plan in favour of a new grid in order to provide better defence against the [[Viking invasions of Britain|Vikings]].

Bishop [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] was a leading figure in the monastic reform movement of the later 10th century. He expelled the secular canons of both minsters and replaced them with monks. He created the drainage system, the \"Lockburn\", which served as the town drain until 1875, and still survives. Also in the late 10th century, the Old Minster was enlarged as a centre of the cult of the 9th century [[Bishop of Winchester]], Saint [[Swithun]]. The three minsters were the home of what architectural historian John Crook describes as \"the supreme artistic achievements\" of the ''Winchester School''.<ref name=WB/>

There was a fire in the city in 1141 during the [[Rout of Winchester]]. Much later, [[William of Wykeham]] played a role in the city's restoration. As [[Bishop of Winchester]] he was responsible for much of the current structure of the cathedral, and he founded the still extant public school [[Winchester College]]. During the [[Middle Ages]], the city was an important centre of the wool trade, before going into a slow decline.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} The [[curfew bell]] in the bell tower (near the clock in the picture), still sounds at 8:00 pm each evening.

Jews lived in Winchester from at least 1148, and in the 13th century the Jewish community in the city was one of the most important in England. There was an [[Archa (document store)|archa]] in the city, and the Jewish quarter was located in the city's heart (present day Jewry street). There were a series of [[blood libel]] claims against the Jewish community in the 1220s and 1230s, which likely was the cause of the hanging of the community's leader, Abraham Pinch, in front of the synagogue of which he was the head. [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] ransacked the Jewish quarter in 1264, and in 1290 all Jews were [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled]] from England.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Winchester |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/winchester |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>

===Modern period===
The City Cross (also known as the [[Buttercross]]) has been dated to the 15th century, and features 12 statues of the [[Virgin Mary]], other saints and various historical figures. Several statues appear to have been added throughout the structure's history. In 1770, [[Thomas Dummer]] purchased the Buttercross from the Corporation of Winchester, intending to have it re-erected at [[Cranbury Park]], near [[Otterbourne]]. When his workmen arrived to dismantle the cross, they were prevented from doing so by the people of the city, who \"organised a small riot\",<ref>{{cite web |title= The Buttercross, Winchester |url=http://www.cityofwinchester.co.uk/history/html/buttercross.html |year= 1998| publisher= City of Winchester |accessdate= 23 September 2009}}</ref> and they were forced to abandon their task. The agreement with the city was cancelled and Dummer erected a [[lath and plaster]] facsimile, which stood in the park for about sixty years before it was destroyed by the weather.<ref name = \"Yonge8\">{{cite web |last=Yonge |first=Charlotte M. |title= Chapter 8: Old Otterbourne |url= http://www.online-literature.com/charlotte-yonge/john-keble/8/ |year= 1898|work= [[John Keble]]'s Parishes |publisher= Online literature |accessdate=23 September 2009 |authorlink = Charlotte M.

Three notable bronze sculptures can be seen in or from the High Street by major sculptors of the 19th and 20th centuries, the earliest a monumental statue of [[Queen Victoria]], now in the [[Great Hall]], by [[Sir Alfred Gilbert]] (also known as the sculptor of '[[Eros]]' in London's Piccadilly Circus), [[King Alfred]], facing the city with raised sword from the centre of The Broadway, by [[Hamo Thornycroft]] and the modern striking ''[[Horse and Rider (Frink)|Horse and Rider]]'' by [[Dame Elizabeth Frink]] at the entrance to the Law Courts.

In 2013, businesses involved in the housing market were reported by a local newspaper as saying that the city's architectural and historical interest, and its fast links to other towns and cities, had led Winchester to become one of the most expensive and desirable areas of the country and {{Fix|text=who?}}ranked Winchester as one of the least deprived areas in England and Wales.<ref name=WinchesterGreatest>{{cite news|title=Winchester hits top ten list of places to live in the UK|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/10898665.Winchester_hits_top_ten_list_of_places_to_live_in_the_UK/|accessdate=18 June 2014 |work=Hampshire Chronicle |date=26 December 2013}}</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|City of Winchester#Governance}}
[[File:Winchester proper ward borders.svg|thumb|Map of the wards of Winchester itself within the wider [[City of Winchester]] District]]

===Cathedral===
{{Main|Winchester Cathedral}}
[[File:WinCath30Je6-4836wiki.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Winchester Cathedral.]]
[[Winchester Cathedral]] was originally built in 1079 and remains the longest Gothic cathedral in Europe. It contains much fine architecture spanning the 11th to the 16th centuries and is the place of interment of numerous [[Bishop of Winchester|Bishops of Winchester]] (such as [[William of Wykeham]]), [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] monarchs (such as [[Egbert of Wessex]]) and later monarchs such as King [[Canute the Great|Canute]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]].<ref name=\"RTGB\">{{cite book |last=Dodson |first=Aidan |title=The Royal Tombs of Great Britain |location=London |publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co. |year=2004}}</ref> It was once an important [[pilgrim]]age centre and housed the [[shrine]] of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]]. The ancient [[Pilgrims' Way]] to [[Canterbury]] begins at Winchester. The plan of the earlier [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] is laid out in the grass adjoining the cathedral. The [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] (the original burial place of [[Alfred the Great]] and [[Edward the Elder]]<ref name=\"RTGB\" />) once stood beside it. The cathedral has a girls choir and a boys choir, who sing regularly in the cathedral.

Winchester Cathedral Close contains a number of historic buildings from the time when the cathedral was also a [[priory]]. Of particular note is the ''[[Deanery]]'', which dates back to the 13th century. It was originally the Prior's House, and was the birthplace of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] in 1486. Not far away is ''Cheyney Court'', a mid 15th-century [[timber framing|timber-framed]] house incorporating the Porter's Lodge for the Priory Gate. It was the Bishop's court house.

The earliest [[hammer-beam]]ed building still standing in England is situated in the Cathedral Close, next to the Dean's garden. It is known as the ''Pilgrims' Hall'', as it was part of the hostelry used to accommodate the many pilgrims to Saint Swithun's shrine. Left-overs from the lavish banquets of the Priors (the monastic predecessors of the later Deans) would be given to the pilgrims, who were welcome to spend the night in the hall. It is thought by Winchester City Council to have been built in 1308. Now part of [[The Pilgrims' School]], the hall is used by the school for assemblies in the morning, drama lessons, plays, orchestral practices, Cathedral Waynflete{{clarify|date=September 2019}} rehearsals, the school's Senior Commoners' Choir rehearsals etc.

Entrance for pedestrians to the North [[garth (architecture)|garth]] of the cathedral is via the Norman arches of Saint Maurice's tower, in the High Street.<ref>Hampshire Churches, Margaret Green,Winton Pubs.Ltd.1967. Page 90.</ref>

===Wolvesey Castle and Palace===
{{Main|Wolvesey Castle}}
[[Wolvesey Castle]] was the [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] bishop's palace, dating from 1110, but standing on the site of an earlier Saxon structure. It was enhanced by [[Henry de Blois]] during [[the Anarchy]] of his brother King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]]'s reign. He was besieged there for some days. In the 16th century, Queen [[Mary I of England|Mary Tudor]] and King [[Philip II of Spain]] were guests just before their wedding in the Cathedral. The building is now a ruin (maintained by [[English Heritage]]), but the chapel was incorporated into the new palace built in the 1680s, only one wing of which survives.

===Castle===
{{Main|Winchester Castle}}
[[File:Winchester RoundTable.jpg|thumb|The \"Winchester Round Table\" in the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle]]]]
Winchester is well known for the Great Hall of [[Winchester Castle|its castle]], which was built in the 12th century. The Great Hall was rebuilt sometime between 1222 and 1235, and still exists in this form. It is famous for ''[[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]]'', which has hung in the hall from at least 1463. The table actually dates from the 13th century, and as such is not contemporary to Arthur. Despite this it is still of considerable historical interest and attracts many tourists. The table was originally unpainted, but was painted for [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in 1522. The names of the legendary [[Knights of the Round Table]] are written around the edge of the table surmounted by King Arthur on his throne. Opposite the table are [[Prince Charles]]'s 'Wedding Gates'. In the grounds of the Great Hall is a recreation of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] garden. Apart from the hall, only a few excavated remains of the stronghold survive among the modern Law Courts. The buildings were supplanted by the adjacent [[King's House, Winchester|King's House]], now incorporated into the [[Peninsula Barracks]] where there are five military museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winchestermilitarymuseums.co.uk|accessdate=15 April 2012|title=Winchester's Military Museums|publisher=Winchester's Military Museums}}</ref> (The training that used to be carried out at the barracks is now done by the [[Army Training Regiment]] Winchester, based at the [[Sir John Moore Barracks]], {{convert|2|mi|km|sigfig=1}} outside the city).<ref name=\"Ministry of Defence training\">{{cite web|title=MOD Training and Education|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/training_education/6959.aspx|website=MOD Training|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref>

===Hospital of St Cross===
{{Main|Hospital of St Cross}}
[[File:The Hospital of St Cross.jpg|alt=The Hospital of St Cross|thumb|The Hospital of St Cross]]
The [[almshouse]]s and vast [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[chapel]] of [[Hospital of St Cross]] were founded just outside the city centre by [[Henry de Blois]] in the 1130s. Since at least the 14th century, and still available today, a 'wayfarer's dole' of ale and bread has been handed out there. It was supposedly instigated to aid pilgrims on their way to [[Canterbury]].

==Transport==

===Road===
Winchester is located near the [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]] and at the meeting of the [[A34 road (England)|A34]], [[A31 road (England)|A31]], [[A3090 road|A3090]] and [[A272 road|A272]] roads. Once a major traffic bottleneck, the city still suffers from congestion at peak times. It is just to the south of the [[A303 road|A303]] and [[A30 road|A30]].

====Roman road====
A [[Roman road]] originating in [[Salisbury]] called The [[Clarendon Way]] ends in Winchester.<ref name=hcc-roman>{{cite web|title=The Clarendon Way|url=https://www3.hants.gov.uk/longdistance/clarendon-way.htm|publisher=Hampshire County Council|accessdate=8 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924134748/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/longdistance/clarendon-way.htm|archive-date=24 September 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Clarendon Way is now a recreational footpath.

Historically it was also served by a line to London via [[Alton railway station|Alton]], which partially survives as the [[Watercress Line]]. The closure of this line removed an alternative route between London and Winchester when, due to engineering works or other reasons, the main line was temporarily unusable.  There was a second station called [[Winchester (Chesil) railway station|Winchester Chesil]] served by the [[Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway]], this closed in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Hampshire County Council\">{{cite news |title=Winchester Bus & Train Travel Times|publisher=Hampshire County Council|year=2011}}</ref>  This line provided a link to the [[The Midlands|Midlands]] and the [[North]], bypassing the present longer route through [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]].

== Winchester in fiction ==

===Medieval===
In the medieval narrative poem, [[Sir Orfeo]], the main character Sir Orfeo is King of Winchester, which is said to be the modern name of [[Thrace]]. The final combat of the romance hero [[Guy of Warwick]] against the giant [[Colbrand (giant)|Colbrand]] takes place outside the walls of Winchester.

The [[Late Middle Ages]] author [[Sir Thomas Malory]] identified Winchester as the mythical home of [[Camelot]] and [[King Arthur]] in [[Le Morte d'Arthur]], his collection of medieval legends about the Arthurian myths.  (Malory's editor [[William Caxton]] disputed this, insisting that Camelot must be in [[Wales]]).

===19th century===
A scene in ''[[The History of Henry Esmond|Henry Esmond]]'' (1852) by [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] is set in the choir of Winchester cathedral. Winchester is in part the model for ''Barchester'' in the ''[[Chronicles of Barsetshire|Barsetshire]]'' novels of [[Anthony Trollope]], who attended Winchester College; ''[[The Warden]]'' (1855) is said to be based on a scandal at the [[Hospital of St Cross]]. A fictionalised Winchester appears as ''Wintoncester'' in [[Thomas Hardy|Hardy]]'s ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' (1891). Some of the action in [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Adventure of the Copper Beeches]]'' (1892) takes place in the city—the Black Swan hotel mentioned in the story formerly stood at the end of Southgate St and is still acknowledged by a figure on the outside of the building.

In [[Charles Kingsley]]'s romantic history ''[[Hereward the Wake (novel)|Hereward the Wake]]'' (1866), Hereward smashes his ash lance against the doors of the [[Westgate, Winchester]] showing by the strength of his arm that it is he. William the Conqueror is so impressed that he pardons him.

===20th century===
A fictitious estate near Winchester is the scene of a crime in the [[Sherlock Holmes]] adventure, ''[[The Problem of Thor Bridge]]'' (1922).

In [[Gerry Anderson]]'s 1967 and 1968 programme ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', background material published by, or with the approval of, Anderson identifies Winchester as the birthplace of the main character, [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]], real name Paul Metcalfe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Captain Scarlet bio|url=http://www.spectrum-headquarters.com/captain_scarlet.html |publisher=Aardman|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>

Winchester is the main location of [[Samuel Youd|John Christopher]]'s post-apocalyptic science fiction series, ''[[Sword of the Spirits]]''.

The Siege of Winchester in 1141, part of [[The Anarchy]] (a civil war) between [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda]], is an important plot element in the detective novel [[An Excellent Mystery (novel)|''An Excellent Mystery'']], part of the [[Brother Cadfael]] chronicles by [[Edith Pargeter]] writing as Ellis Peters. In [[Philip Pullman]]'s novel ''[[The Subtle Knife]]'' (part of the ''[[His Dark Materials]]'' trilogy) the main male protagonist, Will Parry, comes from Winchester. However, little of the book is set there.

In the movie ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]'', King Uther's first conquest of Britain begins with Winchester, which Merlin foresaw would fall.

In the novel ''[[The Pillars of the Earth]]'', by [[Ken Follett]], which traces English historical events from 1123 C.E. to 1174 C.E., Winchester and its cathedral figure prominently in several chapters. The fictional town of Kingsbridge in the novel is based on Winchester, as Follett explained in the first episode of his [[Channel 4]] 2013 documentary series ''Ken Follett's Journey into the Dark Ages''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/ken-folletts-journey-into-the-dark-ages |title=Ken Follett's Journey into the Dark Ages |publisher=Channel 4 |year=2013 |accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref> Accounts of wool merchants and their trading with sheep farmers in Winchester are related to the reader.

The '''Canada lynx''' (''Lynx canadensis'') is a medium-sized [[lynx]] native to [[North America]]. It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.

The Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada—when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.

This lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.

A study of the differences (in factors such as coat colour, cranial measurements and weights) between the mainland and Newfoundland forms showed that apart from a few variations (for instance, the Newfoundland lynx features a darker coat than the mainland subspecies), the standard measurements are not significantly distinct. Noting only a few differences between the two forms, the study suggested the Newfoundland lynx to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] only recently from the mainland form. The lack of appreciable subspecific distinctions led the researchers to doubt the vaidity of the Newfoundland lynx as a separate subspecies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Zyll de Jong |first1=C.

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Lynx (5300913523).jpg|thumb|A close facial view of the Canada lynx. The black ear tufts are characteristic of lynxes.]]

The Canada lynx is a lean, medium-sized cat characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the bobcat, the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx is [[sexually dimorphic]], with males larger and heavier than females.

=== Relationship with the snowshoe hare ===

A [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist predator]], the Canada lynx depends heavily on snowshoe hares for food.<ref name=Hunter/> Snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada undergo cyclic rises and falls—at times the population densities can fall from as high as {{convert|2,300|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}} to as low as {{convert|12|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. Consequently, a period of hare scarcity occurs every 8 to 11 years. An example of a prey-predator cycle, the cyclic variations in snowshoe hare populations significantly affect the numbers of their predators—lynxes and [[coyote]]s—in the region. When the hare populations plummet, lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares, and tend to not produce litters; as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx.<ref name=\"Brand1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=C.J.|last2=Keith|first2=L.B.|title=Lynx demography during a snowshoe hare decline in Alberta|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1979|volume=43|issue=4|pages=827–849|doi=10.2307/3808267|jstor=3808267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Hofer |first4=E.J. |title=Numerical responses of coyotes and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1997 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=150–162 |doi=10.2307/3546526|jstor=3546526 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=R.M.P. |last2=Krebs |first2=C.J. |title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=1985 |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=2817–2824 |doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> In northern Canada, the abundance of lynxes can be estimated from the records kept of the number caught each year for their fur; records have been kept by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] since the 1730s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=M.S. |year=1977|title=Hares, lynx, and trappers |journal= The American Naturalist|volume= 111|issue=980 |pages=806–8 |doi=10.1086/283212 |jstor=2460337}}</ref> These cycles have been cited as one of the few examples of the [[Lotka-Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations]], caused by the interplay of three major factors—food, predation and social interaction.<ref name=\"krebs2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Krebs |first1=C.J. |last2=Boonstra |first2=R. |last3=Boutin |first3=S. |last4=Sinclair |first4=A.R.E. |title=What drives the 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares?: The ten-year cycle of snowshoe hares—one of the most striking features of the boreal forest— is a product of the interaction between predation and food supplies, as large-scale experiments in the Yukon have demonstrated |journal=BioScience |date=2001 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0025:WDTYCO]2.0.CO;2|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/51/1/25/26890541/51-1-25.pdf}}</ref> A study involving statistical modelling of the interspecific relations of the snowshoe hare, the plant species it feeds on and its predators (including the Canada lynx) suggested that while the demographics of the lynx depend primarily on the hare, the hare's dynamics depend both on the plant species in its diet and predators, of which the Canada lynx is just one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stenseth |first1=N.C. |last2=Falck |first2=W. |last3=Bjørnstad |first3=O.N. |last4=Krebs |first4=C.J. |title=Population regulation in snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx: Asymmetric food web configurations between hare and lynx |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1997 |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=5147–52 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.10.5147 |pmid=9144205 |pmc=24646 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.5147C |url=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/94/10/5147.full.pdf}}</ref> Environmental factors such as forest fires, precipitation and snowfall might also significantly affect this prey-predator cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=J.F. |title=Forest fires and the snowshoe hare-Canada lynx cycle |journal=Oecologia |date=1978 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–374 |doi=10.1007/BF00346252}}</ref>

===Home ranges===
[[File:Canada lynx (6002291242).jpg|thumb|Lynxes are typically solitary with minimal social bonds.]]
Canada lynxes establish [[home range]]s that vary widely in size, depending upon the method of measurement. The two common methods are examining the tracks of the lynx on snow (snow-tracking) and [[Wildlife radio telemetry|radio telemetry]]; snow-tracking generally gives smaller sizes for home ranges. Studies based on snow-tracking have estimated home range sizes of {{convert|11.1|–|49.5|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those based on radio telemetry have given the area between {{convert|8|and|783|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lox/> Like other cats, Canada lynxes [[Territorial marking|scent-mark]] their ranges by spraying urine and depositing faeces on snow or tree stumps and other prominent sites in and around their range.<ref name=Sunquist/>

Factors such as availability of prey (primarily snowshoe hare), density of lynxes and the topography of the habitat determine the shape and size of the home range.<ref name=lox/> Studies have tried to correlate the abundance of snowshoe hares in an area with the sizes of lynx home ranges in that area. A 1985 study showed that the mean size of home ranges trebled—from {{convert|13.2|to|39.2|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}—when the density of hares fell from {{convert|14.7|to|1|/ha|/acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=R.M.P.|last2=Krebs|first2=C.J.|title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1985|volume=63|issue=12|pages=2817–24|doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> However, a few other studies have reported different responses from lynxes at times of prey scarcity; some lynxes do not show any changes in their ranges, while others may resort to hunting in small areas, occupying small home ranges.<ref name=lox/> Canada lynxes generally do not leave their home ranges frequently, though limited prey availability can force lynxes to disperse or expand their ranges.<ref name=Poole1995>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Spatial organization of a lynx population|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1995|volume=73|issue=4|pages=632–41|doi=10.1139/z95-074}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Dispersal patterns of lynx in the Northwest Territories|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1997|volume=61|issue=2|pages=497–505|doi=10.2307/3802607|jstor=3802607}}</ref>

Males tend to occupy larger ranges than do females; for instance, data from a 1980 radio telemetric analysis in [[Minnesota]] showed that home ranges of males spread over {{convert|145|–|243|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those of females covered {{convert|51|–|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mech|first1=L.D.|title=Age, sex, reproduction, and spatial organization of lynxes colonizing Northeastern Minnesota|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=1980|volume=61|issue=2|pages=261–7|jstor=1380047|doi=10.2307/1380047}}</ref> In another radio telemetric study in 1985 in [[Montana]], male home ranges averaged {{convert|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and those of females averaged {{convert|43.1|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Brainerd|first=S.M.|title=Reproductive ecology of bobcats and lynx in western Montana|type=M.Sc. thesis |publisher=[[University of Montana]]|date=1985|pages=1–85}}</ref> In a study in the southern [[Northwest Territories]], ranges of individuals of opposite sexes were found to overlap extensively, while the ranges of individuals of the same sex hardly coincided.

A [[Genetics|genetic]] study showed that lynxes at the periphery of a population, given their smaller numbers and greater susceptibility to variations in the range, face more difficulty in breeding with lynxes toward the centre of the population and hence show lower [[heterozygosity]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=M.K. |last2=Mills |first2=L.S. |last3=Ortega |first3=Y. |last4=Ruggiero |first4=L.F. |last5=Allendorf |first5=F.W. |title=Landscape location affects genetic variation of Canada lynx (''Lynx canadensis'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=2003 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1807–16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01878.x|pmid=12803633 }}</ref>

===Diet and hunting===
[[File:Snowshoe Hare (6187109754).jpg|thumb|left|[[Snowshoe hare]], the primary prey of the Canada lynx]]
The Canada lynx preys primarily and almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. These hares comprise 35–97% of their diet; the proportion varies by the season and the abundance of hares.<ref name=Hunter/> However, at times when the numbers of the hare drop, lynxes will include other animals in their diet—such as ducks, [[grouse]], moles, [[ptarmigan]], [[red squirrel]]s, voles and young [[ungulate]]s ([[Dall's sheep]], [[mule deer]] and [[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]])—though snowshoe hares continue to be the primary component. The Canada lynx tends to be less selective in summer and autumn, adding small mammals as a minor component of their diet besides the hare. The reason behind this is unclear—it could be due to greater abundance of alternate prey, or reduced success in hunting hares.<ref name=ruggiero/> A study in Alaska found that lynxes played a role in the decrease in populations of [[red fox]], caribou and Dall's sheep when hares were very low in number.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephenson |first1=R.O. |last2=Grangaard |first2=D.V. |last3=Burch |first3=J. |title=Lynx, ''Felis lynx'', predation on red foxes, ''Vulpes vulpes'', caribou, ''Rangifer tarandus'', and Dall sheep, ''Ovis dalli'', in Alaska |journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist |date=1991 |volume=105 |pages=255–62 |url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/library/pdfs/wildlife/propubs/91_stephenson_etal_lynx_predation_redfoxes_caribou_dallsheep_ak.pdf}}</ref> Canada lynxes ingest {{convert|0.6|–|1.2|kg|lb}} of food everyday.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes have also been reported feeding occasionally on [[Succulent plant|succulent]] [[sedge]]s and grasses.<ref name=yukongov/>

[[File:Lynx-canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|A lynx stalking its prey]]
Both coyotes and Canada lynxes are major predators of the snowshoe hare. A study showed that compared to lynxes, the feet of coyotes sink deeper in the snow due to their smaller size and hence a larger body mass to foot area ratio, prompting them to ambush their prey instead of chasing it like lynxes often do.<ref name=\"murray1991\">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=D.L. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |title=The influence of snow on lynx and coyote movements: does morphology affect behavior? |journal=Oecologia |date=1991 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=463–9 |doi=10.1007/BF00317707|pmid=28312614 |bibcode=1991Oecol..88..463M }}</ref> A study of the two species in southwest [[Yukon Territory]] showed that when the numbers of the hare increased, both predators killed more hares than were necessary for their subsistence; lynxes need to kill 0.4 to 0.5 hare per day to meet their energy requirements, but were observed to kill 1.2 hares per day during this period. Coyotes, with a success rate of 36.9%, emerged as more successful hunters than lynxes that succeeded in 28.7% of their hunts; however this may have resulted from the greater number of adult coyotes in the studied population. Lynxes rarely cached their kills, unlike coyotes, and this may have led to incomplete consumption of some kills. During the cyclic decrease in snowshoe hare numbers, both predators hunted for the same time period as they did when hares were abundant, but lynxes killed more hares than they did earlier. Moreover, lynxes supplemented their diet with red squirrels.<ref name=ODonoghue/><ref name=dono98>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Murray|first4=D.L. |last5=Hofer |first5=E.J.| title=Behavioural responses of coyote and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1998 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.2307/3546927|jstor=3546927 }}</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Canada Lynx Mom and Kitten (15250932421).jpg|thumb|left|A juvenile with its mother]]

The mating season is roughly a month long, from March to early April. Urine marking and mating calls are part of [[Display (zoology)|display behaviour]], and increases the interaction between individuals of opposite sexes. Females can be [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]] when the availability of mates is low, or spontaneous ovulators when several mates are available. Females have only a single [[estrus cycle]]; estrus lasts for three to five days in captivity.<ref name=Sunquist /> Individuals have been observed making long wailing vocalizations, probably as mating calls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Some observations on the natural history and behaviour of the Canada Lynx, ''Lynx canadensis'' |journal=Canadian Field Naturalist |date=1998 |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=32-36 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Slough/publication/268872103_Some_observations_on_the_natural_history_and_behaviour_of_the_Canada_Lynx_Lynx_canadensis/links/547a2cbc0cf293e2da2b5e05.pdf}}</ref> Before birth, the female prepares a maternal den, usually in very thick brush, and typically inside thickets of shrubs, trees or woody debris.<ref name=Kaufman/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Slough |first=B.

After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born.<ref name=Sunquist /> Lynx reproductive cycles and litter sizes have been observed to vary with prey availability; litter size would typically contract in years of snowshoe hare decline (along with high infant mortality rates), and increase when hares were abundant.<ref name=\"breitenmoser\">{{cite journal |last1=Breitenmoser |first1=U. |last2=Slough |first2=B.G. |last3=Breitenmoser-Würsten |first3=C. |title=Predators of cyclic prey: is the Canada lynx a victim or profiteer of the snowshoe hare cycle? |journal=Oikos |date=1993 |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=551–554 |doi=10.2307/3544952|jstor=3544952 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Lynx population dynamics in an untrapped refugium |journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management |date=1996 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=946–961 |doi=10.2307/3802397}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=M.|first1=Garth |last2=Slough |first2=B.G. |last3=Boutin |first3=S.|title=Lynx recruitment during a snowshoe hare population peak and decline in southwest Yukon |journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management |date=1996 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=441–452 |doi=10.2307/3802247}}</ref> Kittens weigh from {{convert|175|to|235|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth, and initially have grayish buff fur with black markings. They are blind for the first 14 days, and [[weaning|weaned]] at 12 weeks. Most births occur from May to July. Kittens leave the den after about five weeks, and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but do not reach the full adult size until around two years old. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years. Canada lynxes have been reported to live for up to 16 years in wild, though most do not make it beyond 10 years; in captivity the lifespan may be as long as 27 years.<ref name=Sunquist /><ref name=Hunter/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Young Lynx spotted west of Drayton Valley Ab - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canada lynxes prefer dense [[boreal forest]]s.]]
The Canada lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s. Canada lynxes have been recorded up to an elevation of {{convert|4310|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/>

A Canada lynx was shot near [[Newton Abbot]] in the United Kingdom in 1903 after it attacked two dogs. The animal remained unidentified at the time and was preserved by [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]], and was finally identified in a 2014 study. The researchers concluded that it had probably been captive for some time, perhaps as an [[exotic pet]] or part of a travelling menagerie, but may have survived for a substantial period after escaping. They considered it \"the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=M. |last2=Naish |first2=D. |last3=Larson |first3=G. |last4=King |first4=C.L. |last5=Nowell |first5=G. |last6=Sakamoto |first6=M. |last7=Barnett |first7=R. |title=Multidisciplinary investigation of a ‘British big cat’: a lynx killed in southern England c. 1903 |journal=Historical Biology |date=2013 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=441–448 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2013.785541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22263874|title='Big cat' Canada lynx was on the loose in UK in 1903|last=Morelle|first=R.|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Postmedia News |title=That 'British big cat' called England's Loch Ness Monster?

== Threats and conservation ==
[[File:Felis lynx canadensis (Canadian lynx) fur skin back.jpg|thumb|left|Canada lynxes are trapped for their fur.]]
Canada lynxes are trapped in specific periods or seasons for fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada. To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality. Hybridization between Canada lynxes and bobcats has been reported in the southern periphery of the range, and does not appear to be a threat to Canada lynxes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Homyack, J.A. |year=2008|title=Canada Lynx-Bobcat (''Lynx canadensis × L.rufus'') hybrids at the southern periphery of lynx range in Maine, Minnesota and New Brunswick|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_homyack_j001.pdf|journal= American Midland Naturalist |volume=159|pages=504–508|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[504:CLLCLR]2.0.CO;2|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz, M.K. | year = 2004 | title = Hybridization between Canada Lynx and bobcats: genetic results and management implications| journal = Conservation Genetics | volume = 5 | pages = 349–355 | doi = 10.1023/B:COGE.0000031141.47148.8b | issue = 3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225195035_Hybridization_Between_Canada_Lynx_and_Bobcats_Genetic_Results_and_Management_Implications }}</ref>

The Canada lynx is abundant over its broad range, and is not significantly threatened by its legal use in the international fur trade since more than two centuries. Therefore, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) classifies the Canada lynx as [[Least Concern]]. However, populations are relatively lower in the southern half of the range and are protected from killing for fur trade. The lynx is listed as Endangered in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name=iucn/> On March 24, 2000, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) issued its Final Rule, which designated the Canada lynx a Threatened Species in 14 contiguous United States.<ref name=\"FedReg\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-03-24/pdf/00-7145.pdf|title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Threatened Status for the Contiguous U.S. Distinct Population Segment of the Canada Lynx and Related Rule |page=16051–16086|journal=Federal Register|volume= 65|issue= 58 |date= 24 March 2000|publisher=Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref> In 2005, the USFWS demarcated six major areas for revival where lynx populations had been reported in the past two decades: northern Maine and [[New Hampshire]], northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern [[Idaho]], the [[Kettle River Range]] and the \"Wedge area\" between the [[Kettle River (Columbia River tributary)|Kettle]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the northern Cascade Range of Washington, and the [[Greater Yellowstone]] area of [[Wyoming]], Montana and Idaho.<ref name=iucn/> By 2010, after an 11-year effort, the lynx had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado.

The '''Canada lynx''' (''Lynx canadensis'') is a medium-sized [[lynx]] native to [[North America]]. It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.

The Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada—when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.

This lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.

A study of the differences (in factors such as coat colour, cranial measurements and weights) between the mainland and Newfoundland forms showed that apart from a few variations (for instance, the Newfoundland lynx features a darker coat than the mainland subspecies), the standard measurements are not significantly distinct. Noting only a few differences between the two forms, the study suggested the Newfoundland lynx to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] only recently from the mainland form.

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Lynx (5300913523).jpg|thumb|A close facial view of the Canada lynx. The black ear tufts are characteristic of lynxes.]]

The Canada lynx is a lean, medium-sized cat characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the bobcat, the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx is [[sexually dimorphic]], with males larger and heavier than females. The lynx is between {{convert|73|and|107|cm|in|abbr=on}} in head-and-body length and stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder; females weigh around {{convert|5|–|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}} while males weigh around {{convert|6|–|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Sunquist/> Physical proportions do not vary significantly across the range and are probably [[natural selection|naturally selected]] to allow survival on smaller prey.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Werdelin|first1=L.|authorlink=Lars Werdelin|title=The evolution of lynxes|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|url=http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/ibelynxco/04_library/4_3_publications/W/Werdelin_1981_Evolution_of_lynxes.pdf|date=1981|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37–71|jstor=23734102|access-date=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005114343/http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/ibelynxco/04_library/4_3_publications/W/Werdelin_1981_Evolution_of_lynxes.pdf|archive-date=October 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Eurasian lynx, that prefers prey the size of a [[roe deer]], is twice the size of the Canada lynx, that feeds primarily on the [[snowshoe hare]].<ref name=Sunquist/> The stubby tail, typical of lynxes, is {{convert|5|–|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; while the bobcat's tail is black only in the upper part, the tail of the Canada lynx has a completely black tip.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=L.|title=Wild Cats of the World|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1-4729-2285-4|pages=146–151|url={{Google Books|id=hzNBCgAAQBAJ|page=146|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> 

The long, dense fur, uniformly coloured with little to no markings except on the underside, insulates the lynx in its frosty habitat.

=== Relationship with the snowshoe hare ===

A [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist predator]], the Canada lynx depends heavily on snowshoe hares for food.<ref name=Hunter/> Snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada undergo cyclic rises and falls—at times the population densities can fall from as high as {{convert|2,300|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}} to as low as {{convert|12|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. Consequently, a period of hare scarcity occurs every 8 to 11 years. An example of a prey-predator cycle, the cyclic variations in snowshoe hare populations significantly affect the numbers of their predators—lynxes and [[coyote]]s—in the region. When the hare populations plummet, lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares, and tend to not produce litters; as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx.<ref name=\"Brand1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=C.J.|last2=Keith|first2=L.B.|title=Lynx demography during a snowshoe hare decline in Alberta|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1979|volume=43|issue=4|pages=827–849|doi=10.2307/3808267|jstor=3808267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Hofer |first4=E.J. |title=Numerical responses of coyotes and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1997 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=150–162 |doi=10.2307/3546526|jstor=3546526 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=R.M.P. |last2=Krebs |first2=C.J. |title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=1985 |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=2817–2824 |doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> In northern Canada, the abundance of lynxes can be estimated from the records kept of the number caught each year for their fur; records have been kept by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] since the 1730s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=M.S. |year=1977|title=Hares, lynx, and trappers |journal= The American Naturalist|volume= 111|issue=980 |pages=806–8 |doi=10.1086/283212 |jstor=2460337}}</ref> These cycles have been cited as one of the few examples of the [[Lotka-Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations]], caused by the interplay of three major factors—food, predation and social interaction.<ref name=\"krebs2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Krebs |first1=C.J. |last2=Boonstra |first2=R. |last3=Boutin |first3=S. |last4=Sinclair |first4=A.R.E. |title=What drives the 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares?: The ten-year cycle of snowshoe hares—one of the most striking features of the boreal forest— is a product of the interaction between predation and food supplies, as large-scale experiments in the Yukon have demonstrated |journal=BioScience |date=2001 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0025:WDTYCO]2.0.CO;2|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/51/1/25/26890541/51-1-25.pdf}}</ref> A study involving statistical modelling of the interspecific relations of the snowshoe hare, the plant species it feeds on and its predators (including the Canada lynx) suggested that while the demographics of the lynx depend primarily on the hare, the hare's dynamics depend both on the plant species in its diet and predators, of which the Canada lynx is just one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stenseth |first1=N.C. |last2=Falck |first2=W. |last3=Bjørnstad |first3=O.N. |last4=Krebs |first4=C.J. |title=Population regulation in snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx: Asymmetric food web configurations between hare and lynx |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1997 |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=5147–52 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.10.5147 |pmid=9144205 |pmc=24646 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.5147C |url=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/94/10/5147.full.pdf}}</ref> Environmental factors such as forest fires, precipitation and snowfall might also significantly affect this prey-predator cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=J.F. |title=Forest fires and the snowshoe hare-Canada lynx cycle |journal=Oecologia |date=1978 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–374 |doi=10.1007/BF00346252}}</ref>

===Home ranges===
[[File:Canada lynx (6002291242).jpg|thumb|Lynxes are typically solitary with minimal social bonds.]]
Canada lynxes establish [[home range]]s that vary widely in size, depending upon the method of measurement. The two common methods are examining the tracks of the lynx on snow (snow-tracking) and [[Wildlife radio telemetry|radio telemetry]]; snow-tracking generally gives smaller sizes for home ranges. Studies based on snow-tracking have estimated home range sizes of {{convert|11.1|–|49.5|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those based on radio telemetry have given the area between {{convert|8|and|783|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lox/> Like other cats, Canada lynxes [[Territorial marking|scent-mark]] their ranges by spraying urine and depositing faeces on snow or tree stumps and other prominent sites in and around their range.<ref name=Sunquist/>

Factors such as availability of prey (primarily snowshoe hare), density of lynxes and the topography of the habitat determine the shape and size of the home range.<ref name=lox/> Studies have tried to correlate the abundance of snowshoe hares in an area with the sizes of lynx home ranges in that area. A 1985 study showed that the mean size of home ranges trebled—from {{convert|13.2|to|39.2|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}—when the density of hares fell from {{convert|14.7|to|1|/ha|/acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=R.M.P.|last2=Krebs|first2=C.J.|title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1985|volume=63|issue=12|pages=2817–24|doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> However, a few other studies have reported different responses from lynxes at times of prey scarcity; some lynxes do not show any changes in their ranges, while others may resort to hunting in small areas, occupying small home ranges.<ref name=lox/> Canada lynxes generally do not leave their home ranges frequently, though limited prey availability can force lynxes to disperse or expand their ranges.<ref name=Poole1995>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Spatial organization of a lynx population|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1995|volume=73|issue=4|pages=632–41|doi=10.1139/z95-074}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Dispersal patterns of lynx in the Northwest Territories|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1997|volume=61|issue=2|pages=497–505|doi=10.2307/3802607|jstor=3802607}}</ref>

Males tend to occupy larger ranges than do females; for instance, data from a 1980 radio telemetric analysis in [[Minnesota]] showed that home ranges of males spread over {{convert|145|–|243|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those of females covered {{convert|51|–|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mech|first1=L.D.|title=Age, sex, reproduction, and spatial organization of lynxes colonizing Northeastern Minnesota|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=1980|volume=61|issue=2|pages=261–7|jstor=1380047|doi=10.2307/1380047}}</ref> In another radio telemetric study in 1985 in [[Montana]], male home ranges averaged {{convert|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and those of females averaged {{convert|43.1|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Brainerd|first=S.M.|title=Reproductive ecology of bobcats and lynx in western Montana|type=M.Sc. thesis |publisher=[[University of Montana]]|date=1985|pages=1–85}}</ref> In a study in the southern [[Northwest Territories]], ranges of individuals of opposite sexes were found to overlap extensively, while the ranges of individuals of the same sex hardly coincided.

A [[Genetics|genetic]] study showed that lynxes at the periphery of a population, given their smaller numbers and greater susceptibility to variations in the range, face more difficulty in breeding with lynxes toward the centre of the population and hence show lower [[heterozygosity]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=M.K. |last2=Mills |first2=L.S. |last3=Ortega |first3=Y. |last4=Ruggiero |first4=L.F. |last5=Allendorf |first5=F.W. |title=Landscape location affects genetic variation of Canada lynx (''Lynx canadensis'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=2003 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1807–16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01878.x|pmid=12803633 }}</ref>

===Diet and hunting===
[[File:Snowshoe Hare (6187109754).jpg|thumb|left|[[Snowshoe hare]], the primary prey of the Canada lynx]]
The Canada lynx preys primarily and almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. These hares comprise 35–97% of their diet; the proportion varies by the season and the abundance of hares.<ref name=Hunter/> However, at times when the numbers of the hare drop, lynxes will include other animals in their diet—such as ducks, [[grouse]], moles, [[ptarmigan]], [[red squirrel]]s, voles and young [[ungulate]]s ([[Dall's sheep]], [[mule deer]] and [[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]])—though snowshoe hares continue to be the primary component. The Canada lynx tends to be less selective in summer and autumn, adding small mammals as a minor component of their diet besides the hare. The reason behind this is unclear—it could be due to greater abundance of alternate prey, or reduced success in hunting hares.<ref name=ruggiero/> A study in Alaska found that lynxes played a role in the decrease in populations of [[red fox]], caribou and Dall's sheep when hares were very low in number.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephenson |first1=R.O. |last2=Grangaard |first2=D.V. |last3=Burch |first3=J. |title=Lynx, ''Felis lynx'', predation on red foxes, ''Vulpes vulpes'', caribou, ''Rangifer tarandus'', and Dall sheep, ''Ovis dalli'', in Alaska |journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist |date=1991 |volume=105 |pages=255–62 |url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/library/pdfs/wildlife/propubs/91_stephenson_etal_lynx_predation_redfoxes_caribou_dallsheep_ak.pdf}}</ref> Canada lynxes ingest {{convert|0.6|–|1.2|kg|lb}} of food everyday.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes have also been reported feeding occasionally on [[Succulent plant|succulent]] [[sedge]]s and grasses.<ref name=yukongov/>

Canadian lynxes hunt around twilight or at night, the time when snowshoe hares tend to be active.<ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes rely on their vision and sense of hearing to locate prey.<ref name=Nowak/> The lynx will roam or wait (in what researchers often term \"ambush beds\") on certain trails where snowshoe hares gather, pounce on a hare and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck.<ref name=ruggiero/> Sometimes a chase of around ten bounds may be necessary to trap the prey. The lynx is assisted by its [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic vision]] in detecting prey and measuring distances. Staying in cover while hunting helps the lynx conserve energy in its frigid habitat by avoiding unnecessary movement.<ref name=yukongov/> Young ungulates are given a throat bite to suffocate them to death. The lynx may eat its kill immediately or cache it in snow or leaves to eat it over the next few days.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/><ref name=ruggiero/> Studies suggest success in hunting hares depends heavily on the distance between the lynx and the hare when the lynx starts chasing it and their relative speeds, which in turn depends on the hunting prowess of the lynx, the alertness of the hare and the vegetation cover among other factors.<ref name=Sunquist/> Lynxes will occasionally hunt together, though studies differ on how this affects the hunting success rate compared to when an individual hunts alone.<ref name=ruggiero/> In fact, they may hunt in groups when hares are scarce.<ref name = dono98/> [[Scavenger|Scavenging]] is common in Canada lynxes; they will take ungulates killed by the cold or vehicles.<ref name=Hunter/>
[[File:Lynx-canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|A lynx stalking its prey]]
Both coyotes and Canada lynxes are major predators of the snowshoe hare. A study showed that compared to lynxes, the feet of coyotes sink deeper in the snow due to their smaller size and hence a larger body mass to foot area ratio, prompting them to ambush their prey instead of chasing it like lynxes often do.<ref name=\"murray1991\">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=D.L. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |title=The influence of snow on lynx and coyote movements: does morphology affect behavior? |journal=Oecologia |date=1991 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=463–9 |doi=10.1007/BF00317707|pmid=28312614 |bibcode=1991Oecol..88..463M }}</ref> A study of the two species in southwest [[Yukon Territory]] showed that when the numbers of the hare increased, both predators killed more hares than were necessary for their subsistence; lynxes need to kill 0.4 to 0.5 hare per day to meet their energy requirements, but were observed to kill 1.2 hares per day during this period. Coyotes, with a success rate of 36.9%, emerged as more successful hunters than lynxes that succeeded in 28.7% of their hunts; however this may have resulted from the greater number of adult coyotes in the studied population. Lynxes rarely cached their kills, unlike coyotes, and this may have led to incomplete consumption of some kills. During the cyclic decrease in snowshoe hare numbers, both predators hunted for the same time period as they did when hares were abundant, but lynxes killed more hares than they did earlier. Moreover, lynxes supplemented their diet with red squirrels.<ref name=ODonoghue/><ref name=dono98>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Murray|first4=D.L. |last5=Hofer |first5=E.J.| title=Behavioural responses of coyote and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1998 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.2307/3546927|jstor=3546927 }}</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Canada Lynx Mom and Kitten (15250932421).jpg|thumb|left|A juvenile with its mother]]

The mating season is roughly a month long, from March to early April. Urine marking and mating calls are part of [[Display (zoology)|display behaviour]], and increases the interaction between individuals of opposite sexes. Females can be [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]] when the availability of mates is low, or spontaneous ovulators when several mates are available. Females have only a single [[estrus cycle]]; estrus lasts for three to five days in captivity.<ref name=Sunquist /> Individuals have been observed making long wailing vocalizations, probably as mating calls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Some observations on the natural history and behaviour of the Canada Lynx, ''Lynx canadensis'' |journal=Canadian Field Naturalist |date=1998 |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=32-36 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Slough/publication/268872103_Some_observations_on_the_natural_history_and_behaviour_of_the_Canada_Lynx_Lynx_canadensis/links/547a2cbc0cf293e2da2b5e05.pdf}}</ref> Before birth, the female prepares a maternal den, usually in very thick brush, and typically inside thickets of shrubs, trees or woody debris.<ref name=Kaufman/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Slough |first=B.

Kittens leave the den after about five weeks, and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but do not reach the full adult size until around two years old. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years. Canada lynxes have been reported to live for up to 16 years in wild, though most do not make it beyond 10 years; in captivity the lifespan may be as long as 27 years.<ref name=Sunquist /><ref name=Hunter/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Young Lynx spotted west of Drayton Valley Ab - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canada lynxes prefer dense [[boreal forest]]s.]]
The Canada lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s. Canada lynxes have been recorded up to an elevation of {{convert|4310|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/>

A Canada lynx was shot near [[Newton Abbot]] in the United Kingdom in 1903 after it attacked two dogs. The animal remained unidentified at the time and was preserved by [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]], and was finally identified in a 2014 study. The researchers concluded that it had probably been captive for some time, perhaps as an [[exotic pet]] or part of a travelling menagerie, but may have survived for a substantial period after escaping. They considered it \"the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=M. |last2=Naish |first2=D. |last3=Larson |first3=G. |last4=King |first4=C.L. |last5=Nowell |first5=G. |last6=Sakamoto |first6=M. |last7=Barnett |first7=R. |title=Multidisciplinary investigation of a ‘British big cat’: a lynx killed in southern England c. 1903 |journal=Historical Biology |date=2013 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=441–448 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2013.785541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22263874|title='Big cat' Canada lynx was on the loose in UK in 1903|last=Morelle|first=R.|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Postmedia News |title=That 'British big cat' called England's Loch Ness Monster?

== Threats and conservation ==
[[File:Felis lynx canadensis (Canadian lynx) fur skin back.jpg|thumb|left|Canada lynxes are trapped for their fur.]]
Canada lynxes are trapped in specific periods or seasons for fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada. To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality. Hybridization between Canada lynxes and bobcats has been reported in the southern periphery of the range, and does not appear to be a threat to Canada lynxes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Homyack, J.A. |year=2008|title=Canada Lynx-Bobcat (''Lynx canadensis × L.rufus'') hybrids at the southern periphery of lynx range in Maine, Minnesota and New Brunswick|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_homyack_j001.pdf|journal= American Midland Naturalist |volume=159|pages=504–508|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[504:CLLCLR]2.0.CO;2|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz, M.K. | year = 2004 | title = Hybridization between Canada Lynx and bobcats: genetic results and management implications| journal = Conservation Genetics | volume = 5 | pages = 349–355 | doi = 10.1023/B:COGE.0000031141.47148.8b | issue = 3|url=http://www.rmrs.nau.edu/publications/Schwartz_et_al_conservation_genetics/Schwartz_et_al_conservation_genetics.pdf }}</ref>

The Canada lynx is abundant over its broad range, and is not significantly threatened by its legal use in the international fur trade since more than two centuries. Therefore, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) classifies the Canada lynx as [[Least Concern]].

The '''Canada lynx''' (''Lynx canadensis'') is a medium-sized [[lynx]] native to [[North America]]. It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.

The Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada—when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.

This lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.

A study of the differences (in factors such as coat colour, cranial measurements and weights) between the mainland and Newfoundland forms showed that apart from a few variations (for instance, the Newfoundland lynx features a darker coat than the mainland subspecies), the standard measurements are not significantly distinct. Noting only a few differences between the two forms, the study suggested the Newfoundland lynx to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] only recently from the mainland form. The lack of appreciable subspecific distinctions led the researchers to doubt the vaidity of the Newfoundland lynx as a separate subspecies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Zyll de Jong |first1=C.

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Lynx (5300913523).jpg|thumb|A close facial view of the Canada lynx. The black ear tufts are characteristic of lynxes.]]

The Canada lynx is a lean, medium-sized cat characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the bobcat, the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx is [[sexually dimorphic]], with males larger and heavier than females.

=== Relationship with the snowshoe hare ===

A [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist predator]], the Canada lynx depends heavily on snowshoe hares for food.<ref name=Hunter/> Snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada undergo cyclic rises and falls—at times the population densities can fall from as high as {{convert|2,300|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}} to as low as {{convert|12|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. Consequently, a period of hare scarcity occurs every 8 to 11 years. An example of a prey-predator cycle, the cyclic variations in snowshoe hare populations significantly affect the numbers of their predators—lynxes and [[coyote]]s—in the region. When the hare populations plummet, lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares, and tend to not produce litters; as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx.<ref name=\"Brand1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=C.J.|last2=Keith|first2=L.B.|title=Lynx demography during a snowshoe hare decline in Alberta|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1979|volume=43|issue=4|pages=827–849|doi=10.2307/3808267|jstor=3808267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Hofer |first4=E.J. |title=Numerical responses of coyotes and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1997 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=150–162 |doi=10.2307/3546526|jstor=3546526 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=R.M.P. |last2=Krebs |first2=C.J. |title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=1985 |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=2817–2824 |doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> In northern Canada, the abundance of lynxes can be estimated from the records kept of the number caught each year for their fur; records have been kept by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] since the 1730s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=M.S. |year=1977|title=Hares, lynx, and trappers |journal= The American Naturalist|volume= 111|issue=980 |pages=806–8 |doi=10.1086/283212 |jstor=2460337}}</ref> These cycles have been cited as one of the few examples of the [[Lotka-Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations]], caused by the interplay of three major factors—food, predation and social interaction.<ref name=\"krebs2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Krebs |first1=C.J. |last2=Boonstra |first2=R. |last3=Boutin |first3=S. |last4=Sinclair |first4=A.R.E. |title=What drives the 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares?: The ten-year cycle of snowshoe hares—one of the most striking features of the boreal forest— is a product of the interaction between predation and food supplies, as large-scale experiments in the Yukon have demonstrated |journal=BioScience |date=2001 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0025:WDTYCO]2.0.CO;2|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/51/1/25/26890541/51-1-25.pdf}}</ref> A study involving statistical modelling of the interspecific relations of the snowshoe hare, the plant species it feeds on and its predators (including the Canada lynx) suggested that while the demographics of the lynx depend primarily on the hare, the hare's dynamics depend both on the plant species in its diet and predators, of which the Canada lynx is just one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stenseth |first1=N.C. |last2=Falck |first2=W. |last3=Bjørnstad |first3=O.N. |last4=Krebs |first4=C.J. |title=Population regulation in snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx: Asymmetric food web configurations between hare and lynx |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1997 |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=5147–52 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.10.5147 |pmid=9144205 |pmc=24646 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.5147C |url=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/94/10/5147.full.pdf}}</ref> Environmental factors such as forest fires, precipitation and snowfall might also significantly affect this prey-predator cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=J.F. |title=Forest fires and the snowshoe hare-Canada lynx cycle |journal=Oecologia |date=1978 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–374 |doi=10.1007/BF00346252}}</ref>

===Home ranges===
[[File:Canada lynx (6002291242).jpg|thumb|Lynxes are typically solitary with minimal social bonds.]]
Canada lynxes establish [[home range]]s that vary widely in size, depending upon the method of measurement. The two common methods are examining the tracks of the lynx on snow (snow-tracking) and [[Wildlife radio telemetry|radio telemetry]]; snow-tracking generally gives smaller sizes for home ranges. Studies based on snow-tracking have estimated home range sizes of {{convert|11.1|–|49.5|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those based on radio telemetry have given the area between {{convert|8|and|783|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lox/> Like other cats, Canada lynxes [[Territorial marking|scent-mark]] their ranges by spraying urine and depositing faeces on snow or tree stumps and other prominent sites in and around their range.<ref name=Sunquist/>

Factors such as availability of prey (primarily snowshoe hare), density of lynxes and the topography of the habitat determine the shape and size of the home range.<ref name=lox/> Studies have tried to correlate the abundance of snowshoe hares in an area with the sizes of lynx home ranges in that area. A 1985 study showed that the mean size of home ranges trebled—from {{convert|13.2|to|39.2|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}—when the density of hares fell from {{convert|14.7|to|1|/ha|/acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=R.M.P.|last2=Krebs|first2=C.J.|title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1985|volume=63|issue=12|pages=2817–24|doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> However, a few other studies have reported different responses from lynxes at times of prey scarcity; some lynxes do not show any changes in their ranges, while others may resort to hunting in small areas, occupying small home ranges.<ref name=lox/> Canada lynxes generally do not leave their home ranges frequently, though limited prey availability can force lynxes to disperse or expand their ranges.<ref name=Poole1995>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Spatial organization of a lynx population|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1995|volume=73|issue=4|pages=632–41|doi=10.1139/z95-074}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Dispersal patterns of lynx in the Northwest Territories|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1997|volume=61|issue=2|pages=497–505|doi=10.2307/3802607|jstor=3802607}}</ref>

Males tend to occupy larger ranges than do females; for instance, data from a 1980 radio telemetric analysis in [[Minnesota]] showed that home ranges of males spread over {{convert|145|–|243|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those of females covered {{convert|51|–|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mech|first1=L.D.|title=Age, sex, reproduction, and spatial organization of lynxes colonizing Northeastern Minnesota|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=1980|volume=61|issue=2|pages=261–7|jstor=1380047|doi=10.2307/1380047}}</ref> In another radio telemetric study in 1985 in [[Montana]], male home ranges averaged {{convert|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and those of females averaged {{convert|43.1|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Brainerd|first=S.M.|title=Reproductive ecology of bobcats and lynx in western Montana|type=M.Sc. thesis |publisher=[[University of Montana]]|date=1985|pages=1–85}}</ref> In a study in the southern [[Northwest Territories]], ranges of individuals of opposite sexes were found to overlap extensively, while the ranges of individuals of the same sex hardly coincided.

A [[Genetics|genetic]] study showed that lynxes at the periphery of a population, given their smaller numbers and greater susceptibility to variations in the range, face more difficulty in breeding with lynxes toward the centre of the population and hence show lower [[heterozygosity]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=M.K. |last2=Mills |first2=L.S. |last3=Ortega |first3=Y. |last4=Ruggiero |first4=L.F. |last5=Allendorf |first5=F.W. |title=Landscape location affects genetic variation of Canada lynx (''Lynx canadensis'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=2003 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1807–16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01878.x|pmid=12803633 }}</ref>

===Diet and hunting===
[[File:Snowshoe Hare (6187109754).jpg|thumb|left|[[Snowshoe hare]], the primary prey of the Canada lynx]]
The Canada lynx preys primarily and almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. These hares comprise 35–97% of their diet; the proportion varies by the season and the abundance of hares.<ref name=Hunter/> However, at times when the numbers of the hare drop, lynxes will include other animals in their diet—such as ducks, [[grouse]], moles, [[ptarmigan]], [[red squirrel]]s, voles and young [[ungulate]]s ([[Dall's sheep]], [[mule deer]] and [[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]])—though snowshoe hares continue to be the primary component. The Canada lynx tends to be less selective in summer and autumn, adding small mammals as a minor component of their diet besides the hare. The reason behind this is unclear—it could be due to greater abundance of alternate prey, or reduced success in hunting hares.<ref name=ruggiero/> A study in Alaska found that lynxes played a role in the decrease in populations of [[red fox]], caribou and Dall's sheep when hares were very low in number.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephenson |first1=R.O. |last2=Grangaard |first2=D.V. |last3=Burch |first3=J. |title=Lynx, ''Felis lynx'', predation on red foxes, ''Vulpes vulpes'', caribou, ''Rangifer tarandus'', and Dall sheep, ''Ovis dalli'', in Alaska |journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist |date=1991 |volume=105 |pages=255–62 |url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/library/pdfs/wildlife/propubs/91_stephenson_etal_lynx_predation_redfoxes_caribou_dallsheep_ak.pdf}}</ref> Canada lynxes ingest {{convert|0.6|–|1.2|kg|lb}} of food everyday.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes have also been reported feeding occasionally on [[Succulent plant|succulent]] [[sedge]]s and grasses.<ref name=yukongov/>

[[File:Lynx-canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|A lynx stalking its prey]]
Both coyotes and Canada lynxes are major predators of the snowshoe hare. A study showed that compared to lynxes, the feet of coyotes sink deeper in the snow due to their smaller size and hence a larger body mass to foot area ratio, prompting them to ambush their prey instead of chasing it like lynxes often do.<ref name=\"murray1991\">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=D.L. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |title=The influence of snow on lynx and coyote movements: does morphology affect behavior? |journal=Oecologia |date=1991 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=463–9 |doi=10.1007/BF00317707|pmid=28312614 |bibcode=1991Oecol..88..463M }}</ref> A study of the two species in southwest [[Yukon Territory]] showed that when the numbers of the hare increased, both predators killed more hares than were necessary for their subsistence; lynxes need to kill 0.4 to 0.5 hare per day to meet their energy requirements, but were observed to kill 1.2 hares per day during this period. Coyotes, with a success rate of 36.9%, emerged as more successful hunters than lynxes that succeeded in 28.7% of their hunts; however this may have resulted from the greater number of adult coyotes in the studied population. Lynxes rarely cached their kills, unlike coyotes, and this may have led to incomplete consumption of some kills. During the cyclic decrease in snowshoe hare numbers, both predators hunted for the same time period as they did when hares were abundant, but lynxes killed more hares than they did earlier. Moreover, lynxes supplemented their diet with red squirrels.<ref name=ODonoghue/><ref name=dono98>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Murray|first4=D.L. |last5=Hofer |first5=E.J.| title=Behavioural responses of coyote and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1998 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.2307/3546927|jstor=3546927 }}</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Canada Lynx Mom and Kitten (15250932421).jpg|thumb|left|A juvenile with its mother]]

The mating season is roughly a month long, from March to early April. Urine marking and mating calls are part of [[Display (zoology)|display behaviour]], and increases the interaction between individuals of opposite sexes. Females can be [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]] when the availability of mates is low, or spontaneous ovulators when several mates are available. Females have only a single [[estrus cycle]]; estrus lasts for three to five days in captivity.<ref name=Sunquist /> Individuals have been observed making long wailing vocalizations, probably as mating calls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Some observations on the natural history and behaviour of the Canada Lynx, ''Lynx canadensis'' |journal=Canadian Field Naturalist |date=1998 |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=32-36 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Slough/publication/268872103_Some_observations_on_the_natural_history_and_behaviour_of_the_Canada_Lynx_Lynx_canadensis/links/547a2cbc0cf293e2da2b5e05.pdf}}</ref> Before birth, the female prepares a maternal den, usually in very thick brush, and typically inside thickets of shrubs, trees or woody debris.<ref name=Kaufman/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Slough |first=B.

After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born.<ref name=Sunquist /> Lynx reproductive cycles and litter sizes have been observed to vary with prey availability; litter size would typically contract in years of snowshoe hare decline (along with high infant mortality rates), and increase when hares were abundant.<ref name=\"breitenmoser\">{{cite journal |last1=Breitenmoser |first1=U. |last2=Slough |first2=B.G. |last3=Breitenmoser-Würsten |first3=C. |title=Predators of cyclic prey: is the Canada lynx a victim or profiteer of the snowshoe hare cycle? |journal=Oikos |date=1993 |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=551–554 |doi=10.2307/3544952|jstor=3544952 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Lynx population dynamics in an untrapped refugium |journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management |date=1996 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=946–961 |doi=10.2307/3802397}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=M.|first1=Garth |last2=Slough |first2=B.G. |last3=Boutin |first3=S.|title=Lynx recruitment during a snowshoe hare population peak and decline in southwest Yukon |journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management |date=1996 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=441–452 |doi=10.2307/3802247}}</ref> Kittens weigh from {{convert|175|to|235|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth, and initially have grayish buff fur with black markings. They are blind for the first 14 days, and [[weaning|weaned]] at 12 weeks. Most births occur from May to July. Kittens leave the den after about five weeks, and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but do not reach the full adult size until around two years old. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years. Canada lynxes have been reported to live for up to 16 years in wild, though most do not make it beyond 10 years; in captivity the lifespan may be as long as 27 years.<ref name=Sunquist /><ref name=Hunter/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Young Lynx spotted west of Drayton Valley Ab - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canada lynxes prefer dense [[boreal forest]]s.]]
The Canada lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s. Canada lynxes have been recorded up to an elevation of {{convert|4310|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/>

A Canada lynx was shot near [[Newton Abbot]] in the United Kingdom in 1903 after it attacked two dogs. The animal remained unidentified at the time and was preserved by [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]], and was finally identified in a 2014 study. The researchers concluded that it had probably been captive for some time, perhaps as an [[exotic pet]] or part of a travelling menagerie, but may have survived for a substantial period after escaping. They considered it \"the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=M. |last2=Naish |first2=D. |last3=Larson |first3=G. |last4=King |first4=C.L. |last5=Nowell |first5=G. |last6=Sakamoto |first6=M. |last7=Barnett |first7=R. |title=Multidisciplinary investigation of a ‘British big cat’: a lynx killed in southern England c. 1903 |journal=Historical Biology |date=2013 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=441–448 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2013.785541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22263874|title='Big cat' Canada lynx was on the loose in UK in 1903|last=Morelle|first=R.|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Postmedia News |title=That 'British big cat' called England's Loch Ness Monster?

== Threats and conservation ==
[[File:Felis lynx canadensis (Canadian lynx) fur skin back.jpg|thumb|left|Canada lynxes are trapped for their fur.]]
Canada lynxes are trapped in specific periods or seasons for fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada; hunting seasons and quotas are set based on population data. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality. Hybridization between Canada lynxes and bobcats has been reported in the southern periphery of the range, and does not appear to be a threat to Canada lynxes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Homyack, J.A. |year=2008|title=Canada Lynx-Bobcat (''Lynx canadensis × L.rufus'') hybrids at the southern periphery of lynx range in Maine, Minnesota and New Brunswick|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_homyack_j001.pdf|journal= American Midland Naturalist |volume=159|pages=504–508|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[504:CLLCLR]2.0.CO;2|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz, M.K. | year = 2004 | title = Hybridization between Canada Lynx and bobcats: genetic results and management implications| journal = Conservation Genetics | volume = 5 | pages = 349–355 | doi = 10.1023/B:COGE.0000031141.47148.8b | issue = 3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225195035_Hybridization_Between_Canada_Lynx_and_Bobcats_Genetic_Results_and_Management_Implications }}</ref>

The Canada lynx is abundant over its broad range, and is not significantly threatened by its legal use in the international fur trade since more than two centuries. Therefore, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) classifies the Canada lynx as [[Least Concern]]. However, populations are relatively lower in the southern half of the range and are protected from killing for fur trade. The lynx is listed as Endangered in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name=iucn/> On March 24, 2000, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) issued its Final Rule, which designated the Canada lynx a Threatened Species in 14 contiguous United States.<ref name=\"FedReg\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-03-24/pdf/00-7145.pdf|title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Threatened Status for the Contiguous U.S. Distinct Population Segment of the Canada Lynx and Related Rule |page=16051–16086|journal=Federal Register|volume= 65|issue= 58 |date= 24 March 2000|publisher=Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref> In 2005, the USFWS demarcated six major areas for revival where lynx populations had been reported in the past two decades: northern Maine and [[New Hampshire]], northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern [[Idaho]], the [[Kettle River Range]] and the \"Wedge area\" between the [[Kettle River (Columbia River tributary)|Kettle]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the northern Cascade Range of Washington, and the [[Greater Yellowstone]] area of [[Wyoming]], Montana and Idaho.<ref name=iucn/> By 2010, after an 11-year effort, the lynx had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado.

The '''Canada lynx''' (''Lynx canadensis'') is a medium-sized [[lynx]] native to [[North America]]. It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.

The Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada—when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.

This lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.

A study of the differences (in factors such as coat colour, cranial measurements and weights) between the mainland and Newfoundland forms showed that apart from a few variations (for instance, the Newfoundland lynx features a darker coat than the mainland subspecies), the standard measurements are not significantly distinct. Noting only a few differences between the two forms, the study suggested the Newfoundland lynx to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] only recently from the mainland form.

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Lynx (5300913523).jpg|thumb|A close facial view of the Canada lynx. The black ear tufts are characteristic of lynxes.]]

The Canada lynx is a lean, medium-sized cat characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the bobcat, the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx is [[sexually dimorphic]], with males larger and heavier than females. The lynx is between {{convert|73|and|107|cm|in|abbr=on}} in head-and-body length and stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder; females weigh around {{convert|5|–|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}} while males weigh around {{convert|6|–|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Sunquist/> Physical proportions do not vary significantly across the range and are probably [[natural selection|naturally selected]] to allow survival on smaller prey.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Werdelin|first1=L.|authorlink=Lars Werdelin|title=The evolution of lynxes|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|url=http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/ibelynxco/04_library/4_3_publications/W/Werdelin_1981_Evolution_of_lynxes.pdf|date=1981|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37–71|jstor=23734102|access-date=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005114343/http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/ibelynxco/04_library/4_3_publications/W/Werdelin_1981_Evolution_of_lynxes.pdf|archive-date=October 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Eurasian lynx, that prefers prey the size of a [[roe deer]], is twice the size of the Canada lynx, that feeds primarily on the [[snowshoe hare]].<ref name=Sunquist/> The stubby tail, typical of lynxes, is {{convert|5|–|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; while the bobcat's tail is black only in the upper part, the tail of the Canada lynx has a completely black tip.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=L.|title=Wild Cats of the World|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1-4729-2285-4|pages=146–151|url={{Google Books|id=hzNBCgAAQBAJ|page=146|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> 

The long, dense fur, uniformly coloured with little to no markings except on the underside, insulates the lynx in its frosty habitat.

=== Relationship with the snowshoe hare ===

A [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist predator]], the Canada lynx depends heavily on snowshoe hares for food.<ref name=Hunter/> Snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada undergo cyclic rises and falls—at times the population densities can fall from as high as {{convert|2,300|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}} to as low as {{convert|12|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. Consequently, a period of hare scarcity occurs every 8 to 11 years. An example of a prey-predator cycle, the cyclic variations in snowshoe hare populations significantly affect the numbers of their predators—lynxes and [[coyote]]s—in the region. When the hare populations plummet, lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares, and tend to not produce litters; as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx.<ref name=\"Brand1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=C.J.|last2=Keith|first2=L.B.|title=Lynx demography during a snowshoe hare decline in Alberta|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1979|volume=43|issue=4|pages=827–849|doi=10.2307/3808267|jstor=3808267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Hofer |first4=E.J. |title=Numerical responses of coyotes and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1997 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=150–162 |doi=10.2307/3546526|jstor=3546526 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=R.M.P. |last2=Krebs |first2=C.J. |title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=1985 |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=2817–2824 |doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> In northern Canada, the abundance of lynxes can be estimated from the records kept of the number caught each year for their fur; records have been kept by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] since the 1730s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=M.S. |year=1977|title=Hares, lynx, and trappers |journal= The American Naturalist|volume= 111|issue=980 |pages=806–8 |doi=10.1086/283212 |jstor=2460337}}</ref> These cycles have been cited as one of the few examples of the [[Lotka-Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations]], caused by the interplay of three major factors—food, predation and social interaction.<ref name=\"krebs2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Krebs |first1=C.J. |last2=Boonstra |first2=R. |last3=Boutin |first3=S. |last4=Sinclair |first4=A.R.E. |title=What drives the 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares?: The ten-year cycle of snowshoe hares—one of the most striking features of the boreal forest— is a product of the interaction between predation and food supplies, as large-scale experiments in the Yukon have demonstrated |journal=BioScience |date=2001 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0025:WDTYCO]2.0.CO;2|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/51/1/25/26890541/51-1-25.pdf}}</ref> A study involving statistical modelling of the interspecific relations of the snowshoe hare, the plant species it feeds on and its predators (including the Canada lynx) suggested that while the demographics of the lynx depend primarily on the hare, the hare's dynamics depend both on the plant species in its diet and predators, of which the Canada lynx is just one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stenseth |first1=N.C. |last2=Falck |first2=W. |last3=Bjørnstad |first3=O.N. |last4=Krebs |first4=C.J. |title=Population regulation in snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx: Asymmetric food web configurations between hare and lynx |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1997 |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=5147–52 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.10.5147 |pmid=9144205 |pmc=24646 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.5147C |url=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/94/10/5147.full.pdf}}</ref> Environmental factors such as forest fires, precipitation and snowfall might also significantly affect this prey-predator cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=J.F. |title=Forest fires and the snowshoe hare-Canada lynx cycle |journal=Oecologia |date=1978 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–374 |doi=10.1007/BF00346252}}</ref>

===Home ranges===
[[File:Canada lynx (6002291242).jpg|thumb|Lynxes are typically solitary with minimal social bonds.]]
Canada lynxes establish [[home range]]s that vary widely in size, depending upon the method of measurement. The two common methods are examining the tracks of the lynx on snow (snow-tracking) and [[Wildlife radio telemetry|radio telemetry]]; snow-tracking generally gives smaller sizes for home ranges. Studies based on snow-tracking have estimated home range sizes of {{convert|11.1|–|49.5|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those based on radio telemetry have given the area between {{convert|8|and|783|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lox/> Like other cats, Canada lynxes [[Territorial marking|scent-mark]] their ranges by spraying urine and depositing faeces on snow or tree stumps and other prominent sites in and around their range.<ref name=Sunquist/>

Factors such as availability of prey (primarily snowshoe hare), density of lynxes and the topography of the habitat determine the shape and size of the home range.<ref name=lox/> Studies have tried to correlate the abundance of snowshoe hares in an area with the sizes of lynx home ranges in that area. A 1985 study showed that the mean size of home ranges trebled—from {{convert|13.2|to|39.2|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}—when the density of hares fell from {{convert|14.7|to|1|/ha|/acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=R.M.P.|last2=Krebs|first2=C.J.|title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1985|volume=63|issue=12|pages=2817–24|doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> However, a few other studies have reported different responses from lynxes at times of prey scarcity; some lynxes do not show any changes in their ranges, while others may resort to hunting in small areas, occupying small home ranges.<ref name=lox/> Canada lynxes generally do not leave their home ranges frequently, though limited prey availability can force lynxes to disperse or expand their ranges.<ref name=Poole1995>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Spatial organization of a lynx population|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1995|volume=73|issue=4|pages=632–41|doi=10.1139/z95-074}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Dispersal patterns of lynx in the Northwest Territories|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1997|volume=61|issue=2|pages=497–505|doi=10.2307/3802607|jstor=3802607}}</ref>

Males tend to occupy larger ranges than do females; for instance, data from a 1980 radio telemetric analysis in [[Minnesota]] showed that home ranges of males spread over {{convert|145|–|243|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those of females covered {{convert|51|–|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mech|first1=L.D.|title=Age, sex, reproduction, and spatial organization of lynxes colonizing Northeastern Minnesota|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=1980|volume=61|issue=2|pages=261–7|jstor=1380047|doi=10.2307/1380047}}</ref> In another radio telemetric study in 1985 in [[Montana]], male home ranges averaged {{convert|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and those of females averaged {{convert|43.1|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Brainerd|first=S.M.|title=Reproductive ecology of bobcats and lynx in western Montana|type=M.Sc. thesis |publisher=[[University of Montana]]|date=1985|pages=1–85}}</ref> In a study in the southern [[Northwest Territories]], ranges of individuals of opposite sexes were found to overlap extensively, while the ranges of individuals of the same sex hardly coincided.

A [[Genetics|genetic]] study showed that lynxes at the periphery of a population, given their smaller numbers and greater susceptibility to variations in the range, face more difficulty in breeding with lynxes toward the centre of the population and hence show lower [[heterozygosity]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=M.K. |last2=Mills |first2=L.S. |last3=Ortega |first3=Y. |last4=Ruggiero |first4=L.F. |last5=Allendorf |first5=F.W. |title=Landscape location affects genetic variation of Canada lynx (''Lynx canadensis'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=2003 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1807–16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01878.x|pmid=12803633 }}</ref>

===Diet and hunting===
[[File:Snowshoe Hare (6187109754).jpg|thumb|left|[[Snowshoe hare]], the primary prey of the Canada lynx]]
The Canada lynx preys primarily and almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. These hares comprise 35–97% of their diet; the proportion varies by the season and the abundance of hares.<ref name=Hunter/> However, at times when the numbers of the hare drop, lynxes will include other animals in their diet—such as ducks, [[grouse]], moles, [[ptarmigan]], [[red squirrel]]s, voles and young [[ungulate]]s ([[Dall's sheep]], [[mule deer]] and [[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]])—though snowshoe hares continue to be the primary component. The Canada lynx tends to be less selective in summer and autumn, adding small mammals as a minor component of their diet besides the hare. The reason behind this is unclear—it could be due to greater abundance of alternate prey, or reduced success in hunting hares.<ref name=ruggiero/> A study in Alaska found that lynxes played a role in the decrease in populations of [[red fox]], caribou and Dall's sheep when hares were very low in number.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephenson |first1=R.O. |last2=Grangaard |first2=D.V. |last3=Burch |first3=J. |title=Lynx, ''Felis lynx'', predation on red foxes, ''Vulpes vulpes'', caribou, ''Rangifer tarandus'', and Dall sheep, ''Ovis dalli'', in Alaska |journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist |date=1991 |volume=105 |pages=255–62 |url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/library/pdfs/wildlife/propubs/91_stephenson_etal_lynx_predation_redfoxes_caribou_dallsheep_ak.pdf}}</ref> Canada lynxes ingest {{convert|0.6|–|1.2|kg|lb}} of food everyday.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes have also been reported feeding occasionally on [[Succulent plant|succulent]] [[sedge]]s and grasses.<ref name=yukongov/>

Canadian lynxes hunt around twilight or at night, the time when snowshoe hares tend to be active.<ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes rely on their vision and sense of hearing to locate prey.<ref name=Nowak/> The lynx will roam or wait (in what researchers often term \"ambush beds\") on certain trails where snowshoe hares gather, pounce on a hare and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck.<ref name=ruggiero/> Sometimes a chase of around ten bounds may be necessary to trap the prey. The lynx is assisted by its [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic vision]] in detecting prey and measuring distances. Staying in cover while hunting helps the lynx conserve energy in its frigid habitat by avoiding unnecessary movement.<ref name=yukongov/> Young ungulates are given a throat bite to suffocate them to death. The lynx may eat its kill immediately or cache it in snow or leaves to eat it over the next few days.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/><ref name=ruggiero/> Studies suggest success in hunting hares depends heavily on the distance between the lynx and the hare when the lynx starts chasing it and their relative speeds, which in turn depends on the hunting prowess of the lynx, the alertness of the hare and the vegetation cover among other factors.<ref name=Sunquist/> Lynxes will occasionally hunt together, though studies differ on how this affects the hunting success rate compared to when an individual hunts alone.<ref name=ruggiero/> In fact, they may hunt in groups when hares are scarce.<ref name = dono98/> [[Scavenger|Scavenging]] is common in Canada lynxes; they will take ungulates killed by the cold or vehicles.<ref name=Hunter/>
[[File:Lynx-canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|A lynx stalking its prey]]
Both coyotes and Canada lynxes are major predators of the snowshoe hare. A study showed that compared to lynxes, the feet of coyotes sink deeper in the snow due to their smaller size and hence a larger body mass to foot area ratio, prompting them to ambush their prey instead of chasing it like lynxes often do.<ref name=\"murray1991\">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=D.L. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |title=The influence of snow on lynx and coyote movements: does morphology affect behavior? |journal=Oecologia |date=1991 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=463–9 |doi=10.1007/BF00317707|pmid=28312614 |bibcode=1991Oecol..88..463M }}</ref> A study of the two species in southwest [[Yukon Territory]] showed that when the numbers of the hare increased, both predators killed more hares than were necessary for their subsistence; lynxes need to kill 0.4 to 0.5 hare per day to meet their energy requirements, but were observed to kill 1.2 hares per day during this period. Coyotes, with a success rate of 36.9%, emerged as more successful hunters than lynxes that succeeded in 28.7% of their hunts; however this may have resulted from the greater number of adult coyotes in the studied population. Lynxes rarely cached their kills, unlike coyotes, and this may have led to incomplete consumption of some kills. During the cyclic decrease in snowshoe hare numbers, both predators hunted for the same time period as they did when hares were abundant, but lynxes killed more hares than they did earlier. Moreover, lynxes supplemented their diet with red squirrels.<ref name=ODonoghue/><ref name=dono98>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Murray|first4=D.L. |last5=Hofer |first5=E.J.| title=Behavioural responses of coyote and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1998 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.2307/3546927|jstor=3546927 }}</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Canada Lynx Mom and Kitten (15250932421).jpg|thumb|left|A juvenile with its mother]]

The mating season is roughly a month long, from March to early April. Urine marking and mating calls are part of [[Display (zoology)|display behaviour]], and increases the interaction between individuals of opposite sexes. Females can be [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]] when the availability of mates is low, or spontaneous ovulators when several mates are available. Females have only a single [[estrus cycle]]; estrus lasts for three to five days in captivity.<ref name=Sunquist /> Individuals have been observed making long wailing vocalizations, probably as mating calls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Some observations on the natural history and behaviour of the Canada Lynx, ''Lynx canadensis'' |journal=Canadian Field Naturalist |date=1998 |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=32-36 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Slough/publication/268872103_Some_observations_on_the_natural_history_and_behaviour_of_the_Canada_Lynx_Lynx_canadensis/links/547a2cbc0cf293e2da2b5e05.pdf}}</ref> Before birth, the female prepares a maternal den, usually in very thick brush, and typically inside thickets of shrubs, trees or woody debris.<ref name=Kaufman/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Slough |first=B.

Kittens leave the den after about five weeks, and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but do not reach the full adult size until around two years old. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years. Canada lynxes have been reported to live for up to 16 years in wild, though most do not make it beyond 10 years; in captivity the lifespan may be as long as 27 years.<ref name=Sunquist /><ref name=Hunter/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Young Lynx spotted west of Drayton Valley Ab - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canada lynxes prefer dense [[boreal forest]]s.]]
The Canada lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s. Canada lynxes have been recorded up to an elevation of {{convert|4310|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/>

A Canada lynx was shot near [[Newton Abbot]] in the United Kingdom in 1903 after it attacked two dogs. The animal remained unidentified at the time and was preserved by [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]], and was finally identified in a 2014 study. The researchers concluded that it had probably been captive for some time, perhaps as an [[exotic pet]] or part of a travelling menagerie, but may have survived for a substantial period after escaping. They considered it \"the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=M. |last2=Naish |first2=D. |last3=Larson |first3=G. |last4=King |first4=C.L. |last5=Nowell |first5=G. |last6=Sakamoto |first6=M. |last7=Barnett |first7=R. |title=Multidisciplinary investigation of a ‘British big cat’: a lynx killed in southern England c. 1903 |journal=Historical Biology |date=2013 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=441–448 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2013.785541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22263874|title='Big cat' Canada lynx was on the loose in UK in 1903|last=Morelle|first=R.|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Postmedia News |title=That 'British big cat' called England's Loch Ness Monster?

== Threats and conservation ==
[[File:Felis lynx canadensis (Canadian lynx) fur skin back.jpg|thumb|left|Canada lynxes are trapped for their fur.]]
Canada lynxes are trapped in specific periods or seasons for fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada. To avoid severe population declines during the periodic fall in lynx populations, Alaska and most Canadian provinces regulate the time periods and fur quantity for trapping. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality. Hybridization between Canada lynxes and bobcats has been reported in the southern periphery of the range, and does not appear to be a threat to Canada lynxes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Homyack, J.A. |year=2008|title=Canada Lynx-Bobcat (''Lynx canadensis × L.rufus'') hybrids at the southern periphery of lynx range in Maine, Minnesota and New Brunswick|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_homyack_j001.pdf|journal= American Midland Naturalist |volume=159|pages=504–508|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[504:CLLCLR]2.0.CO;2|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz, M.K. | year = 2004 | title = Hybridization between Canada Lynx and bobcats: genetic results and management implications| journal = Conservation Genetics | volume = 5 | pages = 349–355 | doi = 10.1023/B:COGE.0000031141.47148.8b | issue = 3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225195035_Hybridization_Between_Canada_Lynx_and_Bobcats_Genetic_Results_and_Management_Implications }}</ref>

The Canada lynx is abundant over its broad range, and is not significantly threatened by its legal use in the international fur trade since more than two centuries. Therefore, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) classifies the Canada lynx as [[Least Concern]]. However, populations are relatively lower in the southern half of the range and are protected from killing for fur trade. The lynx is listed as Endangered in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name=iucn/> On March 24, 2000, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) issued its Final Rule, which designated the Canada lynx a Threatened Species in 14 contiguous United States.<ref name=\"FedReg\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-03-24/pdf/00-7145.pdf|title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Threatened Status for the Contiguous U.S. Distinct Population Segment of the Canada Lynx and Related Rule |page=16051–16086|journal=Federal Register|volume= 65|issue= 58 |date= 24 March 2000|publisher=Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref> In 2005, the USFWS demarcated six major areas for revival where lynx populations had been reported in the past two decades: northern Maine and [[New Hampshire]], northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern [[Idaho]], the [[Kettle River Range]] and the \"Wedge area\" between the [[Kettle River (Columbia River tributary)|Kettle]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the northern Cascade Range of Washington, and the [[Greater Yellowstone]] area of [[Wyoming]], Montana and Idaho.<ref name=iucn/> By 2010, after an 11-year effort, the lynx had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado.

'''William Everett Preston''' (September 2, 1946 – June 6, 2006)<ref name=\"nyt\" /> was an American musician whose work encompassed [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. Preston was a top session keyboardist in the 1960s, during which he backed artists such as [[Little Richard]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Rev. James Cleveland]] and [[the Beatles]]. He went on to achieve fame as a solo artist, with hit singles such as \"[[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|That's the Way God Planned It]]\", the Grammy-winning \"[[Outa-Space]]\", \"[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]\", \"[[Space Race (Billy Preston song)|Space Race]]\", \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\" and \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\". Additionally, Preston co-wrote \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\", which became a number 5 hit for [[Joe Cocker]].

Preston was one of five musicians<ref>{{Cite AV media notes | title=Revolver | title-link  = Revolver (Beatles album) | year =1966 | type = LP cover (back) | publisher = [[Parlophone Records]] | id = PCS7009 }} </ref> credited on a Beatles recording other than the group's four members. Preston continued to record and perform with other artists, notably [[George Harrison]] after the Beatles' breakup, and [[Eric Clapton]], and he played keyboards for [[the Rolling Stones]] on many of the group's albums and tours during the 1970s.

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Preston was born September 2, 1946, in [[Houston]]{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=741}} and moved to [[Los Angeles]] as a child with his mother, Robbie Lee Williams.  Noted as a [[child prodigy]], Preston was entirely self-taught and never had a music lesson. By the age of ten, he was playing [[Organ_(music)|organ]] onstage backing several gospel singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]].<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/arts/07preston.html|title=Billy Preston, 59, Soul Musician, Is Dead; Renowned Keyboardist and Collaborator|last=|first=|date=June 7, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref> Aged 11, Preston appeared on an episode of [[Nat King Cole]]'s [[NBC]] network TV show singing the [[Fats Domino]] hit \"[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]\" with Cole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=billy+preston+blueberry+hill&FORM=VIRE1#view=detail&mid=C4C029AE7E4DA745633AC4C029AE7E4DA745633A|title=billy preston blueberry hill - Bing video|website=Bing.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> He also appeared in ''[[St. Louis Blues (1958 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', the 1958 [[W. C. Handy]] biopic starring [[Nat King Cole]]; Preston played Handy at a younger age.<ref name=\"nyt\" />

In 1962, Preston joined [[Little Richard]]'s band as an organist, and it was while performing in [[Hamburg]] that he met the Beatles.<ref name=nyt/> In 1963, he played the organ on [[Sam Cooke]]'s ''[[Night Beat (Sam Cooke album)|Night Beat]]'' album and released his own debut album, ''16 Yr Old Soul'', for Cooke's [[SAR Records|SAR]] label.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news-releases.theurbanmusicscene.com/2011/02/11/billy-prestons-16-year-old-soul-to-be-re.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212030620/http://news-releases.theurbanmusicscene.com/2011/02/11/billy-prestons-16-year-old-soul-to-be-re.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-12-12 |work=The Urban Music Scene |title=Billy Preston's ''16-Year-Old Soul'' to be Digitally re-re-released on February 22, 2011 }} \"''16 Year Old Soul'' is an album of percolating organ-infused instrumentals that offers insight into the roots of one of the music world's most innovative and genre-busting stars who died at the age of 59, in 2006. With songs covering a broad spectrum of styles from country ('Born to Loose') to R&B ('Good News') to jazz ('God Bless The Child') with pop and blues undertones aplenty, ''16 Year Old Soul'' is a preserved-in-amber glimpse of an artist whose musical maturity belied his years.\"</ref> In 1965, he released the album ''[[The Most Exciting Organ Ever]]'' and performed on the rock and roll show ''[[Shindig!]]'' In 1967, he joined [[Ray Charles]]' band.{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=741}} Following this exposure, several musicians began asking Preston to contribute to their sessions.<ref name=nyt/>

===Relationship with the Beatles===
Preston first met [[the Beatles]] as a 16-year-old in 1962, while part of Little Richard's touring band, when their manager [[Brian Epstein]] organized a Liverpool show, at which the Beatles opened. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' explained their subsequent meeting:
{{quote|They'd hook up again in 1969, when the Beatles were about to break up while recording the last album they released, ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' (they would later record ''[[Abbey Road]]'', which was released prior to ''Let It Be''). [[George Harrison]], a friend of Preston, had quit, walked out of the studio and gone to a Ray Charles concert in [[London]], where Preston was playing organ. Harrison brought Preston back to the studio, where his keen musicianship and gregarious personality temporarily calmed the tension.<ref name=\"WP Obit\">{{cite news |first= Richard|last= Harrington|title='Fifth Beatle' Billy Preston Made the Greats Even Greater |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/07/AR2006060702166.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 8, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>}}

Preston is one of several people referred to as the \"[[Fifth Beatle]]\". At one point during the [[Let It Be (Beatles album)#Recording and production|''Get Back'' sessions]], [[John Lennon]] proposed the idea of having him join the band (to which [[Paul McCartney]] countered that it was difficult enough reaching agreements with four).<ref>The Beatles - A/B Road: The Complete Get back Sessions, January 24th</ref> Preston played organ and electric piano for the Beatles during several of the ''Get Back'' sessions; some of these sessions appeared in the film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let it Be]]'' and on its companion album. Preston also accompanied the band on electric piano for [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|its rooftop concert]], the group's final public appearance.<ref name=\"WP Obit\"/> In April 1969, their single \"Get Back\" was credited to \"The Beatles with Billy Preston\", the only time such a joint credit had been given on an official Beatles-sanctioned release (as distinct from an unsanctioned reissue of some Hamburg-era recordings on which they were the backing group for [[Tony Sheridan]]). The credit was bestowed by the Beatles to reflect the extent of Preston's presence on the track; his electric piano is prominent throughout and he plays an extended solo. Preston also worked, in a more limited role, on the ''Abbey Road'' album, contributing organ to the tracks \"[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".

In 1978, he appeared as Sgt. Pepper in [[Robert Stigwood]]'s film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was based on the Beatles' [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|album of the same name]], and sang and danced to \"Get Back\" as the penultimate song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/21/archives/screen-son-of-sgt-pepper-many-forms-involved.html|title=Screen: Son of 'Sgt. Pepper':Many Forms Involved|first=Janet|last=Maslin|publisher=}}</ref>

===Post-Beatles solo career===
[[File:Billy Preston perforning in 1971.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Preston singing at the piano in 1971]]
Signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] label, in 1969, Preston released the album ''[[That's the Way God Planned It]]'', produced by Harrison, the [[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|title song from which]] was a hit single in Britain. His relationship with Harrison continued after the Beatles' break-up in 1970; Preston was the first artist to record Harrison's subsequent international hit \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", on his 1970 album ''[[Encouraging Words]]'', which Harrison co-produced with him. He appeared on several of Harrison's 1970s solo albums, starting with ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''; made a notable contribution to [[the Concert for Bangladesh]], the Harrison-organized 1971 charity benefit; performed with the ex-Beatle on his 1974 tour of [[North America]]; and played at the 2002 [[Concert for George]] tribute, held at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Preston also worked on solo releases by Lennon and [[Ringo Starr]].

In 1971, Preston left Apple and signed with [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]]. The previous year, he contributed to another hit single when [[Stephen Stills]] asked to use Preston's phrase \"if you can't be with the one you love, [[Love the One You're With|love the one you're with]]\", a song on Stills' [[Stephen Stills (album)|self-titled]] debut solo album.<ref>{{cite news|title=Song Stories: Love The One You're With|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/love-the-one-you-re-with-stephen-stills|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

Following the release of ''[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]'' on A&M, Preston's solo career peaked at this time, beginning with 1972's \"[[Outa-Space]]\", an [[instrumental]] track that further popularized the sound of the [[clavinet]] in [[funk]] music. The song reached number 2 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, before going on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]. \"Outa-Space\" sold over 1 million copies in America, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in June 1972.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/319 319, 334, and 349] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/319 }}</ref> Later that year, Preston contributed the title song to the hit [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Slaughter (1972 film)|Slaughter]]'' starring [[Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|url=|first=John|last=Tobler|title=[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]/[[Music Is My Life]]|others=Billy Preston|pp=4, 6|year=2011|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[BGO Records]]|id=}}</ref>

Over the next two years, Preston followed up with the US chart-topping singles \"[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]\" (which displaced Harrison's \"[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]\" at the top on 7 July 1973) and \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\", and the number 4 hit \"[[Space Race (Billy Preston song)|Space Race]]\". Each of the three singles sold in excess of 1 million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> ''[[American Bandstand]]'' host and executive producer [[Dick Clark]] enjoyed \"Space Race\" so much that he used the instrumental for the mid-show break for virtually the remainder of its run.

[[File:The Rolling Stones with Billy Preston (1975).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Preston (seated behind grand piano in foreground) performing with the Rolling Stones in 1975]]
From 1970, Preston played keyboards (including piano, organ, clavinet and various synthesizers) for [[the Rolling Stones]], sometimes alongside pianists [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], on their albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'', ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'', ''[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll]]'' and ''[[Black and Blue]]''. As the band's primary touring keyboardist from 1973 to 1977, he also performed as a support act with his own band (including [[Mick Taylor]] on guitar) on their [[The Rolling Stones 1973 European Tour|1973 European tour]]. A [[Munich]] performance from this tour was documented on Preston's album ''[[Live European Tour 1973]]''. In 1974, along with [[Bruce Fisher]], one of his regular songwriting collaborators in the 1970s, he composed one of Joe Cocker's biggest hits, \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\". On October 11, 1975, he was the first musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s series premiere episode.<ref name=nyt/> Preston's 1973 song \"Do You Love Me\" was the basis for the Rolling Stones' track \"Melody\", released on ''Black and Blue'' in 1976. Although two of his songs were included in the band's 1975 and 1976 live sets, the Stones and Preston parted company in 1977, mainly due to a disagreement over money. He continued to play on solo records by Stones members like [[Mick Jagger]]'s ''[[Wandering Spirit (album)|Wandering Spirit]]'', and made appearances on the band's ''[[Tattoo You]]'' and ''[[Bridges to Babylon]]''.

After seven years with A&M, he signed with [[Motown]]. In 1979, he duetted with [[Syreeta Wright]] on the ballad \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\",<ref name=nyt/> which reached number 4 on the charts in the US. Preston's career lost momentum in the 1980s due to his [[cocaine]] and alcohol addictions. He left Motown in 1984 and focused on session work, contributing to works by artists such as [[Luther Vandross]] (his organ solos were included on Vandross' 1985 hit \"Til My Baby Comes Home\"), [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Patti LaBelle]], among others. He served as musical director for ''[[Nightlife (TV series)|Nightlife]]'', a late-night [[talk show]] hosted by [[David Brenner]] that lasted one season from 1986 to 1987.<ref name=\"Chase\">

Preston toured with [[Eric Clapton]], recorded with Gary Walker, one of the vocalists in his Los Angeles-based band, and worked with a wide range of other artists. He also toured with [[Ringo Starr]], appearing on [[Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band|his 1990 live album]]. He was invited to become a member of [[The Band]] in 1991, after the death of piano player [[Stan Szelest]]. He performed on tour with the group,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1991-07-20-2816944-story.html|title=Billy Preston Makes The Band Born Again|last=Gehman|first=Geoff|date=July 20, 1991|website=The Morning Call|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> but the sentencing from his cocaine and sexual assault charges in 1991 ended the collaboration.

===Later work===
In 1997, Billy Preston recorded the album ''You and I'', in Italy, with Italian band [[Novecento (group)|Novecento]]. The album was produced by Vaughn De Spenza and Novecento members [[Nicolosi Productions|Lino and Pino Nicolosi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/novecentomusic-wolit/collaboration/collaboration.htm |title=Collaborations - Novecento and Billy Preston |publisher=Web.tiscali.it |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> In 1998, Preston played organ during the choir numbers on the [[UPN]] comedy show ''[[Good News (TV series)|Good News]]''. The same year he sang and played synthesizer in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', as part of [[the Louisiana Gator Boys]] supergroup.

On November 29, 2001, while touring and fighting his own health problems, Preston received the news that George Harrison had died, having long suffered from [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. Preston, among many of Harrison's longtime friends, performed in the 2002 [[Concert for George]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. Preston's performance of \"My Sweet Lord\" received critical acclaim. Additionally, he sang \"[[Isn't It a Pity]]\", provided backing vocals on most of the other songs, and played the [[Hammond organ]] for the show.

In 2002, Preston appeared on the [[Johnny Cash]] album ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'', playing piano on \"[[Personal Jesus]]\" and \"[[Tear-Stained Letter]]\".

In 2004, Preston toured with [[the Funk Brothers]] and [[Steve Winwood]] in Europe, and then with Clapton in Europe and North America. After the Clapton tours, he went to France, where he was featured in one episode of the ''Legends Rock TV Show.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legends-rock.com/index.php/episodes/billy-preston |title=Guest Artist of the Legends Rock TV Show |publisher=Legends-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> His performance included a duet with [[Sam Moore]] on \"You Are So Beautiful\"; this was Preston's last filmed concert.

In 2004, Preston performed as a [[List of jazz organists|jazz organist]] on Ray Charles' ''[[Genius Loves Company]]'', an album of duets, on the song \"[[Here We Go Again (Ray Charles song)|Here We Go Again]]\" with Charles and [[Norah Jones]].

In March 2005, he appeared on the ''[[American Idol]]'' [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] finale. Playing piano, he performed \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\" with [[Vonzell Solomon]] (who finished the contest in third place). The same year, he recorded \"Go Where No One's Gone Before\", the main title song for the [[anime]] series ''[[L/R: Licensed by Royalty]]''.

Preston played [[clavinet]] on the song \"Warlocks\" for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] album ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006). Although very ill by this point, he jumped out of his bed after hearing a tape of the song given to him by the band, recorded his part, and went back to bed.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/peppers%20get%20sick%20preston%20out%20of%20bed_14_03_2006 |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers - Peppers Get Sick Preston Out Of Bed |magazine=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> Preston's final recorded contributions were the gospel-tinged organ on the [[Neil Diamond]] album ''[[12 Songs (Neil Diamond album)|12 Songs]]'' (2005), and his keyboard work on ''[[The Road to Escondido]]'' (2006) by Eric Clapton and [[J. J. Cale]].

In late 2005, Preston made his last public performance, in Los Angeles, to publicize the re-release of the 1972  documentary film ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]''. He played a set of three Harrison songs – \"Give Me Love\", \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"Isn't It a Pity\" – with [[Dhani Harrison]] and Starr joining on guitar and drums, respectively, for the last song.

==Personal life==
Preston lived in [[London]] for a time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulmusic.info/main.asp?S=3&T=36&ART=262|title=SoulMusic.com|website=Soulmusic.info|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> possibly around 1969–1971, but he moved back to the US sometime in the early 1970s.

=== Religion ===
Billy Preston was brought up in the African-American [[Gospel music|gospel]] tradition; he was a committed Christian throughout his life and he openly expressed his faith in works such as his 1970s hit \"[[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|That's the Way God Planned It]]\". However, his personal beliefs were sometimes at odds with the attitudes and musical expressions of the secular world of rock & roll in which he often worked; while he was apparently willing to put his religious views aside when working on tracks like [[John Lennon]]'s openly atheistic song \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\". Preston was also deeply attached to his mother, for whom he wrote the song that became his best-known composition, \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wqb5d ''Billy Preston: That's The Way God Planned It''], BBC Radio 4,  December 21, 2010.</ref>

=== Sexuality ===
Although the details did not become fully known to the general public until after his death, Preston struggled throughout his life to cope with his [[homosexuality]], and the lasting effects of the traumatic sexual abuse he suffered as a boy. Although his [[sexual orientation]] became known to friends and associates in the music world (such as [[Keith Richards]]), Preston did not publicly come out as gay until just before he died. This was reportedly partly because he felt that it conflicted with his deeply held religious beliefs and his lifelong association with the church, so he remained \"[[Coming out|in the closet]]\" until shortly before his death.

In an interview for a 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] documentary on his life and career, Preston's manager Joyce Moore revealed that after she began handling his affairs, Preston opened up to her about the lifelong trauma he had suffered as the result of being sexually abused as a boy. Preston told Moore that at about the age of nine, after he and his mother moved to Los Angeles from Houston to perform in a touring production of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', he was repeatedly abused by the touring company's pianist. When Preston told his mother about the abuse, she did not believe him, and failed to protect him.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" /> The abuse subsequently went on for the entire summer, and Preston stated that he was also later abused by a local pastor.

Another traumatic incident, which reportedly affected Preston deeply, occurred in the early 1970s, while he was engaged to actress/model Kathy Silva. At this time Preston had become close friends with musician [[Sly Stone]], and made many contributions to Stone's recordings of the period (including the landmark album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]''). According to Moore, Preston was devastated when he came home one day to find Stone in bed with Silva (who later famously married Stone on stage at Madison Square Garden). According to Moore, Silva's affair with Stone was the trigger that led Preston to stop having relationships with women. It was after this incident that he began abusing [[cocaine]] and having sex with men, and Moore has stated that she saw his drug abuse as his way of coping with the internal conflicts he felt about his sexual urges.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/><ref>[http://www.houstonpress.com/music/the-bitter-battle-over-fifth-beatle-billy-prestons-estate-6779599 Nate Jackson, \"The Bitter Battle over 'Fifth Beatle' Billy Preston's Estate\", ''Houston Press'', March 11, 2015 (retrieved December 1, 2015)]</ref>

==Death==
{{Wikinews|Billy Preston dies at 59}}
Preston had suffered [[kidney disease]] in his later years, brought on by his [[hypertension]]. He received a kidney transplant in 2002, but his health continued to deteriorate. He had voluntarily entered a drug rehabilitation clinic in [[Malibu, California]], at the suggestion of guitarist Is'real Benton, and suffered [[pericarditis]] there, leading to respiratory failure that left him in a coma from November 21, 2005.<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news |first= Jon|last= Pareles|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Billy Preston, 59, Soul Musician, Is Dead; Renowned Keyboardist and Collaborator |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/arts/07preston.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all |quote=Billy Preston, the splashy gospel-rooted keyboardist whose career included No. 1 solo hits and work with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, died yesterday in Scottsdale, Ariz.

==Legacy==
[[Miles Davis]]' 1974 album ''[[Get Up with It]]'' features a track called \"Billy Preston\" in his honor. Ringo Starr, speaking during the rehearsals for the Concert for George in 2002, called Preston one of the greatest Hammond players of all time.

His song \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\" was featured in the soundtrack of the 2008 film ''[[Be Kind Rewind]]''.

In his introduction to the 2010 [[BBC Radio]] program ''Billy Preston: That's the Way God Planned It'', former [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] said of Preston: \"Every keyboard player I know loves Billy Preston. You can spot his playing a mile off, whether it's the Hammond organ, the Fender Rhodes or the piano. He had such a ''spiritual'' touch to his technique, it made him completely unique.\"<ref>{{cite AV media|people=[[Rick Wakeman|Wakeman, Rick]] (presenter); Wilson, John (producer)|year=2010|title=Billy Preston: That's the Way God Planned It|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wqb5d|medium=''Radio 4 on Music'' documentary|time=1:26–1:42|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

'''William Everett Preston''' (September 2, 1946 – June 6, 2006)<ref name=\"nyt\" /> was an American musician whose work encompassed [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. Preston was a top session keyboardist in the 1960s, during which he backed artists such as [[Little Richard]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Rev. James Cleveland]] and [[the Beatles]]. He went on to achieve fame as a solo artist, with hit singles such as \"[[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|That's the Way God Planned It]]\", the Grammy-winning \"[[Outa-Space]]\", \"[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]\", \"[[Space Race (Billy Preston song)|Space Race]]\", \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\" and \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\". Additionally, Preston co-wrote \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\", which became a number 5 hit for [[Joe Cocker]].

Preston was one of five musicians<ref>{{Cite AV media notes | title=Revolver | title-link  = Revolver (Beatles album) | year =1966 | type = LP cover (back) | publisher = [[Parlophone Records]] | id = PCS7009 }} </ref> credited on a Beatles recording other than the group's four members. Preston continued to record and perform with other artists, notably [[George Harrison]] after the Beatles' breakup, and [[Eric Clapton]], and he played keyboards for [[the Rolling Stones]] on many of the group's albums and tours during the 1970s.

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Preston was born September 2, 1946, in [[Houston]]{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=741}} and moved to [[Los Angeles]] as a child with his mother, Robbie Lee Williams.  Noted as a [[child prodigy]], Preston was entirely self-taught and never had a music lesson. By the age of ten, he was playing [[Organ_(music)|organ]] onstage backing several gospel singers such as [[Mahalia Jackson]].<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/arts/07preston.html|title=Billy Preston, 59, Soul Musician, Is Dead; Renowned Keyboardist and Collaborator|last=|first=|date=June 7, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref> Aged 11, Preston appeared on an episode of [[Nat King Cole]]'s [[NBC]] network TV show singing the [[Fats Domino]] hit \"[[Blueberry Hill (song)|Blueberry Hill]]\" with Cole.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=billy+preston+blueberry+hill&FORM=VIRE1#view=detail&mid=C4C029AE7E4DA745633AC4C029AE7E4DA745633A|title=billy preston blueberry hill - Bing video|website=Bing.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> He also appeared in ''[[St. Louis Blues (1958 film)|St. Louis Blues]]'', the 1958 [[W. C. Handy]] biopic starring [[Nat King Cole]]; Preston played Handy at a younger age.<ref name=\"nyt\" />

In 1962, Preston joined [[Little Richard]]'s band as an organist, and it was while performing in [[Hamburg]] that he met the Beatles.<ref name=nyt/> In 1963, he played the organ on [[Sam Cooke]]'s ''[[Night Beat (Sam Cooke album)|Night Beat]]'' album and released his own debut album, ''16 Yr Old Soul'', for Cooke's [[SAR Records|SAR]] label.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news-releases.theurbanmusicscene.com/2011/02/11/billy-prestons-16-year-old-soul-to-be-re.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212030620/http://news-releases.theurbanmusicscene.com/2011/02/11/billy-prestons-16-year-old-soul-to-be-re.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-12-12 |work=The Urban Music Scene |title=Billy Preston's ''16-Year-Old Soul'' to be Digitally re-re-released on February 22, 2011 }} \"''16 Year Old Soul'' is an album of percolating organ-infused instrumentals that offers insight into the roots of one of the music world's most innovative and genre-busting stars who died at the age of 59, in 2006. With songs covering a broad spectrum of styles from country ('Born to Loose') to R&B ('Good News') to jazz ('God Bless The Child') with pop and blues undertones aplenty, ''16 Year Old Soul'' is a preserved-in-amber glimpse of an artist whose musical maturity belied his years.\"</ref> In 1965, he released the album ''[[The Most Exciting Organ Ever]]'' and performed on the rock and roll show ''[[Shindig!]]'' In 1967, he joined [[Ray Charles]]' band.{{sfn|Womack|2014|p=741}} Following this exposure, several musicians began asking Preston to contribute to their sessions.<ref name=nyt/>

===Relationship with the Beatles===
Preston first met [[the Beatles]] as a 16-year-old in 1962, while part of Little Richard's touring band, when their manager [[Brian Epstein]] organized a Liverpool show, at which the Beatles opened. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' explained their subsequent meeting:
{{quote|They'd hook up again in 1969, when the Beatles were about to break up while recording the last album they released, ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' (they would later record ''[[Abbey Road]]'', which was released prior to ''Let It Be''). [[George Harrison]], a friend of Preston, had quit, walked out of the studio and gone to a Ray Charles concert in [[London]], where Preston was playing organ. Harrison brought Preston back to the studio, where his keen musicianship and gregarious personality temporarily calmed the tension.<ref name=\"WP Obit\">{{cite news |first= Richard|last= Harrington|title='Fifth Beatle' Billy Preston Made the Greats Even Greater |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/07/AR2006060702166.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 8, 2006 |accessdate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>}}

Preston is one of several people referred to as the \"[[Fifth Beatle]]\". At one point during the [[Let It Be (Beatles album)#Recording and production|''Get Back'' sessions]], [[John Lennon]] proposed the idea of having him join the band (to which [[Paul McCartney]] countered that it was difficult enough reaching agreements with four).<ref>The Beatles - A/B Road: The Complete Get back Sessions, January 24th</ref> Preston played organ and electric piano for the Beatles during several of the ''Get Back'' sessions; some of these sessions appeared in the film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let it Be]]'' and on its companion album. Preston also accompanied the band on electric piano for [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|its rooftop concert]], the group's final public appearance.<ref name=\"WP Obit\"/> In April 1969, their single \"Get Back\" was credited to \"The Beatles with Billy Preston\", the only time such a joint credit had been given on an official Beatles-sanctioned release (as distinct from an unsanctioned reissue of some Hamburg-era recordings on which they were the backing group for [[Tony Sheridan]]). The credit was bestowed by the Beatles to reflect the extent of Preston's presence on the track; his electric piano is prominent throughout and he plays an extended solo. Preston also worked, in a more limited role, on the ''Abbey Road'' album, contributing organ to the tracks \"[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]\" and \"[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]\".

In 1978, he appeared as Sgt. Pepper in [[Robert Stigwood]]'s film ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was based on the Beatles' [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|album of the same name]], and sang and danced to \"Get Back\" as the penultimate song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/21/archives/screen-son-of-sgt-pepper-many-forms-involved.html|title=Screen: Son of 'Sgt.

===Post-Beatles solo career===
[[File:Billy Preston perforning in 1971.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Preston singing at the piano in 1971]]
Signed to the Beatles' [[Apple Records|Apple]] label, in 1969, Preston released the album ''[[That's the Way God Planned It]]'', produced by Harrison, the [[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|title song from which]] was a hit single in Britain. His relationship with Harrison continued after the Beatles' break-up in 1970; Preston was the first artist to record Harrison's subsequent international hit \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", on his 1970 album ''[[Encouraging Words]]'', which Harrison co-produced with him. He appeared on several of Harrison's 1970s solo albums, starting with ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''; made a notable contribution to [[the Concert for Bangladesh]], the Harrison-organized 1971 charity benefit; performed with the ex-Beatle on his 1974 tour of [[North America]]; and played at the 2002 [[Concert for George]] tribute, held at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Preston also worked on solo releases by Lennon and [[Ringo Starr]].

In 1971, Preston left Apple and signed with [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[A&M Records]]. The previous year, he contributed to another hit single when [[Stephen Stills]] asked to use Preston's phrase \"if you can't be with the one you love, [[Love the One You're With|love the one you're with]]\", a song on Stills' [[Stephen Stills (album)|self-titled]] debut solo album.<ref>{{cite news|title=Song Stories: Love The One You're With|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/song-stories/love-the-one-you-re-with-stephen-stills|accessdate=February 10, 2014|newspaper=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

Following the release of ''[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]'' on A&M, Preston's solo career peaked at this time, beginning with 1972's \"[[Outa-Space]]\", an [[instrumental]] track that further popularized the sound of the [[clavinet]] in [[funk]] music. The song reached number 2 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and topped ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart, before going on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]]. \"Outa-Space\" sold over 1 million copies in America, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in June 1972.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins |location=London |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/319 319, 334, and 349] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/319 }}</ref> Later that year, Preston contributed the title song to the hit [[blaxploitation]] film ''[[Slaughter (1972 film)|Slaughter]]'' starring [[Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite AV media notes|url=|first=John|last=Tobler|title=[[I Wrote a Simple Song]]/[[Music Is My Life]]|others=Billy Preston|pp=4, 6|year=2011|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[BGO Records]]|id=}}</ref>

Over the next two years, Preston followed up with the US chart-topping singles \"[[Will It Go Round in Circles]]\" (which displaced Harrison's \"[[Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)]]\" at the top on 7 July 1973) and \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\", and the number 4 hit \"[[Space Race (Billy Preston song)|Space Race]]\". Each of the three singles sold in excess of 1 million copies.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> ''[[American Bandstand]]'' host and executive producer [[Dick Clark]] enjoyed \"Space Race\" so much that he used the instrumental for the mid-show break for virtually the remainder of its run.

[[File:The Rolling Stones with Billy Preston (1975).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|right|Preston (seated behind grand piano in foreground) performing with the Rolling Stones in 1975]]
From 1970, Preston played keyboards (including piano, organ, clavinet and various synthesizers) for [[the Rolling Stones]], sometimes alongside pianists [[Nicky Hopkins]] and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]], on their albums ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'', ''[[Goats Head Soup]]'', ''[[It's Only Rock 'n Roll]]'' and ''[[Black and Blue]]''. As the band's primary touring keyboardist from 1973 to 1977, he also performed as a support act with his own band (including [[Mick Taylor]] on guitar) on their [[The Rolling Stones 1973 European Tour|1973 European tour]]. A [[Munich]] performance from this tour was documented on Preston's album ''[[Live European Tour 1973]]''. In 1974, along with [[Bruce Fisher]], one of his regular songwriting collaborators in the 1970s, he composed one of Joe Cocker's biggest hits, \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\". On October 11, 1975, he was the first musical guest on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''{{'}}s series premiere episode.<ref name=nyt/> Preston's 1973 song \"Do You Love Me\" was the basis for the Rolling Stones' track \"Melody\", released on ''Black and Blue'' in 1976. Although two of his songs were included in the band's 1975 and 1976 live sets, the Stones and Preston parted company in 1977, mainly due to a disagreement over money. He continued to play on solo records by Stones members like [[Mick Jagger]]'s ''[[Wandering Spirit (album)|Wandering Spirit]]'', and made appearances on the band's ''[[Tattoo You]]'' and ''[[Bridges to Babylon]]''.

After seven years with A&M, he signed with [[Motown]]. In 1979, he duetted with [[Syreeta Wright]] on the ballad \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\",<ref name=nyt/> which reached number 4 on the charts in the US. Preston's career lost momentum in the 1980s due to his [[cocaine]] and alcohol addictions. He left Motown in 1984 and focused on session work, contributing to works by artists such as [[Luther Vandross]] (his organ solos were included on Vandross' 1985 hit \"Til My Baby Comes Home\"), [[Whitney Houston]] and [[Patti LaBelle]], among others. He served as musical director for ''[[Nightlife (TV series)|Nightlife]]'', a late-night [[talk show]] hosted by [[David Brenner]] that lasted one season from 1986 to 1987.<ref name=\"Chase\">

Preston toured with [[Eric Clapton]], recorded with Gary Walker, one of the vocalists in his Los Angeles-based band, and worked with a wide range of other artists. He also toured with [[Ringo Starr]], appearing on [[Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band|his 1990 live album]]. He was invited to become a member of [[The Band]] in 1991, after the death of piano player [[Stan Szelest]]. He performed on tour with the group,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcall.com/news/mc-xpm-1991-07-20-2816944-story.html|title=Billy Preston Makes The Band Born Again|last=Gehman|first=Geoff|date=July 20, 1991|website=The Morning Call|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref> but the sentencing from his cocaine and sexual assault charges in 1991 ended the collaboration.

===Later work===
In 1997, Billy Preston recorded the album ''You and I'', in Italy, with Italian band [[Novecento (group)|Novecento]]. The album was produced by Vaughn De Spenza and Novecento members [[Nicolosi Productions|Lino and Pino Nicolosi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/novecentomusic-wolit/collaboration/collaboration.htm |title=Collaborations - Novecento and Billy Preston |publisher=Web.tiscali.it |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> In 1998, Preston played organ during the choir numbers on the [[UPN]] comedy show ''[[Good News (TV series)|Good News]]''. The same year he sang and played synthesizer in the film ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', as part of [[the Louisiana Gator Boys]] supergroup.

On November 29, 2001, while touring and fighting his own health problems, Preston received the news that George Harrison had died, having long suffered from [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. Preston, among many of Harrison's longtime friends, performed in the 2002 [[Concert for George]] at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London. Preston's performance of \"My Sweet Lord\" received critical acclaim. Additionally, he sang \"[[Isn't It a Pity]]\", provided backing vocals on most of the other songs, and played the [[Hammond organ]] for the show.

In 2002, Preston appeared on the [[Johnny Cash]] album ''[[American IV: The Man Comes Around]]'', playing piano on \"[[Personal Jesus]]\" and \"[[Tear-Stained Letter]]\".

In 2004, Preston toured with [[the Funk Brothers]] and [[Steve Winwood]] in Europe, and then with Clapton in Europe and North America. After the Clapton tours, he went to France, where he was featured in one episode of the ''Legends Rock TV Show.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legends-rock.com/index.php/episodes/billy-preston |title=Guest Artist of the Legends Rock TV Show |publisher=Legends-rock.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> His performance included a duet with [[Sam Moore]] on \"You Are So Beautiful\"; this was Preston's last filmed concert.

In 2004, Preston performed as a [[List of jazz organists|jazz organist]] on Ray Charles' ''[[Genius Loves Company]]'', an album of duets, on the song \"[[Here We Go Again (Ray Charles song)|Here We Go Again]]\" with Charles and [[Norah Jones]].

In March 2005, he appeared on the ''[[American Idol]]'' [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] finale. Playing piano, he performed \"[[With You I'm Born Again]]\" with [[Vonzell Solomon]] (who finished the contest in third place). The same year, he recorded \"Go Where No One's Gone Before\", the main title song for the [[anime]] series ''[[L/R: Licensed by Royalty]]''.

Preston played [[clavinet]] on the song \"Warlocks\" for the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] album ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006). Although very ill by this point, he jumped out of his bed after hearing a tape of the song given to him by the band, recorded his part, and went back to bed.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/peppers%20get%20sick%20preston%20out%20of%20bed_14_03_2006 |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers - Peppers Get Sick Preston Out Of Bed |magazine=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> Preston's final recorded contributions were the gospel-tinged organ on the [[Neil Diamond]] album ''[[12 Songs (Neil Diamond album)|12 Songs]]'' (2005), and his keyboard work on ''[[The Road to Escondido]]'' (2006) by Eric Clapton and [[J. J. Cale]].

In late 2005, Preston made his last public performance, in Los Angeles, to publicize the re-release of the 1972  documentary film ''[[The Concert for Bangladesh (film)|The Concert for Bangladesh]]''. He played a set of three Harrison songs – \"Give Me Love\", \"My Sweet Lord\" and \"Isn't It a Pity\" – with [[Dhani Harrison]] and Starr joining on guitar and drums, respectively, for the last song.

==Personal life==
Preston lived in [[London]] for a time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulmusic.info/main.asp?S=3&T=36&ART=262|title=SoulMusic.com|website=Soulmusic.info|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> possibly around 1969–1971, but he moved back to the US sometime in the early 1970s.

=== Religion ===
Billy Preston was brought up in the African-American [[Gospel music|gospel]] tradition; he was a committed Christian throughout his life and he openly expressed his faith in works such as his 1970s hit \"[[That's the Way God Planned It (song)|That's the Way God Planned It]]\". However, his personal beliefs were sometimes at odds with the attitudes and musical expressions of the secular world of rock & roll in which he often worked; while he was apparently willing to put his religious views aside when working on tracks like [[John Lennon]]'s openly atheistic song \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\". Preston was also deeply attached to his mother, for whom he wrote the song that became his best-known composition, \"[[You Are So Beautiful]]\".<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wqb5d ''Billy Preston: That's The Way God Planned It''], BBC Radio 4,  December 21, 2010.</ref>

=== Sexuality ===
Although the details did not become fully known to the general public until after his death, Preston struggled throughout his life to cope with his [[homosexuality]], and the lasting effects of the traumatic sexual abuse he suffered as a boy. Although his [[sexual orientation]] became known to friends and associates in the music world (such as [[Keith Richards]]), Preston did not publicly come out as gay until just before he died. This was reportedly partly because he felt that it conflicted with his deeply held religious beliefs and his lifelong association with the church, so he remained \"[[Coming out|in the closet]]\" until shortly before his death. Keith Richards' autobiography, ''Life'',<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Life (Keith Richards)|Life]]|author=Richards, Keith|authorlink=Keith Richards|publisher=[[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-297-85439-5|quote=And he was gay at a time when nobody could be openly gay, which added difficulties to his life.

In an interview for a 2010 [[BBC Radio 4]] documentary on his life and career, Preston's manager Joyce Moore revealed that after she began handling his affairs, Preston opened up to her about the lifelong trauma he had suffered as the result of being sexually abused as a boy. Preston told Moore that at about the age of nine, after he and his mother moved to Los Angeles from Houston to perform in a touring production of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'', he was repeatedly abused by the touring company's pianist. When Preston told his mother about the abuse, she did not believe him, and failed to protect him.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\" /> The abuse subsequently went on for the entire summer, and Preston stated that he was also later abused by a local pastor.

Another traumatic incident, which reportedly affected Preston deeply, occurred in the early 1970s, while he was engaged to actress/model Kathy Silva. At this time Preston had become close friends with musician [[Sly Stone]], and made many contributions to Stone's recordings of the period (including the landmark album ''[[There's a Riot Goin' On]]''). According to Moore, Preston was devastated when he came home one day to find Stone in bed with Silva (who later famously married Stone on stage at Madison Square Garden). According to Moore, Silva's affair with Stone was the trigger that led Preston to stop having relationships with women. It was after this incident that he began abusing [[cocaine]] and having sex with men, and Moore has stated that she saw his drug abuse as his way of coping with the internal conflicts he felt about his sexual urges.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/><ref>[http://www.houstonpress.com/music/the-bitter-battle-over-fifth-beatle-billy-prestons-estate-6779599 Nate Jackson, \"The Bitter Battle over 'Fifth Beatle' Billy Preston's Estate\", ''Houston Press'', March 11, 2015 (retrieved December 1, 2015)]</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Miles Davis]]' 1974 album ''[[Get Up with It]]'' features a track called \"Billy Preston\" in his honor. Ringo Starr, speaking during the rehearsals for the Concert for George in 2002, called Preston one of the greatest Hammond players of all time.

His song \"[[Nothing from Nothing (Billy Preston song)|Nothing from Nothing]]\" was featured in the soundtrack of the 2008 film ''[[Be Kind Rewind]]''.

In his introduction to the 2010 [[BBC Radio]] program ''Billy Preston: That's the Way God Planned It'', former [[Yes (band)|Yes]] keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] said of Preston: \"Every keyboard player I know loves Billy Preston. You can spot his playing a mile off, whether it's the Hammond organ, the Fender Rhodes or the piano. He had such a ''spiritual'' touch to his technique, it made him completely unique.\"<ref>{{cite AV media|people=[[Rick Wakeman|Wakeman, Rick]] (presenter); Wilson, John (producer)|year=2010|title=Billy Preston: That's the Way God Planned It|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wqb5d|medium=''Radio 4 on Music'' documentary|time=1:26–1:42|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

The '''Canada lynx''' (''Lynx canadensis'') is a medium-sized [[lynx]] native to [[North America]]. It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.

The Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada—when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.

This lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.

A study of the differences (in factors such as coat colour, cranial measurements and weights) between the mainland and Newfoundland forms showed that apart from a few variations (for instance, the Newfoundland lynx features a darker coat than the mainland subspecies), the standard measurements are not significantly distinct. Noting only a few differences between the two forms, the study suggested the Newfoundland lynx to have [[genetic divergence|diverged]] only recently from the mainland form. The lack of appreciable subspecific distinctions led the researchers to doubt the vaidity of the Newfoundland lynx as a separate subspecies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Zyll de Jong |first1=C.

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Lynx (5300913523).jpg|thumb|A close facial view of the Canada lynx. The black ear tufts are characteristic of lynxes.]]

The Canada lynx is a lean, medium-sized cat characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the bobcat, the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx is [[sexually dimorphic]], with males larger and heavier than females. The lynx is between {{convert|73|and|107|cm|in|abbr=on}} in head-and-body length and stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder; females weigh around {{convert|5|–|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}} while males weigh around {{convert|6|–|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Sunquist/> Physical proportions do not vary significantly across the range and are probably [[natural selection|naturally selected]] to allow survival on smaller prey.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Werdelin|first1=L.|authorlink=Lars Werdelin|title=The evolution of lynxes|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|url=http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/ibelynxco/04_library/4_3_publications/W/Werdelin_1981_Evolution_of_lynxes.pdf|date=1981|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37–71|jstor=23734102|access-date=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005114343/http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/ibelynxco/04_library/4_3_publications/W/Werdelin_1981_Evolution_of_lynxes.pdf|archive-date=October 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Eurasian lynx, that prefers prey the size of a [[roe deer]], is twice the size of the Canada lynx, that feeds primarily on the [[snowshoe hare]].<ref name=Sunquist/> The stubby tail, typical of lynxes, is {{convert|5|–|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; while the bobcat's tail is black only in the upper part, the tail of the Canada lynx has a completely black tip.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=L.|title=Wild Cats of the World|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1-4729-2285-4|pages=146–151|url={{Google Books|id=hzNBCgAAQBAJ|page=146|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> 

The long, dense fur, uniformly coloured with little to no markings except on the underside, insulates the lynx in its frosty habitat.

=== Relationship with the snowshoe hare ===

A [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist predator]], the Canada lynx depends heavily on snowshoe hares for food.<ref name=Hunter/> Snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada undergo cyclic rises and falls—at times the population densities can fall from as high as {{convert|2,300|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}} to as low as {{convert|12|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. Consequently, a period of hare scarcity occurs every 8 to 11 years. An example of a prey-predator cycle, the cyclic variations in snowshoe hare populations significantly affect the numbers of their predators—lynxes and [[coyote]]s—in the region. When the hare populations plummet, lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares, and tend to not produce litters; as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx.<ref name=\"Brand1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=C.J.|last2=Keith|first2=L.B.|title=Lynx demography during a snowshoe hare decline in Alberta|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1979|volume=43|issue=4|pages=827–849|doi=10.2307/3808267|jstor=3808267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Hofer |first4=E.J. |title=Numerical responses of coyotes and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1997 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=150–162 |doi=10.2307/3546526|jstor=3546526 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=R.M.P. |last2=Krebs |first2=C.J. |title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=1985 |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=2817–2824 |doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> In northern Canada, the abundance of lynxes can be estimated from the records kept of the number caught each year for their fur; records have been kept by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] since the 1730s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=M.S. |year=1977|title=Hares, lynx, and trappers |journal= The American Naturalist|volume= 111|issue=980 |pages=806–8 |doi=10.1086/283212 |jstor=2460337}}</ref> These cycles have been cited as one of the few examples of the [[Lotka-Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations]], caused by the interplay of three major factors—food, predation and social interaction.<ref name=\"krebs2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Krebs |first1=C.J. |last2=Boonstra |first2=R. |last3=Boutin |first3=S. |last4=Sinclair |first4=A.R.E. |title=What drives the 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares?: The ten-year cycle of snowshoe hares—one of the most striking features of the boreal forest— is a product of the interaction between predation and food supplies, as large-scale experiments in the Yukon have demonstrated |journal=BioScience |date=2001 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0025:WDTYCO]2.0.CO;2|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/51/1/25/26890541/51-1-25.pdf}}</ref> A study involving statistical modelling of the interspecific relations of the snowshoe hare, the plant species it feeds on and its predators (including the Canada lynx) suggested that while the demographics of the lynx depend primarily on the hare, the hare's dynamics depend both on the plant species in its diet and predators, of which the Canada lynx is just one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stenseth |first1=N.C. |last2=Falck |first2=W. |last3=Bjørnstad |first3=O.N. |last4=Krebs |first4=C.J. |title=Population regulation in snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx: Asymmetric food web configurations between hare and lynx |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1997 |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=5147–52 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.10.5147 |pmid=9144205 |pmc=24646 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.5147C |url=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/94/10/5147.full.pdf}}</ref> Environmental factors such as forest fires, precipitation and snowfall might also significantly affect this prey-predator cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=J.F. |title=Forest fires and the snowshoe hare-Canada lynx cycle |journal=Oecologia |date=1978 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–374 |doi=10.1007/BF00346252}}</ref>

===Home ranges===
[[File:Canada lynx (6002291242).jpg|thumb|Lynxes are typically solitary with minimal social bonds.]]
Canada lynxes establish [[home range]]s that vary widely in size, depending upon the method of measurement. The two common methods are examining the tracks of the lynx on snow (snow-tracking) and [[Wildlife radio telemetry|radio telemetry]]; snow-tracking generally gives smaller sizes for home ranges. Studies based on snow-tracking have estimated home range sizes of {{convert|11.1|–|49.5|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those based on radio telemetry have given the area between {{convert|8|and|783|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lox/> Like other cats, Canada lynxes [[Territorial marking|scent-mark]] their ranges by spraying urine and depositing faeces on snow or tree stumps and other prominent sites in and around their range.<ref name=Sunquist/>

Factors such as availability of prey (primarily snowshoe hare), density of lynxes and the topography of the habitat determine the shape and size of the home range.<ref name=lox/> Studies have tried to correlate the abundance of snowshoe hares in an area with the sizes of lynx home ranges in that area. A 1985 study showed that the mean size of home ranges trebled—from {{convert|13.2|to|39.2|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}—when the density of hares fell from {{convert|14.7|to|1|/ha|/acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=R.M.P.|last2=Krebs|first2=C.J.|title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1985|volume=63|issue=12|pages=2817–24|doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> However, a few other studies have reported different responses from lynxes at times of prey scarcity; some lynxes do not show any changes in their ranges, while others may resort to hunting in small areas, occupying small home ranges.<ref name=lox/> Canada lynxes generally do not leave their home ranges frequently, though limited prey availability can force lynxes to disperse or expand their ranges.<ref name=Poole1995>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Spatial organization of a lynx population|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1995|volume=73|issue=4|pages=632–41|doi=10.1139/z95-074}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Dispersal patterns of lynx in the Northwest Territories|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1997|volume=61|issue=2|pages=497–505|doi=10.2307/3802607|jstor=3802607}}</ref>

Males tend to occupy larger ranges than do females; for instance, data from a 1980 radio telemetric analysis in [[Minnesota]] showed that home ranges of males spread over {{convert|145|–|243|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those of females covered {{convert|51|–|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mech|first1=L.D.|title=Age, sex, reproduction, and spatial organization of lynxes colonizing Northeastern Minnesota|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=1980|volume=61|issue=2|pages=261–7|jstor=1380047|doi=10.2307/1380047}}</ref> In another radio telemetric study in 1985 in [[Montana]], male home ranges averaged {{convert|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and those of females averaged {{convert|43.1|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Brainerd|first=S.M.|title=Reproductive ecology of bobcats and lynx in western Montana|type=M.Sc. thesis |publisher=[[University of Montana]]|date=1985|pages=1–85}}</ref> In a study in the southern [[Northwest Territories]], ranges of individuals of opposite sexes were found to overlap extensively, while the ranges of individuals of the same sex hardly coincided.

A [[Genetics|genetic]] study showed that lynxes at the periphery of a population, given their smaller numbers and greater susceptibility to variations in the range, face more difficulty in breeding with lynxes toward the centre of the population and hence show lower [[genetic variability]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=M.K. |last2=Mills |first2=L.S. |last3=Ortega |first3=Y. |last4=Ruggiero |first4=L.F. |last5=Allendorf |first5=F.W. |title=Landscape location affects genetic variation of Canada lynx (''Lynx canadensis'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=2003 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1807–16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01878.x|pmid=12803633 }}</ref>

===Diet and hunting===
[[File:Snowshoe Hare (6187109754).jpg|thumb|left|[[Snowshoe hare]], the primary prey of the Canada lynx]]
The Canada lynx preys primarily and almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. These hares comprise 35–97% of their diet; the proportion varies by the season and the abundance of hares.<ref name=Hunter/> However, at times when the numbers of the hare drop, lynxes will include other animals in their diet—such as ducks, [[grouse]], moles, [[ptarmigan]], [[red squirrel]]s, voles and young [[ungulate]]s ([[Dall's sheep]], [[mule deer]] and [[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]])—though snowshoe hares continue to be the primary component. The Canada lynx tends to be less selective in summer and autumn, adding small mammals as a minor component of their diet besides the hare. The reason behind this is unclear—it could be due to greater abundance of alternate prey, or reduced success in hunting hares.<ref name=ruggiero/> A study in Alaska found that lynxes played a role in the decrease in populations of [[red fox]], caribou and Dall's sheep when hares were very low in number.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephenson |first1=R.O. |last2=Grangaard |first2=D.V. |last3=Burch |first3=J. |title=Lynx, ''Felis lynx'', predation on red foxes, ''Vulpes vulpes'', caribou, ''Rangifer tarandus'', and Dall sheep, ''Ovis dalli'', in Alaska |journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist |date=1991 |volume=105 |pages=255–62 |url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/library/pdfs/wildlife/propubs/91_stephenson_etal_lynx_predation_redfoxes_caribou_dallsheep_ak.pdf}}</ref> Canada lynxes ingest {{convert|0.6|–|1.2|kg|lb}} of food everyday.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes have also been reported feeding occasionally on [[Succulent plant|succulent]] [[sedge]]s and grasses.<ref name=yukongov/>

Canadian lynxes hunt around twilight or at night, the time when snowshoe hares tend to be active.<ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes rely on their vision and sense of hearing to locate prey.<ref name=Nowak/> The lynx will roam or wait (in what researchers often term \"ambush beds\") on certain trails where snowshoe hares gather, pounce on a hare and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck.<ref name=ruggiero/> Sometimes a chase of around ten bounds may be necessary to trap the prey. The lynx is assisted by its [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic vision]] in detecting prey and measuring distances. Staying in cover while hunting helps the lynx conserve energy in its frigid habitat by avoiding unnecessary movement.<ref name=yukongov/> Young ungulates are given a throat bite to suffocate them to death. The lynx may eat its kill immediately or cache it in snow or leaves to eat it over the next few days.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/><ref name=ruggiero/> Studies suggest success in hunting hares depends heavily on the distance between the lynx and the hare when the lynx starts chasing it and their relative speeds, which in turn depends on the hunting prowess of the lynx, the alertness of the hare and the vegetation cover among other factors.<ref name=Sunquist/> Lynxes will occasionally hunt together, though studies differ on how this affects the hunting success rate compared to when an individual hunts alone.<ref name=ruggiero/> In fact, they may hunt in groups when hares are scarce.<ref name = dono98/> [[Scavenger|Scavenging]] is common in Canada lynxes; they will take ungulates killed by the cold or vehicles.<ref name=Hunter/>
[[File:Lynx-canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|A lynx stalking its prey]]
Both coyotes and Canada lynxes are major predators of the snowshoe hare. A study showed that compared to lynxes, the feet of coyotes sink deeper in the snow due to their smaller size and hence a larger body mass to foot area ratio, prompting them to ambush their prey instead of chasing it like lynxes often do.<ref name=\"murray1991\">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=D.L. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |title=The influence of snow on lynx and coyote movements: does morphology affect behavior? |journal=Oecologia |date=1991 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=463–9 |doi=10.1007/BF00317707|pmid=28312614 |bibcode=1991Oecol..88..463M }}</ref> A study of the two species in southwest [[Yukon Territory]] showed that when the numbers of the hare increased, both predators killed more hares than were necessary for their subsistence; lynxes need to kill 0.4 to 0.5 hare per day to meet their energy requirements, but were observed to kill 1.2 hares per day during this period. Coyotes, with a success rate of 36.9%, emerged as more successful hunters than lynxes that succeeded in 28.7% of their hunts; however this may have resulted from the greater number of adult coyotes in the studied population. Lynxes rarely cached their kills, unlike coyotes, and this may have led to incomplete consumption of some kills. During the cyclic decrease in snowshoe hare numbers, both predators hunted for the same time period as they did when hares were abundant, but lynxes killed more hares than they did earlier. Moreover, lynxes supplemented their diet with red squirrels.<ref name=ODonoghue/><ref name=dono98>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Murray|first4=D.L. |last5=Hofer |first5=E.J.| title=Behavioural responses of coyote and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1998 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.2307/3546927|jstor=3546927 }}</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Canada Lynx Mom and Kitten (15250932421).jpg|thumb|left|A juvenile with its mother]]

The mating season is roughly a month long, from March to early April. Urine marking and mating calls are part of [[Display (zoology)|display behaviour]], and increases the interaction between individuals of opposite sexes. Females can be [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]] when the availability of mates is low, or spontaneous ovulators when several mates are available. Females have only a single [[estrus cycle]]; estrus lasts for three to five days in captivity.<ref name=Sunquist /> Individuals have been observed making long wailing vocalizations, probably as mating calls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Some observations on the natural history and behaviour of the Canada Lynx, ''Lynx canadensis'' |journal=Canadian Field Naturalist |date=1998 |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=32-36 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Slough/publication/268872103_Some_observations_on_the_natural_history_and_behaviour_of_the_Canada_Lynx_Lynx_canadensis/links/547a2cbc0cf293e2da2b5e05.pdf}}</ref> Before birth, the female prepares a maternal den, usually in very thick brush, and typically inside thickets of shrubs, trees or woody debris.<ref name=Kaufman/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Slough |first=B.

They are blind for the first 14 days, and [[weaning|weaned]] at 12 weeks. Most births occur from May to July. Kittens leave the den after about five weeks, and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but do not reach the full adult size until around two years old. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years. Canada lynxes have been reported to live for up to 16 years in wild, though most do not make it beyond 10 years; in captivity the lifespan may be as long as 27 years.<ref name=Sunquist /><ref name=Hunter/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Young Lynx spotted west of Drayton Valley Ab - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canada lynxes prefer dense [[boreal forest]]s.]]
The Canada lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s. Canada lynxes have been recorded up to an elevation of {{convert|4310|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/>

A Canada lynx was shot near [[Newton Abbot]] in the United Kingdom in 1903 after it attacked two dogs. The animal remained unidentified at the time and was preserved by [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]], and was finally identified in a 2014 study. The researchers concluded that it had probably been captive for some time, perhaps as an [[exotic pet]] or part of a travelling menagerie, but may have survived for a substantial period after escaping. They considered it \"the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=M. |last2=Naish |first2=D. |last3=Larson |first3=G. |last4=King |first4=C.L. |last5=Nowell |first5=G. |last6=Sakamoto |first6=M. |last7=Barnett |first7=R. |title=Multidisciplinary investigation of a ‘British big cat’: a lynx killed in southern England c. 1903 |journal=Historical Biology |date=2013 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=441–448 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2013.785541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22263874|title='Big cat' Canada lynx was on the loose in UK in 1903|last=Morelle|first=R.|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Postmedia News |title=That 'British big cat' called England's Loch Ness Monster?

== Threats and conservation ==
[[File:Felis lynx canadensis (Canadian lynx) fur skin back.jpg|thumb|left|Canada lynxes are trapped for their fur.]]
Canada lynxes are trapped in specific periods or seasons for fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada; hunting seasons and quotas are set based on population data. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality. Hybridization between Canada lynxes and bobcats has been reported in the southern periphery of the range, and does not appear to be a threat to Canada lynxes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Homyack, J.A. |year=2008|title=Canada Lynx-Bobcat (''Lynx canadensis × L.rufus'') hybrids at the southern periphery of lynx range in Maine, Minnesota and New Brunswick|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_homyack_j001.pdf|journal= American Midland Naturalist |volume=159|pages=504–508|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[504:CLLCLR]2.0.CO;2|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz, M.K. | year = 2004 | title = Hybridization between Canada Lynx and bobcats: genetic results and management implications| journal = Conservation Genetics | volume = 5 | pages = 349–355 | doi = 10.1023/B:COGE.0000031141.47148.8b | issue = 3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225195035_Hybridization_Between_Canada_Lynx_and_Bobcats_Genetic_Results_and_Management_Implications }}</ref>

The Canada lynx is abundant over its broad range, and is not significantly threatened by its legal use in the international fur trade since more than two centuries. Therefore, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) classifies the Canada lynx as [[Least Concern]]. However, populations are relatively lower in the southern half of the range and are protected from killing for fur trade. The lynx is listed as Endangered in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name=iucn/> On March 24, 2000, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) issued its Final Rule, which designated the Canada lynx a Threatened Species in 14 contiguous United States.<ref name=\"FedReg\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-03-24/pdf/00-7145.pdf|title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Threatened Status for the Contiguous U.S. Distinct Population Segment of the Canada Lynx and Related Rule |page=16051–16086|journal=Federal Register|volume= 65|issue= 58 |date= 24 March 2000|publisher=Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref> In 2005, the USFWS demarcated six major areas for revival where lynx populations had been reported in the past two decades: northern Maine and [[New Hampshire]], northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern [[Idaho]], the [[Kettle River Range]] and the \"Wedge area\" between the [[Kettle River (Columbia River tributary)|Kettle]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the northern Cascade Range of Washington, and the [[Greater Yellowstone]] area of [[Wyoming]], Montana and Idaho.<ref name=iucn/> By 2010, after an 11-year effort, the lynx had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado.

The '''Canada lynx''' (''Lynx canadensis'') is a medium-sized [[lynx]] native to [[North America]]. It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.

The Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada—when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.

This lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.

== Physical characteristics ==
[[File:Lynx (5300913523).jpg|thumb|A close facial view of the Canada lynx. The black ear tufts are characteristic of lynxes.]]

The Canada lynx is a lean, medium-sized cat characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the bobcat, the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The Canada lynx is [[sexually dimorphic]], with males larger and heavier than females. The lynx is between {{convert|73|and|107|cm|in|abbr=on}} in head-and-body length and stands {{convert|48|–|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder; females weigh around {{convert|5|–|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}} while males weigh around {{convert|6|–|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Sunquist/> Physical proportions do not vary significantly across the range and are probably [[natural selection|naturally selected]] to allow survival on smaller prey.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Werdelin|first1=L.|authorlink=Lars Werdelin|title=The evolution of lynxes|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|url=http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/ibelynxco/04_library/4_3_publications/W/Werdelin_1981_Evolution_of_lynxes.pdf|date=1981|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37–71|jstor=23734102|access-date=June 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005114343/http://lynx.uio.no/lynx/ibelynxco/04_library/4_3_publications/W/Werdelin_1981_Evolution_of_lynxes.pdf|archive-date=October 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Eurasian lynx, that prefers prey the size of a [[roe deer]], is twice the size of the Canada lynx, that feeds primarily on the [[snowshoe hare]].<ref name=Sunquist/> The stubby tail, typical of lynxes, is {{convert|5|–|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; while the bobcat's tail is black only in the upper part, the tail of the Canada lynx has a completely black tip.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=L.|title=Wild Cats of the World|date=2015|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|location=London|isbn=978-1-4729-2285-4|pages=146–151|url={{Google Books|id=hzNBCgAAQBAJ|page=146|plainurl=yes}}}}</ref> 

The long, dense fur, uniformly coloured with little to no markings except on the underside, insulates the lynx in its frosty habitat.

=== Relationship with the snowshoe hare ===
[[File:Milliers fourrures vendues en environ 90 ans odum 1953 en.jpg|right|upright=2|thumb|Numbers of [[snowshoe hare]]s (''Lepus americanus'', yellow, background) and Canada lynx (black line, foreground) furs sold to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]]]
A [[Generalist and specialist species|specialist predator]], the Canada lynx depends heavily on snowshoe hares for food.<ref name=Hunter/> Snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada undergo cyclic rises and falls—at times the population densities can fall from as high as {{convert|2,300|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}} to as low as {{convert|12|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}. Consequently, a period of hare scarcity occurs every 8 to 11 years. An example of a prey-predator cycle, the cyclic variations in snowshoe hare populations significantly affect the numbers of their predators—lynxes and [[coyote]]s—in the region. When the hare populations plummet, lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares, and tend to not produce litters; as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx.<ref name=\"Brand1979\">{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=C.J.|last2=Keith|first2=L.B.|title=Lynx demography during a snowshoe hare decline in Alberta|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1979|volume=43|issue=4|pages=827–849|doi=10.2307/3808267|jstor=3808267}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Hofer |first4=E.J. |title=Numerical responses of coyotes and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1997 |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=150–162 |doi=10.2307/3546526|jstor=3546526 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ward |first1=R.M.P. |last2=Krebs |first2=C.J. |title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance |journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology |date=1985 |volume=63 |issue=12 |pages=2817–2824 |doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> In northern Canada, the abundance of lynxes can be estimated from the records kept of the number caught each year for their fur; records have been kept by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] since the 1730s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Weinstein |first=M.S. |year=1977|title=Hares, lynx, and trappers |journal= The American Naturalist|volume= 111|issue=980 |pages=806–8 |doi=10.1086/283212 |jstor=2460337}}</ref> These cycles have been cited as one of the few examples of the [[Lotka-Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations]], caused by the interplay of three major factors—food, predation and social interaction.<ref name=\"krebs2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Krebs |first1=C.J. |last2=Boonstra |first2=R. |last3=Boutin |first3=S. |last4=Sinclair |first4=A.R.E. |title=What drives the 10-year cycle of snowshoe hares?: The ten-year cycle of snowshoe hares—one of the most striking features of the boreal forest— is a product of the interaction between predation and food supplies, as large-scale experiments in the Yukon have demonstrated |journal=BioScience |date=2001 |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=25–35 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0025:WDTYCO]2.0.CO;2|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article-pdf/51/1/25/26890541/51-1-25.pdf}}</ref> A study involving statistical modelling of the interspecific relations of the snowshoe hare, the plant species it feeds on and its predators (including the Canada lynx) suggested that while the demographics of the lynx depend primarily on the hare, the hare's dynamics depend both on the plant species in its diet and predators, of which the Canada lynx is just one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stenseth |first1=N.C. |last2=Falck |first2=W. |last3=Bjørnstad |first3=O.N. |last4=Krebs |first4=C.J. |title=Population regulation in snowshoe hare and Canadian lynx: Asymmetric food web configurations between hare and lynx |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |date=1997 |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=5147–52 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.10.5147 |pmid=9144205 |pmc=24646 |bibcode=1997PNAS...94.5147C |url=https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/94/10/5147.full.pdf}}</ref> Environmental factors such as forest fires, precipitation and snowfall might also significantly affect this prey-predator cycle.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=J.F. |title=Forest fires and the snowshoe hare-Canada lynx cycle |journal=Oecologia |date=1978 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=349–374 |doi=10.1007/BF00346252}}</ref>

===Home ranges===
[[File:Canada lynx (6002291242).jpg|thumb|Lynxes are typically solitary with minimal social bonds.]]
Canada lynxes establish [[home range]]s that vary widely in size, depending upon the method of measurement. The two common methods are examining the tracks of the lynx on snow (snow-tracking) and [[Wildlife radio telemetry|radio telemetry]]; snow-tracking generally gives smaller sizes for home ranges. Studies based on snow-tracking have estimated home range sizes of {{convert|11.1|–|49.5|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those based on radio telemetry have given the area between {{convert|8|and|783|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=lox/> Like other cats, Canada lynxes [[Territorial marking|scent-mark]] their ranges by spraying urine and depositing faeces on snow or tree stumps and other prominent sites in and around their range.<ref name=Sunquist/>

Factors such as availability of prey (primarily snowshoe hare), density of lynxes and the topography of the habitat determine the shape and size of the home range.<ref name=lox/> Studies have tried to correlate the abundance of snowshoe hares in an area with the sizes of lynx home ranges in that area. A 1985 study showed that the mean size of home ranges trebled—from {{convert|13.2|to|39.2|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}—when the density of hares fell from {{convert|14.7|to|1|/ha|/acre|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Ward\">{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=R.M.P.|last2=Krebs|first2=C.J.|title=Behavioural responses of lynx to declining snowshoe hare abundance|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1985|volume=63|issue=12|pages=2817–24|doi=10.1139/z85-421}}</ref> However, a few other studies have reported different responses from lynxes at times of prey scarcity; some lynxes do not show any changes in their ranges, while others may resort to hunting in small areas, occupying small home ranges.<ref name=lox/> Canada lynxes generally do not leave their home ranges frequently, though limited prey availability can force lynxes to disperse or expand their ranges.<ref name=Poole1995>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Spatial organization of a lynx population|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1995|volume=73|issue=4|pages=632–41|doi=10.1139/z95-074}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Poole|first1=K.G.|title=Dispersal patterns of lynx in the Northwest Territories|journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management|date=1997|volume=61|issue=2|pages=497–505|doi=10.2307/3802607|jstor=3802607}}</ref>

Males tend to occupy larger ranges than do females; for instance, data from a 1980 radio telemetric analysis in [[Minnesota]] showed that home ranges of males spread over {{convert|145|–|243|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, while those of females covered {{convert|51|–|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mech|first1=L.D.|title=Age, sex, reproduction, and spatial organization of lynxes colonizing Northeastern Minnesota|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|date=1980|volume=61|issue=2|pages=261–7|jstor=1380047|doi=10.2307/1380047}}</ref> In another radio telemetric study in 1985 in [[Montana]], male home ranges averaged {{convert|122|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and those of females averaged {{convert|43.1|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Brainerd|first=S.M.|title=Reproductive ecology of bobcats and lynx in western Montana|type=M.Sc. thesis |publisher=[[University of Montana]]|date=1985|pages=1–85}}</ref> In a study in the southern [[Northwest Territories]], ranges of individuals of opposite sexes were found to overlap extensively, while the ranges of individuals of the same sex hardly coincided.

A [[Genetics|genetic]] study showed that lynxes at the periphery of a population, given their smaller numbers and greater susceptibility to variations in the range, face more difficulty in breeding with lynxes toward the centre of the population and hence show lower [[genetic diversity]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schwartz |first1=M.K. |last2=Mills |first2=L.S. |last3=Ortega |first3=Y. |last4=Ruggiero |first4=L.F. |last5=Allendorf |first5=F.W. |title=Landscape location affects genetic variation of Canada lynx (''Lynx canadensis'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |date=2003 |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=1807–16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01878.x|pmid=12803633 }}</ref>

===Diet and hunting===
[[File:Snowshoe Hare (6187109754).jpg|thumb|left|[[Snowshoe hare]], the primary prey of the Canada lynx]]
The Canada lynx preys primarily and almost exclusively on the snowshoe hare. These hares comprise 35–97% of their diet; the proportion varies by the season and the abundance of hares.<ref name=Hunter/> However, at times when the numbers of the hare drop, lynxes will include other animals in their diet—such as ducks, [[grouse]], moles, [[ptarmigan]], [[red squirrel]]s, voles and young [[ungulate]]s ([[Dall's sheep]], [[mule deer]] and [[boreal woodland caribou|caribou]])—though snowshoe hares continue to be the primary component. The Canada lynx tends to be less selective in summer and autumn, adding small mammals as a minor component of their diet besides the hare. The reason behind this is unclear—it could be due to greater abundance of alternate prey, or reduced success in hunting hares.<ref name=ruggiero/> A study in Alaska found that lynxes played a role in the decrease in populations of [[red fox]], caribou and Dall's sheep when hares were very low in number.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stephenson |first1=R.O. |last2=Grangaard |first2=D.V. |last3=Burch |first3=J. |title=Lynx, ''Felis lynx'', predation on red foxes, ''Vulpes vulpes'', caribou, ''Rangifer tarandus'', and Dall sheep, ''Ovis dalli'', in Alaska |journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist |date=1991 |volume=105 |pages=255–62 |url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/home/library/pdfs/wildlife/propubs/91_stephenson_etal_lynx_predation_redfoxes_caribou_dallsheep_ak.pdf}}</ref> Canada lynxes ingest {{convert|0.6|–|1.2|kg|lb}} of food everyday.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes have also been reported feeding occasionally on [[Succulent plant|succulent]] [[sedge]]s and grasses.<ref name=yukongov/>

Canadian lynxes hunt around twilight or at night, the time when snowshoe hares tend to be active.<ref name=Hunter/> Lynxes rely on their vision and sense of hearing to locate prey.<ref name=Nowak/> The lynx will roam or wait (in what researchers often term \"ambush beds\") on certain trails where snowshoe hares gather, pounce on a hare and kill it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck.<ref name=ruggiero/> Sometimes a chase of around ten bounds may be necessary to trap the prey. The lynx is assisted by its [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic vision]] in detecting prey and measuring distances. Staying in cover while hunting helps the lynx conserve energy in its frigid habitat by avoiding unnecessary movement.<ref name=yukongov/> Young ungulates are given a throat bite to suffocate them to death. The lynx may eat its kill immediately or cache it in snow or leaves to eat it over the next few days.<ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/><ref name=ruggiero/> Studies suggest success in hunting hares depends heavily on the distance between the lynx and the hare when the lynx starts chasing it and their relative speeds, which in turn depends on the hunting prowess of the lynx, the alertness of the hare and the vegetation cover among other factors.<ref name=Sunquist/> Lynxes will occasionally hunt together, though studies differ on how this affects the hunting success rate compared to when an individual hunts alone.<ref name=ruggiero/> In fact, they may hunt in groups when hares are scarce.<ref name = dono98/> [[Scavenger|Scavenging]] is common in Canada lynxes; they will take ungulates killed by the cold or vehicles.<ref name=Hunter/>
[[File:Lynx-canadensis.jpg|thumb|right|A lynx stalking its prey]]
Both coyotes and Canada lynxes are major predators of the snowshoe hare. A study showed that compared to lynxes, the feet of coyotes sink deeper in the snow due to their smaller size and hence a larger body mass to foot area ratio, prompting them to ambush their prey instead of chasing it like lynxes often do.<ref name=\"murray1991\">{{cite journal |last1=Murray |first1=D.L. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |title=The influence of snow on lynx and coyote movements: does morphology affect behavior? |journal=Oecologia |date=1991 |volume=88 |issue=4 |pages=463–9 |doi=10.1007/BF00317707|pmid=28312614 |bibcode=1991Oecol..88..463M }}</ref> A study of the two species in southwest [[Yukon Territory]] showed that when the numbers of the hare increased, both predators killed more hares than were necessary for their subsistence; lynxes need to kill 0.4 to 0.5 hare per day to meet their energy requirements, but were observed to kill 1.2 hares per day during this period. Coyotes, with a success rate of 36.9%, emerged as more successful hunters than lynxes that succeeded in 28.7% of their hunts; however this may have resulted from the greater number of adult coyotes in the studied population. Lynxes rarely cached their kills, unlike coyotes, and this may have led to incomplete consumption of some kills. During the cyclic decrease in snowshoe hare numbers, both predators hunted for the same time period as they did when hares were abundant, but lynxes killed more hares than they did earlier. Moreover, lynxes supplemented their diet with red squirrels.<ref name=ODonoghue/><ref name=dono98>{{cite journal |last1=O'Donoghue |first1=M. |last2=Boutin |first2=S. |last3=Krebs |first3=C.J. |last4=Murray|first4=D.L. |last5=Hofer |first5=E.J.| title=Behavioural responses of coyote and lynx to the snowshoe hare cycle |journal=Oikos |date=1998 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.2307/3546927|jstor=3546927 }}</ref>

=== Reproduction ===
[[File:Canada Lynx Mom and Kitten (15250932421).jpg|thumb|left|A juvenile with its mother]]

The mating season is roughly a month long, from March to early April. Urine marking and mating calls are part of [[Display (zoology)|display behaviour]], and increases the interaction between individuals of opposite sexes. Females can be [[Induced ovulation (animals)|induced ovulators]] when the availability of mates is low, or spontaneous ovulators when several mates are available. Females have only a single [[estrus cycle]]; estrus lasts for three to five days in captivity.<ref name=Sunquist /> Individuals have been observed making long wailing vocalizations, probably as mating calls.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Some observations on the natural history and behaviour of the Canada Lynx, ''Lynx canadensis'' |journal=Canadian Field Naturalist |date=1998 |volume=112 |issue=1 |pages=32-36 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_Slough/publication/268872103_Some_observations_on_the_natural_history_and_behaviour_of_the_Canada_Lynx_Lynx_canadensis/links/547a2cbc0cf293e2da2b5e05.pdf}}</ref> Before birth, the female prepares a maternal den, usually in very thick brush, and typically inside thickets of shrubs, trees or woody debris.<ref name=Kaufman/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Slough |first=B.

After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born.<ref name=Sunquist /> Lynx reproductive cycles and litter sizes have been observed to vary with prey availability; litter size would typically contract in years of snowshoe hare decline (along with high infant mortality rates), and increase when hares were abundant.<ref name=\"breitenmoser\">{{cite journal |last1=Breitenmoser |first1=U. |last2=Slough |first2=B.G. |last3=Breitenmoser-Würsten |first3=C. |title=Predators of cyclic prey: is the Canada lynx a victim or profiteer of the snowshoe hare cycle? |journal=Oikos |date=1993 |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=551–554 |doi=10.2307/3544952|jstor=3544952 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Slough |first1=B.G. |last2=Mowat |first2=G. |title=Lynx population dynamics in an untrapped refugium |journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management |date=1996 |volume=60 |issue=4 |pages=946–961 |doi=10.2307/3802397}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=M.|first1=Garth |last2=Slough |first2=B.G. |last3=Boutin |first3=S.|title=Lynx recruitment during a snowshoe hare population peak and decline in southwest Yukon |journal=The Journal of Wildlife Management |date=1996 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=441–452 |doi=10.2307/3802247}}</ref> Kittens weigh from {{convert|175|to|235|g|oz|abbr=on}} at birth, and initially have grayish buff fur with black markings. They are blind for the first 14 days, and [[weaning|weaned]] at 12 weeks. Most births occur from May to July. Kittens leave the den after about five weeks, and begin hunting at between seven and nine months of age. They leave the mother at around ten months, as the next breeding season begins, but do not reach the full adult size until around two years old. Female offspring typically settle in home ranges close to their mothers and remain in contact with them for life, while male offspring move far from their mother's range. Females reach sexual maturity at ten months, although they often delay breeding for another year, whereas males reach maturity at two or three years. Canada lynxes have been reported to live for up to 16 years in wild, though most do not make it beyond 10 years; in captivity the lifespan may be as long as 27 years.<ref name=Sunquist /><ref name=Hunter/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[File:Young Lynx spotted west of Drayton Valley Ab - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Canada lynxes prefer dense [[boreal forest]]s.]]
The Canada lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]]. The lynx has been successfully reintroduced in [[Colorado]], where it had become extinct in the 1970s. Canada lynxes have been recorded up to an elevation of {{convert|4310|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=Sunquist/><ref name=Hunter/>

A Canada lynx was shot near [[Newton Abbot]] in the United Kingdom in 1903 after it attacked two dogs. The animal remained unidentified at the time and was preserved by [[Bristol Museum and Art Gallery]], and was finally identified in a 2014 study. The researchers concluded that it had probably been captive for some time, perhaps as an [[exotic pet]] or part of a travelling menagerie, but may have survived for a substantial period after escaping. They considered it \"the earliest recorded example of an exotic cat on the loose in the UK\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blake |first1=M. |last2=Naish |first2=D. |last3=Larson |first3=G. |last4=King |first4=C.L. |last5=Nowell |first5=G. |last6=Sakamoto |first6=M. |last7=Barnett |first7=R. |title=Multidisciplinary investigation of a ‘British big cat’: a lynx killed in southern England c. 1903 |journal=Historical Biology |date=2013 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=441–448 |doi=10.1080/08912963.2013.785541}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22263874|title='Big cat' Canada lynx was on the loose in UK in 1903|last=Morelle|first=R.|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Postmedia News |title=That 'British big cat' called England's Loch Ness Monster?

== Threats and conservation ==
[[File:Felis lynx canadensis (Canadian lynx) fur skin back.jpg|thumb|left|Canada lynxes are trapped for their fur.]]
Canada lynxes are trapped in specific periods or seasons for fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada; hunting seasons and quotas are set based on population data. Even without regulations in place, the lynx-hare cycles and the distribution of the lynx have remained unaffected over the last century. In eastern Canada the lynx is threatened by competition with the [[eastern coyote]], whose numbers in the region have rose in the last few decades. Habitat loss is the main threat in the [[contiguous United States]], while trapping is a relatively insignificant cause of mortality. Hybridization between Canada lynxes and bobcats has been reported in the southern periphery of the range, and does not appear to be a threat to Canada lynxes.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Homyack, J.A. |year=2008|title=Canada Lynx-Bobcat (''Lynx canadensis × L.rufus'') hybrids at the southern periphery of lynx range in Maine, Minnesota and New Brunswick|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/pubs_other/rmrs_2008_homyack_j001.pdf|journal= American Midland Naturalist |volume=159|pages=504–508|doi=10.1674/0003-0031(2008)159[504:CLLCLR]2.0.CO;2|issue=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Schwartz, M.K. | year = 2004 | title = Hybridization between Canada Lynx and bobcats: genetic results and management implications| journal = Conservation Genetics | volume = 5 | pages = 349–355 | doi = 10.1023/B:COGE.0000031141.47148.8b | issue = 3|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225195035_Hybridization_Between_Canada_Lynx_and_Bobcats_Genetic_Results_and_Management_Implications }}</ref>

The Canada lynx is abundant over its broad range, and is not significantly threatened by its legal use in the international fur trade since more than two centuries. Therefore, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) classifies the Canada lynx as [[Least Concern]]. However, populations are relatively lower in the southern half of the range and are protected from killing for fur trade. The lynx is listed as Endangered in [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name=iucn/> On March 24, 2000, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS) issued its Final Rule, which designated the Canada lynx a Threatened Species in 14 contiguous United States.<ref name=\"FedReg\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2000-03-24/pdf/00-7145.pdf|title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Determination of Threatened Status for the Contiguous U.S. Distinct Population Segment of the Canada Lynx and Related Rule |page=16051–16086|journal=Federal Register|volume= 65|issue= 58 |date= 24 March 2000|publisher=Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service}}</ref> In 2005, the USFWS demarcated six major areas for revival where lynx populations had been reported in the past two decades: northern Maine and [[New Hampshire]], northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Montana and northeastern [[Idaho]], the [[Kettle River Range]] and the \"Wedge area\" between the [[Kettle River (Columbia River tributary)|Kettle]] and [[Columbia River|Columbia]] rivers of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the northern Cascade Range of Washington, and the [[Greater Yellowstone]] area of [[Wyoming]], Montana and Idaho.<ref name=iucn/> By 2010, after an 11-year effort, the lynx had been successfully reintroduced into Colorado.

The final outcome of this game had somewhat of a [[domino effect]].  It resulted in the Dolphins' elimination from the post-season (including [[Super Bowl XLIV]], which they hosted February 8, 2010), and also, by virtue of the final standings' tiebreaker (as the result of the [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] defeating the [[2009 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]), the Steelers themselves being dethroned of their world title defense.

The Dolphins ended their season in 3rd place in the AFC East as they finished the season 7–9.

After a great season for the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 2008, the Dolphins went to the Georgia Dome to take on 2008 playoff contenders, the [[Atlanta Falcons]].
After a scoreless first quarter, the Falcons got on the board with a 1-yard touchdown pass from [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] to fullback [[Ovie Mughelli]] in the second quarter.

The Falcons won the game 19–7 as the Dolphins started their season 0–1.

The final outcome of this game had somewhat of a [[domino effect]].  It resulted in the Dolphins' elimination from the post-season (including [[Super Bowl XLIV]], which they hosted February 8, 2010), and also, by virtue of the final standings' tiebreaker (as the result of the [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] defeating the [[2009 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]), the Steelers themselves being dethroned of their world title defense.

The Dolphins ended their season in 3rd place in the AFC East as they finished the season 7–9.

'''John Warren Davis''' (11 February 1888 – 12 July 1980) was an [[African American]] educator, college administrator, and civil rights leader. Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).

Davis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.

Davis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.

Davis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>

Washington]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] during this period, Davis \"began to formulate his lifetime philosophies and commitment to the educational development of the black community.\"<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Davis received counsel from both Washington and Du Bois, and he remained a lifelong friend of Du Bois.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/>

Throughout his early years in the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[Southern United States|American South]], Davis overcame [[racial discrimination]], which included being forced out of a [[Mississippi]] town at gunpoint for entering a store that refused service to African Americans, and being prevented from attending an educational conference at [[Georgia State University|Georgia State College]] by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/>

Davis accepted a position in [[Washington, D.C.]] as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in 1917, and he served in this position until 1919.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 61\"/><ref name=\"Goggin 1993 54\">{{Harvnb|Goggin|1993|p=54.}}</ref><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 5\">{{Harvnb|Moorland–Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=5.}}</ref>

=== Expansion and Improvement of the Campus and Curriculum ===
Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU History 1\"/><ref name=\"Trent 1960 ChXI\">{{Harvnb|Trent|1960|loc=Chapter XI.}}</ref> At the time of Davis' arrival, the institute suffered from depressed academic and physical conditions.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 61\"/> He transformed the school's campus during his first ten years of leadership through the construction of new buildings.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU History 1\"/> He also expanded and improved the school's academic programs and curriculum.<ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU History 1\"/> Davis recruited some of the nation's preeminent African American educators to join the school's faculty.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/> In 1922, Carter G. Woodson described the institute under Davis' leadership as \"a reorganized college furnishing facilities for education not offered elsewhere for the youth of West Virginia.\"<ref name=\"Woodson 1922 58\"/>

The 1922 ''Biennial Report of the State Supervisor of Negro Schools of West Virginia'' noted \"steady and commendable\" progress had been made at West Virginia Collegiate Institute under Davis' management.<ref name=\"WVDOE 1922 13\">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Department of Education|1922|p=13.}}</ref> The report stated that a new dormitory for female students had been erected and many new volumes had been added to the school's library, and it also stated, \"this institution is possibly the best equipped State-supported college for Negroes in America.\"<ref name=\"WVDOE 1922 13\"/> Despite the school's progress under Davis, the report noted the institute's work was hampered by inadequate classroom facilities, and acknowledged the need for \"an administration building, a gymnasium, library, and cottages for teachers.\"<ref name=\"WVDOE 1922 13\"/>

Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"Robinson 180\"/><ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/> In Davis' annual report for the school in 1927, he stated that the institute was the first ever U.S. college with an African American president and full African American faculty to become fully accredited.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 61\"/> Davis later become the first African American member of NCA's Committee on Institutions of Higher Education.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/> West Virginia Collegiate Institute changed its name to West Virginia State College in 1929,<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/> and it began conferring college degrees.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/> Soon after this transition, West Virginia State became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/>

During his tenure as West Virginia State's president, the college's enrollment increased from around 20 students in 1919 to a peak enrollment of between 1,850 and 1,900 students at the time of his departure in 1953.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Robinson 180\"/> Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution.<ref name=\"Robinson 180\"/><ref name=\"Bardolph 133\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=133.}}</ref> West Virginia State was the first historically black college to enroll large numbers of white students.<ref name=\"Garibaldi xi\"/> White students began entering West Virginia State in increasing numbers during the final years of Davis' presidency,<ref name=\"Robinson 180\"/><ref name=\"Bardolph 133\"/> and by 1965, white students accounted for 71 percent of the college's enrollment.<ref name=\"Robinson 180\"/>

=== Early African American Educational History of West Virginia ===
Davis initiated a study of early African American educational history in West Virginia, and appointed a committee to undertake the study's research and data collection.<ref name=\"Woodson 1922 23\">{{Harvnb|Woodson|1922|p=23.}}</ref> Carter G. Woodson served as the committee's chairperson and developed a questionnaire that was disseminated among West Virginia's African American communities and institutions to gather facts.<ref name=\"Goggin 1993 54\"/><ref name=\"Haskins 2000 33\"/><ref name=\"Woodson 1922 23\"/> At the conclusion of this study, Davis held a presentation of the study's findings as part of the West Virginia Collegiate Institute Founder's Day celebration on 3 May 1921.<ref name=\"Woodson 1922 24\">{{Harvnb|Woodson|1922|p=24.}}</ref> Many of West Virginia's living pioneers of early African American education in the state were invited to address this meeting to share their experiences.<ref name=\"Woodson 1922 24\"/> In 1922, Woodson published the study's findings in the article, \"Early Negro Education in West Virginia,\" in his ''Journal of Negro History''.<ref name=\"Haskins 2000 33\"/><ref name=\"Woodson 1922 23\"/><ref name=\"Goggin 1993 55\">{{Harvnb|Goggin|1993|p=55.}}</ref> In 1922, Woodson began receiving a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] for the operation of his ''Journal of Negro History'' and shortly thereafter, he resigned his position as dean of the West Virginia Collegiate Institute in June of that year.<ref name=\"Haskins 2000 33\"/><ref name=\"Goggin 1993 65\">{{Harvnb|Goggin|1993|p=65.}}</ref> Davis accepted Woodson's resignation, and while he was disappointed in Woodson's decision, he understood Woodson's devotion to promoting African American history.<ref name=\"Goggin 1993 65\"/>

=== Extension Service and State 4-H Camp for African Americans ===
[[File:Camp Washington-Carver - Great Chestnut Lodge.jpg|thumb|right|Great Chestnut Lodge, [[Camp Washington-Carver Complex]]]]
Under Davis' leadership in the 1930s, West Virginia State College and its Extension Service were part of a movement to provide educational outdoor and recreational activities for West Virginia's African American youth.<ref name=\"Collins Turley 5\">{{Harvnb|Collins|Turley|1980|p=5 of the PDF file.}}</ref> This movement received West Virginia Board of Control funding from the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) when the [[West Virginia Legislature]] established [[Camp Washington-Carver Complex|Camp Washington-Carver]] in 1937 near [[Clifftop, Fayette County, West Virginia|Clifftop]] in [[Fayette County, West Virginia|Fayette County]].<ref name=\"O'Brien 105\">{{Harvnb|O'Brien|2016|p=105.}}</ref><ref name=\"Collins Turley 2&5\">{{Harvnb|Collins|Turley|1980|p=2 and 5 of the PDF file.}}</ref> The {{convert|583|acres|ha|adj=on|0}} African American [[4-H]] camp was constructed by the WPA between 1939 and 1942 and under Davis' leadership, the camp was transferred from the West Virginia Board of Control to West Virginia State's Extension Service in 1942.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"Collins Turley 2\">{{Harvnb|Collins|Turley|1980|p=2 of the PDF file.}}</ref> Camp Washington-Carver was formally dedicated on 26 July 1942 in a ceremony attended by Davis.<ref name=\"Collins Turley 6\">{{Harvnb|Collins|Turley|1980|p=6 of the PDF file.}}</ref> At the 4-H camp, West Virginia State's Extension Service offered instruction to African American children and adolescents in the subjects of [[agricultural education]], [[soil conservation]], [[home economics]], and 4-H values.<ref name=\"Collins Turley 2\"/>

=== Civilian Pilot Training Program ===
Following the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the United States government recognized a shortage of trained pilots.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/timetrl/ttsept.html |title= September 11, 1939: Civilian Pilot Training Program at West Virginia State College | author = West Virginia Archives and History |year = 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History | access-date= 1 March 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200301161147/http://www.wvculture.org/history/timetrl/ttsept.html |archive-date= 1 March 2020}}</ref> To mitigate this shortage, the U.S. government's [[Civil Aeronautics Board|Civilian Aeronautics Authority]] (CAA) established the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) with the intention of creating pilot training programs at U.S. colleges and universities.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> According to West Virginia State's Dr. Charles Ledbetter, only 20 African Americans in the U.S. were licensed as pilots at the time of the CPTP's establishment.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> On 11 September 1939, Davis received approval from the CAA to establish a CPTP at West Virginia State, which became the first African American college in the U.S. to do so.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> One of the college's CPTP instructors, Dr. Charles Byrd, noted that West Virginia State's CPTP \"played a part in the struggle to get African Americans accepted\" into the [[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC).<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/>

When the USAAC admitted the first African Americans and organized the [[99th Flying Training Squadron]], two of the first five commissioned African American pilots were graduates from West Virginia State's CPTP: George Spencer Roberts, the first African American appointed to the USAAC, and Mac Ross.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> Another of the college's CPTP graduates was [[Rose Agnes Rolls Cousins|Rose Agnes Rolls]] of [[Fairmont, West Virginia|Fairmont]], the first African American woman to receive flight training through the CAA and the first female solo pilot in the CPTP nation-wide.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> Rolls and Joseph Greider, a West Virginia State music professor, later joined the West Virginia Civil Air Patrol, becoming the first African Americans in the state's air patrol.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> In the summer of 1940, West Virginia State became the first African American college to enroll white trainees into its CPTP, which served as a precedent for the [[Racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces|racial integration]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/> West Virginia State's CPTP was discontinued in 1942.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/>

=== Army Specialized Training Program ===
[[File:Astp-patch.gif|thumb|Insignia of the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP)]]
Also under Davis' leadership, West Virginia State received an [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\">{{Harvnb|Keefer|1994|pp=119–132.}}</ref> He was persistent in conveying the college's desire to have ASTP trainees on its campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> Davis had read about the ASTP in newspapers and in ''School and Safety'', the [[American Council on Education]]'s weekly newsletter, and he sent a letter on 16 June 1943 to the ASTP Director, [[United States Army]] Colonel [[Herman Beukema]].<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> Beukema responded by stating that the ASTP was, \"utilizing the facilities of Howard University, [[Prairie View A&M University|Prairie View State College]], and [[North Carolina A&T State University|Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina]]. Inasmuch as the above institutions meet the present demand, based upon the number of Negro trainees available, we have no immediate need of any other institutions. It is planned that West Virginia State College will be given an Army Specialized Training Unit at the earliest possible date.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/>

Davis was only made aware that West Virginia State was receiving an ASTP unit two weeks before ASTP personnel arrived on its campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> On 16 July 1943, Colonel W. G. Johnston of the [[Army Service Forces]]' Fifth Service Command called Davis to inform him, and two days later, Johnston confirmed the tentative number of ASTP trainees, arrival date, and basic engineering courses to be offered, and that a contract \"negotiating party\" would soon visit the campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> Within a week's time, West Virginia State reached agreements with the Fifth Service Command, and Davis commenced modifications to the college's Gore Hall, where most of the ASTP personnel were housed.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> On 22 July 1943, Davis wrote to Johnston, asking for him to increase the number of ASTP trainees from the expected 150 to 300, a figure which included 17-year-old ASTP reservists from West Virginia that were to be sent to other colleges for ASTP training.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> In this letter, Davis assured Johnston, \"the entire force of this college... is now busy preparing for the arrival of AST trainees.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/>

=== Nonpartisan leadership style ===
Throughout his tenure as president of West Virginia State, Davis was able to govern the college with a surprising degree of independence and political nonpartisanship, despite the college's proximity to the [[West Virginia State Capitol|state capitol]] in nearby [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]].<ref name=\"Bardolph 227-8\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|pp=227-8.}}</ref><ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=62.}}</ref> In a 1944 meeting of the West Virginia State faculty, Davis explained his disinterest in partisan politics: \"I have never felt it my duty to go and dabble in partisan politics. I hold the position that I have a unique place in the life of the state. You and I are to cooperate in guiding this school, that whatever party is in power, the success of the institution can be a credit to that party.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> However, Davis advocated the college's advancement in all matters in his correspondences with West Virginia state legislators and officials.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> He also leveraged his faculty as a resource for providing expertise and assistance to state politicians, regardless of their party.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> When a [[West Virginia Senate|West Virginia state senator]] expressed an interest in having German papers translated, Davis recommended a West Virginia State faculty member to perform this task, and he assured the senator that the professor would remain \"quiet\" about their assistance.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Davis believed that assistance provided by West Virginia State would be returned in the form of appropriations.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Author Gerald L. Smith cited Davis' nonpartisan leadership style as being an influence on Rufus B. Atwood, president of [[Kentucky State University|Kentucky State College]].<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Davis was also able to secure appropriations for the West Virginia State's buildings and equipment because the state's [[West Virginia Democratic Party|Democratic]] and [[West Virginia Republican Party|Republican]] parties both vied for African American votes.<ref name=\"Trent 1960 ChXI\"/>

== Associated Publishers, Inc. ==
In June 1921, Davis and African American leaders including Carter G. Woodson, [[Don S.S.

In ''Black Colleges and Universities: Challenges for the Future'' (1984), editor Antoine Garibaldi remarked of Davis' involvement with the book's preparation: \"Even at 92, [Davis] was still progressive in his thinking and believed as strongly as any member of the group that black colleges would have to alter their missions to adapt to a changing clientele of students, changing demographics and political trends, and economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial health of most institutions of higher learning. Dr. Davis leaves a legacy for all educators to emulate. He will be missed by all those who had the good fortune to know him, but his contributions to education, to civil rights, and to the United States will live on.\"<ref name=\"Garibaldi xi\"/>

'''John Warren Davis''' (11 February 1888 – 12 July 1980) was an [[African American]] educator, college administrator, and civil rights leader. Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).

Davis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.

Davis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.

=== Expansion and Improvement of the Campus and Curriculum ===
Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU History 1\"/><ref name=\"Trent 1960 ChXI\">{{Harvnb|Trent|1960|loc=Chapter XI.}}</ref> At the time of Davis' arrival, the institute suffered from depressed academic and physical conditions.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 61\"/> He transformed the school's campus during his first ten years of leadership through the construction of new buildings.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU History 1\"/> He also expanded and improved the school's academic programs and curriculum.<ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU History 1\"/> Davis recruited some of the nation's preeminent African American educators to join the school's faculty.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/> In 1922, Carter G.

The 1922 ''Biennial Report of the State Supervisor of Negro Schools of West Virginia'' noted \"steady and commendable\" progress had been made at West Virginia Collegiate Institute under Davis' management.<ref name=\"WVDOE 1922 13\">{{Harvnb|West Virginia Department of Education|1922|p=13.}}</ref> The report stated that a new dormitory for female students had been erected and many new volumes had been added to the school's library, and it also stated, \"this institution is possibly the best equipped State-supported college for Negroes in America.\"<ref name=\"WVDOE 1922 13\"/> Despite the school's progress under Davis, the report noted the institute's work was hampered by inadequate classroom facilities, and acknowledged the need for \"an administration building, a gymnasium, library, and cottages for teachers.\"<ref name=\"WVDOE 1922 13\"/>

Woodson served as the committee's chairperson and developed a questionnaire that was disseminated among West Virginia's African American communities and institutions to gather facts.<ref name=\"Goggin 1993 54\"/><ref name=\"Haskins 2000 33\"/><ref name=\"Woodson 1922 23\"/> At the conclusion of this study, Davis held a presentation of the study's findings as part of the West Virginia Collegiate Institute Founder's Day celebration on 3 May 1921.<ref name=\"Woodson 1922 24\">{{Harvnb|Woodson|1922|p=24.}}</ref> Many of West Virginia's living pioneers of early African American education in the state were invited to address this meeting to share their experiences.<ref name=\"Woodson 1922 24\"/> In 1922, Woodson published the study's findings in the article, \"Early Negro Education in West Virginia,\" in his ''Journal of Negro History''.<ref name=\"Haskins 2000 33\"/><ref name=\"Woodson 1922 23\"/><ref name=\"Goggin 1993 55\">{{Harvnb|Goggin|1993|p=55.}}</ref> In 1922, Woodson began receiving a grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation of New York]] for the operation of his ''Journal of Negro History'' and shortly thereafter, he resigned his position as dean of the West Virginia Collegiate Institute in June of that year.<ref name=\"Haskins 2000 33\"/><ref name=\"Goggin 1993 65\">{{Harvnb|Goggin|1993|p=65.}}</ref> Davis accepted Woodson's resignation, and while he was disappointed in Woodson's decision, he understood Woodson's devotion to promoting African American history.<ref name=\"Goggin 1993 65\"/>

=== Extension Service and State 4-H Camp for African Americans ===
[[File:Camp Washington-Carver - Great Chestnut Lodge.jpg|thumb|right|Great Chestnut Lodge, [[Camp Washington-Carver Complex]]]]
Under Davis' leadership in the 1930s, West Virginia State College and its Extension Service were part of a movement to provide educational outdoor and recreational activities for West Virginia's African American youth.<ref name=\"Collins Turley 5\">{{Harvnb|Collins|Turley|1980|p=5 of the PDF file.}}</ref> This movement received West Virginia Board of Control funding from the [[Works Progress Administration]] (WPA) when the [[West Virginia Legislature]] established [[Camp Washington-Carver Complex|Camp Washington-Carver]] in 1937 near [[Clifftop, Fayette County, West Virginia|Clifftop]] in [[Fayette County, West Virginia|Fayette County]].<ref name=\"O'Brien 105\">{{Harvnb|O'Brien|2016|p=105.}}</ref><ref name=\"Collins Turley 2&5\">{{Harvnb|Collins|Turley|1980|p=2 and 5 of the PDF file.}}</ref> The {{convert|583|acres|ha|adj=on|0}} African American [[4-H]] camp was constructed by the WPA between 1939 and 1942 and under Davis' leadership, the camp was transferred from the West Virginia Board of Control to West Virginia State's Extension Service in 1942.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"Collins Turley 2\">{{Harvnb|Collins|Turley|1980|p=2 of the PDF file.}}</ref> Camp Washington-Carver was formally dedicated on 26 July 1942 in a ceremony attended by Davis.<ref name=\"Collins Turley 6\">{{Harvnb|Collins|Turley|1980|p=6 of the PDF file.}}</ref> At the 4-H camp, West Virginia State's Extension Service offered instruction to African American children and adolescents in the subjects of [[agricultural education]], [[soil conservation]], [[home economics]], and 4-H values.<ref name=\"Collins Turley 2\"/>

=== Civilian Pilot Training Program ===
Following the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the United States government recognized a shortage of trained pilots.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/timetrl/ttsept.html |title= September 11, 1939: Civilian Pilot Training Program at West Virginia State College | author = West Virginia Archives and History |year = 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History | access-date= 1 March 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200301161147/http://www.wvculture.org/history/timetrl/ttsept.html |archive-date= 1 March 2020}}</ref> To mitigate this shortage, the U.S. government's [[Civil Aeronautics Board|Civilian Aeronautics Authority]] (CAA) established the [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) with the intention of creating pilot training programs at U.S. colleges and universities.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> According to West Virginia State's Dr. Charles Ledbetter, only 20 African Americans in the U.S. were licensed as pilots at the time of the CPTP's establishment.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> On 11 September 1939, Davis received approval from the CAA to establish a CPTP at West Virginia State, which became the first African American college in the U.S. to do so.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> One of the college's CPTP instructors, Dr. Charles Byrd, noted that West Virginia State's CPTP \"played a part in the struggle to get African Americans accepted\" into the [[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC).<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/>

When the USAAC admitted the first African Americans and organized the [[99th Flying Training Squadron]], two of the first five commissioned African American pilots were graduates from West Virginia State's CPTP: George Spencer Roberts, the first African American appointed to the USAAC, and Mac Ross.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> Another of the college's CPTP graduates was [[Rose Agnes Rolls Cousins|Rose Agnes Rolls]] of [[Fairmont, West Virginia|Fairmont]], the first African American woman to receive flight training through the CAA and the first female solo pilot in the CPTP nation-wide.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> Rolls and Joseph Greider, a West Virginia State music professor, later joined the West Virginia Civil Air Patrol, becoming the first African Americans in the state's air patrol.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> In the summer of 1940, West Virginia State became the first African American college to enroll white trainees into its CPTP, which served as a precedent for the [[Racial segregation in the United States Armed Forces|racial integration]] of the [[United States Armed Forces]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/> West Virginia State's CPTP was discontinued in 1942.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/>

=== Army Specialized Training Program ===
[[File:Astp-patch.gif|thumb|Insignia of the Army Specialized Training Program (ASTP)]]
Also under Davis' leadership, West Virginia State received an [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\">{{Harvnb|Keefer|1994|pp=119–132.}}</ref> He was persistent in conveying the college's desire to have ASTP trainees on its campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> Davis had read about the ASTP in newspapers and in ''School and Safety'', the [[American Council on Education]]'s weekly newsletter, and he sent a letter on 16 June 1943 to the ASTP Director, [[United States Army]] Colonel [[Herman Beukema]].<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> Beukema responded by stating that the ASTP was, \"utilizing the facilities of Howard University, [[Prairie View A&M University|Prairie View State College]], and [[North Carolina A&T State University|Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina]]. Inasmuch as the above institutions meet the present demand, based upon the number of Negro trainees available, we have no immediate need of any other institutions. It is planned that West Virginia State College will be given an Army Specialized Training Unit at the earliest possible date.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/>

Davis was only made aware that West Virginia State was receiving an ASTP unit two weeks before ASTP personnel arrived on its campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> On 16 July 1943, Colonel W. G. Johnston of the [[Army Service Forces]]' Fifth Service Command called Davis to inform him, and two days later, Johnston confirmed the tentative number of ASTP trainees, arrival date, and basic engineering courses to be offered, and that a contract \"negotiating party\" would soon visit the campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> Within a week's time, West Virginia State reached agreements with the Fifth Service Command, and Davis commenced modifications to the college's Gore Hall, where most of the ASTP personnel were housed.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> On 22 July 1943, Davis wrote to Johnston, asking for him to increase the number of ASTP trainees from the expected 150 to 300, a figure which included 17-year-old ASTP reservists from West Virginia that were to be sent to other colleges for ASTP training.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/> In this letter, Davis assured Johnston, \"the entire force of this college... is now busy preparing for the arrival of AST trainees.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119–132\"/>

=== Nonpartisan leadership style ===
Throughout his tenure as president of West Virginia State, Davis was able to govern the college with a surprising degree of independence and political nonpartisanship, despite the college's proximity to the [[West Virginia State Capitol|state capitol]] in nearby [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]].<ref name=\"Bardolph 227-8\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|pp=227-8.}}</ref><ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=62.}}</ref> In a 1944 meeting of the West Virginia State faculty, Davis explained his disinterest in partisan politics: \"I have never felt it my duty to go and dabble in partisan politics. I hold the position that I have a unique place in the life of the state. You and I are to cooperate in guiding this school, that whatever party is in power, the success of the institution can be a credit to that party.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> However, Davis advocated the college's advancement in all matters in his correspondences with West Virginia state legislators and officials.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> He also leveraged his faculty as a resource for providing expertise and assistance to state politicians, regardless of their party.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> When a [[West Virginia Senate|West Virginia state senator]] expressed an interest in having German papers translated, Davis recommended a West Virginia State faculty member to perform this task, and he assured the senator that the professor would remain \"quiet\" about their assistance.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Davis believed that assistance provided by West Virginia State would be returned in the form of appropriations.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Author Gerald L. Smith cited Davis' nonpartisan leadership style as being an influence on Rufus B. Atwood, president of [[Kentucky State University|Kentucky State College]].<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Davis was also able to secure appropriations for the West Virginia State's buildings and equipment because the state's [[West Virginia Democratic Party|Democratic]] and [[West Virginia Republican Party|Republican]] parties both vied for African American votes.<ref name=\"Trent 1960 ChXI\"/>

== Associated Publishers, Inc. ==
In June 1921, Davis and African American leaders including Carter G. Woodson, [[Don S.S. Goodloe]], Mordecai Wyatt Johnson, and Byrd Prillerman, established Associated Publishers, Inc., in Washington, D.C., with a capital stock of $25,000.<ref name=\"Haskins 2000 33\"/><ref name=\"Goggin 1993 55\"/><ref name=\"Woodson 1921 380\">{{Harvnb|Woodson|1921|p=380.}}</ref> Davis and his fellow incorporators founded Associated Publishers after recognizing the need of \"supplanting exploiting publishers\" and to focus primarily on works by African American authors and about issues concerning the African American community.<ref name=\"Goggin 1993 55\"/><ref name=\"Woodson 1921 380\"/> Davis served as the publishing firm's treasurer and Woodson served as its president.<ref name=\"Goggin 1993 55\"/><ref name=\"Woodson 1921 380\"/>

Davis was a member of the [[Sigma Pi Phi]] and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honor society fraternities, and he was a [[Scottish Rite|33rd Degree]] Mason and a [[Prince Hall Freemasonry|Prince Hall Mason]].<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi xi\"/>

=== Awards ===
Davis was awarded the [[William E. Harmon Foundation Award for Distinguished Achievement Among Negroes]] for education in 1926.<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 5\"/> Just prior to his death in 1980, he was honored by the [[National Education Association]] (of which he was a member) with its Harper Council Trenholm Award.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/>

== Legacy ==
Davis' lifelong personal and professional pursuits were focused on the economic and educational development of the African American community, the improvement of relations between African Americans and other groups, and the improvement of relations between the United States and developing black nations.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Robinson 181\"/> With a tenure spanning 34 years, Davis is the longest-serving president of West Virginia State College,<ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/> which later became West Virginia State University in 2004.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/> The university's Davis Fine Arts Building is named in his honor.<ref name=\"WVSU President 1\"/>

In ''Black Colleges and Universities: Challenges for the Future'' (1984), editor Antoine Garibaldi remarked of Davis' involvement with the book's preparation: \"Even at 92, [Davis] was still progressive in his thinking and believed as strongly as any member of the group that black colleges would have to alter their missions to adapt to a changing clientele of students, changing demographics and political trends, and economic conditions that have adversely affected the financial health of most institutions of higher learning. Dr. Davis leaves a legacy for all educators to emulate. He will be missed by all those who had the good fortune to know him, but his contributions to education, to civil rights, and to the United States will live on.\"<ref name=\"Garibaldi xi\"/>

A few days later worries grew as to how wages could continue being paid and if the directive was legal or not.<ref name=\":17\" /> There were also concerns raised by migrant workers regarding implementation of the orders as many daily-wagers have no records of being sacked or salaries being paid or deducted; the concerns also expand to uncertainty in the government's ability to enforce minimum wages under a lockdown when it couldn't even do so during normal times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-question-implementation-of-govt-advisory-on-protecting-wages-jobs/story-bSJcx1l7ODCA1qgUBnG6qJ.html|title=Migrants question implementation advisory on protecting wages, jobs|last=Dey|first=Abhishek|date=2020-04-01|website=Hindustan Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>

=== Migrant workers and labour force ===
Due to the lockdown, there suddenly was no work for many daily workers (the urban poor and migrant labourers). At the same time the lockdown restrictions put a stop on the movement of buses and trains. Large numbers of migrant workers ended up walking back to there villages, some journeys hundreds of kilometers long. Commentators commented on how the whole purpose of social distancing was defeated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/india-s-government-should-have-expected-coronavirus-migration|title=Coronavirus Exposes India’s Official Callousness|last=Sharma|first=Mihir|date=1 April 2020|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref><ref name=\":19\" />

=== Lockdown extension ===
On 8 April 2020, the managing director of [[Bajaj Auto]], [[Rajiv Bajaj]], wrote in an opinion piece in the [[The Economic Times|Economic Times]] that the \"lockdown makes India weak rather than stronger in combating the epidemic,\" and that the current \"arbitrary\" lockdown was totally unsustainable and a \"recalibration\" is needed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/coronavirus-lockdown-makes-india-weak-rather-than-stronger-rajiv-bajaj-writes-in-et|title=Coronavirus Lockdown Makes India Weak Rather Than Stronger, Rajiv Bajaj Writes In ET|website=BloombergQuint|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/view-must-sell-ourselves-out-of-this-crisis/articleshow/75038503.cms|title=India may have to sell itself out of this crisis, says Rajiv Bajaj|date=2020-04-08|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> Rajiv Bajaj writes that \"India may have to sell itself out of the coronavirus crisis\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/industry/india-may-have-to-sell-itself-out-of-this-crisis-says-rajiv-bajaj/75058899|title=India may have to sell itself out of this crisis, says Rajiv Bajaj - ET Auto|last=|first=|date=9 April 2020|website=ETAuto|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>
