The first vessel was to replace ''Vikrant'', which was set to decommission in early 1997. Construction of the ADS was to start at the Cochin Shipyard (CSL) in 1993 after the Indian Naval Design Organisation had translated this design study into a production model. Following the [[1991 India economic crisis|1991 economic crisis]], the plans for construction of the vessels were put on hold indefinitely.\n\nIn 1999, then-[[Defence Minister of India|Defence Minister]] [[George Fernandes]] revived the project and sanctioned the construction of the Project 71 ADS.<ref name=br-iac>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Ships/Future/185-Indian-Aircraft-Carrier.html |title=Indian Aircraft Carrier (Project-71) |publisher=Bharat Rakshak |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217185025/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/Ships/Future/185-Indian-Aircraft-Carrier.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 }}</ref> By that time, given the ageing Sea Harrier fleet, the letter of intent called for a carrier that would carry more modern jet fighters.
