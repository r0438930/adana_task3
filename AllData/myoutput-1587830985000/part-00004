They can be dug out, shredded with a [[stump grinder]] or burnt.\n\nA common method for stump removal is to use one of the many chemical stump removal products, so long as immediate results are not needed. These stump removers are mostly made of [[potassium nitrate]] (KNO<sub>3</sub>) and act by rapidly increasing the decay of the stump. After an average of 4\u20136 weeks, the stump will be rotten through and easily fragmented in manageable pieces. If time is a limiting factor, setting fire to the stump is effective because once the potassium nitrate has been absorbed it acts as an effective oxidizer.\n\nHistorically, an explosive called ''stumping powder'' was used to blast stumps.\n\n== Stump harvesting ==\nIn plantation forests in parts of Europe, stumps are sometimes pulled out of the ground using a specially adapted tracked [[excavator]], to supply wood fuel for [[biomass]] power stations. [[Stump harvesting]] may provide an increasing component of the woody material required by the biomass power sector.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trees}}\n*[[Living stump]]\n*[[Stump harvesting]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Buckley, G.P. 1992.
