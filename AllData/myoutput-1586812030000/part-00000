Its mirror is the [[hypnagogic]] state at sleep onset; though often conflated, the two states are not identical. The hypnagogic state is [[Rationality|rational]] [[Waking up|waking]] [[cognition]] trying to make sense of non-linear images and associations; the hypnopompic state is [[emotion]]al and credulous [[dream]]ing cognition trying to make sense of real world stolidity. They have a different [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] character. While these hypnopompic hallucinations can be neutral, they are often more akin to nightmares. Further, they are frequently accompanied by e.g. [[sleep paralysis]], which is a state wherein the mind perceives itself to be awake, yet is unable to move the body, a truly terrifying disconnect between the soul and body. As such, hypnopompic hallucinations are deeply troubling experiences that for centuries now, have fascinated thinkers\u2014most recently psychologists and increasingly now neurologists as well. Though the phenomena was once poorly understood it is now being illuminated by our growing understanding of sleep overall and in particular, our cutting edge brain-scanning technologies.\n\nTo better understand hypnopompic hallucinations, we must first define [[hallucination]]s.

Conversely, there is almost no electrical activity during NREM sleep. It will thus be no surprise that NREM is what is referred to in layman\u2019s terms as \u201c[[Slow-wave sleep|deep sleep]]\u201d, which is characterised by the complete quieting of the mind, to include dreamlessness and by muscle \u201c[[Atony|atonia]]\u201d, which is to basically say paralysis, a complete motor disconnect. A last critical point in this regard is that REM sleep cycles are bookended by NREM stages, which is to say that when we fall asleep and wake up, we first fall into and last arise from, NREM sleep.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Waters|first=Flavie|last2=Blom|first2=Jan Dirk|last3=Dang-Vu|first3=Thien Thanh|last4=Cheyne|first4=Allan J.|last5=Alderson-Day|first5=Ben|last6=Woodruff|first6=Peter|last7=Collerton|first7=Daniel|date=September 2016|title=What Is the Link Between Hallucinations, Dreams, and Hypnagogic\u2013Hypnopompic Experiences?|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4988750/|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|volume=42|issue=5|pages=1098\u20131109|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbw076|issn=0586-7614|pmc=4988750|pmid=27358492}}</ref>\n\nIt is precisely at this last point, though, that a minor '''glitch''', as it were, in brain chemistry, can cause hypnopompic hallucinations: occasionally during deep NREM, \u201ctransient patterns of neural activation in brainstem structures resemble[ing] micro-wake \u201cfragments\u201d can occur\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> As the origin of the fragments and their name implies, they have a twofold effect: first, just as in REM sleep, these brain stem fragments essentially activate the dream mechanism.
