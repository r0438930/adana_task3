Some have explicitly rejected the notions of punishment by fire in a particular place that are prominent in the popular picture of purgatory. The representatives of the [[Orthodox Church]] at the [[Council of Florence]] argued against these notions, while declaring that they do hold that there is a cleansing after death of the souls of the saved and that these are assisted by the prayers of the living: \"If souls depart from this life in faith and charity but marked with some defilements, whether unrepented minor ones or major ones repented of but without having yet borne the fruits of repentance, we believe that within reason they are purified of those faults, but not by some purifying fire and particular punishments in some place.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/patrologiaorient15pariuoft/page/40 \"First Speech by Mark, Archbishop of Ephesus, on Purifying Fire\" in ''Patrologia Orientalis'', vol. 15, pp. 40\u201341]</ref> The definition of purgatory adopted by that council excluded the two notions with which the Orthodox disagreed and mentioned only the two points that, they said, were part of their faith also.

[...] 'The soul', Catherine says, 'presents itself to God still bound to the desires and suffering that derive from sin and this makes it impossible for it to enjoy the [[beatific vision]] of God'. Catherine asserts that God is so pure and holy that a soul stained by sin cannot be in the presence of the divine majesty. We too feel how distant we are, how full we are of so many things that we cannot see God. The soul is aware of the immense love and perfect justice of God and consequently suffers for having failed to respond in a correct and perfect way to this love; and love for God itself becomes a flame, love itself cleanses it from the residue of sin.\"<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20110112.html Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience of 12 January 2011]</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 encyclical ''Spe salvi'', Pope Benedict XVI, referring to the words of [[Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:12\u201315|ESV}} about a fire that both burns and saves, spoke of the opinion that \"the fire which both burns and saves is Christ himself, the Judge and Saviour. The encounter with him is the decisive act of judgement. Before his gaze all falsehood melts away. This encounter with him, as it burns us, transforms and frees us, allowing us to become truly ourselves. All that we build during our lives can prove to be mere straw, pure bluster, and it collapses. Yet in the pain of this encounter, when the impurity and sickness of our lives become evident to us, there lies salvation. His gaze, the touch of his heart heals us through an undeniably painful transformation 'as through fire'. But it is a blessed pain, in which the holy power of his love sears through us like a flame, enabling us to become totally ourselves and thus totally of God. In this way the inter-relation between justice and grace also becomes clear: the way we live our lives is not immaterial, but our defilement does not stain us for ever if we have at least continued to reach out towards Christ, towards truth and towards love. Indeed, it has already been burned away through Christ's Passion. At the moment of judgement we experience and we absorb the overwhelming power of his love over all the evil in the world and in ourselves. The pain of love becomes our salvation and our joy. It is clear that we cannot calculate the 'duration' of this transforming burning in terms of the chronological measurements of this world. The transforming 'moment' of this encounter eludes earthly time-reckoning \u2014 it is the heart's time, it is the time of 'passage' to communion with God in the Body of Christ.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi_en.html Encyclical ''Spe salvi''], 46\u201347].</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens 172.jpg | Purgatory, by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]\nFile:Concepcion Santa Cruz 09.jpg | Altar in [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (Santa Cruz de Tenerife)|Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n]], [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]\nFile:Folio 113v - Purgatory.jpg | A fiery purgatory in the ''[[Tr\u00e8s riches heures du Duc de Berry]]''\nFile:V.Carmen de Beniajan-general.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[Beniaj\u00e1n]], [[Spain]]\nFile:LadyOfMtCarmelWithSufferingSouls.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[North End, Boston]]\nFile:Auhausen St. Maria 473gf.JPG | Detail of altar in Lutheran church in [[Auhausen]], [[Bavaria]]\nFile:AMR Kirche - Altar 3.jpg | Our Lady, St Monica and souls in purgatory, [[Rattenberg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nFile:Kientzheim StFelix 30.JPG | Our Lady of Passau in St Felix Church, [[Kientzheim]], [[Alsace]]\nFile:Heidelberg cpg 144 Els\u00e4ssische Legenda Aurea 338r St. Patricks Fegefeuer.jpg | Purgatory, 1419 drawing by unknown artist from [[Strasbourg]]\nFile:Michel-Serre-Vierge \u00e0 l'enfant et le purgatoire.jpg | Painting by [[Michel Serre]] in the Saint Cannat Church, [[Marseilles]]\nFile:Wimpfen-stadtkirche-predell.jpg |Altar predella in the town church of [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\nFile:Mantlach - Velburg NM 002.JPG | Request for prayer for the souls in purgatory\nFile:Catedral de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico - DSC06866.JPG | Stained-glass window in [[Puerto Rico]] Cathedral\nFile:Cristobal Rojas 46a.JPG | Purgatory by Venezuelan painter [[Crist\u00f3bal Rojas (artist)|Crist\u00f3bal Rojas]] (1890)\nFile:St.Ulrich am Pillersee - Deckenfresko 1a.jpg | Ceiling of St Ulrich Church in [[Pillersee]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], Austria\nFile:Andrea Vaccaro - The Virgin intercedes for the Souls in Purgatory.jpg |Our Lady Interceding for the Souls in Purgatory, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]\nFile:Stephan Lochner Souls in Purgatory.jpg | Miniature by [[Stefan Lochner]] showing souls in purgatory\nFile:\u00c1nimas Benditas.jpg | [[Azulejo]] of souls in purgatory, [[Seville]], [[Spain]]\n</gallery>\n\n==== Popular notion of purgatory as a place ====\n[[File:William Frederick Wakeman Lough Derg.png|thumb|The island of St Patrick's Purgatory]]\nIn his ''La naissance du Purgatoire'' (''The Birth of Purgatory''), [[Jacques Le Goff]] attributes the origin of the idea of a third other-world domain, similar to heaven and hell, called Purgatory, to Paris intellectuals and [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] at some point in the last three decades of the twelfth century, possibly as early as 1170\u22121180.

The painter was likely Jacopo di Mino del Pellicciaio, and the date of the fresco is around 1345. Purgatory is shown as a rocky hill filled with separate openings into its hollow center. Above the mountain St Patrick introduces the prayers of the faithful that can help attenuate the sufferings of the souls undergoing purification. In each opening, sinners are tormented by demons and by fire. Each of the seven deadly sins \u2013 avarice, envy, sloth, pride, anger, lust, and gluttony \u2013 has its own region of purgatory and its own appropriate tortures. \n\n[[File:Dante03.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dante gazes at purgatory (shown as a mountain) in this 16th-century painting.]]\nLe Goff dedicates the final chapter of his book to the ''Purgatorio'', the second book in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s fourteenth-century ''[[The Divine Comedy|La divina commedia]]'' (''The Divine Comedy''). In an interview Le Goff declared: \"Dante's ''Purgatorio'' represents the sublime conclusion of the slow development of Purgatory that took place in the course of the Middle Ages. The power of Dante's poetry made a decisive contribution to fixing in the public imagination this 'third place', whose birth was on the whole quite recent.\"<ref>[https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/09/27/invenzione-del-purgatorio.html Fabio Gambaro, \"L'invenzione del purgatorio\" in ''La Repubblica'', 27 September 2005]</ref>\n\nDante pictures purgatory as an island at the [[antipodes]] of Jerusalem, pushed up, in an otherwise empty sea, by the displacement caused by the fall of Satan, which left him fixed at the central point of the globe of the Earth. The cone-shaped island has seven terraces on which souls are cleansed from the [[seven deadly sins]] or capital vices as they ascend. Additional spurs at the base hold those for whom beginning the ascent is delayed because in life they were excommunicates, indolent or late repenters. At the summit is the [[Garden of Eden|earthly paradise]], from where the souls, cleansed of evil tendencies and made perfect, are taken to heaven.\n\nThe Catholic Church has not included in its teaching this idea of purgatory as a place, any more than it has sealed with its authority the idea of a [[Limbo]], which also has been postulated by some theologians.\n\nOn 4 August 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]], speaking of purgatory, said: \"The term does not indicate a place, but a condition of existence. Those who, after death, exist in a state of purification, are already in the love of Christ who removes from them the remnants of imperfection as \"a condition of existence\".<ref name=\"Audience of 4 August 1999\"/>\n\nSimilarly in 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], speaking of Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]] (1447\u20131510) in relation to purgatory, said that \"In her day it was depicted mainly using images linked to space: a certain space was conceived of in which purgatory was supposed to be located.

Its place is decided forever by its Creator and judge. The Orthodox Church does not believe in purgatory (a place of purging), that is, the inter-mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved (those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins) are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into Heaven, where every soul is perfect and fit to see God. Also, the Orthodox Church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment. Both purgatory and indulgences are inter-corelated theories, unwitnessed in the Bible or in the Ancient Church, and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices at the expense of the prevailing Truths of the Church. If Almighty God in His merciful loving-kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner, it is unknown to the Church of Christ. The Church lived for fifteen hundred years without such a theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7076|title=Death, the Threshold to Eternal Life - Liturgy & Worship - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=www.goarch.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEastern Orthodox teaching is that, while all undergo an [[particular judgment|individual judgment]] immediately after death, neither the just nor the wicked attain the final state of bliss or punishment before the Last Day,<ref>John Meyondorff, ''Byzantine Theology'' (London: Mowbrays, 1974) pp. 220\u2013221. \"At death man's body goes to the earth from which it was taken, and the soul, being immortal, goes to God, who gave it.

Rather his basic argument is that, in a phrase he often uses, it \"makes sense.\"<ref>For example, Walls,  2012, p. 71</ref> For Walls, purgatory has a [[logic]], as in the title of his book. He documents the \"contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models\" of purgatory. In the satisfaction model, \"the punishment of purgatory\" is to satisfy God's justice. In the sanctification model, Wall writes: \"Purgatory might be pictured ... as a regimen to regain one\u2019s spiritual health and get back into moral shape.\"<ref>Walls, 2012, pp. 76, 90.</ref> In Catholic theology Walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has \"swung\" between the \"poles of satisfaction and sanctification\" sometimes \"combining both elements somewhere in the middle\". He believes the sanctification model \"can be affirmed by Protestants without in any way contradicting their theology\" and that they may find that it \"makes better sense of how the remains of sin are purged\" than an instantaneous cleansing at the moment of death.<ref>Walls 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nWhile purgatory was disputed by the Reformers, some early patristic theologians of the Eastern Church taught and believed in \"[[apocatastasis]]\", the belief that all creation would be restored to its original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation. [[Clement of Alexandria]] was one of the early church theologians who taught this view. Protestants have always contended that there are no second chances.

This is frequently referred to as \"baptism for the dead\" and \"temple work.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiandataresources.com/mormonbeliefs2.htm|title=What Do Mormons Believe (The God Makers)?|website=www.christiandataresources.com}}</ref> Members of the Church believe that during the three days following Christ's crucifixion, he preached his gospel to inhabitants of spirit prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_Prison|title=Spirit Prison - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Judaism==\nIn [[Judaism]], [[Gehenna]] is a place of purification where, according to some traditions, most sinners spend up to a year before release.\n\nThe view of purgatory can be found in the teaching of the Shammaites: \"In the last judgment day there shall be three classes of souls: the righteous shall at once be written down for the life everlasting; the wicked, for Gehenna; but those whose virtues and sins counterbalance one another shall go down to Gehenna and float up and down until they rise purified; for of them it is said: 'I will bring the third part into the fire and refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried' [Zech. xiii. 9.]; also, 'He [the Lord] bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up again'\" (I Sam. ii. 6). The Hillelites seem to have had no purgatory; for they said: \"He who is 'plenteous in mercy' [Ex. xxxiv. 6.] inclines the balance toward mercy, and consequently the intermediates do not descend into Gehenna\" (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 3; R. H. 16b; Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" i. 18). Still they also speak of an intermediate state.\n\nRegarding the time which purgatory lasts, the accepted opinion of R. Akiba is twelve months; according to R. Johanan b. Nuri, it is only forty-nine days. Both opinions are based upon Isa. lxvi. 23\u201324: \"From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before Me, and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched\"; the former interpreting the words \"from one new moon to another\" to signify all the months of a year; the latter interpreting the words \"from one Sabbath to another,\" in accordance with Lev. xxiii. 15\u201316, to signify seven weeks. During the twelve months, declares the baraita (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 4\u20135; R. H. 16b), the souls of the wicked are judged, and after these twelve months are over they are consumed and transformed into ashes under the feet of the righteous (according to Mal. iii. 21 [A. V. iv. 3]), whereas the great seducers and blasphemers are to undergo eternal tortures in Gehenna without cessation (according to Isa. lxvi. 24).\n\nThe righteous, however, and, according to some, also the sinners among the people of Israel for whom Abraham intercedes because they bear the Abrahamic sign of the covenant are not harmed by the fire of Gehenna even when they are required to pass through the intermediate state of purgatory ('Er. 19b; \u1e24ag. 27a).<ref>\"There are three categories of men; the wholly pious and the arch-sinners are not purified, but only those between these two classes\" ([http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=115&letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia: Gehenna])</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] declares, in [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|his 13 principles of faith]], that the descriptions of Gehenna, as a place of punishment in rabbinic literature, were pedagocically motivated inventions to encourage respect of the [[Torah]] commandements by mankind, which had been regarded as immature.<ref name=\"perek-helek-d\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 3\u20134.</ref> Instead of being sent to Gehenna, the souls of the wicked would actually get annihilated.<ref name=\"perek-helek-c\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Islam ==\n{{main article|Barzakh}}\nIslam has a concept similar to that of purgatory in Christianity.

[[Paul J. Griffiths]] notes: \"Recent Catholic thought on purgatory typically preserves the essentials of the basic doctrine while also offering second-hand speculative interpretations of these elements\".<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1XYXMTe1jYC&pg=PA436&dq=Griffiths+purgatory+second-order&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi42pv2wNHfAhWyQxUIHZV2A14Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=Griffiths%20purgatory%20second-order&f=false |author=Paul J.

Walls |title=The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |p=436}}</ref> Thus [[Joseph Ratzinger]] wrote: \"Purgatory is not, as [[Tertullian]] thought, some kind of supra-worldly concentration camp where man is forced to undergo punishment in a more or less arbitrary fashion. Rather it is the inwardly necessary process of transformation in which a person becomes capable of Christ, capable of God, and thus capable of unity with the whole communion of saints\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AfomsX5KtYkC&pg=PA230&dq=supra-worldly+concentration#v=onepage&q=supra-worldly%20concentration&f=false |author=Joseph Ratzinger |title=Eschatology: Death and Eternal Life |publisher=CUA Press |year=2007 |p=230|isbn=9780813215167 }}</ref>\n\nThe speculations and popular imaginings that, especially in late medieval times, were common in the Western or [[Latin Church]] have not necessarily found acceptance in the [[eastern Catholic Churches]], of which there are 23 in [[full communion]] with the Pope. Some have explicitly rejected the notions of punishment by fire in a particular place that are prominent in the popular picture of purgatory. The representatives of the [[Orthodox Church]] at the [[Council of Florence]] argued against these notions, while declaring that they do hold that there is a cleansing after death of the souls of the saved and that these are assisted by the prayers of the living: \"If souls depart from this life in faith and charity but marked with some defilements, whether unrepented minor ones or major ones repented of but without having yet borne the fruits of repentance, we believe that within reason they are purified of those faults, but not by some purifying fire and particular punishments in some place.\"<ref>[https://archive.org/details/patrologiaorient15pariuoft/page/40 \"First Speech by Mark, Archbishop of Ephesus, on Purifying Fire\" in ''Patrologia Orientalis'', vol. 15, pp. 40\u201341]</ref> The definition of purgatory adopted by that council excluded the two notions with which the Orthodox disagreed and mentioned only the two points that, they said, were part of their faith also. Accordingly, the agreement, known as the [[Union of Brest]], that formalized the admission of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] into the full [[communion (Christian)|communion]] of the Roman Catholic Church stated: \"We shall not debate about purgatory, but we entrust ourselves to the teaching of the Holy Church\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1595brest.html|title=Treaty of Brest, Article 5|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Fire====\nFire has an important place in the popular image of purgatory and has been the object of speculation by theologians, speculation to which the article on purgatory in the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' relates the warning by the Council of Trent against \"difficult and subtle questions which tend not to edification.\"<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia on Purgatory\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12575a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Purgatory|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\nFire has never been included in the Catholic Church's defined doctrine on purgatory, but speculation about it is traditional. \"The tradition of the Church, by reference to certain texts of Scripture, speaks of a cleansing fire.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P2N.HTM#$1BW Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1031]</ref> In this regard the ''Catechism of the Catholic Church'' references in particular two New Testament passages: \"If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire\"<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:15|ESV}}</ref> and \"so that the tested genuineness of your faith\u2014more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire\u2014may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ\".<ref>{{Bibleverse|1|Peter|1:7|ESV}}</ref> Catholic theologians have also cited verses such as \"I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested.

To enter afterwards then into the holy lands with your ''wood'' and with your ''hay'' and ''stubble'' so that you may defile the Kingdom of God? But again do you want to be left behind in the fire on account of the ''hay'', the ''wood'', the ''stubble'', and to receive nothing due you for the ''gold'' and the ''silver'' and ''precious stone''? That is not reasonable. What then? It follows that you receive the ''fire first'' due to the ''wood'', and the ''hay'' and the ''stubble''.

Thus the ''[[Summa Theologica]]'' of [[Thomas Aquinas]] considered it probable that purgatory was situated close to hell, so that the same fire that tormented the damned cleansed the just souls in purgatory.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/aquinas/summa.AP2_Q1_A2.html ''Summa Theologica'', appendix 2, article 2: \"Whether it is the same place where souls are cleansed, and the damned punished?\"]</ref>\n\nIdeas about the supposed fire of purgatory have changed with time: in the early 20th century the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' reported that, while in the past most theologians had held that the fire of purgatory was in some sense a material fire, though of a nature different from ordinary fire, the view of what then seemed to be the majority of theologians was that the term was to be understood metaphorically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07207a.htm#VI|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hell|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Pope Benedict XVI]] recommended to theologians the presentation of purgatory by Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]], for whom purgatory is not an external but an inner fire: \"The Saint speaks of the soul's journey of purification on the way to full communion with God, starting from her own experience of profound sorrow for the sins committed, in comparison with God's infinite love. [...] 'The soul', Catherine says, 'presents itself to God still bound to the desires and suffering that derive from sin and this makes it impossible for it to enjoy the [[beatific vision]] of God'. Catherine asserts that God is so pure and holy that a soul stained by sin cannot be in the presence of the divine majesty. We too feel how distant we are, how full we are of so many things that we cannot see God. The soul is aware of the immense love and perfect justice of God and consequently suffers for having failed to respond in a correct and perfect way to this love; and love for God itself becomes a flame, love itself cleanses it from the residue of sin.\"<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/audiences/2011/documents/hf_ben-xvi_aud_20110112.html Pope Benedict XVI, General Audience of 12 January 2011]</ref>\n\nIn his 2007 encyclical ''Spe salvi'', Pope Benedict XVI, referring to the words of [[Paul the Apostle]] in {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|3:12\u201315|ESV}} about a fire that both burns and saves, spoke of the opinion that \"the fire which both burns and saves is Christ himself, the Judge and Saviour. The encounter with him is the decisive act of judgement. Before his gaze all falsehood melts away. This encounter with him, as it burns us, transforms and frees us, allowing us to become truly ourselves. All that we build during our lives can prove to be mere straw, pure bluster, and it collapses. Yet in the pain of this encounter, when the impurity and sickness of our lives become evident to us, there lies salvation. His gaze, the touch of his heart heals us through an undeniably painful transformation 'as through fire'. But it is a blessed pain, in which the holy power of his love sears through us like a flame, enabling us to become totally ourselves and thus totally of God. In this way the inter-relation between justice and grace also becomes clear: the way we live our lives is not immaterial, but our defilement does not stain us for ever if we have at least continued to reach out towards Christ, towards truth and towards love. Indeed, it has already been burned away through Christ's Passion. At the moment of judgement we experience and we absorb the overwhelming power of his love over all the evil in the world and in ourselves. The pain of love becomes our salvation and our joy. It is clear that we cannot calculate the 'duration' of this transforming burning in terms of the chronological measurements of this world. The transforming 'moment' of this encounter eludes earthly time-reckoning \u2014 it is the heart's time, it is the time of 'passage' to communion with God in the Body of Christ.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi_en.html Encyclical ''Spe salvi''], 46\u201347].</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Peter Paul Rubens 172.jpg | Purgatory, by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]\nFile:Concepcion Santa Cruz 09.jpg | Altar in [[Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n (Santa Cruz de Tenerife)|Iglesia de la Concepci\u00f3n]], [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]\nFile:Folio 113v - Purgatory.jpg | A fiery purgatory in the ''[[Tr\u00e8s riches heures du Duc de Berry]]''\nFile:V.Carmen de Beniajan-general.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[Beniaj\u00e1n]], [[Spain]]\nFile:LadyOfMtCarmelWithSufferingSouls.jpg | [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] and purgatory, [[North End, Boston]]\nFile:Auhausen St. Maria 473gf.JPG | Detail of altar in Lutheran church in [[Auhausen]], [[Bavaria]]\nFile:AMR Kirche - Altar 3.jpg | Our Lady, St Monica and souls in purgatory, [[Rattenberg]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]]\nFile:Kientzheim StFelix 30.JPG | Our Lady of Passau in St Felix Church, [[Kientzheim]], [[Alsace]]\nFile:Heidelberg cpg 144 Els\u00e4ssische Legenda Aurea 338r St. Patricks Fegefeuer.jpg | Purgatory, 1419 drawing by unknown artist from [[Strasbourg]]\nFile:Michel-Serre-Vierge \u00e0 l'enfant et le purgatoire.jpg | Painting by [[Michel Serre]] in the Saint Cannat Church, [[Marseilles]]\nFile:Wimpfen-stadtkirche-predell.jpg |Altar predella in the town church of [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\nFile:Mantlach - Velburg NM 002.JPG | Request for prayer for the souls in purgatory\nFile:Catedral de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico - DSC06866.JPG | Stained-glass window in [[Puerto Rico]] Cathedral\nFile:Cristobal Rojas 46a.JPG | Purgatory by Venezuelan painter [[Crist\u00f3bal Rojas (artist)|Crist\u00f3bal Rojas]] (1890)\nFile:St.Ulrich am Pillersee - Deckenfresko 1a.jpg | Ceiling of St Ulrich Church in [[Pillersee]], [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], Austria\nFile:Andrea Vaccaro - The Virgin intercedes for the Souls in Purgatory.jpg |Our Lady Interceding for the Souls in Purgatory, by [[Andrea Vaccaro]]\nFile:Stephan Lochner Souls in Purgatory.jpg | Miniature by [[Stefan Lochner]] showing souls in purgatory\nFile:\u00c1nimas Benditas.jpg | [[Azulejo]] of souls in purgatory, [[Seville]], [[Spain]]\n</gallery>\n\n==== Popular notion of purgatory as a place ====\n[[File:William Frederick Wakeman Lough Derg.png|thumb|The island of St Patrick's Purgatory]]\nIn his ''La naissance du Purgatoire'' (''The Birth of Purgatory''), [[Jacques Le Goff]] attributes the origin of the idea of a third other-world domain, similar to heaven and hell, called Purgatory, to Paris intellectuals and [[Cistercians|Cistercian monks]] at some point in the last three decades of the twelfth century, possibly as early as 1170\u22121180.

The power of Dante's poetry made a decisive contribution to fixing in the public imagination this 'third place', whose birth was on the whole quite recent.\"<ref>[https://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2005/09/27/invenzione-del-purgatorio.html Fabio Gambaro, \"L'invenzione del purgatorio\" in ''La Repubblica'', 27 September 2005]</ref>\n\nDante pictures purgatory as an island at the [[antipodes]] of Jerusalem, pushed up, in an otherwise empty sea, by the displacement caused by the fall of Satan, which left him fixed at the central point of the globe of the Earth. The cone-shaped island has seven terraces on which souls are cleansed from the [[seven deadly sins]] or capital vices as they ascend. Additional spurs at the base hold those for whom beginning the ascent is delayed because in life they were excommunicates, indolent or late repenters. At the summit is the [[Garden of Eden|earthly paradise]], from where the souls, cleansed of evil tendencies and made perfect, are taken to heaven.\n\nThe Catholic Church has not included in its teaching this idea of purgatory as a place, any more than it has sealed with its authority the idea of a [[Limbo]], which also has been postulated by some theologians.\n\nOn 4 August 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]], speaking of purgatory, said: \"The term does not indicate a place, but a condition of existence. Those who, after death, exist in a state of purification, are already in the love of Christ who removes from them the remnants of imperfection as \"a condition of existence\".<ref name=\"Audience of 4 August 1999\"/>\n\nSimilarly in 2011, [[Pope Benedict XVI]], speaking of Saint [[Catherine of Genoa]] (1447\u20131510) in relation to purgatory, said that \"In her day it was depicted mainly using images linked to space: a certain space was conceived of in which purgatory was supposed to be located.

Its place is decided forever by its Creator and judge. The Orthodox Church does not believe in purgatory (a place of purging), that is, the inter-mediate state after death in which the souls of the saved (those who have not received temporal punishment for their sins) are purified of all taint preparatory to entering into Heaven, where every soul is perfect and fit to see God. Also, the Orthodox Church does not believe in indulgences as remissions from purgatorial punishment. Both purgatory and indulgences are inter-corelated theories, unwitnessed in the Bible or in the Ancient Church, and when they were enforced and applied they brought about evil practices at the expense of the prevailing Truths of the Church. If Almighty God in His merciful loving-kindness changes the dreadful situation of the sinner, it is unknown to the Church of Christ. The Church lived for fifteen hundred years without such a theory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarch.org/ourfaith/ourfaith7076|title=Death, the Threshold to Eternal Life - Liturgy & Worship - Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America|website=www.goarch.org}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nEastern Orthodox teaching is that, while all undergo an [[particular judgment|individual judgment]] immediately after death, neither the just nor the wicked attain the final state of bliss or punishment before the Last Day,<ref>John Meyondorff, ''Byzantine Theology'' (London: Mowbrays, 1974) pp. 220\u2013221. \"At death man's body goes to the earth from which it was taken, and the soul, being immortal, goes to God, who gave it.

Many Protestant denominations, though not all, teach the doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]'' (\"scripture alone\") or ''[[prima scriptura]]'' (\"scripture first\"). The general Protestant view is that the Bible, from which Protestants exclude [[deuterocanonical books]] such as [[2 Maccabees]], contains no overt, explicit discussion of purgatory and therefore it should be rejected as an unbiblical belief.<ref>Robert L. Millet, ''By what Authority?: The Vital Question of Religious Authority in Christianity'' (Mercer University, 2010), 66.</ref>\n\nAnother view held by many Protestants, such as the [[Lutheran Church]]es and the [[Reformed Church]]es, is ''[[sola fide]]'' (\"by faith alone\"): that faith alone is what achieves [[salvation]], and that good works are merely ''evidence'' of that faith.<ref>Alan Richardson, John Bowden, eds, ''The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology'' (Westminster John Knox, 1983), s.v. sola fide, 545.</ref> Justification is generally seen as a discrete event that takes place once for all during one's lifetime, not the result of a transformation of character.

Rather his basic argument is that, in a phrase he often uses, it \"makes sense.\"<ref>For example, Walls,  2012, p. 71</ref> For Walls, purgatory has a [[logic]], as in the title of his book. He documents the \"contrast between the satisfaction and sanctification models\" of purgatory. In the satisfaction model, \"the punishment of purgatory\" is to satisfy God's justice. In the sanctification model, Wall writes: \"Purgatory might be pictured ... as a regimen to regain one\u2019s spiritual health and get back into moral shape.\"<ref>Walls, 2012, pp. 76, 90.</ref> In Catholic theology Walls finds that the doctrine of purgatory has \"swung\" between the \"poles of satisfaction and sanctification\" sometimes \"combining both elements somewhere in the middle\". He believes the sanctification model \"can be affirmed by Protestants without in any way contradicting their theology\" and that they may find that it \"makes better sense of how the remains of sin are purged\" than an instantaneous cleansing at the moment of death.<ref>Walls 2012, p. 90</ref>\n\nWhile purgatory was disputed by the Reformers, some early patristic theologians of the Eastern Church taught and believed in \"[[apocatastasis]]\", the belief that all creation would be restored to its original perfect condition after a remedial purgatorial reformation. [[Clement of Alexandria]] was one of the early church theologians who taught this view. Protestants have always contended that there are no second chances.

This place, called \"the spirit world,\" includes \"paradise\" for the righteous and \"prison\" for those who do not know God. Spirits in paradise serve as missionaries to the spirits in prison, who can still accept salvation. In this sense, spirit prison can be conceptualized as a type of purgatory. In addition to hearing the message from the missionary spirits, the spirits in prison can also accept posthumous baptism and other posthumous ordinances performed by living church members in temples on Earth. This is frequently referred to as \"baptism for the dead\" and \"temple work.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christiandataresources.com/mormonbeliefs2.htm|title=What Do Mormons Believe (The God Makers)?|website=www.christiandataresources.com}}</ref> Members of the Church believe that during the three days following Christ's crucifixion, he preached his gospel to inhabitants of spirit prison.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eom.byu.edu/index.php/Spirit_Prison|title=Spirit Prison - The Encyclopedia of Mormonism|website=eom.byu.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Judaism==\nIn [[Judaism]], [[Gehenna]] is a place of purification where, according to some traditions, most sinners spend up to a year before release.\n\nThe view of purgatory can be found in the teaching of the Shammaites: \"In the last judgment day there shall be three classes of souls: the righteous shall at once be written down for the life everlasting; the wicked, for Gehenna; but those whose virtues and sins counterbalance one another shall go down to Gehenna and float up and down until they rise purified; for of them it is said: 'I will bring the third part into the fire and refine them as silver is refined, and try them as gold is tried' [Zech. xiii. 9.]; also, 'He [the Lord] bringeth down to Sheol and bringeth up again'\" (I Sam. ii. 6). The Hillelites seem to have had no purgatory; for they said: \"He who is 'plenteous in mercy' [Ex. xxxiv. 6.] inclines the balance toward mercy, and consequently the intermediates do not descend into Gehenna\" (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 3; R. H. 16b; Bacher, \"Ag. Tan.\" i. 18). Still they also speak of an intermediate state.\n\nRegarding the time which purgatory lasts, the accepted opinion of R. Akiba is twelve months; according to R. Johanan b. Nuri, it is only forty-nine days. Both opinions are based upon Isa. lxvi. 23\u201324: \"From one new moon to another and from one Sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before Me, and they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against Me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched\"; the former interpreting the words \"from one new moon to another\" to signify all the months of a year; the latter interpreting the words \"from one Sabbath to another,\" in accordance with Lev. xxiii. 15\u201316, to signify seven weeks. During the twelve months, declares the baraita (Tosef., Sanh. xiii. 4\u20135; R. H. 16b), the souls of the wicked are judged, and after these twelve months are over they are consumed and transformed into ashes under the feet of the righteous (according to Mal. iii. 21 [A. V. iv. 3]), whereas the great seducers and blasphemers are to undergo eternal tortures in Gehenna without cessation (according to Isa. lxvi. 24).\n\nThe righteous, however, and, according to some, also the sinners among the people of Israel for whom Abraham intercedes because they bear the Abrahamic sign of the covenant are not harmed by the fire of Gehenna even when they are required to pass through the intermediate state of purgatory ('Er. 19b; \u1e24ag. 27a).<ref>\"There are three categories of men; the wholly pious and the arch-sinners are not purified, but only those between these two classes\" ([http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=115&letter=G Jewish Encyclopedia: Gehenna])</ref>\n\n[[Maimonides]] declares, in [[Jewish principles of faith#Maimonides' 13 principles of faith|his 13 principles of faith]], that the descriptions of Gehenna, as a place of punishment in rabbinic literature, were pedagocically motivated inventions to encourage respect of the [[Torah]] commandements by mankind, which had been regarded as immature.<ref name=\"perek-helek-d\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 3\u20134.</ref> Instead of being sent to Gehenna, the souls of the wicked would actually get annihilated.<ref name=\"perek-helek-c\">Maimonides\u2019 Introduction to Perek Helek, publ. and transl. by [[Maimonides Heritage Center]], p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n== Islam ==\n{{main article|Barzakh}}\nIslam has a concept similar to that of purgatory in Christianity.
