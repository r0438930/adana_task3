He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].\n\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].\n\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\n[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]\nBorn in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].\n\nIn 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.\n\n==Provincial administrator, 1837\u20131843==\n[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]\nOn 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />\n\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=31}}\n\nPecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=37}}\n\n==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==\n[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]\nIn 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\n\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].\n\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=52}}\n\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>\n\n==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878==\n\n===Papal assistant===\n[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>K\u00fchne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\n\n===Provincial council===\nPecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\n\n===Charitable activities===\n[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]\nPecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n===Defending the papacy===\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=105}}\n\n===Organizing the First Vatican Council===\nOn 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\n\nDuring the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=129}}\n\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard.

It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.\n\n(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)\n\n==Papacy, 1878\u20131903==\n{{Social teachings of the popes}}\n[[File:Vatican Observatory 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Silver medal celebrating the 1891 Pope Leo XIII's inauguration of the new observatory]]\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII 1898.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Photogram of the 1896 film ''Sua Santit\u00e1 papa Leone XIII'', the first time a Pope appeared on film.]]\n[[File:XIII.Leop\u00e1pa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]\n\nAs soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.

Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.\n\nWhile Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\n\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nLeo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

He had to defend the freedom of the Church against what Catholics considered Italian persecutions and attacks in the area of education, expropriation and violation of Catholic Churches, legal measures against the Church and brutal attacks, culminating in anticlerical groups attempting to throw the body of the deceased Pope Pius IX into the Tiber river on 13 July 1881.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=413}} The Pope even considered moving his residence to [[Trieste]] or [[Salzburg]], two cities in [[Austria]], an idea that the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] gently rejected.{{Sfn|Schmidlin|1934|p=414}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\nAmong the activities of Leo XIII that were important for the English-speaking world, he [[Restoration of the Scottish hierarchy|restored the Scottish hierarchy]] in 1878.

The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants.\n\n===Theology===\n{{Main|Theology of Pope Leo XIII}}\n[[File:GiuseppePecciLeoXIII.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[Giuseppe Pecci]] in 1872. At the urgent requests of the [[College of Cardinals]], Leo XIII in 1879 elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, a [[Jesuit]] and prominent [[Thomist]] theologian, into their ranks.<ref>{{Citation |first=Benno |last=K\u00fchne |title=Unser Heiliger Vater Papst Leo XIII in seinem Leben und wirken |place=Benzinger |publisher=Einsiedeln |year=1880 |page=247}}.</ref>]]\n{{Further|List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\nThe pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869\u20131870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev. Anthony |date=1992 |website= |publisher=TraditionalMass.org |access-date=29 September 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nLeo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>\n\n====Thomism====\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism\u2014the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas\u2014as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\n\nFollowing this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.\n\n====Consecrations====\n[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863\u20131899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\n\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\n\n====Scriptures====\nIn his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\n\n====Theological research====\n[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>\n\n====Mariology====\n{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}\nHis predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].\n\n====Social teachings====\n{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\n\n=====Church and state=====\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=====''Rerum novarum''=====\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1900]]\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].\n\n===Canonizations and beatifications===\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\n* 8 December 1881: [[Clare of Montefalco]] (d. 1308), [[John Baptist de Rossi]] (1696\u20131764), [[Lawrence of Brindisi]] (d. 1619), and [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] (1748\u201383)\n* 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the [[Servite Order]], [[Peter Claver]] (1581\u20131654), [[John Berchmans]] (1599\u20131621), and [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]] (1531\u20131617)\n* 27 May 1897: [[Anthony Maria Zaccaria|Antonio Maria Zaccaria]] (1502\u201339) and [[Peter Fourier]] (1565\u20131640)\n* 24 May 1900: [[John Baptist de la Salle]] (1651\u20131719) and [[Rita of Cascia]] (1381\u20131457)\n\nLeo XIII also beatified several of his predecessors: [[Urban II]] (14 July 1881), [[Victor III]] (23 July 1887) and [[Innocent V]] (9 March 1898). He also canonized [[Adrian III]] on 2 June 1891.\n\nHe also beatified the following.\n* [[Charles of Sezze|Giancarlo Melchiori]] on 22 January 1882\n* [[Edmund Campion]] and [[Ralph Sherwin]] in 1886\n* [[John Haile]] on 29 December 1886\n* John Baptist de la Salle (whom he later canonized) on 19 February 1888\n* [[In\u00e9s de Benig\u00e1nim|In\u00e9s of Benig\u00e1nim]] on 26 February 1888\n* Antonio Maria Zaccaria (whom he later canonized) on 3 January 1890\n* [[Giovanni Giovenale Ancina]] on 9 February 1890\n* [[Pompilio Maria Pirrotti]] on 26 January 1890\n* [[Gerard Majella]] on 29 January 1893\n* [[Leopoldo da Gaiche|Leopoldo Croci]] on 12 May 1893\n* [[Antonio Baldinucci]] on 16 April 1893\n* Rodolfo Acquaviva and 4 Companions on 30 April 1893\n* [[Diego Jos\u00e9 de C\u00e1diz|Diego Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Caama\u00f1o]] on 22 April 1894\n* [[Bernardino Realino]] on 12 January 1896\n* [[Maria Maddalena Martinengo]] on 3 June 1900\n* D\u00e9nis Berthelot of the Nativity and Redento Rodr\u00edguez of the Cross on 10 June 1900\n* [[Jeanne de Lestonnac]] on 23 September 1900\n* [[Antonio Grassi]] on 30 September 1900\n\nHe also approved the cult of [[Cosmas of Aphrodisia]]. He also beatified several of the English martyrs in 1895.<ref>{{cite web|newspaper=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=2748 |title=St. Cosmas&nbsp;\u2014 Saints & Angels |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Doctors of the Church====\nLeo XIII named four individuals as [[Doctors of the Church]]:\n* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (1883)\n* [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (1883)\n* [[John of Damascus]] (1890)\n* [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] (13 November 1899)\n\n===Audiences===\n[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|165px|left|In 1901, Pope Leo XIII welcomed Eugenio Pacelli, later [[Pope Pius XII]], on his first day of fifty-seven years of service in the Vatican (1901\u20131958).]]\nOne of the first audiences Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the [[Collegio Capranica]], where in the first row knelt in front of him a young seminarian, [[Giacomo Della Chiesa]], the future [[Pope Benedict XV]], who would reign from 1914 to 1922.\n\nWhile on a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future [[Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux]] attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the [[Carmelite order]]. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] authorized the prioress to receive Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:TOMB LEO xiii.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.]]\nLeo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,<ref>John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98.</ref> the longest-lived pope ever ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}).

Lewis Pecci'''}}; 2 March 1810 \u2013 20 July 1903) was the visible head of the [[Catholic Church]] from 20 February 1878 to his death. He was the [[List of ages of popes|oldest]] pope (reigning until the age of 93), and had the [[List of popes by length of reign|third-longest confirmed pontificate]], behind those of [[Pius IX]] (his immediate predecessor) and [[John Paul II]].\n\nHe is well known for his intellectualism and his attempts to define the position of the Catholic Church with regard to modern thinking. In his famous 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'', Pope Leo outlined the rights of workers to a fair wage, safe working conditions, and the formation of [[trade unions]], while affirming the rights of property and free enterprise, opposing both [[socialism]] and [[laissez-faire]] [[capitalism]]. He influenced [[Mariology of the Catholic Church]] and promoted both the [[rosary]] and the [[scapular]].\n\nLeo XIII issued a record of eleven papal encyclicals on the [[rosary]] earning him the title as the \"'''Rosary Pope'''\". In addition, he approved two new Marian [[scapular]]s and was the first pope to fully embrace the concept of Mary as [[Mediatrix]]. He was the first pope to have never held any control over the [[Papal States]], after they had been dissolved by 1870. He was briefly buried in the grottos of Saint Peter's Basilica before his remains were later transferred to the [[Basilica of Saint John Lateran]].\n\n== Early life and education, 1810\u20131836 ==\n[[File:Carpineto italiano paolucci.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The house in [[Carpineto Romano]], in which the Pecci brothers grew up]]\nBorn in [[Carpineto Romano]], near Rome, he was the sixth of the seven sons of Count Ludovico Pecci and his wife Anna Prosperi Buzzi. His brothers included [[Giuseppe Pecci|Giuseppe]] and Giovanni Battista Pecci. Until 1818 he lived at home with his family, \"in which religion counted as the highest grace on earth, as through her, salvation can be earned for all eternity\".{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=7}} Together with his brother Giuseppe, he studied in the Jesuit College in [[Viterbo]], where he stayed until 1824.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=12}} He enjoyed the [[Latin]] language and was known to write his own Latin poems at the age of eleven.\n\nIn 1824 he and his older brother Giuseppe were called to Rome where their mother was dying. Count Pecci wanted his children near him after the loss of his wife, and so they stayed with him in Rome, attending the Jesuit [[Collegium Romanum]].\n\nIn 1828, 18-year-old Vincenzo decided in favour of [[secular clergy]], while his brother Giuseppe entered the Jesuit order.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=20}} He studied at the ''[[Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy|Academia dei Nobili]]'', mainly diplomacy and law. In 1834, he gave a student presentation, attended by several [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], on ''papal judgements''. For his presentation he received awards for academic excellence, and gained the attention of Vatican officials.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=23}} [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Luigi Lambruschini]] introduced him to Vatican congregations. During a cholera epidemic in Rome he assisted [[Giuseppe Antonio Sala|Cardinal Sala]] in his duties as overseer of all the city hospitals.<ref name=Benigni>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09169a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Pope Leo XIII|website=www.newadvent.org}}</ref> In 1836 he received his doctorate in theology and doctorates of civil and [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in Rome.\n\n==Provincial administrator, 1837\u20131843==\n[[File:Carpineto romano illustration 1878.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the [[Carpineto Romano]] as seen in 1860]]\nOn 14 February 1837, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] appointed the 27 year old Pecci as personal [[prelate]] even before he was ordained priest on 31 December 1837, by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicar of Rome]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Carlo Odescalchi]]. He celebrated his first mass together with his priest brother Giuseppe.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=24}} Shortly thereafter, [[Gregory XVI]] appointed Pecci as legate (provincial administrator) to [[Benevento]], the smallest of papal provinces, including about 20,000&nbsp;people.<ref name=Benigni />\n\nThe main problems facing Pecci were a decaying local economy, insecurity because of widespread bandits, and pervasive [[Camorra|Mafia or Camorra]] structures, which were often allied with aristocratic families. Pecci arrested the most powerful aristocrat in Benevento, and his troops captured others, who were either killed or imprisoned by him. With the public order restored, he turned to the economy and a reform of the tax system to stimulate trade with neighboring provinces.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=31}}\n\nPecci was first destined for [[Spoleto]], a province of 100,000. On 17 July 1841, he was sent to [[Perugia]] with 200,000 inhabitants.<ref name=Benigni /> His immediate concern was to prepare the province for a papal visitation in the same year. Pope Gregory XVI visited hospitals and educational institutions for several days, asking for advice and listing questions. The fight against corruption continued in Perugia, where Pecci investigated several incidents. When it was claimed that a bakery was selling bread below the prescribed pound weight, he personally went there, had all bread weighed, and confiscated it if below legal weight. The confiscated bread was distributed to the poor.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=37}}\n\n==Nuncio to Belgium, 1843==\n[[File:Leo13nuncio.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Archbishop Pecci as [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium|Nuncio]] in [[Brussels]]]]\nIn 1843, Pecci, only thirty-three years old, was appointed [[Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium]],<ref name=Miranda>[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1853-ii.htm#Pecci Miranda, Salvador. \"Pecci, Gioacchino\", ''The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church'']</ref> a position which guaranteed the Cardinal's hat after completion of the tour.\n\nOn 27 April 1843, Pope Gregory XVI appointed Pecci [[Archbishop]] and asked his Cardinal Secretary of State Lambruschini to consecrate him.<ref name=Miranda /> Pecci developed excellent relations with the royal family and used the location to visit neighbouring Germany, where he was particularly interested in the resumed construction of the [[Cologne Cathedral]].\n\nIn 1844, upon his initiative, a [[Belgian college (Rome)|Belgian College]] in Rome was opened, where 102 years later, in 1946, the future [[Pope John Paul II]] would begin his Roman studies. He spent several weeks in England with Bishop [[Nicholas Wiseman]], carefully reviewing the condition of the [[Catholic Church in England#Nineteenth century|Catholic Church in that country]].{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=52}}\n\nIn Belgium, the school question was sharply debated between the Catholic majority and the [[Liberalism|Liberal]] minority. Pecci encouraged the struggle for Catholic schools, yet he was able to win the good will of the Court, not only of the pious [[Louise-Marie of France|Queen Louise]], but also of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I]], strongly Liberal in his views. The new nuncio succeeded in uniting the Catholics. At the end of his mission, the King granted him the Grand Cordon in the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]].<ref>Laatste Nieuws (Het) 1 January 1910</ref>\n\n==Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia, 1846\u20131878==\n\n===Papal assistant===\n[[File:Leo entryperugia.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci enters [[Perugia]] in 1846]]\nIn 1843, Pecci had been named [[Assistant at the Pontifical Throne|papal assistant]]. From 1846 to 1877 he was considered a popular and successful [[Archbishop of Perugia|Archbishop-Bishop of Perugia]]. In 1847, after [[Pope Pius IX]] granted unlimited freedom for the press in the Papal States,<ref>K\u00fchne 62</ref> Pecci, who had been highly popular in the first years of his episcopate, became the object of attacks in the media and at his residence.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=66}} In 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary movements]] developed throughout Western Europe, including France, Germany and Italy. Austrian, French and Spanish troops reversed the revolutionary gains, but at a price for Pecci and the Catholic Church, who could not regain their former popularity.\n\n===Provincial council===\nPecci called a provincial council{{when|date=July 2017}} to reform the religious life in his dioceses. He invested in enlarging the seminary for future priests and in hiring new and prominent professors, preferably [[Thomist]]s. He called on his brother [[Giuseppe Pecci]], a noted Thomist scholar, to resign his professorship in Rome and teach in Perugia instead.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=76}} His own residence was next to the seminary, which facilitated his daily contacts with the students.\n\n===Charitable activities===\n[[File:Leopoor.jpg|thumb|Archbishop Pecci aids the poor in Perugia]]\nPecci developed several activities{{when|date=July 2017}} in support of [[Catholic charities]]. He founded [[homeless shelter]]s for boys, girls and elderly women. Throughout his dioceses he opened branches of a ''Bank, Monte di Piet\u00e0,'' which focused on low-income people and provided [[low-interest loan]]s.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=78}}  He created [[soup kitchen]]s, which were run by the Capuchins. In the consistory of 19 December 1853, he was elevated to the [[College of Cardinals]], as [[Cardinal-Priest]] of ''[[San Crisogono|S. Crisogono]]''.<ref name=Miranda /> In light of continuing earthquakes and floods, he donated all resources for festivities to the victims. Much of the public attention turned on the conflict between the [[Papal States]] and Italian nationalism, aiming at the papal states' annihilation to achieve the [[Unification of Italy]].\n\n===Defending the papacy===\nPecci defended the papacy and its claims. When Italian authorities expropriated convents and monasteries of Catholic orders, turning them into administration or military buildings, Pecci protested but acted moderately. When the Italian state took over Catholic schools, Pecci, fearing for his theological seminary, simply added all secular topics from other schools and opened the seminary to non-theologians.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=102}} The new government also levied taxes on the Church and issued legislation,{{when|date=July 2017}} according to which all Episcopal or papal utterances were to be approved by the government before their publication.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=105}}\n\n===Organizing the First Vatican Council===\nOn 8 December 1869, an [[Catholic Ecumenical Councils|ecumenical council]], which became known as the [[First Vatican Council]], was to take place in the Vatican per Pope Pius IX. Pecci was likely well informed, since the Pope named his brother Giuseppe to help prepare the event.\n\nDuring the 1870s in his last years in Perugia, Pecci addressed the role of the Church in modern society several times, defining the Church as ''the mother of material civilization'', because it upheld human dignity of working people, opposed the excesses of industrialization, and developed large scale charities for the needy.{{Sfn|K\u00fchne|1880|p=129}}\n\nIn August 1877, on the death of Cardinal [[Filippo de Angelis]], Pope Pius IX appointed him [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], which meant he had to reside in Rome.<ref name=Oreilly>[https://archive.org/stream/lifepopeleoxiii00ldgoog#page/n296/mode/2up O'Reilly, Bernard.

It was also debated that the conclave be moved elsewhere, but Pecci decided otherwise. On 18 February 1878 the conclave assembled in Rome. Cardinal Pecci was elected on the third ballot and chose the name Leo XIII.<ref name=Oreilly /> He was announced to the people and later crowned on 3 March 1878.\n\n(He retained administration of the Perugia see until 1880.)\n\n==Papacy, 1878\u20131903==\n{{Social teachings of the popes}}\n[[File:Vatican Observatory 1891.jpg|thumb|left|Silver medal celebrating the 1891 Pope Leo XIII's inauguration of the new observatory]]\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII 1898.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Photogram of the 1896 film ''Sua Santit\u00e1 papa Leone XIII'', the first time a Pope appeared on film.]]\n[[File:XIII.Leop\u00e1pa1.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Photograph of Leo XIII in his later years.]]\n\nAs soon as he was elected to the papacy, Leo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world.

Leo's intellectual and diplomatic skills helped regain much of the prestige lost with the fall of the Papal States. He tried to reconcile the Church with the working class, particularly by dealing with the social changes that were sweeping Europe. The new economic order had resulted in the growth of an impoverished working class who had increasing anti-clerical and socialist sympathies. Leo helped reverse this trend.\n\nWhile Leo XIII was no radical in either theology or politics, his papacy did move the Catholic Church back to the mainstream of European life. Considered a great diplomat, he managed to improve relations with Russia, Prussia, Germany, France, Britain and other countries.\n\nPope Leo XIII was able to reach several agreements in 1896 that resulted in better conditions for the faithful and additional appointments of bishops. During the [[Fifth cholera pandemic]] in 1891 he ordered the construction of a [[hospice]] inside the Vatican. That building would be torn down in 1996 to make way for construction of the [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/HolySee/Interregnum/domus.asp |title=Domus Sanctae Marthae & The New Urns Used in the Election of the Pope |publisher=EWTN |date=22 February 1996 |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nLeo was a drinker of the [[cocaine]]-infused wine tonic [[Vin Mariani]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Poison Pills: The Untold Story of the Vioxx Drug Scandal|last=Nesi|first=Thomas|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=9780312369590|edition=1st|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53 53]|oclc=227205792|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/poisonpillsuntol0000nesi/page/53}}</ref> He awarded a [[Vatican City|Vatican]] gold medal to the wine's creator, [[Angelo Mariani (chemist)|Angelo Mariani]] and also appeared on a poster endorsing it.<ref name=inciardi>{{cite book |last=Inciardi |first=James A. |title=The War on Drugs II |publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company |year=1992 |page=6 |isbn=978-1-55934-016-8}}</ref> Leo XIII was a [[Semi-vegetarianism|semi-vegetarian]].

The missionaries were sent to North and South America to do pastoral care for Italian immigrants.\n\n===Theology===\n{{Main|Theology of Pope Leo XIII}}\n[[File:GiuseppePecciLeoXIII.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[Giuseppe Pecci]] in 1872. At the urgent requests of the [[College of Cardinals]], Leo XIII in 1879 elevated his brother, Giuseppe Pecci, a [[Jesuit]] and prominent [[Thomist]] theologian, into their ranks.<ref>{{Citation |first=Benno |last=K\u00fchne |title=Unser Heiliger Vater Papst Leo XIII in seinem Leben und wirken |place=Benzinger |publisher=Einsiedeln |year=1880 |page=247}}.</ref>]]\n{{Further|List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\nThe pontificate of Leo XIII was theologically influenced by the [[First Vatican Council]] (1869\u20131870), which had ended only eight years earlier. Leo XIII issued some 46 [[apostolic letter]]s and [[encyclical]]s dealing with central issues in the areas of marriage and family and state and society. He also wrote two prayers for the [[intercession]] of [[Michael (archangel)|Michael the Archangel]] after allegedly having a vision of Michael and the [[end time]]s,<ref name=queen>{{cite web|url=http://www.thequeenofangels.com/the-angelic-host/archangel-michael/|title=Archangel Michael|publisher=}}</ref> although the story of the alleged vision may be merely [[apocryphal]], as historians note that the story does not appear in any writings of Pope Leo XIII.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.traditionalmass.org/images/articles/Russia-Leonine.pdf |title=Russia and the Leonine Prayers |last=Cekada |first=Rev. Anthony |date=1992 |website= |publisher=TraditionalMass.org |access-date=29 September 2017 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nLeo XIII also approved a number of Scapulars. In 1885 he approved the [[Scapular of the Holy Face]], (also known as ''The Veronica'') and elevated the ''Priests of the Holy Face'' to an archconfraternity.<ref>Henry Charles Lea, 2002, ''A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church'', Adamant Media Corp. {{ISBN|1-4021-6108-5}} page 506</ref> He also approved the Scapular of [[Our Lady of Good Counsel]] and the [[Scapular of St. Joseph]], both in 1893, and the [[Scapular of the Sacred Heart]] in 1900.<ref>Francis de Zulueta, 2008, ''Early Steps In The Fold'', Miller Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4086-6003-4}} page 317</ref>\n\n====Thomism====\nAs pope, he used all his authority for a revival of [[Thomism]], the theology of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. On 4 August 1879, Leo XIII promulgated the encyclical ''[[Aeterni Patris]]'' (\"Eternal Father\") which, more than any other single document, provided a charter for the revival of Thomism\u2014the medieval theological system based on the thought of Aquinas\u2014as the official philosophical and theological system of the Catholic Church. It was to be normative not only in the training of priests at church seminaries but also in the education of the laity at universities.\n\nFollowing this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] on 15 October 1879 and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called [[Leonine Edition]], of the complete works of the ''doctor angelicus''. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe '' the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].  Leo XIII also founded the ''Angelicum's'' Faculty of Philosophy in 1882 and its Faculty of [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]] in 1896.\n\n====Consecrations====\n[[File:Maria Droste zu Vischering.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Blessed [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]] was a nun from the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd]] who requested Pope Leo XIII to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.<ref>{{Citation |last=Chasle |first=Louis |title=Sister Mary of the Divine Heart, Droste zu Vischering, religious of the Good Shepherd, 1863\u20131899 |publisher=Burns & Oates |place=London |year=1906}}.</ref>]]\nPope Leo XIII performed a number of consecrations, at times entering new theological territory. After he received many letters from [[Mary of the Divine Heart|Sister Mary of the Divine Heart]], the countess of [[Droste zu Vischering]] and [[wikt:Special:Search/mother superior|Mother Superior]] in the Convent of the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd|Good Shepherd Sisters]] in [[Porto]], Portugal, asking him to consecrate the entire world to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, he commissioned a group of theologians to examine the petition on the basis of revelation and sacred tradition. The outcome of this investigation was positive, and so in the encyclical letter ''[[Annum sacrum]]'' (on 25 May 1899) he decreed that the consecration of the entire human race to the Sacred Heart of Jesus should take place on 11 June 1899.\n\nThe encyclical letter also encouraged the entire Catholic episcopate to promote the [[First Friday Devotions]], established June as the Month of the Sacred Heart, and included the [[Prayer of Consecration to the Sacred Heart]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Ann |last=Ball |year=2003 |title=Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices |isbn=978-0-87973-910-2 |page=166}}.</ref> His consecration of the entire world to the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] presented theological challenges in consecrating non-Christians. Since about 1850, various congregations and States had consecrated themselves to the Sacred Heart, and, in 1875, this consecration was made throughout the Catholic world.\n\n====Scriptures====\nIn his 1893 encyclical ''[[Providentissimus Deus]],'' he described the importance of scriptures for theological study. It was an important encyclical for Catholic theology and its relation to the Bible, as Pope Pius XII pointed out fifty years later in his encyclical ''Divino Afflante Spiritu''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Divino Afflante Spiritu |at=1\u201312}}.</ref>\n\n====Relations with Eastern Orthodox Churches====\nPope Leo XIII fostered relations of goodwill, particularly towards the churches of the East, who were not in communion with the Apostolic See. He also opposed efforts to Latinize the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] Churches, stating that they constitute a most valuable ancient tradition and symbol of the divine unity of the Catholic Church. He expressed this in his encyclical \"Orientalium Dignitas\" of 1894, writing, \"The Churches of the East are worthy of the glory and reverence that they hold throughout the whole of Christendom in virtue of those extremely ancient, singular memorials that they have bequeathed to us.\"\n\n====Theological research====\n[[File:Newmanhenry.jpg|thumb|145px|left|[[John Henry Newman]] was raised into the College of Cardinals by Pope Leo XIII.]]\nLeo XIII is credited with great efforts in the areas of scientific and historical analysis. He opened the [[Vatican Archive]]s and personally fostered a twenty-volume comprehensive scientific study of the Papacy by [[Ludwig von Pastor]], an Austrian historian.<ref>{{Citation |first=Ludwig |last=von Pastor |title=Errinnerungen |year=1950 |language=German}}.</ref>\n\n====Mariology====\n{{Main|Mariology of Pope Leo XIII}}\nHis predecessor, [[Pope Pius IX]], became known as the Pope of the [[Immaculate Conception]] because of the dogmatization in 1854. Leo XIII, in light of his unprecedented promulgation of the [[rosary]] in eleven encyclicals, was called the [[Rosary Pope]]. In eleven encyclicals on the rosary he promulgates Marian devotion. In his encyclical on the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, he stresses her role in the redemption of humanity, mentioning Mary as [[Mediatrix]] and [[Co-Redemptrix]].\n\n====Social teachings====\n{{Main|List of encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII}}\n\n=====Church and state=====\nLeo XIII worked to encourage understanding between the Church and the modern world, though he preferred a cautious view on freedom of thought, stating that it \"is quite unlawful to demand, defend, or to grant unconditional freedom of thought, or speech, of writing or worship, as if these were so many rights given by nature to man\". Leo's social teachings are based on the Catholic premise that God is the Creator of the world and its Ruler. Eternal law commands the natural order to be maintained, and forbids that it be disturbed; men's destiny is far above human things and beyond the earth.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=====''Rerum novarum''=====\n[[File:Papst Leo XIII.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Portrait by [[Philip de L\u00e1szl\u00f3]], 1900]]\nHis encyclicals changed the Church's relations with temporal authorities, and, in the 1891 encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]],'' for the first time addressed social inequality and social justice issues with Papal authority, focusing on the rights and duties of capital and labour. He was greatly influenced by [[Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler]], a German bishop who openly propagated siding with the suffering working classes in his book ''Die Arbeiterfrage und das Christentum''. Since Leo XIII, Papal teachings have expanded on the rights and obligations of workers and the limitations of private property: [[Pope Pius XI]] [[Quadragesimo anno]], the [[Social teachings of Pope Pius XII]] on a huge range of social issues, [[John XXIII]] [[Mater et magistra]] in 1961, [[Pope Paul VI]], the encyclical ''[[Populorum progressio]]'' on world development issues, and [[Pope John Paul II]], ''[[Centesimus annus]]'', commemorating the 100th anniversary of ''Rerum novarum''. Leo XIII had argued that both capitalism and communism are flawed. ''Rerum novarum'' introduced the idea of [[subsidiarity (Catholicism)|subsidiarity]], the principle that political and social decisions should be taken at a local level, if possible, rather than by a central authority, into Catholic social thought.  A list of all of Leo's encyclicals can be found in the [[List of Encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII]].\n\n===Canonizations and beatifications===\nLeo XIII canonized the following saints during his pontificate:\n* 8 December 1881: [[Clare of Montefalco]] (d. 1308), [[John Baptist de Rossi]] (1696\u20131764), [[Lawrence of Brindisi]] (d. 1619), and [[Benedict Joseph Labre]] (1748\u201383)\n* 15 January 1888: Seven Holy Founders of the [[Servite Order]], [[Peter Claver]] (1581\u20131654), [[John Berchmans]] (1599\u20131621), and [[Alphonsus Rodriguez]] (1531\u20131617)\n* 27 May 1897: [[Anthony Maria Zaccaria|Antonio Maria Zaccaria]] (1502\u201339) and [[Peter Fourier]] (1565\u20131640)\n* 24 May 1900: [[John Baptist de la Salle]] (1651\u20131719) and [[Rita of Cascia]] (1381\u20131457)\n\nLeo XIII also beatified several of his predecessors: [[Urban II]] (14 July 1881), [[Victor III]] (23 July 1887) and [[Innocent V]] (9 March 1898). He also canonized [[Adrian III]] on 2 June 1891.\n\nHe also beatified the following.\n* [[Charles of Sezze|Giancarlo Melchiori]] on 22 January 1882\n* [[Edmund Campion]] and [[Ralph Sherwin]] in 1886\n* [[John Haile]] on 29 December 1886\n* John Baptist de la Salle (whom he later canonized) on 19 February 1888\n* [[In\u00e9s de Benig\u00e1nim|In\u00e9s of Benig\u00e1nim]] on 26 February 1888\n* Antonio Maria Zaccaria (whom he later canonized) on 3 January 1890\n* [[Giovanni Giovenale Ancina]] on 9 February 1890\n* [[Pompilio Maria Pirrotti]] on 26 January 1890\n* [[Gerard Majella]] on 29 January 1893\n* [[Leopoldo da Gaiche|Leopoldo Croci]] on 12 May 1893\n* [[Antonio Baldinucci]] on 16 April 1893\n* Rodolfo Acquaviva and 4 Companions on 30 April 1893\n* [[Diego Jos\u00e9 de C\u00e1diz|Diego Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez-Caama\u00f1o]] on 22 April 1894\n* [[Bernardino Realino]] on 12 January 1896\n* [[Maria Maddalena Martinengo]] on 3 June 1900\n* D\u00e9nis Berthelot of the Nativity and Redento Rodr\u00edguez of the Cross on 10 June 1900\n* [[Jeanne de Lestonnac]] on 23 September 1900\n* [[Antonio Grassi]] on 30 September 1900\n\nHe also approved the cult of [[Cosmas of Aphrodisia]]. He also beatified several of the English martyrs in 1895.<ref>{{cite web|newspaper=Catholic Online |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=2748 |title=St. Cosmas&nbsp;\u2014 Saints & Angels |accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Doctors of the Church====\nLeo XIII named four individuals as [[Doctors of the Church]]:\n* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (1883)\n* [[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (1883)\n* [[John of Damascus]] (1890)\n* [[Bede|Bede the Venerable]] (13 November 1899)\n\n===Audiences===\n[[File:Pacelliordenado.jpg|thumb|165px|left|In 1901, Pope Leo XIII welcomed Eugenio Pacelli, later [[Pope Pius XII]], on his first day of fifty-seven years of service in the Vatican (1901\u20131958).]]\nOne of the first audiences Leo XIII granted was to the professors and students of the [[Collegio Capranica]], where in the first row knelt in front of him a young seminarian, [[Giacomo Della Chiesa]], the future [[Pope Benedict XV]], who would reign from 1914 to 1922.\n\nWhile on a pilgrimage with her father and sister in 1887, the future [[Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux]] attended a general audience with Pope Leo XIII and asked him to allow her to enter the [[Carmelite order]]. Even though she was strictly forbidden to speak to him because she was told it would prolong the audience too much, in her autobiography, ''Story of a Soul'', she wrote that after she kissed his slipper and he presented his hand, instead of kissing it, she took it in her own hand and said through tears, \"Most Holy Father, I have a great favor to ask you.  In honor of your Jubilee, permit me to enter Carmel at the age of 15!\"  Leo XIII answered, \"Well, my child, do what the superiors decide.\" Th\u00e9r\u00e8se replied, \"Oh! Holy Father, if you say yes, everybody will agree!\" Finally, the Pope said, \"Go... go... ''You will enter if God wills it''\" [italics hers] after which time two guards lifted Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (still on her knees in front of the Pope) by her arms and carried her to the door where a third gave her a medal of the Pope. Shortly thereafter, the [[Bishop of Bayeux]] authorized the prioress to receive Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, and in April 1888, she entered Carmel at the age of 15.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:TOMB LEO xiii.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The monument and tomb to Leo XIII in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran.]]\nLeo XIII was the first pope to be born in the 19th century and was also the first to die in the 20th century: he lived to the age of 93, dying on 20 July 1903,<ref>John-Peter Pham, ''Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession'', (Oxford University Press, 2004), 98.</ref> the longest-lived pope ever ({{as of|2020|lc=y}}).
