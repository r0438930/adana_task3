Examples are {{IPA|[p]}}, pronounced with the lips; {{IPA|[t]}}, pronounced with the front of the tongue; {{IPA|[k]}}, pronounced with the back of the tongue; {{IPA|[h]}}, pronounced in the throat; {{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|[s]}}, pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel ([[fricative]]s); and {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}, which have air flowing through the nose ([[nasal consonant|nasal]]s). Contrasting with consonants are [[vowel]]s.\n\nSince the number of possible sounds in all of the world's languages is much greater than the number of letters in any one [[alphabet]], [[Linguistics|linguists]] have devised systems such as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) to assign a unique and unambiguous [[symbol]] to each attested consonant. In fact, the [[English alphabet]] has fewer consonant letters than English has consonant sounds, so [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s like \"ch\", \"sh\", \"th\", and \"zh\" are used to extend the alphabet, and some letters and digraphs represent more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled \"th\" in \"this\" is a different consonant from the \"th\" sound in \"thin\". (In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], they are transcribed {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} and {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}, respectively.)\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''consonant'' comes from [[Latin]] oblique stem ''c\u014dnsonant-,'' from ''c\u014dnson\u0101ns (littera)'' \"sounding-together (letter)\", a [[calque]] of Greek \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ''s\u00fdmph\u014dnon'' (plural ''s\u00fdmph\u014dna'').<ref>{{LSJ|su/mfwnos|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2|ref}}</ref><ref>Robert K.

The 21 consonant letters in the English alphabet are [[B]], [[C]], [[D]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[M]], [[N]], [[P]], [[Q]], [[R]], [[S]], [[T]], [[V]], [[X]], [[Z]], and usually [[W]] and [[Y]]. The letter Y stands for the consonant {{IPA|/j/}} in ''yoke'', the vowel {{IPA|/\u026a/}} in ''myth'', the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} in ''funny'', and the diphthong {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} in ''my''. W always represents a consonant except in combination with a vowel letter, as in ''growth'', ''raw'', and ''how'', and in a few [[loanword]]s from [[Welsh language|Welsh]], like ''crwth'' or ''cwm''.\n\nIn some other languages, such as Finnish, ''y'' only represents a vowel sound.\n\nThe consonant and the alphabet r not quite the same. This is because people say that y can be a vowel when it\u2019s a constant.\n\n==Consonants versus vowels==\nConsonants and vowels correspond to distinct parts of a [[syllable]]: The most sonorous part of the syllable (that is, the part that's easiest to sing), called the ''syllabic peak'' or ''[[syllable nucleus|nucleus]],'' is typically a vowel, while the less sonorous margins (called the ''[[syllable onset|onset]]'' and ''[[syllable coda|coda]]'') are typically consonants. Such syllables may be abbreviated CV, V, and CVC, where C stands for consonant and V stands for vowel. This can be argued to be the only pattern found in most of the world's languages, and perhaps the primary pattern in all of them. However, the distinction between consonant and vowel is not always clear cut: there are syllabic consonants and non-syllabic vowels in many of the world's languages.\n\nOne blurry area is in segments variously called ''[[semivowel]]s'', ''semiconsonants'', or ''glides''. On one side, there are vowel-like segments that are not in themselves syllabic, but form [[diphthong]]s as part of the syllable nucleus, as the ''i'' in English ''boil'' {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0254\u026a\u032fl]}}. On the other, there are [[approximant]]s that behave like consonants in forming onsets, but are articulated very much like vowels, as the ''y'' in English ''yes'' {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025bs]}}. Some phonologists model these as both being the underlying vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, so that the English word ''bit'' would [[phoneme|phonemically]] be {{IPA|/bit/}}, ''beet'' would be {{IPA|/bii\u032ft/}}, and ''yield'' would be phonemically {{IPA|/i\u032fii\u032fld/}}. Likewise, ''foot'' would be {{IPA|/fut/}}, ''food'' would be {{IPA|/fuu\u032fd/}}, ''wood'' would be {{IPA|/u\u032fud/}}, and ''wooed'' would be {{IPA|/u\u032fuu\u032fd/}}. However, there is a (perhaps allophonic) difference in articulation between these segments, with the {{IPA|[j]}} in {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025bs]}} ''yes'' and {{IPA|[\u02c8ji\u02b2ld]}} ''yield'' and the {{IPA|[w]}} of {{IPA|[\u02c8wu\u02b7d]}} ''wooed'' having more constriction and a more definite place of articulation than the {{IPA|[\u026a]}} in {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0254\u026a\u032fl]}} ''boil'' or {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u026at]}} ''bit'' or the {{IPA|[\u028a]}} of {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028at]}} ''foot''.\n\nThe other problematic area is that of syllabic consonants, segments articulated as consonants but occupying the nucleus of a syllable. This may be the case for words such as ''church'' in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] dialects of English, although phoneticians differ in whether they consider this to be a syllabic consonant, {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u0279\u0329t\u0283/}}, or a rhotic vowel, {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025dt\u0283/}}: Some distinguish an approximant {{IPA|/\u0279/}} that corresponds to a vowel {{IPA|/\u025d/}}, for ''rural'' as {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0279\u025dl/}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u02b7\u025d\u02d0l\u0329]}}; others see these as a single phoneme, {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0279\u0279\u0329l/}}.\n\nOther languages use fricative and often trilled segments as syllabic nuclei, as in [[Czech language|Czech]] and several languages in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[China]], including [[Mandarin Chinese]]. In Mandarin, they are historically allophones of {{IPA|/i/}}, and spelled that way in [[Pinyin]]. Ladefoged and Maddieson<ref name=SOWL>{{SOWL}}</ref>{{page missing|date=August 2018}} call these \"fricative vowels\" and say that \"they can usually be thought of as syllabic fricatives that are allophones of vowels\". That is, phonetically they are consonants, but phonemically they behave as vowels.\n\nMany [[Slavic languages]] allow the trill {{IPA|[r\u0329]}} and the lateral {{IPA|[l\u0329]}} as syllabic nuclei (see [[Words without vowels]]). In languages like [[Nux\u00e1lk language|Nuxalk]], it is difficult to know what the nucleus of a syllable is, or if all syllables even have nuclei. If the concept of 'syllable' applies in Nuxalk, there are syllabic consonants in words like {{IPA|/sx\u0329s/}} ({{IPA|/s\u0329xs\u0329/}}?) 'seal fat'. [[Miyako language|Miyako]] in Japan is similar, with {{IPA|/f\u0329ks\u0329/}} 'to build' and {{IPA|/ps\u0329ks\u0329/}} 'to pull'.\n\n==Features==\n{{Unreferenced section|date = August 2013}}{{Manner of articulation}}\nEach spoken consonant can be distinguished by several phonetic ''[[Distinctive feature|features]]'':\n* The [[manner of articulation]] is how air escapes from the vocal tract when the consonant or [[approximant]] (vowel-like) sound is made. Manners include stops, fricatives, and nasals.\n* The [[place of articulation]] is where in the vocal tract the obstruction of the consonant occurs, and which speech organs are involved. Places include [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] (both lips), [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (tongue against the gum ridge), and [[velar consonant|velar]] (tongue against soft palate). In addition, there may be a simultaneous narrowing at another place of articulation, such as [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] or [[pharyngealisation]]. Consonants with two simultaneous places of articulation are said to be [[Co-articulated consonant| coarticulated]].\n* The [[phonation]] of a consonant is how the [[vocal cords]] vibrate during the articulation. When the vocal cords vibrate fully, the consonant is called [[voiced]]; when they do not vibrate at all, it is [[voiceless]].\n* The [[voice onset time]] (VOT) indicates the timing of the phonation. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] is a feature of VOT. \n* The [[airstream mechanism]] is how the air moving through the vocal tract is powered. Most languages have exclusively [[pulmonic egressive]] consonants, which use the lungs and diaphragm, but [[ejective]]s, [[click consonant|click]]s, and [[implosive]]s use different mechanisms. \n* The [[gemination|length]] is how long the obstruction of a consonant lasts. This feature is borderline distinctive in English, as in \"wholly\" {{IPA|[ho\u028alli]}} vs. \"holy\" {{IPA|[ho\u028ali]}}, but cases are limited to morpheme boundaries. Unrelated roots are differentiated in various languages such as Italian, Japanese, and Finnish, with two length levels, \"single\" and \"[[geminate]]\". [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and some [[Sami languages]] have three phonemic lengths: short, geminate, and long geminate, although the distinction between the geminate and overlong geminate includes suprasegmental features.\n* The articulatory force is how much muscular energy is involved. This has been proposed many times, but no distinction relying exclusively on force has ever been demonstrated.\n\nAll English consonants can be classified by a combination of these features, such as \"voiceless alveolar stop\" {{IPA|[t]}}. In this case, the airstream mechanism is omitted.\n\nSome pairs of consonants like ''p::b'', ''t::d'' are sometimes called [[fortis and lenis]], but this is a [[phonology|phonological]] rather than phonetic distinction.\n\nConsonants are scheduled by their features in a number of IPA charts:\n{{IPA pulmonic consonants}}\n{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|notes=no}}\n{{IPA co-articulated consonants}}\n\n==Examples==\nThe recently extinct [[Ubykh language]] had only 2 or 3 vowels but 84 consonants;<ref>Georges Dum\u00e9zil and Tevfik Esen\u00e7, 1975, ''Le verbe oubykh: \u00e9tudes descriptives et comparatives''. Adrien Maisonneuve: Paris.</ref> the [[Taa language]] has 87 consonants under [[consonant cluster|one analysis]], 164 under [[linguo-pulmonic|another]], plus some 30 vowels and tone.<ref>Naumann, Christfied (2008). \"The Consonantal System of West !Xoon\". ''3rd International Symposium on Khoisan Languages and Linguistics''. Riezlern.</ref> The types of consonants used in various languages are by no means universal. For instance, nearly all [[Australian languages]] lack fricatives; a large percentage of the world's languages lack voiced stops as phonemes, such as {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}. Most languages, however, do include one or more fricatives, with {{IPA|[s]}} being the most common, and a [[liquid consonant]] or two, with {{IPA|[l]}} the most common. The approximant {{IPA|[w]}} is also widespread, and virtually all languages have one or more [[nasal consonant|nasals]], though a very few, such as the Central dialect of [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], lack even these. This last language has the smallest number of consonants in the world, with just six.\n\n===Most common===\nThe most common consonants around the world are the three voiceless stops {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[k]}}, and the two nasals {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}. However, even these common five are not universal. Several languages in the vicinity of the [[Sahara Desert]], including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], lack {{IPA|[p]}}. Several languages of North America, such as [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], lack both of the labials {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[m]}}. The [[Wichita language]] of [[Oklahoma]] and some West African languages, such as [[Ijo languages|Ijo]], lack the consonant {{IPA|/n/}} on a phonemic level, but do use it as an [[allophone]] of another consonant (of {{IPA|/l/}} in the case of Ijo, and of {{IPA|/\u027e/}} in Wichita). A few languages on [[Bougainville Island]] and around [[Puget Sound]], such as [[Makah language|Makah]], lack both of the nasals {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. The 'click language' [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c1ng]] lacks {{IPA|[t]}},{{efn|N\u01c0u has a {{IPA|[ts]}} instead. [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to lack a {{IPA|[t]}}, but it actually has a consonant that varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}.}} and colloquial [[Samoan language|Samoan]] lacks both alveolars, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}.{{efn|Samoan words written with the letters ''t'' and ''n'' are pronounced with {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} except in formal speech.

Examples are {{IPA|[p]}}, pronounced with the lips; {{IPA|[t]}}, pronounced with the front of the tongue; {{IPA|[k]}}, pronounced with the back of the tongue; {{IPA|[h]}}, pronounced in the throat; {{IPA|[f]}} and {{IPA|[s]}}, pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel ([[fricative]]s); and {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}, which have air flowing through the nose ([[nasal consonant|nasal]]s). Contrasting with consonants are [[vowel]]s.\n\nSince the number of possible sounds in all of the world's languages is much greater than the number of letters in any one [[alphabet]], [[Linguistics|linguists]] have devised systems such as the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) to assign a unique and unambiguous [[symbol]] to each attested consonant. In fact, the [[English alphabet]] has fewer consonant letters than English has consonant sounds, so [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s like \"ch\", \"sh\", \"th\", and \"zh\" are used to extend the alphabet, and some letters and digraphs represent more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled \"th\" in \"this\" is a different consonant from the \"th\" sound in \"thin\". (In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], they are transcribed {{IPA|[\u00f0]}} and {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}, respectively.)\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''consonant'' comes from [[Latin]] oblique stem ''c\u014dnsonant-,'' from ''c\u014dnson\u0101ns (littera)'' \"sounding-together (letter)\", a [[calque]] of Greek \u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd ''s\u00fdmph\u014dnon'' (plural ''s\u00fdmph\u014dna'').<ref>{{LSJ|su/mfwnos|\u03c3\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2|ref}}</ref><ref>Robert K.

The 21 consonant letters in the English alphabet are [[B]], [[C]], [[D]], [[F]], [[G]], [[H]], [[J]], [[K]], [[L]], [[M]], [[N]], [[P]], [[Q]], [[R]], [[S]], [[T]], [[V]], [[X]], [[Z]], and usually [[W]] and [[Y]]. The letter Y stands for the consonant {{IPA|/j/}} in ''yoke'', the vowel {{IPA|/\u026a/}} in ''myth'', the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} in ''funny'', and the diphthong {{IPA|/a\u026a/}} in ''my''. W always represents a consonant except in combination with a vowel letter, as in ''growth'', ''raw'', and ''how'', and in a few [[loanword]]s from [[Welsh language|Welsh]], like ''crwth'' or ''cwm''.\n\nIn some other languages, such as Finnish, ''y'' only represents a vowel sound.\n\n==Consonants versus vowels==\nConsonants and vowels correspond to distinct parts of a [[syllable]]: The most sonorous part of the syllable (that is, the part that's easiest to sing), called the ''syllabic peak'' or ''[[syllable nucleus|nucleus]],'' is typically a vowel, while the less sonorous margins (called the ''[[syllable onset|onset]]'' and ''[[syllable coda|coda]]'') are typically consonants. Such syllables may be abbreviated CV, V, and CVC, where C stands for consonant and V stands for vowel. This can be argued to be the only pattern found in most of the world's languages, and perhaps the primary pattern in all of them. However, the distinction between consonant and vowel is not always clear cut: there are syllabic consonants and non-syllabic vowels in many of the world's languages.\n\nOne blurry area is in segments variously called ''[[semivowel]]s'', ''semiconsonants'', or ''glides''. On one side, there are vowel-like segments that are not in themselves syllabic, but form [[diphthong]]s as part of the syllable nucleus, as the ''i'' in English ''boil'' {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0254\u026a\u032fl]}}. On the other, there are [[approximant]]s that behave like consonants in forming onsets, but are articulated very much like vowels, as the ''y'' in English ''yes'' {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025bs]}}. Some phonologists model these as both being the underlying vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, so that the English word ''bit'' would [[phoneme|phonemically]] be {{IPA|/bit/}}, ''beet'' would be {{IPA|/bii\u032ft/}}, and ''yield'' would be phonemically {{IPA|/i\u032fii\u032fld/}}. Likewise, ''foot'' would be {{IPA|/fut/}}, ''food'' would be {{IPA|/fuu\u032fd/}}, ''wood'' would be {{IPA|/u\u032fud/}}, and ''wooed'' would be {{IPA|/u\u032fuu\u032fd/}}. However, there is a (perhaps allophonic) difference in articulation between these segments, with the {{IPA|[j]}} in {{IPA|[\u02c8j\u025bs]}} ''yes'' and {{IPA|[\u02c8ji\u02b2ld]}} ''yield'' and the {{IPA|[w]}} of {{IPA|[\u02c8wu\u02b7d]}} ''wooed'' having more constriction and a more definite place of articulation than the {{IPA|[\u026a]}} in {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u0254\u026a\u032fl]}} ''boil'' or {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u026at]}} ''bit'' or the {{IPA|[\u028a]}} of {{IPA|[\u02c8f\u028at]}} ''foot''.\n\nThe other problematic area is that of syllabic consonants, segments articulated as consonants but occupying the nucleus of a syllable. This may be the case for words such as ''church'' in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] dialects of English, although phoneticians differ in whether they consider this to be a syllabic consonant, {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u0279\u0329t\u0283/}}, or a rhotic vowel, {{IPA|/\u02c8t\u0283\u025dt\u0283/}}: Some distinguish an approximant {{IPA|/\u0279/}} that corresponds to a vowel {{IPA|/\u025d/}}, for ''rural'' as {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0279\u025dl/}} or {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0279\u02b7\u025d\u02d0l\u0329]}}; others see these as a single phoneme, {{IPA|/\u02c8\u0279\u0279\u0329l/}}.\n\nOther languages use fricative and often trilled segments as syllabic nuclei, as in [[Czech language|Czech]] and several languages in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and [[China]], including [[Mandarin Chinese]]. In Mandarin, they are historically allophones of {{IPA|/i/}}, and spelled that way in [[Pinyin]]. Ladefoged and Maddieson<ref name=SOWL>{{SOWL}}</ref>{{page missing|date=August 2018}} call these \"fricative vowels\" and say that \"they can usually be thought of as syllabic fricatives that are allophones of vowels\". That is, phonetically they are consonants, but phonemically they behave as vowels.\n\nMany [[Slavic languages]] allow the trill {{IPA|[r\u0329]}} and the lateral {{IPA|[l\u0329]}} as syllabic nuclei (see [[Words without vowels]]). In languages like [[Nux\u00e1lk language|Nuxalk]], it is difficult to know what the nucleus of a syllable is, or if all syllables even have nuclei. If the concept of 'syllable' applies in Nuxalk, there are syllabic consonants in words like {{IPA|/sx\u0329s/}} ({{IPA|/s\u0329xs\u0329/}}?) 'seal fat'. [[Miyako language|Miyako]] in Japan is similar, with {{IPA|/f\u0329ks\u0329/}} 'to build' and {{IPA|/ps\u0329ks\u0329/}} 'to pull'.\n\n==Features==\n{{Unreferenced section|date = August 2013}}{{Manner of articulation}}\nEach spoken consonant can be distinguished by several phonetic ''[[Distinctive feature|features]]'':\n* The [[manner of articulation]] is how air escapes from the vocal tract when the consonant or [[approximant]] (vowel-like) sound is made. Manners include stops, fricatives, and nasals.\n* The [[place of articulation]] is where in the vocal tract the obstruction of the consonant occurs, and which speech organs are involved. Places include [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] (both lips), [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (tongue against the gum ridge), and [[velar consonant|velar]] (tongue against soft palate). In addition, there may be a simultaneous narrowing at another place of articulation, such as [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalisation]] or [[pharyngealisation]]. Consonants with two simultaneous places of articulation are said to be [[Co-articulated consonant| coarticulated]].\n* The [[phonation]] of a consonant is how the [[vocal cords]] vibrate during the articulation. When the vocal cords vibrate fully, the consonant is called [[voiced]]; when they do not vibrate at all, it is [[voiceless]].\n* The [[voice onset time]] (VOT) indicates the timing of the phonation. [[Aspiration (phonetics)|Aspiration]] is a feature of VOT. \n* The [[airstream mechanism]] is how the air moving through the vocal tract is powered. Most languages have exclusively [[pulmonic egressive]] consonants, which use the lungs and diaphragm, but [[ejective]]s, [[click consonant|click]]s, and [[implosive]]s use different mechanisms. \n* The [[gemination|length]] is how long the obstruction of a consonant lasts. This feature is borderline distinctive in English, as in \"wholly\" {{IPA|[ho\u028alli]}} vs. \"holy\" {{IPA|[ho\u028ali]}}, but cases are limited to morpheme boundaries. Unrelated roots are differentiated in various languages such as Italian, Japanese, and Finnish, with two length levels, \"single\" and \"[[geminate]]\". [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and some [[Sami languages]] have three phonemic lengths: short, geminate, and long geminate, although the distinction between the geminate and overlong geminate includes suprasegmental features.\n* The articulatory force is how much muscular energy is involved. This has been proposed many times, but no distinction relying exclusively on force has ever been demonstrated.\n\nAll English consonants can be classified by a combination of these features, such as \"voiceless alveolar stop\" {{IPA|[t]}}. In this case, the airstream mechanism is omitted.\n\nSome pairs of consonants like ''p::b'', ''t::d'' are sometimes called [[fortis and lenis]], but this is a [[phonology|phonological]] rather than phonetic distinction.\n\nConsonants are scheduled by their features in a number of IPA charts:\n{{IPA pulmonic consonants}}\n{{IPA non-pulmonic consonants|notes=no}}\n{{IPA co-articulated consonants}}\n\n==Examples==\nThe recently extinct [[Ubykh language]] had only 2 or 3 vowels but 84 consonants;<ref>Georges Dum\u00e9zil and Tevfik Esen\u00e7, 1975, ''Le verbe oubykh: \u00e9tudes descriptives et comparatives''. Adrien Maisonneuve: Paris.</ref> the [[Taa language]] has 87 consonants under [[consonant cluster|one analysis]], 164 under [[linguo-pulmonic|another]], plus some 30 vowels and tone.<ref>Naumann, Christfied (2008). \"The Consonantal System of West !Xoon\". ''3rd International Symposium on Khoisan Languages and Linguistics''. Riezlern.</ref> The types of consonants used in various languages are by no means universal. For instance, nearly all [[Australian languages]] lack fricatives; a large percentage of the world's languages lack voiced stops as phonemes, such as {{IPA|[b]}}, {{IPA|[d]}}, and {{IPA|[\u0261]}}. Most languages, however, do include one or more fricatives, with {{IPA|[s]}} being the most common, and a [[liquid consonant]] or two, with {{IPA|[l]}} the most common. The approximant {{IPA|[w]}} is also widespread, and virtually all languages have one or more [[nasal consonant|nasals]], though a very few, such as the Central dialect of [[Rotokas language|Rotokas]], lack even these. This last language has the smallest number of consonants in the world, with just six.\n\n===Most common===\nThe most common consonants around the world are the three voiceless stops {{IPA|[p]}}, {{IPA|[t]}}, {{IPA|[k]}}, and the two nasals {{IPA|[m]}}, {{IPA|[n]}}. However, even these common five are not universal. Several languages in the vicinity of the [[Sahara Desert]], including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], lack {{IPA|[p]}}. Several languages of North America, such as [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], lack both of the labials {{IPA|[p]}} and {{IPA|[m]}}. The [[Wichita language]] of [[Oklahoma]] and some West African languages, such as [[Ijo languages|Ijo]], lack the consonant {{IPA|/n/}} on a phonemic level, but do use it as an [[allophone]] of another consonant (of {{IPA|/l/}} in the case of Ijo, and of {{IPA|/\u027e/}} in Wichita). A few languages on [[Bougainville Island]] and around [[Puget Sound]], such as [[Makah language|Makah]], lack both of the nasals {{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}. The 'click language' [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c1ng]] lacks {{IPA|[t]}},{{efn|N\u01c0u has a {{IPA|[ts]}} instead. [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to lack a {{IPA|[t]}}, but it actually has a consonant that varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}.}} and colloquial [[Samoan language|Samoan]] lacks both alveolars, {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[n]}}.{{efn|Samoan words written with the letters ''t'' and ''n'' are pronounced with {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} except in formal speech. However, Samoan does have an alveolar consonant, {{IPA|[l]}}.}} Despite the 80-odd consonants of [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]], it lacks the plain velar {{IPA|/k/}} in native words, as do the related [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] and [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] languages. But with a few striking exceptions, such as [[Xavante language|Xavante]] and [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]]\u2014which have no dorsal consonants whatsoever\u2014nearly all other languages have at least one velar consonant: the few languages that do not have a simple {{IPA|[k]}} usually have a consonant that is very similar.{{efn|The Ni\u02bbihau\u2013Kaua\u02bbi dialect of [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] is often said to have no {{IPA|[k]}}, but as in other dialects of Hawaiian it has a consonant that varies between {{IPA|[t]}} and {{IPA|[k]}}, with {{IPA|[t]}} before {{IPA|[i]}} but {{IPA|[k]}} at the beginnings of words, though they are often in [[free variation]].}} For instance, an areal feature of the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast is that historical *{{IPA|[k]}} has become palatalized in many languages, so that [[Saanich language|Saanich]] for example has {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} and {{IPA|[k\u02b7]}} but no plain {{IPA|[k]}};<ref>Ian Maddieson and Sandra Ferrari Disner, 1984, ''Patterns of Sounds.''
