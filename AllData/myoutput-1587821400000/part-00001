The season also suffered 4 fatalities; 2 died in [[New South Wales]], 1 in [[Western Australia]] and 1 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. One death was as a direct result of fire, 2 died due to unrelated health complications while fighting fires on their property, and a pilot contracted by the [[NSW Rural Fire Service]] died during an accident.\n\n== Climate summary and predictions ==\n\nThe season was predicted to have above average fire potential for most [[Australian state|states]] including portions of the north west of [[Western Australia]], the north west of the [[Northern Territory]] and large areas of central [[Queensland]] following below average rainfall and above average temperatures in these areas in the months leading up to the fire season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bushfirecrc.com/resources/firenote/northern-australia-seasonal-bushfire-outlook-2013|title=Northern Australian seasonal bushfire

The season also suffered 4 fatalities; 2 died in [[New South Wales]], 1 in [[Western Australia]] and 1 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. One death was as a direct result of fire, 2 died due to unrelated health complications while fighting fires on their property, and a pilot contracted by the [[NSW Rural Fire Service]] died during an accident.\n\n== Climate summary and predictions ==\n\nThe season was predicted to have above average fire potential for most [[Australian state|states]] including portions of the north west of [[Western Australia]], the north west of the [[Northern Territory]] and large areas of central [[Queensland]] following below average rainfall and above average temperatures in these areas in the months leading up to the fire season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bushfirecrc.com/resources/firenote/northern-australia-seasonal-bushfire-outlook-2013|title=Northern Australian seasonal bushfire
