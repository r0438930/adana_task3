[[Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867|Section 91 (clause 24) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'']] gives the federal government (as opposed to the provinces) the sole responsibility for \"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\". The government inherited treaty obligations from the British colonial authorities in Eastern Canada and signed treaties itself with First Nations in Western Canada (the [[Numbered Treaties]]). It also passed the ''[[Indian Act]]'' in 1876 which governed its interactions with all treaty and non-treaty peoples. Members of First Nations bands that are subject to the ''Indian Act'' with the Crown are compiled on a list called the [[Indian Register]], and such people are called ''Status Indians''. Many non-treaty First Nations and all Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples are not subject to the ''Indian Act''. However, two court cases have clarified that Inuit, M\u00e9tis, and non-status First Nations people, all are covered by the term \"Indians\" in the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. The first was ''[[Bianca (Pok\u00e9mon)|Bianca]]'' in 1939 covering the Inuit, the second being ''[[Daniels v.

[[Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867|Section 91 (clause 24) of the ''Constitution Act, 1867'']] gives the federal government (as opposed to the provinces) the sole responsibility for \"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\". The government inherited treaty obligations from the British colonial authorities in Eastern Canada and signed treaties itself with First Nations in Western Canada (the [[Numbered Treaties]]). It also passed the ''[[Indian Act]]'' in 1876 which governed its interactions with all treaty and non-treaty peoples. Members of First Nations bands that are subject to the ''Indian Act'' with the Crown are compiled on a list called the [[Indian Register]], and such people are called ''Status Indians''. Many non-treaty First Nations and all Inuit and M\u00e9tis peoples are not subject to the ''Indian Act''. However, two court cases have clarified that Inuit, M\u00e9tis, and non-status First Nations people, all are covered by the term \"Indians\" in the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. The first was ''[[Re Eskimos]]'' in 1939 covering the Inuit, the second being ''[[Daniels v.
