These ants form colonies with multiple nests in trees, each nest being made of leaves stitched together using the silk produced by the ant [[larva]]e.\n\n==Description==\nWorkers and major workers are  mostly coloured orange. Workers are {{convert|5|-|6|mm}} long; they look after larvae and farm scale bugs for [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]]. Major workers are {{convert|8|-|10|mm|1}} long, with long strong legs and large mandibles. They forage, assemble and expand the nest. Queens are typically {{convert|20|-|25|mm|1}} long, and normally greenish-brown.<ref name=describe>{{cite web |url=http://antark.net/ant-species/weaver-ant-oecophylla-smaragdina/ |title=Weaver Ant \u2013 Oecophylla smaragdina.

It is an arboreal species, making its nests among the foliage of trees. Nests are constructed during the night, with major workers weaving towards the exterior and minor workers completing the interior structure.<ref name=\"soe-townsville.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soe-townsville.org/greentreeants/index.html|first=|last=|title=Green Tree Ants \u2014 State of the Environment Report|publisher=|accessdate=7 January 2017}}</ref> The ant colony may have several nests in one tree, or the nests may be spread over several adjacent trees; colonies can reach up to half a million individuals.<ref name=describe/> In one instance, a colony occupied 151 nests distributed among twelve trees.

First a row of ants line up along the edge of a green leaf and, grasping a nearby leaf, pull the two leaves together, edge to edge. Other workers on the far side of the leaves, each carrying a larva in its mouth, apply the tips of the abdomens of the larvae to each leaf edge in turn. This produces a suture of fine silken threads that secures the leaves together. More leaves are attached in a similar manner to enlarge the nest.<ref name=Majno>{{cite book|author=Majno, Guido |title=The Healing Hand: Man and Wound in the Ancient World |url=https://archive.org/details/healinghandmanwo00majn |url-access=registration |year=1991 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-38331-9 |page=[https://archive.org/details/healinghandmanwo00majn/page/307 307]}}</ref>\n\nWeaver ants feed on insects and other invertebrates, their prey being mainly beetles, flies and [[hymenoptera]]ns.<ref name=Kusters/> They do not sting, but have a painful bite into which they can secrete irritant chemicals from their abdomens.
