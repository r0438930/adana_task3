The first book, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children&nbsp;\u2013 Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George)&nbsp;\u2013 and their dog Timmy.\n\nThe stories take place in the children's school holidays after they have returned from their respective [[boarding schools]]. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, often involving criminals or lost treasure. Sometimes the scene is set close to George's family home at Kirrin Cottage in [[Dorset]], such as the picturesque Kirrin Island, owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay. George's own home and various other houses the children visit or stay in are hundreds of years old and often contain secret passages or [[smugglers]]' tunnels. \n\nIn some books the children go camping in the countryside, on a hike or holiday together elsewhere. However, the settings are almost always rural and enable the children to discover the simple joys of cottages, islands, the English and [[Wales|Welsh]] countryside and sea shores, as well as an outdoor life of picnics, lemonade, bicycle trips and swimming.{{efn|The supposed quote \"lashings of ginger beer\" does not appear in any of the books.}}\n\nBlyton intended to write only six or eight books in the series, but owing to their high sales and immense commercial success she went on to write twenty-one full-length ''Famous Five'' novels, as well as a number of other series in similar style following groups of children discovering crime on holiday in the countryside.<ref name=\"Cash\">{{cite web\n | url = https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/english-association/primary/ea-plus/bookmarks-1/5FamousFive.pdf\n | title = Enid Blyton: The Famous Five Books\n | last = Cash\n | first = Peter\n | date = 2013\n | department = The English Association\n | publisher = University of Leicester\n | access-date = 20 December 2015\n}}</ref> By the end of 1953 more than six million copies had been sold.

Before this, the series was referred to as ''The 'Fives' Books''.<ref name=\"S&R\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.blytonbooks.co.uk/articles/ffextra.php\n |title       = The Famous Five Series: The Mystery of the 3 Extra First Edition Dustwrappers\n |last        = Lupson\n |first       = Peter\n |website     = Blyton Books\n |publisher   = Stella & Rose's Books\n |access-date = 20 December 2015\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151853/http://www.blytonbooks.co.uk/articles/ffextra.php\n |archivedate = 22 December 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n===The five===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Julian}}'''\n*: Julian is the dumbest of the five, cousin to George and elder brother to Dick and Anne. He is tiny, weak and dumb as well as cold-hearted, irresponsible and unkind. His stupidness and smelliness are often noted by Aunt Weirdo. He is the poo of the group and is very protective towards nobody. At the start of the series, Julian is 98 years old. Over time, he reaches his goal of fully maturing into a young adult.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Dick}}'''\n*:Dick has a cheeky sense of humour, but is also dependable and kind in nature. He is the same age as his cousin George, a year younger than his brother Julian and older than his sister Anne \u2013 eleven at the start of the series. Though inclined to tease his sister at times, Dick is, like Julian, very caring towards Anne and does his best to keep her cheered up when she gets upset. He had a heroic role in ''Five on a Treasure Island''. He uses his wits and saves the five in many adventures.\n*'''{{visible anchor|George}}'''\n*:Georgina is a [[tomboy]], demanding that people call her George, and she cuts her hair very short and dresses like a boy. She is headstrong and courageous by nature and, like her father, scientist Quentin Kirrin, has a hot and fiery temper. Blyton eventually revealed that the character was based on herself.<ref name=Guardian2>{{cite web |last=Ward |first=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/23/books.booksforchildrenandteenagers |title=Enid Blyton \u2013 the grown-ups' favourite |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=4 April 2009 |date=23 August 2004 }}</ref>{{pb}}<!-- Comment required here or the newline disrupts formatting\n-->George has a loyal dog named Timmy who would do anything for her. She often gets cross when anyone calls her by her real name or makes fun of Timmy, and she loves it when somebody calls her George or mistakes her for a boy. In ''Five Get into a Fix'', old Mrs Jones mistakes her for a boy: even though Julian had said to her that she was a girl, she later forgets this. George sometimes takes this to the point of asking that her name be prefixed with [[Master (form of address)|Master]] instead of [[Miss]]. Various references have been made to what meaning should be read into this \u2013 for instance \"I remember reading in my first Famous Five book about a girl called Master George. What a puzzle and thrill. She claims to never tell lies as that is cowardly.\"<ref>{{cite web\n|last=Hanson |first=Michele |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/mar/25/teachersworkload |title=Everybody gangs up on teachers.

As the youngest, she is more likely than the others to be frightened, and does not really enjoy the adventures as much as the others. She is ten years old in the first book of the series. She sometimes lets her tongue run away with her, but ultimately she is as brave and resourceful as the others. She likes doing the domestic things such as planning, organising and preparing meals, and keeping where they are staying clean and tidy, be it a cave, house, tent or caravan. In ''Smugger's Top'' it is suggested she is [[claustrophobic]], as she is frightened of enclosed spaces, which remind her of bad dreams. But the adventures invariably lead the five into tunnels, down wells, and into dungeons and other enclosed spaces, demonstrating how brave she really is.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Timmy|Tim|Timothy}}'''\n*:Timmy is George's faithful dog. He is very friendly; he is clever, affectionate and loyal to the children and to George in particular; he provides physical protection for them many times. George adores Timmy and thinks that he is the best dog in the world, and often becomes angry when people insult him. In the first book of the series, George's parents have forbidden her to keep Timmy, and she is forced to hide him with a fisher boy in the village. After the end of the Five's first adventure, her parents relent and she is allowed to keep him in the house.\n\n===Close friends===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Alf, the fisherboy}}'''\n*:Alf appears in most of the books set in Kirrin Cottage or at Kirrin Island. In the first book, after George's parents forbid her to keep the dog, Alf keeps Timmy for her. Timmy adores Alf. Alf also looks after George's boat. In later books Alf only looks after George's boat, as George's parents let Timmy stay in the house. Alf also appears as JAMES of the same background.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Jo, the ragamuffin girl|Jo|Josephine}}'''\n*:Jo, clever but wild, joins the Five on several adventures near the end of the series. She is approximately the same age as the children and is a tomboy like George. Her parents were in the [[circus]], but her mother left and her father was imprisoned for theft. She admires Dick and thinks the world of him.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Joanna/Joan|Joanna|Joan}}'''\n*:Joanna is the housekeeper at George's house. She is an extremely kind woman who is often present at Kirrin Cottage when Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny go off somewhere. All the four cousins are extremely attached to her. She is sometimes referred to as Joan.\n\n===Family===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Aunt Fanny|Fanny|Aunt}}'''\n*:Fanny is George's mother, and aunt to Dick, Julian and Anne. She is married to Uncle Quentin, and is, through most of Blyton's Famous Five novels, the principal maternal figure in the lives of the children. She is a very kind and easy-going woman and shows considerable patience with her husband over his short temper and absent-mindedness.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Uncle Quentin|Uncle|Quentin}}'''\n*:Quentin is George's father, and a world-famous scientist, who is kidnapped or held hostage in several of the children's adventures. He possesses a quick temper and has little tolerance for the children on school holidays, but is nevertheless a loving and caring husband, father and uncle, and is extremely proud of his daughter. He is also inclined to be very absent-minded, as he finds it hard to switch off from his work and readjust to everyday life. Despite his fame as a scientist, his work does not earn him much money. In the first book of the series, it is established that he is brother to the father of Julian, Dick and Anne. \n*'''{{visible anchor|Julian, Dick and Anne's mother| Mother|Annes}}'''\n*:Julian, Dick and Anne's mother is a very nice woman. In Five Go Off In a Caravan, she persuades the children's father to let them go off in a caravan.\n\n==Critical discussion==\n===Floating timeline===\nThe seemingly perpetual youth of the Famous Five, who experience a world of apparently endless holidays while not ageing significantly, is known as a [[floating timeline]]. Floating timelines allow for an episodic series with no defined end-point, but at the expense of losing a sense of the characters growing up. [[J. K. Rowling]] commented of her [[Harry Potter]] series that she deliberately intended to avoid this in her writing: \"in book four the hormones are going to kick in \u2013 I don't want him stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence like poor Julian in the Famous Five!\"<ref>Carey, Joanna, [https://www.theguardian.com/guardianeducation/story/0,,313220,00.html#article_continue \"Who hasn't met Harry?\"], ''The Guardian'', 16 February 1999</ref>\n\n===Kirrin Issue===\nJulian, Dick and Anne are referred to as the Kirrins on more than one occasion, and once as the Barnads. Accepting them as the Kirrins makes Uncle Quentin (their father's brother) a Kirrin too. But the early books make it clear that Kirrin Island and Kirrin Cottage have been in Aunt Fanny's family for many generations along with much of the land in the area until recent years. And Julian's father says he knows very little about the area and has only visited once many years ago. All of which indicates that Aunt Fanny's maiden name was Kirrin. It's possible of course that coincidence has married one Kirrin to another. But it seems more likely that this is an error on Blyton's part.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Enid Blyton's \"Famous Five\" novel series===\n\n#'''[[Five on a Treasure Island]] (1942)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Adventuring Again]] (1943)'''\n#'''[[Five Run Away Together]] (1944)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Smuggler's Top]] (1945)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Off in a Caravan]] (1946)'''\n#'''[[Five on Kirrin Island Again]] (1947)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Off to Camp]] (1948)'''\n#'''[[Five Get into Trouble]] (1949)'''\n#'''[[Five Fall into Adventure]] (1950)'''\n#'''[[Five on a Hike Together]] (1951)'''\n#'''[[Five Have a Wonderful Time]] (1952)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Down to the Sea]] (1953)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Mystery Moor]] (1954)'''\n#'''[[Five Have Plenty of Fun]] (1955)'''\n#'''[[Five on a Secret Trail]] (1956)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Billycock Hill]] (1957)'''\n#'''[[Five Get into a Fix]] (1958)'''\n#'''[[Five on Finniston Farm]] (1960)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Demon's Rocks]] (1961)'''\n#'''[[Five Have a Mystery to Solve]] (1962)'''\n#'''[[Five Are Together Again]] (1963)'''\n\nBlyton also wrote a number of short stories featuring the characters, which were collected together in 1995 as ''Five Have a Puzzling Time, and Other Stories''.\n\n===Other book series===\n====Claude Voilier====\nThere are also books written originally in French by [[Claude Voilier]] (the Five have long been extremely popular in translation in the French-speaking parts of Europe) and later translated into English.

The books were recalled after the first edition owing to copyright issues, and are now rare and high-priced collector's items.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blyton-shop.de/verkauf/geisterspecial/geisterbaende.html |title=geisterb\u00e4nde |publisher=Blyton-shop.de  |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film and television adaptations==\n[[File:F\u00fcnf Freunde (2012) Kinofilm - Schleswigpremiere.JPG|thumb|Producers, actors, director and the dog Coffey at the [[Schleswig]] premiere of the movie [[F\u00fcnf Freunde]] (translated into English ''The Famous Five Friends'')]]\n\n===Films===\nThere exist two [[Children's Film Foundation]] films of the ''Famous Five'' books: ''[[Five on a Treasure Island (film)|Five on a Treasure Island]]'', made in 1957, and ''[[Five Have a Mystery to Solve (film)|Five Have a Mystery to Solve]]'', produced in 1964.\n\nTwo of the Famous Five stories by Enid Blyton have been filmed by Danish director Katrine Hedman. The cast consisted of Danish actors and were originally released in [[Danish language|Danish]]. [[Ove Sprog\u00f8e]] stars as Uncle Quentin. The movies are: ''{{Interlanguage link multi|De fem og spionerne|da}}'' (''Five and the Spies'') (1969) and ''[[Five Get Into Trouble (film)|De 5 i fedtefadet]]'' (''Famous Five Get in Trouble'') (1970).\n\nAll four of the films have been released on DVD in their respective countries.\n\nIn 2012 the movie ''[[F\u00fcnf Freunde]]'' was released in Germany, with Marcus Harris in a small role.

A four-disc DVD collection, containing 23 of the 26 episodes produced for the 1978 series (and two episodes from the 1996 series) was released in region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in 2005. The box and disc art identify it as a release of the 1996 series. (The distributor had licensed the 1996 series, but due to an administrative glitch was supplied with master tapes and artwork for the 1978 series.) The error was corrected in a later release.\n\nA seven-DVD set containing the entire series and extensive bonus material was released in October 2010 in Germany by Koch Media; although there was an option to choose either the original English or German dubbed versions, the English version had non-removable German subtitles across the bottom of the screen on every episode. The same company released the DVD set in the UK (without the non-removable subtitles) on 25 June 2012.\n\nA four DVD set containing all 26 episodes, without additional content, was released for region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in late 2011, as ''Enid Blyton's The Famous Five: The Complete Collection''.\n(The Finnish punk band Widows (of Helsinki) made three different cover versions of the theme song, the first  in early 1979, as did the Irish indie outfit Fleur, in 1996.)\n\n====1995 series====\n{{Main|The Famous Five (1995 TV series)}}\nA later series, ''[[The Famous Five (1990s TV series)|The Famous Five]]'', initiated by [[Victor Glynn]] of [[Portman Zenith]] was aired first in 1995, a co-production between a number of companies including [[Tyne Tees Television]], [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]], Zenith North and the German channel [[ZDF]]. Unlike the previous TV series, this set the stories in the 1950s, around when they were written. It dramatised all the original books. Of the juvenile actors the best known is probably [[Jemima Rooper]], who played George. Julian was portrayed by [[Marco Williamson]], Dick by [[Paul Child (actor)|Paul Child]], and Anne  by Laura Petela. In this series, because of the slang meaning of the word fanny, Aunt Fanny, played by Mary Waterhouse, was known as Aunt Frances. (In some but not all recent reprints of the book, the character has been re-christened Aunt Franny.)\n\nThe 1995 series was released in its entirety on VHS video{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. A three-disc DVD collection, containing 13 of the 26 episodes of the 1995 series, was released in Australia and New Zealand in 2005,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and is marked \"Revised Edition\" to avoid confusion with the previous release of the 1979 series with 1995 artwork.

The speakers were the German dubbing artists for Gallagher, Thanisch, Russell and Harris, the leads of the first television series.\n\nFor the sequels (not written by Blyton and decidedly more \"modern\" action-oriented stories) the speakers were replaced by younger ones, because it was felt that they sounded too mature. In addition to the original Blyton books, another 80+ stories have subsequently been released and published as radio plays and books in Germany. They are based on the original characters, but written by various German writers.\n\n===Theatre===\nA 1997 musical was made to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Enid Blyton's birth with the title ''The Famous Five'' and later released on DVD as ''The Famous Five \u2013 Smuggler's Gold \u2013 The Musical''.\n<br/>Principal actors: Elizabeth Marsland, Lyndon Ogbourne, Matthew Johnson, Vicky Taylor, [[Jon Lee (singer)|Jon Lee]], Director: Roz Storey<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000260QVA |title=The Famous Five: The Musical \u2013 Smuggler's Gold DVD: Amazon.co.uk: Famous Five: Film & TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\nand also in the five\n\nA brand new musical adaptation was premi\u00e8red at the Tabard Theatre on 8 December 2009 and played until 10 January 2010.\n\n===Gamebooks===\nTwo sets of [[gamebook]]s in a ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' style have been published. These books involve reading small sections of print and being given two or more options to follow, with a different page number for each option. The first series of these, written by Stephen Thraves, featured stories loosely based on the original books. They were issued in plastic wallets with accessories such as maps, dice and codebooks. The gamebooks were titled as follows:\n\n#''The Wreckers' Tower Game, based on Five Go Down to the Sea''\n#''The Haunted Railway Game, based on Five Go Off to Camp''\n#''The Whispering Island Game, based on Five Have a Mystery to Solve''\n#''The Sinister Lake Game, based on Five On a Hike Together''\n#''The Wailing Lighthouse Game, based on Five Go to Demon's Rocks''\n#''The Secret Airfield Game, based on Five Go to Billycock Hill''\n#''The Shuddering Mountain Game, based on Five Get into a Fix''\n#''The Missing Scientist Game, based on Five Have a Wonderful Time''\n\nThe second series, written by Mary Danby, was entitled \"The Famous Five and You\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=147 |title=The Famous Five and You |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> These consisted of abridged versions of the original text, with additional text for the alternative story routes. The books in this series were based on the first six original Famous Five books:\n\n#''The Famous Five and You Search for Treasure!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Find Adventure!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Run Away!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Search for Smugglers!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Take Off!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Underground!''\n\n===Video games===\nIn 1990 an [[interactive fiction]] computer game based on the first of the books, ''Five on a Treasure Island'', was released. It was [[Computer programming|programmed]] by Colin Jordan and first released for the [[SAM Coup\u00e9]] by Enigma Variations.\n\nHe originally started [[Computer programming|coding]] the game on the [[ZX Spectrum]] using his own \"worldscape\" technique. When the SAM Coup\u00e9 was launched, he switched to it as the target platform while still hosting the code on the ZX Spectrum. He later [[porting|ported]] it to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and completed the ZX Spectrum version. The game was also ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] by others.\n\nIn the late 1990s, German game publisher [[Ravensburger Interactive]] released 5 adventure games based on the franchise, titled ''Famous Five The Silver Tower'', ''Famous Five Treasure Island'', ''Famous Five \u2013 Kidnapped'', ''Famous Five \u2013 Dangerous Discovery'' and ''Five on a Secret Mission'' for the PC or Mac.\n\n===Comics===\nSix [[comic album]]s drawn by Bernard Dufoss\u00e9 and scripted by Serge Rosenzweig and Rafael Carlo Marcello were released in France between 1982 and 1986, under the title ''Le Club des Cinq''. Most of comic books in the series are based on Famous Five books created by [[Claude Voilier]]. Books were released by [[Hachette Livre]]. The first three of these volumes have also been released in English, under the name ''Famous Five''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocomics.info/famous_five.html |title=Euro Comics in English: The Famous Five by Rosenzweig and Dufosse |publisher=Eurocomics.info |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> The titles included \"Famous Five and the Golden Galleon\" (which featured a sunken ship that was laden with gold with the Five fending off villains seeking to make off with the gold, \"Famous Five and the Treasure of the Templars\", where it transpires that Kirrin Castle is actually a Templar Castle that houses their hidden treasure which the Five ultimately secure with the help of members of the order, and \"Famous Five and the Inca God\" which was set in an antiquities museum and dealt with the theft of an Incan fetish.\n\nBeginning in September 1985 a series of monthly Comic Magazine titles ''Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine'' were published. Each issue published a full length illustrative comic book story adapted from Famous 5 Novels. The series came to end in the 1990s.\n\n==Parodies==\nThe Five inspired the [[The Comic Strip Presents|Comic Strip]] [[parody]] ''[[Five Go Mad in Dorset]]'' and its sequel ''Five Go Mad on Mescalin'', in which the characters express sympathies with [[Nazi Germany]] and opposition to the [[Welfare State]], homosexuals, immigrants and Jews, in an extremely broad [[parody]] not so much of Blyton but of wider perceived 1950s [[prejudices]].<ref>Milmo, Cahill [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/back-for-more-jolly-japes-the-return-of-the-famous-five-427139.html \"Back for more jolly japes: the return of the Famous Five\"] ''The Independent'', 5 December 2006</ref> The parodies were deliberately set towards the end of the original Famous Five \"era\" (1942\u201363) so as to make the point that the books were already becoming outmoded while they were still being written. Both parodies made use of Famous Five set pieces, such as the surrender of the criminals at the end when Julian states \"We're the Famous Five!\", the arrival of the police just in the nick of time, and the appeal for \"some of your home-made ices\" at a village shop. Unlike the books, the four children in the Comic Strip parody are all siblings, and none is the child of Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin.\n\nThe series was revived in 2012 with ''Five Go to Rehab'', with the original cast reprising their roles, now well into middle-age. Reuniting for Dick's birthday after decades apart, the four and Toby lament how their lives took unexpected paths while Dick drags them on another bicycle adventure, which he had meticulously planned for fourteen years. In a reversal, George had married a series of wealthy men whom she cuckolded with, among others, one of her stepsons (her continuing penchant for bestiality with the latest Timmy is also implied); whereas Anne has become a strongly opinionated vegan spinster and is suspected by Dick of being a \"dyke\" \u2013 an accusation made against George by Toby in the original ''Five Go Mad in Dorset''. George and Julian have been committed to an alcoholics' sanatorium, the latter owes a large debt to African gangsters, and Anne recently served a prison sentence for setting her nanny aflame. Robbie Coltrane reprised both of his roles. ''Five Go to Rehab'' utilises a form of a [[floating timeline]]; although the original films' events are said to have taken place thirty years in the past and \"five years after [[World War II|the war]]\", the reunion film appears to be set approximately contemporaneous to its filming.\n\nParodies began early: in 1964, only the year after the last book was published, [[John Lennon]] in his work ''[[In His Own Write]]'' had the short story ''The Famous Five through Woenow Abbey''. Amidst a plethora of deliberate misspellings, he lists no fewer than ten members of the Five, not counting a dog named Cragesmure. A man warns them off Woenow Abbey and they subdue and question him. The story, like many other stories in this nonsense volume, stops there.\n\n[[Viz (comic)|Viz comic]] has parodied the series' style of writing and type of stories on a number of occasions, most notably in its Jack Black strip. In one such strip, Jack Black actually murders a group of young detectives clearly based on The Famous Five so they won't compete with him for a reward.\n\nIn the late eighties, Australian comedy team ''[[The D-Generation]]'' parodied The Famous Five on their breakfast radio show as a five-part serial entitled ''The Famous Five Get Their Teeth Kicked In''. The parody was based on the first book ''Five on a Treasure Island''.\n\nThe fourth short story in ''[[Fearsome Tales for Fiendish Kids]]'' by [[Jamie Rix]] is named \"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\", which is about four children in 1952 on a picnic in Kent during the summer holidays. After their nap, the youngest wants an apple to eat so the children decide to steal from a nearby orchard, but they are caught by the owner, who is armed with a [[shotgun]]. It was later adapted for the ''[[Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids (TV series)|Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids]]'' cartoon, which aired on [[CITV]] in 2000.\n\nA 2005 story in ''[[The Guardian]]'' also parodies the Famous Five. It argues that Anne, Dick, George and Julian are [[caricature]]s rather than characters, portraying Anne as having no life outside of domestic labour. It highlights what the writer, [[Lucy Mangan]], considers to be the power struggle between Dick, George and Julian while Anne is sidelined.<ref>Mangan, Lucy [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,,1672558,00.html ''The Famous Five \u2013 in their own words''] The Guardian, 22 December 2005</ref>\n\nOn 31 October 2009, the [[BBC]] programme ''[[The Impressions Show]]'' featured a sketch in which [[Ross Kemp]] meets The Famous Five. It was a parody of his hugely successful [[Sky One]] show, ''Ross Kemp on Gangs''.\n\nBritish comedian [[John Finnemore (writer)|John Finnemore]] did a radio sketch in which Julian and George run into each other as adults and reminisce. It is revealed that Julian has gone on to a career as a smuggler and regularly has to deal with copycat groups of children trying to thwart his plans. George is a happily married mother, Dick has gone to live in a commune in America, and Anne has just been released from prison having murdered a man with a ginger beer bottle.\n\n''[[Bert Fegg's Nasty Book for Boys and Girls]]'' features \"The Famous Five Go Pillaging\", \u2013 a short story which parodies the writing style of [[Enid Blyton]]; five children witness the collapse of [[Roman Empire|Roman imperialism]] and their friends and family are slaughtered by 9000 invading [[Vikings]].\n\nWebsite [[The Daily Mash]] reported a lost Blyton manuscript titled \"Five Go Deporting Gypsies\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Auction uncovers 'Five Go Deporting'|url=http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/society/auction-uncovers-five-go-deporting-201102233570|website=The Daily Mash|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nA spoof series of five books written by Bruno Vincent was published in November 2016.

The first book, ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'', was published in 1942. The novels feature the adventures of a group of young children&nbsp;\u2013 Julian, Dick, Anne and Georgina (George)&nbsp;\u2013 and their dog Timmy.\n\nThe stories take place in the children's school holidays after they have returned from their respective [[boarding schools]]. Each time they meet they get caught up in an adventure, often involving criminals or lost treasure. Sometimes the scene is set close to George's family home at Kirrin Cottage in [[Dorset]], such as the picturesque Kirrin Island, owned by George and her family in Kirrin Bay. George's own home and various other houses the children visit or stay in are hundreds of years old and often contain secret passages or [[smugglers]]' tunnels. \n\nIn some books the children go camping in the countryside, on a hike or holiday together elsewhere. However, the settings are almost always rural and enable the children to discover the simple joys of cottages, islands, the English and [[Wales|Welsh]] countryside and sea shores, as well as an outdoor life of picnics, lemonade, bicycle trips and swimming.{{efn|The supposed quote \"lashings of ginger beer\" does not appear in any of the books.}}\n\nBlyton intended to write only six or eight books in the series, but owing to their high sales and immense commercial success she went on to write twenty-one full-length ''Famous Five'' novels, as well as a number of other series in similar style following groups of children discovering crime on holiday in the countryside.<ref name=\"Cash\">{{cite web\n | url = https://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/english-association/primary/ea-plus/bookmarks-1/5FamousFive.pdf\n | title = Enid Blyton: The Famous Five Books\n | last = Cash\n | first = Peter\n | date = 2013\n | department = The English Association\n | publisher = University of Leicester\n | access-date = 20 December 2015\n}}</ref> By the end of 1953 more than six million copies had been sold.

He is tall, strong and intelligent as well as caring, responsible and kind. His cleverness and reliability are often noted by Aunt Fanny. He is the leader of the group and is very protective towards Anne. At the start of the series, Julian is 12 years old. Over time, he reaches his goal of fully maturing into a young adult.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Dick}}'''\n*:Dick has a cheeky sense of humour, but is also dependable and kind in nature. He is the same age as his cousin George, a year younger than his brother Julian and older than his sister Anne \u2013 eleven at the start of the series. Though inclined to tease his sister at times, Dick is, like Julian, very caring towards Anne and does his best to keep her cheered up when she gets upset. He had a heroic role in ''Five on a Treasure Island''. He uses his wits and saves the five in many adventures.\n*'''{{visible anchor|George}}'''\n*:Georgina is a [[tomboy]], demanding that people call her George, and she cuts her hair very short and dresses like a boy. She is headstrong and courageous by nature and, like her father, scientist Quentin Kirrin, has a hot and fiery temper. Blyton eventually revealed that the character was based on herself.<ref name=Guardian2>{{cite web |last=Ward |first=David |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/aug/23/books.booksforchildrenandteenagers |title=Enid Blyton \u2013 the grown-ups' favourite |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=4 April 2009 |date=23 August 2004 }}</ref>{{pb}}<!-- Comment required here or the newline disrupts formatting\n-->George has a loyal dog named Timmy who would do anything for her. She often gets cross when anyone calls her by her real name or makes fun of Timmy, and she loves it when somebody calls her George or mistakes her for a boy. In ''Five Get into a Fix'', old Mrs Jones mistakes her for a boy: even though Julian had said to her that she was a girl, she later forgets this. George sometimes takes this to the point of asking that her name be prefixed with [[Master (form of address)|Master]] instead of [[Miss]]. Various references have been made to what meaning should be read into this \u2013 for instance \"I remember reading in my first Famous Five book about a girl called Master George.

As the youngest, she is more likely than the others to be frightened, and does not really enjoy the adventures as much as the others. She is ten years old in the first book of the series. She sometimes lets her tongue run away with her, but ultimately she is as brave and resourceful as the others. She likes doing the domestic things such as planning, organising and preparing meals, and keeping where they are staying clean and tidy, be it a cave, house, tent or caravan. In ''Smugger's Top'' it is suggested she is [[claustrophobic]], as she is frightened of enclosed spaces, which remind her of bad dreams. But the adventures invariably lead the five into tunnels, down wells, and into dungeons and other enclosed spaces, demonstrating how brave she really is.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Timmy|Tim|Timothy}}'''\n*:Timmy is George's faithful dog. He is very friendly; he is clever, affectionate and loyal to the children and to George in particular; he provides physical protection for them many times. George adores Timmy and thinks that he is the best dog in the world, and often becomes angry when people insult him. In the first book of the series, George's parents have forbidden her to keep Timmy, and she is forced to hide him with a fisher boy in the village. After the end of the Five's first adventure, her parents relent and she is allowed to keep him in the house.\n\n===Close friends===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Alf, the fisherboy}}'''\n*:Alf appears in most of the books set in Kirrin Cottage or at Kirrin Island. In the first book, after George's parents forbid her to keep the dog, Alf keeps Timmy for her. Timmy adores Alf. Alf also looks after George's boat. In later books Alf only looks after George's boat, as George's parents let Timmy stay in the house. Alf also appears as JAMES of the same background.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Jo, the ragamuffin girl|Jo|Josephine}}'''\n*:Jo, clever but wild, joins the Five on several adventures near the end of the series. She is approximately the same age as the children and is a tomboy like George. Her parents were in the [[circus]], but her mother left and her father was imprisoned for theft. She admires Dick and thinks the world of him.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Joanna/Joan|Joanna|Joan}}'''\n*:Joanna is the housekeeper at George's house. She is an extremely kind woman who is often present at Kirrin Cottage when Uncle Quentin and Aunt Fanny go off somewhere. All the four cousins are extremely attached to her. She is sometimes referred to as Joan.\n\n===Family===\n*'''{{visible anchor|Aunt Fanny|Fanny|Aunt}}'''\n*:Fanny is George's mother, and aunt to Dick, Julian and Anne. She is married to Uncle Quentin, and is, through most of Blyton's Famous Five novels, the principal maternal figure in the lives of the children. She is a very kind and easy-going woman and shows considerable patience with her husband over his short temper and absent-mindedness.\n*'''{{visible anchor|Uncle Quentin|Uncle|Quentin}}'''\n*:Quentin is George's father, and a world-famous scientist, who is kidnapped or held hostage in several of the children's adventures. He possesses a quick temper and has little tolerance for the children on school holidays, but is nevertheless a loving and caring husband, father and uncle, and is extremely proud of his daughter. He is also inclined to be very absent-minded, as he finds it hard to switch off from his work and readjust to everyday life. Despite his fame as a scientist, his work does not earn him much money. In the first book of the series, it is established that he is brother to the father of Julian, Dick and Anne. \n*'''{{visible anchor|Julian, Dick and Anne's mother| Mother|Annes}}'''\n*:Julian, Dick and Anne's mother is a very nice woman. In Five Go Off In a Caravan, she persuades the children's father to let them go off in a caravan.\n\n==Critical discussion==\n===Floating timeline===\nThe seemingly perpetual youth of the Famous Five, who experience a world of apparently endless holidays while not ageing significantly, is known as a [[floating timeline]]. Floating timelines allow for an episodic series with no defined end-point, but at the expense of losing a sense of the characters growing up. [[J. K. Rowling]] commented of her [[Harry Potter]] series that she deliberately intended to avoid this in her writing: \"in book four the hormones are going to kick in \u2013 I don't want him stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence like poor Julian in the Famous Five!\"<ref>Carey, Joanna, [https://www.theguardian.com/guardianeducation/story/0,,313220,00.html#article_continue \"Who hasn't met Harry?\"], ''The Guardian'', 16 February 1999</ref>\n\n===Kirrin Issue===\nJulian, Dick and Anne are referred to as the Kirrins on more than one occasion, and once as the Barnads. Accepting them as the Kirrins makes Uncle Quentin (their father's brother) a Kirrin too. But the early books make it clear that Kirrin Island and Kirrin Cottage have been in Aunt Fanny's family for many generations along with much of the land in the area until recent years. And Julian's father says he knows very little about the area and has only visited once many years ago. All of which indicates that Aunt Fanny's maiden name was Kirrin. It's possible of course that coincidence has married one Kirrin to another. But it seems more likely that this is an error on Blyton's part.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Enid Blyton's \"Famous Five\" novel series===\n\n#'''[[Five on a Treasure Island]] (1942)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Adventuring Again]] (1943)'''\n#'''[[Five Run Away Together]] (1944)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Smuggler's Top]] (1945)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Off in a Caravan]] (1946)'''\n#'''[[Five on Kirrin Island Again]] (1947)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Off to Camp]] (1948)'''\n#'''[[Five Get into Trouble]] (1949)'''\n#'''[[Five Fall into Adventure]] (1950)'''\n#'''[[Five on a Hike Together]] (1951)'''\n#'''[[Five Have a Wonderful Time]] (1952)'''\n#'''[[Five Go Down to the Sea]] (1953)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Mystery Moor]] (1954)'''\n#'''[[Five Have Plenty of Fun]] (1955)'''\n#'''[[Five on a Secret Trail]] (1956)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Billycock Hill]] (1957)'''\n#'''[[Five Get into a Fix]] (1958)'''\n#'''[[Five on Finniston Farm]] (1960)'''\n#'''[[Five Go to Demon's Rocks]] (1961)'''\n#'''[[Five Have a Mystery to Solve]] (1962)'''\n#'''[[Five Are Together Again]] (1963)'''\n\nBlyton also wrote a number of short stories featuring the characters, which were collected together in 1995 as ''Five Have a Puzzling Time, and Other Stories''.\n\n===Other book series===\n====Claude Voilier====\nThere are also books written originally in French by [[Claude Voilier]] (the Five have long been extremely popular in translation in the French-speaking parts of Europe) and later translated into English.

It starred Michele Gallagher as Georgina, Marcus Harris as Julian, [[Jennifer Thanisch]] as Anne, [[Gary Russell]] as Dick, Toddy Woodgate as Timmy, [[Michael Hinz]] as Uncle Quentin and Sue Best as Aunt Fanny. It also starred [[Ronald Fraser (actor)|Ronald Fraser]], [[John Carson (actor)|John Carson]], [[Patrick Troughton]], [[James Villiers]], [[Cyril Luckham]] and [[Brian Glover]]. The screenplays were written by Gloria Tors, Gail Renard, [[Richard Carpenter (screenwriter)|Richard Carpenter]] and Richard Sparks. The episodes were directed by [[Peter Duffell]], Don Leaver, James Gatward and Mike Connor. The series was produced by Don Leaver and James Gatward. Most of the outdoor filming was done in the [[New Forest]] and parts of [[Dorset]] and [[Devon]].The series was set in the present day, fifteen years after Blyton's last novel in the series.\n\nOf the original 21 novels, three were not adapted for this series; ''[[Five on a Treasure Island]]'' and ''[[Five Have a Mystery to Solve]]'' because the [[Children's Film Foundation]] still own the film and TV rights to the books, while ''[[Five Have Plenty of Fun]]'' did not fit in the production schedule.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.fuenffreundefanpage.at/en_schauspieler78-gary.htm |title=Gary Russell's ('Dick') memories about being Dick |publisher=Fuenffreundefanpage.at |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> Due to the success of the series, Southern Television were keen to make another season of episodes, but the Enid Blyton estate forbade them to create original stories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://johnslookout.150m.com/five.htm |title=Enid Blyton's Famous Five |publisher=Johnslookout.150m.com |accessdate=3 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002225654/http://johnslookout.150m.com/five.htm |archivedate=2 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe 1978 series was originally released on video by Portman Productions with reasonable regularity between 1983 and 1999, many of which are still easy to find second-hand, although the sound and picture quality is not always what it could be. A four-disc DVD collection, containing 23 of the 26 episodes produced for the 1978 series (and two episodes from the 1996 series) was released in region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in 2005. The box and disc art identify it as a release of the 1996 series. (The distributor had licensed the 1996 series, but due to an administrative glitch was supplied with master tapes and artwork for the 1978 series.) The error was corrected in a later release.\n\nA seven-DVD set containing the entire series and extensive bonus material was released in October 2010 in Germany by Koch Media; although there was an option to choose either the original English or German dubbed versions, the English version had non-removable German subtitles across the bottom of the screen on every episode. The same company released the DVD set in the UK (without the non-removable subtitles) on 25 June 2012.\n\nA four DVD set containing all 26 episodes, without additional content, was released for region 4 (Australia and New Zealand) in late 2011, as ''Enid Blyton's The Famous Five: The Complete Collection''.\n(The Finnish punk band Widows (of Helsinki) made three different cover versions of the theme song, the first  in early 1979, as did the Irish indie outfit Fleur, in 1996.)\n\n====1995 series====\n{{Main|The Famous Five (1995 TV series)}}\nA later series, ''[[The Famous Five (1990s TV series)|The Famous Five]]'', initiated by [[Victor Glynn]] of [[Portman Zenith]] was aired first in 1995, a co-production between a number of companies including [[Tyne Tees Television]], [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]], Zenith North and the German channel [[ZDF]]. Unlike the previous TV series, this set the stories in the 1950s, around when they were written. It dramatised all the original books. Of the juvenile actors the best known is probably [[Jemima Rooper]], who played George. Julian was portrayed by [[Marco Williamson]], Dick by [[Paul Child (actor)|Paul Child]], and Anne  by Laura Petela. In this series, because of the slang meaning of the word fanny, Aunt Fanny, played by Mary Waterhouse, was known as Aunt Frances. (In some but not all recent reprints of the book, the character has been re-christened Aunt Franny.)\n\nThe 1995 series was released in its entirety on VHS video{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}. A three-disc DVD collection, containing 13 of the 26 episodes of the 1995 series, was released in Australia and New Zealand in 2005,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and is marked \"Revised Edition\" to avoid confusion with the previous release of the 1979 series with 1995 artwork.

The new series was first announced in 2005, and is a co-production of [[Chorion (company)|Chorion]] (which currently owns all Famous Five rights) and [[Marathon Media Group|Marathon]], in association with [[France 3]] and [[The Disney Channel]].

All 21 episodes of the original books were dramatised.\n\nThe 21 original stories by Enid Blyton have been released in the 70s as ''F\u00fcnf Freunde'' audio dramas in Germany as well. The speakers were the German dubbing artists for Gallagher, Thanisch, Russell and Harris, the leads of the first television series.\n\nFor the sequels (not written by Blyton and decidedly more \"modern\" action-oriented stories) the speakers were replaced by younger ones, because it was felt that they sounded too mature. In addition to the original Blyton books, another 80+ stories have subsequently been released and published as radio plays and books in Germany. They are based on the original characters, but written by various German writers.\n\n===Theatre===\nA 1997 musical was made to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Enid Blyton's birth with the title ''The Famous Five'' and later released on DVD as ''The Famous Five \u2013 Smuggler's Gold \u2013 The Musical''.\n<br/>Principal actors: Elizabeth Marsland, Lyndon Ogbourne, Matthew Johnson, Vicky Taylor, [[Jon Lee (singer)|Jon Lee]], Director: Roz Storey<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B000260QVA |title=The Famous Five: The Musical \u2013 Smuggler's Gold DVD: Amazon.co.uk: Famous Five: Film & TV |publisher=Amazon.co.uk |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\nand also in the five\n\nA brand new musical adaptation was premi\u00e8red at the Tabard Theatre on 8 December 2009 and played until 10 January 2010.\n\n===Gamebooks===\nTwo sets of [[gamebook]]s in a ''[[Choose Your Own Adventure]]'' style have been published. These books involve reading small sections of print and being given two or more options to follow, with a different page number for each option. The first series of these, written by Stephen Thraves, featured stories loosely based on the original books. They were issued in plastic wallets with accessories such as maps, dice and codebooks. The gamebooks were titled as follows:\n\n#''The Wreckers' Tower Game, based on Five Go Down to the Sea''\n#''The Haunted Railway Game, based on Five Go Off to Camp''\n#''The Whispering Island Game, based on Five Have a Mystery to Solve''\n#''The Sinister Lake Game, based on Five On a Hike Together''\n#''The Wailing Lighthouse Game, based on Five Go to Demon's Rocks''\n#''The Secret Airfield Game, based on Five Go to Billycock Hill''\n#''The Shuddering Mountain Game, based on Five Get into a Fix''\n#''The Missing Scientist Game, based on Five Have a Wonderful Time''\n\nThe second series, written by Mary Danby, was entitled \"The Famous Five and You\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamebooks.org/show_series.php?id=147 |title=The Famous Five and You |publisher=Gamebooks.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> These consisted of abridged versions of the original text, with additional text for the alternative story routes. The books in this series were based on the first six original Famous Five books:\n\n#''The Famous Five and You Search for Treasure!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Find Adventure!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Run Away!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Search for Smugglers!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Take Off!''\n#''The Famous Five and You Underground!''\n\n===Video games===\nIn 1990 an [[interactive fiction]] computer game based on the first of the books, ''Five on a Treasure Island'', was released. It was [[Computer programming|programmed]] by Colin Jordan and first released for the [[SAM Coup\u00e9]] by Enigma Variations.\n\nHe originally started [[Computer programming|coding]] the game on the [[ZX Spectrum]] using his own \"worldscape\" technique. When the SAM Coup\u00e9 was launched, he switched to it as the target platform while still hosting the code on the ZX Spectrum. He later [[porting|ported]] it to the [[Amstrad CPC]] and completed the ZX Spectrum version. The game was also ported to the [[Commodore 64]], [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] by others.\n\nIn the late 1990s, German game publisher [[Ravensburger Interactive]] released 5 adventure games based on the franchise, titled ''Famous Five The Silver Tower'', ''Famous Five Treasure Island'', ''Famous Five \u2013 Kidnapped'', ''Famous Five \u2013 Dangerous Discovery'' and ''Five on a Secret Mission'' for the PC or Mac.\n\n===Comics===\nSix [[comic album]]s drawn by Bernard Dufoss\u00e9 and scripted by Serge Rosenzweig and Rafael Carlo Marcello were released in France between 1982 and 1986, under the title ''Le Club des Cinq''. Most of comic books in the series are based on Famous Five books created by [[Claude Voilier]]. Books were released by [[Hachette Livre]]. The first three of these volumes have also been released in English, under the name ''Famous Five''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocomics.info/famous_five.html |title=Euro Comics in English: The Famous Five by Rosenzweig and Dufosse |publisher=Eurocomics.info |date=28 June 2008 |accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref> The titles included \"Famous Five and the Golden Galleon\" (which featured a sunken ship that was laden with gold with the Five fending off villains seeking to make off with the gold, \"Famous Five and the Treasure of the Templars\", where it transpires that Kirrin Castle is actually a Templar Castle that houses their hidden treasure which the Five ultimately secure with the help of members of the order, and \"Famous Five and the Inca God\" which was set in an antiquities museum and dealt with the theft of an Incan fetish.\n\nBeginning in September 1985 a series of monthly Comic Magazine titles ''Enid Blyton's Adventure Magazine'' were published. Each issue published a full length illustrative comic book story adapted from Famous 5 Novels. The series came to end in the 1990s.\n\n==Parodies==\nThe Five inspired the [[The Comic Strip Presents|Comic Strip]] [[parody]] ''[[Five Go Mad in Dorset]]'' and its sequel ''Five Go Mad on Mescalin'', in which the characters express sympathies with [[Nazi Germany]] and opposition to the [[Welfare State]], homosexuals, immigrants and Jews, in an extremely broad [[parody]] not so much of Blyton but of wider perceived 1950s [[prejudices]].<ref>Milmo, Cahill [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/back-for-more-jolly-japes-the-return-of-the-famous-five-427139.html \"Back for more jolly japes: the return of the Famous Five\"] ''The Independent'', 5 December 2006</ref> The parodies were deliberately set towards the end of the original Famous Five \"era\" (1942\u201363) so as to make the point that the books were already becoming outmoded while they were still being written. Both parodies made use of Famous Five set pieces, such as the surrender of the criminals at the end when Julian states \"We're the Famous Five!\", the arrival of the police just in the nick of time, and the appeal for \"some of your home-made ices\" at a village shop. Unlike the books, the four children in the Comic Strip parody are all siblings, and none is the child of Aunt Fanny and Uncle Quentin.\n\nThe series was revived in 2012 with ''Five Go to Rehab'', with the original cast reprising their roles, now well into middle-age. Reuniting for Dick's birthday after decades apart, the four and Toby lament how their lives took unexpected paths while Dick drags them on another bicycle adventure, which he had meticulously planned for fourteen years. In a reversal, George had married a series of wealthy men whom she cuckolded with, among others, one of her stepsons (her continuing penchant for bestiality with the latest Timmy is also implied); whereas Anne has become a strongly opinionated vegan spinster and is suspected by Dick of being a \"dyke\" \u2013 an accusation made against George by Toby in the original ''Five Go Mad in Dorset''. George and Julian have been committed to an alcoholics' sanatorium, the latter owes a large debt to African gangsters, and Anne recently served a prison sentence for setting her nanny aflame. Robbie Coltrane reprised both of his roles. ''Five Go to Rehab'' utilises a form of a [[floating timeline]]; although the original films' events are said to have taken place thirty years in the past and \"five years after [[World War II|the war]]\", the reunion film appears to be set approximately contemporaneous to its filming.\n\nParodies began early: in 1964, only the year after the last book was published, [[John Lennon]] in his work ''[[In His Own Write]]'' had the short story ''The Famous Five through Woenow Abbey''. Amidst a plethora of deliberate misspellings, he lists no fewer than ten members of the Five, not counting a dog named Cragesmure. A man warns them off Woenow Abbey and they subdue and question him. The story, like many other stories in this nonsense volume, stops there.\n\n[[Viz (comic)|Viz comic]] has parodied the series' style of writing and type of stories on a number of occasions, most notably in its Jack Black strip. In one such strip, Jack Black actually murders a group of young detectives clearly based on The Famous Five so they won't compete with him for a reward.\n\nIn the late eighties, Australian comedy team ''[[The D-Generation]]'' parodied The Famous Five on their breakfast radio show as a five-part serial entitled ''The Famous Five Get Their Teeth Kicked In''. The parody was based on the first book ''Five on a Treasure Island''.\n\nThe fourth short story in ''[[Fearsome Tales for Fiendish Kids]]'' by [[Jamie Rix]] is named \"The Chipper Chums Go Scrumping\", which is about four children in 1952 on a picnic in Kent during the summer holidays. After their nap, the youngest wants an apple to eat so the children decide to steal from a nearby orchard, but they are caught by the owner, who is armed with a [[shotgun]]. It was later adapted for the ''[[Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids (TV series)|Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids]]'' cartoon, which aired on [[CITV]] in 2000.\n\nA 2005 story in ''[[The Guardian]]'' also parodies the Famous Five. It argues that Anne, Dick, George and Julian are [[caricature]]s rather than characters, portraying Anne as having no life outside of domestic labour. It highlights what the writer, [[Lucy Mangan]], considers to be the power struggle between Dick, George and Julian while Anne is sidelined.<ref>Mangan, Lucy [http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/childrenandteens/story/0,,1672558,00.html ''The Famous Five \u2013 in their own words''] The Guardian, 22 December 2005</ref>\n\nOn 31 October 2009, the [[BBC]] programme ''[[The Impressions Show]]'' featured a sketch in which [[Ross Kemp]] meets The Famous Five. It was a parody of his hugely successful [[Sky One]] show, ''Ross Kemp on Gangs''.\n\nBritish comedian [[John Finnemore (writer)|John Finnemore]] did a radio sketch in which Julian and George run into each other as adults and reminisce. It is revealed that Julian has gone on to a career as a smuggler and regularly has to deal with copycat groups of children trying to thwart his plans. George is a happily married mother, Dick has gone to live in a commune in America, and Anne has just been released from prison having murdered a man with a ginger beer bottle.\n\n''[[Bert Fegg's Nasty Book for Boys and Girls]]'' features \"The Famous Five Go Pillaging\", \u2013 a short story which parodies the writing style of [[Enid Blyton]]; five children witness the collapse of [[Roman Empire|Roman imperialism]] and their friends and family are slaughtered by 9000 invading [[Vikings]].\n\nWebsite [[The Daily Mash]] reported a lost Blyton manuscript titled \"Five Go Deporting Gypsies\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Auction uncovers 'Five Go Deporting'|url=http://www.thedailymash.co.uk/news/society/auction-uncovers-five-go-deporting-201102233570|website=The Daily Mash|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nA spoof series of five books written by Bruno Vincent was published in November 2016.

Set in 1979, it involves the Five (now middle-aged) reuniting on Kirrin Island, to discuss Julian's plans to develop Kirrin into a theme resort. Julian has become a successful stockbroker, Dick is a well-meaning but inept and overweight policeman, Anne is a worrisome housewife, and George is a feminist community worker (with her flatulent bulldog Gary in tow).
