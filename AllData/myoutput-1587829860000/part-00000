While it is a low floor [[tram]], it is also capable of being used upon the [[National Rail]] network; the Class 399 is the first [[tram-train]] to see operational use in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn 2013, an order was placed with Vossloh for the construction of a batch of nine tram-trains for Supertram. It operates as a pioneering tram-train hybrid vehicle as part of an initial [[Pilot experiment|pilot]] of the operation of such vehicles.<ref name=\"approve\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsuk-approves-tram-train-pilot-south-yorkshire/ |title=UK approves Tram Train pilot for South Yorkshire |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 May 2012 |website=railway-technology.com |publisher=Kable |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The launch of live services using the Class 399 was repeatedly delayed, reportedly due to planning and development-related difficulty experienced by [[Network Rail]], who were responsible for the installation of additional track and other infrastructure-related changes to accommodate the tram-trains upon the heavy rail network, as well as a necessary full track replacement programme performed by Supertram.\n\nIn January 2016, the first tram-train commenced live testing on the Supertram network. On 14 September 2017, the first entered passenger service, but the type was initially restricted to only some sections of Supertram's network as further work was still required on other parts, including Network Rail lines. Full service began on 25 October 2018. The results of the trials may become a decisive factor on the adoption of tram-train technology at various other sites across the country.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Class 399 at Cathedral tram stop.jpg|thumb|399201 at [[Cathedral tram stop]] in January 2020]]\n===Background===\nIn 2008, the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) announced plans to operate a trial [[tram-train]] service using the [[Penistone line]] in [[South Yorkshire]]. As initially envisioned, the trial was to function as two-year pilot programme, as the service would be the first use of combined tram-train operations anywhere in the UK.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The scheme was jointly delivered by the DfT, [[Sheffield Supertram]], [[Network Rail]], [[Northern Rail]] and the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] (SYPTE). The adoption of tram-trains would allow Supertram services to travel on the national rail network, which had the advantages of opening up new routes, integrating multiple transit networks together, and potential for further expansion.<ref name = \"rail eng15\">Johnson, Marc. [https://www.railengineer.uk/2015/12/23/sheffield-tram-train-making-square-pegs-fit/ \"Sheffield tram-train: Making square pegs fit.\"] ''Rail Engineer'', 23 December 2015.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the local impact of the scheme, it has been anticipated that the trial could be invaluable to transport operators through the United Kingdom. Careful scrutiny is to be applied to the service's reliability and popularity; in the long run, the determined level of success could be a decisive factor on the further implementation of tram-train technology across the country.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> According to Rob Carroll, major projects manager at Supertram, the tram-train project team has been approached by multiple organisations, highlighting the interest expressed by representatives of the [[Manchester Metrolink]], transport managers studying options for a rail link to [[Glasgow Airport]], and personnel from [[South Wales]]. The prospect of being able to readily combine heavy and light rail networks together is considered to be an attractive prospect in some cities.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/><ref>Dickins, Sarah.

The revised proposal envisaged the use of the Supertram network, using a new link constructed to connect it to the [[Dearne Valley line]] to [[Rotherham]], that would then allow trams to operate on both [[heavy rail]] and [[light rail]] lines. As part of the project, the line would be electrified, allowing more cost-effective electric vehicles to be procured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8257652.stm |title=City tram-trains trial unveiled  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 September 2009 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> In May 2012, approval for the tram-train trial was granted by the DfT, along with a commitment of \u00a358 million towards the construction of a 400 meter chord to serve as the link between the Network Rail and Supertram networks, as well as the electrification of 8 miles of the route to Rotherham and the purchase of seven new tram-train vehicles.<ref name=\"approve\" />\n\nIn June 2013, [[MACOSA|Vossloh Espa\u00f1a]] was selected to construct the new tram-trains with the first scheduled to be delivered in September 2015.<ref name=\"vossloh\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsvossloh-espaa-deliver-seven-tram-trains-sypte-uk |title=Vossloh Espa\u00f1a to deliver seven tram trains to SYPTE in UK|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 June 2013 |website=railway-technology.com|publisher=Kable |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> Under Supertram's numbering system, the seven units were numbered as 201-207; however, because part of their operation is on the [[National Rail]] network, they are required to be registered under the [[TOPS]] used for main line rail vehicles, which led them being classified as the Class 399.

A Network Rail spokesman stated at the time that the project would be delayed until 2017 and attributed this to the organisation having to wait for the needed permission of the transport secretary to carry out the construction of new track at Tinsley.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-34473670 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train scheme delayed by year\"] ''BBC News'', 8 October 2015.</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, the project was effectively delayed once again when it was announced that a 2017 start date would \"not be possible\".<ref name = \"bbc delaymay16\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-36315711 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train pilot delayed further.\"] ''BBC News'', 18 May 2016.</ref> Speaking at the time, Network Rail referred to the complexity present in elements of the design and planning of the envisioned tram-train operations, and that a thorough review of the programme was in the process of being conducted by the organisation and SYPTE.<ref name = \"bbc delaymay16\"/> Amongst the various changes required in advance of the new unit's operational use, the entirety of the Supertram network had to be re-profiled.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> In November 2016, while in the midst of a review of the associated programme of works, it was announced that full tram-train services would commence in summer 2018, having encountered factors which had necessitated yet another delay.<ref name=\"bbc delaynov16\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-38103252 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train scheme delayed further.\"] ''BBC News'', 25 November 2016.</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, a highly-critical parliamentary report on the developing tram-train programme was released.<ref name = \"report 17\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-42354784 \"Scathing report on Sheffield-Rotherham tram-train pilot.\"] ''BBC News'', 15 December 2017.</ref> According to the report, costs had risen to \u00a375.1 million, around five times of the original \u00a315 million budget originally allocated for the programme. It also found there to have been a \"high level of risk and uncertainty\" and \"\"unacceptable cost increases and delays\", while the DfT were criticised for failing to question if the project still offered value for money or fulfilled its goals.<ref name = \"report 17\"/>\n\n==Design==\nThe Class 399 is a dedicated tram-train unit. The primary purpose of the type is to operate the tram-train service between Sheffield and Rotherham; as such, it is designed to run on both the National Rail and Supertram networks.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> Each vehicle is composed of three articulated sections, which are fitted with a total of three motorised bogies and one unpowered trailer bogie, complete with a [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system. They are bi-directional units, which eliminates any need for turnaround facilities to be installed; rear-view camera displays are also present in the driver\u2019s cab for improved visibility and situational awareness.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nTo suit the two different networks, the Class 399 are dual voltage vehicles, capable of operating on both the 750 V [[OHLE]] of Supertram's network, and the 25 kV OHLE that is the standard on the [[National Rail]] network. Although the route to Rotherham will be electrified to the 750 V standard used on the rest of the Supertram network, the installation of dual voltage capability is to allow the vehicles to be [[future-proof]]ed if the [[Midland Main Line]] north of Sheffield is electrified.<ref name=\"engineer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railengineer.uk/2013/08/15/next-stop-rotherham-sheffields-new-tram-trains/ |title=Next stop Rotherham: Sheffield\u2019s new Tram Trains |last1=O'Connor |first1=Paul |date=15 August 2013 |website=The Rail Engineer |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref><ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The process for switching between the two different power supplies is automated by an integrated Automatic Power Control (APC) system. This system is triggered by a series of [[magnet]]s which have been embedded at key locations on the ground outside of the track, while the two power supplies are intentionally separated a neutral section of track.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> In practice, the vehicle travels over the first magnet to trigger the [[circuit breaker]]s to open, after which it coasts through the short neutral section before the new voltage is detected and the circuit breakers are closed again. While the APC provides an automated process for this, there is a manual override allowing the driver to close the circuit breaker if circumstance ever requires this to be done.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nThe Supertram lines and the National Rail network also use vastly different signalling systems.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> When travelling on the Supertram network, signals are primarily provided to the driver visually; the tram-trains also make use of the same vehicle identification system (VIS) as used by the conventional trams. In addition, for compatibility with running upon the National Rail network, the tram-trains are fitted with [[Train Protection & Warning System]] (TPWS) and [[GSM-R]] equipment.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> While TPWS is to be active during all operations, manual intervention by the driver is required to for the activation of the GSM-R apperatus each time that one of the vehicles enters onto the heavy rail line.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nIn order for the vehicle to be capable of running on both on-street tramways and the National Rail network, the profile of the wheels were required to suit the particularities of the rails on both systems.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The design team collaborated with the [[University of Huddersfield]], to develop a specially-designed wheel that fits both rail head profiles, which is claimed to reduce the rate of wear and mitigate against the risk of derailment. However, as the wheel profile was non-standard, permission had to be obtained from the [[Rail Safety and Standards Board]] before the new design could be adopted and subject to real-world testing.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> As a result of the vehicles being operated upon a heavy rail line, they are subject to higher [[crashworthiness]] standards than had been imposed upon the [[Siemens-Duewag Supertram|rest of Supertram's fleet]], meaning that these units will be the only ones capable of operating the tram-train service to Rotherham.<ref name=\"vossloh\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welovesheffield.uk/magazine/news/10-sheffield-to-rotherham-tram-train-plans.html |title=Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train plans  |last1=Hargreaves |first1=James |date=13 February 2014 |website=We Love Sheffield |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Supertram 399202 Donetsk.jpg|thumb|Supertram 202 on test at [[Donetsk Way tram stop|Donetsk Way]], April 2017]]\nIn January 2016, the first tram-train commenced active testing on the Supertram network.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> On 14 September 2017, the first Class 399 officially entered passenger service in a ceremony attended by the [[Ministry of Transport|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport]] [[Paul Maynard]] and various transport officials and representatives from [[Sheffield Children's Hospital]].<ref name = \"tram launch17\">[http://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2017/2017-09-14.aspx \"Minister launches first Citylink tram train into service.\"] ''Stagecoach'', 14 September 2017.</ref><ref>[http://www.metro-report.com/news/light-rail/single-view/view/sheffield-tram-train-enters-service.html \"Sheffield tram-train enters service.\"] ''[[Metro Report International]]'', 15 September 2017.</ref>  399202 was named ''Theo'', after the mascot of the city's children's hospital charity; in addition, tram passengers who travelled over the next two days made donations to the charity in place of the standard fare.<ref name = \"tram launch17\"/>\n\nIn addition to their tram-train functionality, the fleet has also been used to strengthen Supertram's existing assets, which has not been previously expanded since having been originally commissioned in 1992.

While it is a low floor [[tram]], it is also capable of being used upon the [[National Rail]] network; the Class 399 is the first [[tram-train]] to see operational use in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\nIn 2013, an order was placed with Vossloh for the construction of a batch of nine tram-trains for Supertram. It operates as a pioneering tram-train hybrid vehicle as part of an initial [[Pilot experiment|pilot]] of the operation of such vehicles.<ref name=\"approve\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsuk-approves-tram-train-pilot-south-yorkshire/ |title=UK approves Tram Train pilot for South Yorkshire |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 May 2012 |website=railway-technology.com |publisher=Kable |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> The launch of live services using the Class 399 was repeatedly delayed, reportedly due to planning and development-related difficulty experienced by [[Network Rail]], who were responsible for the installation of additional track and other infrastructure-related changes to accommodate the tram-trains upon the heavy rail network, as well as a necessary full track replacement programme performed by Supertram.\n\nIn January 2016, the first tram-train commenced live testing on the Supertram network. On 14 September 2017, the first entered passenger service, but the type was initially restricted to only some sections of Supertram's network as further work was still required on other parts, including Network Rail lines. Full service began on 25 October 2018. The results of the trials may become a decisive factor on the adoption of tram-train technology at various other sites across the country.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Class 399 at Cathedral tram stop.jpg|thumb|399201 at [[Cathedral tram stop]] in January 2020]]\n===Background===\nIn 2008, the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) announced plans to operate a trial [[tram-train]] service using the [[Penistone line]] in [[South Yorkshire]]. As initially envisioned, the trial was to function as two-year pilot programme, as the service would be the first use of combined tram-train operations anywhere in the UK.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The scheme was jointly delivered by the DfT, [[Sheffield Supertram]], [[Network Rail]], [[Northern Rail]] and the [[South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive]] (SYPTE). The adoption of tram-trains would allow Supertram services to travel on the national rail network, which had the advantages of opening up new routes, integrating multiple transit networks together, and potential for further expansion.<ref name = \"rail eng15\">Johnson, Marc. [https://www.railengineer.uk/2015/12/23/sheffield-tram-train-making-square-pegs-fit/ \"Sheffield tram-train: Making square pegs fit.\"] ''Rail Engineer'', 23 December 2015.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the local impact of the scheme, it has been anticipated that the trial could be invaluable to transport operators through the United Kingdom. Careful scrutiny is to be applied to the service's reliability and popularity; in the long run, the determined level of success could be a decisive factor on the further implementation of tram-train technology across the country.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> According to Rob Carroll, major projects manager at Supertram, the tram-train project team has been approached by multiple organisations, highlighting the interest expressed by representatives of the [[Manchester Metrolink]], transport managers studying options for a rail link to [[Glasgow Airport]], and personnel from [[South Wales]]. The prospect of being able to readily combine heavy and light rail networks together is considered to be an attractive prospect in some cities.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/><ref>Dickins, Sarah.

The revised proposal envisaged the use of the Supertram network, using a new link constructed to connect it to the [[Dearne Valley line]] to [[Rotherham]], that would then allow trams to operate on both [[heavy rail]] and [[light rail]] lines. As part of the project, the line would be electrified, allowing more cost-effective electric vehicles to be procured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8257652.stm |title=City tram-trains trial unveiled  |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=15 September 2009 |website=BBC News |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref> In May 2012, approval for the tram-train trial was granted by the DfT, along with a commitment of \u00a358 million towards the construction of a 400 meter chord to serve as the link between the Network Rail and Supertram networks, as well as the electrification of 8 miles of the route to Rotherham and the purchase of seven new tram-train vehicles.<ref name=\"approve\" />\n\nIn June 2013, [[MACOSA|Vossloh Espa\u00f1a]] was selected to construct the new tram-trains with the first scheduled to be delivered in September 2015.<ref name=\"vossloh\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/news/newsvossloh-espaa-deliver-seven-tram-trains-sypte-uk |title=Vossloh Espa\u00f1a to deliver seven tram trains to SYPTE in UK|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=21 June 2013 |website=railway-technology.com|publisher=Kable |accessdate=20 February 2015}}</ref> Under Supertram's numbering system, the seven units were numbered as 201-207; however, because part of their operation is on the [[National Rail]] network, they are required to be registered under the [[TOPS]] used for main line rail vehicles, which led them being classified as the Class 399.

A Network Rail spokesman stated at the time that the project would be delayed until 2017 and attributed this to the organisation having to wait for the needed permission of the transport secretary to carry out the construction of new track at Tinsley.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-34473670 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train scheme delayed by year\"] ''BBC News'', 8 October 2015.</ref>\n\nIn May 2016, the project was effectively delayed once again when it was announced that a 2017 start date would \"not be possible\".<ref name = \"bbc delaymay16\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-36315711 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train pilot delayed further.\"] ''BBC News'', 18 May 2016.</ref> Speaking at the time, Network Rail referred to the complexity present in elements of the design and planning of the envisioned tram-train operations, and that a thorough review of the programme was in the process of being conducted by the organisation and SYPTE.<ref name = \"bbc delaymay16\"/> Amongst the various changes required in advance of the new unit's operational use, the entirety of the Supertram network had to be re-profiled.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> In November 2016, while in the midst of a review of the associated programme of works, it was announced that full tram-train services would commence in summer 2018, having encountered factors which had necessitated yet another delay.<ref name=\"bbc delaynov16\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-38103252 \"Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train scheme delayed further.\"] ''BBC News'', 25 November 2016.</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, a highly-critical parliamentary report on the developing tram-train programme was released.<ref name = \"report 17\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-42354784 \"Scathing report on Sheffield-Rotherham tram-train pilot.\"] ''BBC News'', 15 December 2017.</ref> According to the report, costs had risen to \u00a375.1 million, around five times of the original \u00a315 million budget originally allocated for the programme. It also found there to have been a \"high level of risk and uncertainty\" and \"\"unacceptable cost increases and delays\", while the DfT were criticised for failing to question if the project still offered value for money or fulfilled its goals.<ref name = \"report 17\"/>\n\n==Design==\nThe Class 399 is a dedicated tram-train unit. The primary purpose of the type is to operate the tram-train service between Sheffield and Rotherham; as such, it is designed to run on both the National Rail and Supertram networks.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> Each vehicle is composed of three articulated sections, which are fitted with a total of three motorised bogies and one unpowered trailer bogie, complete with a [[pneumatics|pneumatic]] [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system. They are bi-directional units, which eliminates any need for turnaround facilities to be installed; rear-view camera displays are also present in the driver\u2019s cab for improved visibility and situational awareness.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nTo suit the two different networks, the Class 399 are dual voltage vehicles, capable of operating on both the 750 V [[OHLE]] of Supertram's network, and the 25 kV OHLE that is the standard on the [[National Rail]] network. Although the route to Rotherham will be electrified to the 750 V standard used on the rest of the Supertram network, the installation of dual voltage capability is to allow the vehicles to be [[future-proof]]ed if the [[Midland Main Line]] north of Sheffield is electrified.<ref name=\"engineer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.railengineer.uk/2013/08/15/next-stop-rotherham-sheffields-new-tram-trains/ |title=Next stop Rotherham: Sheffield\u2019s new Tram Trains |last1=O'Connor |first1=Paul |date=15 August 2013 |website=The Rail Engineer |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref><ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The process for switching between the two different power supplies is automated by an integrated Automatic Power Control (APC) system. This system is triggered by a series of [[magnet]]s which have been embedded at key locations on the ground outside of the track, while the two power supplies are intentionally separated a neutral section of track.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> In practice, the vehicle travels over the first magnet to trigger the [[circuit breaker]]s to open, after which it coasts through the short neutral section before the new voltage is detected and the circuit breakers are closed again. While the APC provides an automated process for this, there is a manual override allowing the driver to close the circuit breaker if circumstance ever requires this to be done.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nThe Supertram lines and the National Rail network also use vastly different signalling systems.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> When travelling on the Supertram network, signals are primarily provided to the driver visually; the tram-trains also make use of the same vehicle identification system (VIS) as used by the conventional trams. In addition, for compatibility with running upon the National Rail network, the tram-trains are fitted with [[Train Protection & Warning System]] (TPWS) and [[GSM-R]] equipment.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> While TPWS is to be active during all operations, manual intervention by the driver is required to for the activation of the GSM-R apperatus each time that one of the vehicles enters onto the heavy rail line.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/>\n\nIn order for the vehicle to be capable of running on both on-street tramways and the National Rail network, the profile of the wheels were required to suit the particularities of the rails on both systems.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> The design team collaborated with the [[University of Huddersfield]], to develop a specially-designed wheel that fits both rail head profiles, which is claimed to reduce the rate of wear and mitigate against the risk of derailment. However, as the wheel profile was non-standard, permission had to be obtained from the [[Rail Safety and Standards Board]] before the new design could be adopted and subject to real-world testing.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> As a result of the vehicles being operated upon a heavy rail line, they are subject to higher [[crashworthiness]] standards than had been imposed upon the [[Siemens-Duewag Supertram|rest of Supertram's fleet]], meaning that these units will be the only ones capable of operating the tram-train service to Rotherham.<ref name=\"vossloh\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.welovesheffield.uk/magazine/news/10-sheffield-to-rotherham-tram-train-plans.html |title=Sheffield to Rotherham tram-train plans  |last1=Hargreaves |first1=James |date=13 February 2014 |website=We Love Sheffield |publisher= |access-date=20 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\n[[File:Supertram 399202 Donetsk.jpg|thumb|Supertram 202 on test at [[Donetsk Way tram stop|Donetsk Way]], April 2017]]\nIn January 2016, the first tram-train commenced active testing on the Supertram network.<ref name = \"rail eng15\"/> On 14 September 2017, the first Class 399 officially entered passenger service in a ceremony attended by the [[Ministry of Transport|Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport]] [[Paul Maynard]] and various transport officials and representatives from [[Sheffield Children's Hospital]].<ref name = \"tram launch17\">[http://www.stagecoach.com/media/news-releases/2017/2017-09-14.aspx \"Minister launches first Citylink tram train into service.\"] ''Stagecoach'', 14 September 2017.</ref><ref>[http://www.metro-report.com/news/light-rail/single-view/view/sheffield-tram-train-enters-service.html \"Sheffield tram-train enters service.\"] ''[[Metro Report International]]'', 15 September 2017.</ref>  399202 was named ''Theo'', after the mascot of the city's children's hospital charity; in addition, tram passengers who travelled over the next two days made donations to the charity in place of the standard fare.<ref name = \"tram launch17\"/>\n\nIn addition to their tram-train functionality, the fleet has also been used to strengthen Supertram's existing assets, which has not been previously expanded since having been originally commissioned in 1992.
