It originally aired on July 24, 2002. This episode mocks [[moral panic]]s, and was the last to feature [[Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] as the \"fourth friend\" alongside Stan, Kyle and Cartman.\n\nIn the episode, the parents of South Park hire the owner and operator of the local City Wok, Mr. Tuong Lu Kim, to build a Great Wall around the city to protect their children from kidnappers. Just as Mr. Tuong Lu Kim almost finishes the wall, Mongolians arrive to try to break through. When a study reveals that nine out of ten abduction cases are committed by the mother or the father, the parents send their kids out on their own so they won't have a fear of being kidnapped by their parents.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, fans voted \"Child Abduction Is Not Funny\" as the best episode of Season 6.<ref>[http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/summer-of-south-park/season-6 Season 6] ''Summer of South Park''</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\nWith the media full of [[school shootings]], [[terrorism|terrorist]] threats and child abductions, the parents of South Park grow excessively concerned about the safety of their children. [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Tweek Tweak|Tweek]] is scared the most by the media reports, and his parents serve only to exacerbate his fears by turning their house into a virtual prison and playing cruel intellectual games with him designed by intention to increase his safety. As a result, Tweek loses his ability to empathize with others - even refusing to assist a crippled person stuck on some train tracks, who is then promptly killed by a train. After a real child abductor (pretending to be the \"Ghost of Human Kindness\") fails to kidnap Tweek, the parents of South Park are put on high alert.\n\nTaking advantage of expensive technology, the City commissions the owner of City Wok, [[List of recurring South Park characters#Tuong Lu Kim|Mr. Lu Kim]] to build a huge wall around the city similar to the [[Great Wall of China]]. Media reports continue to file in \u2014 it first convinces them they should not leave their children alone for a moment, prompting the parents to go with them anywhere they go. A later report convinces them they cannot even trust their own neighbors and family friends, forcing the parents to sever ties with each other. The kids, annoyed and embarrassed by their parents' actions, initially blame Tweek for their parents' paranoia, but soon decide that they'd have inevitably resorted to something this stupid eventually.\n\nDespite trying to avoid being a stereotype and having no experience in construction, Mr. Kim reluctantly agrees to build the wall. He builds a very impressive one single-handedly. After he is finished, a band of [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] appear out of nowhere and attack the wall because: \"Every time us Chinese put up a wall stupid Mongorianzh have to come and knock it down,\" as he puts it, in a reference to Chinese history. Although he tries desperately to rout the enemy by himself, he proves to be no match for the Mongols' increasingly clever tactics, which include redirecting a [[heat-seeking missile]] with a flaming [[baseball]] and making use of a [[Trojan Horse]] filled with sweet and sour pork. Enraged, Kim vows vengeance.\n\nMeanwhile, back within the town a news report states that the parents are most likely to abduct their own children. Blindly believing what they have been told, they send their children from the city in a tearful ceremony in order to avoid putting their children in danger of being kidnapped by their own parents. As they leave, the children wonder about how stupid their parents are sometimes.\n\nWithin the week, the children join forces with the Mongols, having apparently learned their language, and expressing anger at their parents' irresponsible and irrational behavior. The Mongols then move on the wall again, where Mr. Kim is dressed for battle. He then does his \"war dance\", but while he is doing this, the children wheel a large cart laden with explosives in behind him and blow up the wall. The parents arrive to investigate the explosion, and are reunited with their kids. They realize that they overreacted to the news stories, and that to cut themselves off from the rest of the world with the wall denies new possibilities. [[List of recurring South Park characters#Mayor McDaniels|Mayor McDaniels]] orders Mr. Lu Kim to \"[[tear down this wall]],\" angering him once more since building the wall was a waste of time. Despite the reunion, the parents believe their children have forgotten them in the short space of four days and use simple English to convince them to return home (with Stan muttering to Kyle, \"Jesus Christ, dude, they've done some stupid crap before, but Jesus Christ.\").\n\n==Production==\nAccording to the DVD commentary, the episode was done right after the creators saw the Elizabeth Smart abduction in Utah on the news. Parker and Stone came up with the line \"Goddamn Mongorianzh, no more breaking down my shitty warr!\" while on the [[Great Wall of China]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite video | people=[[Trey Parker|Parker, Trey]]|date = November 2005|title=South Park: The Complete Sixth Season: \"Free Hat\" |format= |medium= DVD \u2013 audio commentary|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nWhen Mr. Kim gets ready to shoot the heat seeking missile, he introduces it to the Mongolians saying \"Say herro to my rittre friend.\" This is a reference to the movie ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''.
