He was the younger son of Ralph Rymer, [[lord of the manor]] of [[Brafferton, North Yorkshire|Brafferton]] in Yorkshire, described by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] as possessed of a good estate.

This may have been due to the financial problems his father was suffering at the time, or the fact that on 13 October 1663 his father was arrested, and executed the following year, for his involvement in the [[Farnley Wood Plot]] to stage an uprising in Yorkshire against Charles II. Although Thomas's elder brother Ralph was also arrested and imprisoned, Thomas himself was not implicated, and on 2 May 1666, he became a member of [[Gray's Inn]], and was called to the bar on 16 June 1673.{{sfn |Lee |1897}}\n\n==Career==\nRymer's first appearance in print{{refn|A 1688 translation into English of [[William Bellenden]]'s ''Ciceronis Princeps'' (first published anonymously in Paris in 1608)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cicero's prince the reasons and counsels for settlement and good government of a kingdom, collected out of Cicero's works / by T.

He was the younger son of Ralph Rymer, [[lord of the manor]] of [[Brafferton, North Yorkshire|Brafferton]] in Yorkshire, described by [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Clarendon]] as possessed of a good estate. The father was executed for his part in the [[Farnley Wood Plot]] of 1663.

This may have been due to the financial problems his father was suffering at the time, or the fact that on 13 October 1663 his father was arrested, and executed the following year, for his involvement in the [[Farnley Wood Plot]] to stage an uprising in Yorkshire against Charles II. Although Thomas's elder brother Ralph was also arrested and imprisoned, Thomas himself was not implicated, and on 2 May 1666, he became a member of [[Gray's Inn]], and was called to the bar on 16 June 1673.{{sfn |Lee |1897}}\n\n==Career==\nRymer's first appearance in print{{refn|A 1688 translation into English of [[William Bellenden]]'s ''Ciceronis Princeps'' (first published anonymously in Paris in 1608)<ref>{{Cite book |title=Cicero's prince the reasons and counsels for settlement and good government of a kingdom, collected out of Cicero's works / by T.
