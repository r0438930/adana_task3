He was also a great exponent of the drop kick and the torpedo punt kick.\n\nAfter playing only five games in his debut season, Knights established himself in the first team in 1970. The following year he did so well in that position that he was chosen for Victoria, winning the Simpson Medal for the best on ground in the match against [[Western Australia Australian rules football team|Western Australia]] in Perth. However, he missed out on Hawthorn's [[1971 VFL Grand Final|1971 premiership]] success due to a knee injury.\n\nKnights was moved briefly to full-forward in 1972 after a serious knee injury to [[Peter Hudson]] forced Hawthorn to experiment in the position before finally settling on [[Michael Moncrieff]]. He actually finished as Hawthorn's leading goal-kicking with 46 goals, but was moved back to defence before the season was over. After injury problems restricted his 1973 season, for the next three years Knights was rated the best centre half-back in the game. In 1975, Knights finally had the chance to participate in the first of four Grand Finals. [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] were too good on the day, winning their first-ever Premiership. Knights was Hawthorn's best player on the day, and capped off a fine personal year by winning the club Best and Fairest award.\n\nKnights' stellar form continued into 1976 before he suffered a broken [[collarbone]] early in the match against {{AFL Foo}} in Round 14, which ruled him out for the next seven matches.<ref>{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Allsop|title=Footy Flashbacks: Round 14|date=22 June 2016|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-06-22/footy-flashbacks-round-14}}</ref> Despite this, Knights still managed to come second in the [[1976 Brownlow Medal]] count, polling an astonishing 45 votes to finish three votes behind Essendon's [[Graham Moss]]. He shrugged off that disappointment to be one of Hawthorn's best players in the [[1976 VFL Grand Final]] triumph, later joining some of his teammates at [[Peter Crimmins]]' bedside.\n\nFrom 1977 onwards Knights was frequently rested up forward to reduce the risk of injuries, but still did enough great work at centre half-back to finish one vote behind [[Malcolm Blight]] in the [[1978 Brownlow Medal]] count. He would shrug off the disappointment of finishing runner-up in the Brownlow by starring in the [[1978 VFL Grand Final]]. After being knocked out while playing in defence, Knights was moved forward in the last quarter, where he took a series of fine marks and kicked two goals to help secure Hawthorn's fourth Premiership. During his stellar 1978 season Knights also claimed his second Simpson Medal with a dominant display for Victoria against WA in Perth.\n\nThe litany of injuries that Knights had suffered through his career began to catch up with him, and from 1979 to 1981, he played in only 26 out of a possible 66 games. Amid rumours of retirement, Knights rebounded to play impressive football in his final years. In 1983, he booted six goals in the Qualifying Final to guide Hawthorn to a thrilling four-point win against [[Fitzroy Lions|Fitzroy]], and was again among the best players on the field as the Hawks crushed {{AFL Ess}} in the [[1983 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]]. \nKnights reached the 250-game milestone the following season against {{AFL StK}}, gathering 23 possessions and kicking two goals,<ref>{{cite web|title=The best 250th in Hawthorn history?|date=30 May 2016|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-05-30/the-best-250th-in-hawthorn-history|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au}}</ref> but a knee injury restricted him to just three further games. In 1985, Knights showed traces of brilliant form \u2013 kicking nine goals against {{AFL Car}} in Round 10. The Preliminary Final against {{AFL Foo}} would turn out to be his final VFL game. He had just four disposals, and was dropped for the Grand Final, a surprising decision for some people, given his reputation as a performer on the VFL's biggest stage. Yet again, Knights would bounce back from the disappointment to finish his career in a semblance of style, kicking a bag of goals to help Hawthorn defeat Carlton in the reserves Grand Final.\n\n== Coaching career ==\nAlthough Knights enjoyed spectacular success on the field, it was a different story as a coach. However, it should also be remembered that he was in charge of teams that were either relatively new and inexperienced (Brisbane), or undergoing restructuring (Hawthorn).\n\nIn 1986, the VFL decided to expand and include one team each from [[Western Australia]] and [[Queensland]]. The [[Brisbane Bears]], based on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[South East Queensland]], recruited Knights as their inaugural coach, despite his lack of coaching experience. The club won their first game, and although expectations of the new side were low, it was considered a significant achievement that the team was able to avoid finishing last in their first season.\n\nDespite this, the Bears' results in 1988 and 1989 failed to improve, with the club suffering regular thrashings. Besides the substandard quality of the training and playing facilities, lack of assistance from the VFL, and squad disharmony, Knights also had limited control over team selection; part way through the [[1988 VFL season]], he wanted star signing [[Warwick Capper]] dropped from the senior team due to poor form, but was overruled by club president [[Paul Cronin]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Pierik|publisher=The Age|date=6 May 2014|title=Warwick Capper's life with bad-news Bears|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/warwick-cappers-life-with-badnews-bears-20140506-zr5hn.html}}</ref> Knights was dismissed as coach with seven games remaining in the 1989 season<ref>[https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=hJsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aZEDAAAAIBAJ&dq=peter-knights%20sacked&pg=6691%2C6848905 Shock and tears at golden boy's demise]</ref> and replaced with team [[psychologist]], [[Paul Feltham]]. Knights was considered to have been unlucky, as ineffective club management and poor relationships amongst his underperforming players seen as major contributing factors in the club's performance.\n\nAfter a brief coaching stint at Tasmanian club [[Devonport Football Club|Devonport]] from 1990 to 1993,<ref>http://www.devonportfc.com.au/history/listOnePositionType?positiontype=Senior%20Coach</ref> Knights returned to Hawthorn as senior coach for the 1994 AFL season. He managed to lead the team into the finals series, but were knocked out by {{AFL NM}} in the first final. The following year the team finished second last, however, and Knights was again sacked.\n\nIn 2009, Knights was appointed senior representative coach of the [[Victorian Country Football League]] and held the position until 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hawthorn great Peter Knights to call it a day|date=29 April 2016|first=Hannah|last=Driscoll|publisher=The Weekly Times|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/hawthorn-great-peter-knights-to-call-it-a-day/news-story/6215bc33e92cd6766ea78986ff3af82d}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n: ''Statistics are correct to the end of the 2016 season''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/P/Peter_Knights.html|title=Peter Knights \u2013 Stats|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend}}\n{{AFL player statistics start}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1969 VFL season|1969]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 5 || 3 || 1 || 34 || 9 || 43 || 10 || - || 0.6 || 0.2 || 6.8 || 1.8 || 8.6 || 2.0 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1970 VFL season|1970]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 5 || 0 || 265 || 28 || 293 || 84 || - || 0.3 || 0.0 || 14.7 || 1.6 || 16.3 || 4.7 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1971 VFL season|1971]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 4 || 1 || 320 || 29 || 349 || 130 || - || 0.2 || 0.0 || 14.5 || 1.3 || 15.9 || 5.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1972 VFL season|1972]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 20 || 46 || 27 || 247 || 15 || 262 || 111 || - || 2.3 || 1.4 || 12.4 || 0.8 || 13.1 || 5.6 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1973 VFL season|1973]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 15 || 8 || 5 || 157 || 30 || 187 || 50 || - || 0.5 || 0.3 || 10.5 || 2.0 || 12.5 || 3.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1974 VFL season|1974]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 24 || 1 || 1 || 328 || 39 || 367 || 121 || - || 0.0 || 0.0 || 13.7 || 1.6 || 15.3 || 5.0 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1975 VFL season|1975]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 3 || 4 || 326 || 35 || 361 || 123 || - || 0.1 || 0.2 || 14.2 || 1.5 || 15.7 || 5.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1976 VFL season|1976]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 2 || 0 || 241 || 46 || 287 || 76 || - || 0.1 || 0.0 || 13.4 || 2.6 || 15.9 || 4.2 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1977 VFL season|1977]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 19 || 15 || 8 || 222 || 70 || 292 || 82 || - || 0.8 || 0.4 || 11.7 || 3.7 || 15.4 || 4.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1978 VFL season|1978]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 8 || 10 || 329 || 105 || 434 || 142 || - || 0.4 || 0.5 || 15.0 || 4.8 || 19.7 || 6.5 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1979 VFL season|1979]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 11 || 10 || 7 || 143 || 54 || 197 || 53 || - || 0.9 || 0.6 || 13.0 || 4.9 || 17.9 || 4.8 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1980 VFL season|1980]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 7 || 1 || 3 || 79 || 24 || 103 || 25 || - || 0.1 || 0.4 || 11.3 || 3.4 || 14.7 || 3.6 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1981 VFL season|1981]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 8 || 1 || 2 || 91 || 39 || 130 || 47 || - || 0.1 || 0.3 || 11.4 || 4.9 || 16.3 || 5.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1982 VFL season|1982]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 14 || 14 || 18 || 141 || 52 || 193 || 54 || - || 1.0 || 1.3 || 10.1 || 3.7 || 13.8 || 3.9 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1983 VFL season|1983]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 38 || 29 || 279 || 108 || 387 || 144 || - || 1.8 || 1.4 || 13.3 || 5.1 || 18.4 || 6.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1984 VFL season|1984]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 4 || 5 || 3 || 33 || 13 || 46 || 21 || - || 1.3 || 0.8 || 8.3 || 3.3 || 11.5 || 5.3 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1985 VFL season|1985]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 13 || 37 || 19 || 121 || 23 || 144 || 75 || - || 2.8 || 1.5 || 9.3 || 1.8 || 11.1 || 5.8 || -\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 264\n! 201\n! 138\n! 3356\n! 719\n! 4075\n! 1348\n! -\n! 0.8\n! 0.5\n! 12.7\n! 2.7\n! 15.4\n! 5.1\n! -\n|}\n\n== Personal life ==\nKnights had a son, Benjamin, in 1978 with his first wife Julie.

After being knocked out while playing in defence, Knights was moved forward in the last quarter, where he took a series of fine marks and kicked two goals to help secure Hawthorn's fourth Premiership. During his stellar 1978 season Knights also claimed his second Simpson Medal with a dominant display for Victoria against WA in Perth.\n\nThe litany of injuries that Knights had suffered through his career began to catch up with him, and from 1979 to 1981, he played in only 26 out of a possible 66 games. Amid rumours of retirement, Knights rebounded to play impressive football in his final years. In 1983, he booted six goals in the Qualifying Final to guide Hawthorn to a thrilling four-point win against [[Fitzroy Lions|Fitzroy]], and was again among the best players on the field as the Hawks crushed {{AFL Ess}} in the [[1983 VFL Grand Final|Grand Final]]. \nKnights reached the 250-game milestone the following season against {{AFL StK}}, gathering 23 possessions and kicking two goals,<ref>{{cite web|title=The best 250th in Hawthorn history?|date=30 May 2016|url=http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/2016-05-30/the-best-250th-in-hawthorn-history|publisher=hawthornfc.com.au}}</ref> but a knee injury restricted him to just three further games. In 1985, Knights showed traces of brilliant form \u2013 kicking nine goals against {{AFL Car}} in Round 10. The Preliminary Final against {{AFL Foo}} would turn out to be his final VFL game. He had just four disposals, and was dropped for the Grand Final, a surprising decision for some people, given his reputation as a performer on the VFL's biggest stage. Yet again, Knights would bounce back from the disappointment to finish his career in a semblance of style, kicking a bag of goals to help Hawthorn defeat Carlton in the reserves Grand Final.\n\n== Coaching career ==\nAlthough Knights enjoyed spectacular success on the field, it was a different story as a coach. However, it should also be remembered that he was in charge of teams that were either relatively new and inexperienced (Brisbane), or undergoing restructuring (Hawthorn).\n\nIn 1986, the VFL decided to expand and include one team each from [[Western Australia]] and [[Queensland]]. The [[Brisbane Bears]], based on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[South East Queensland]], recruited Knights as their inaugural coach, despite his lack of coaching experience. The club won their first game, and although expectations of the new side were low, it was considered a significant achievement that the team was able to avoid finishing last in their first season.\n\nDespite this, the Bears' results in 1988 and 1989 failed to improve, with the club suffering regular thrashings. Besides the substandard quality of the training and playing facilities, lack of assistance from the VFL, and squad disharmony, Knights also had limited control over team selection; part way through the [[1988 VFL season]], he wanted star signing [[Warwick Capper]] dropped from the senior team due to poor form, but was overruled by club president [[Paul Cronin]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Jon|last=Pierik|publisher=The Age|date=6 May 2014|title=Warwick Capper's life with bad-news Bears|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/warwick-cappers-life-with-badnews-bears-20140506-zr5hn.html}}</ref> Knights was dismissed as coach with seven games remaining in the 1989 season<ref>[https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=hJsQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aZEDAAAAIBAJ&dq=peter-knights%20sacked&pg=6691%2C6848905 Shock and tears at golden boy's demise]</ref> and replaced with team [[psychologist]], [[Paul Feltham]]. Knights was considered to have been unlucky, as ineffective club management and poor relationships amongst his underperforming players seen as major contributing factors in the club's performance.\n\nAfter a brief coaching stint at Tasmanian club [[Devonport Football Club|Devonport]] from 1990 to 1993,<ref>http://www.devonportfc.com.au/history/listOnePositionType?positiontype=Senior%20Coach</ref> Knights returned to Hawthorn as senior coach for the 1994 AFL season. He managed to lead the team into the finals series, but were knocked out by {{AFL NM}} in the first final. The following year the team finished second last, however, and Knights was again sacked.\n\nIn 2009, Knights was appointed senior representative coach of the [[Victorian Country Football League]] and held the position until 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hawthorn great Peter Knights to call it a day|date=29 April 2016|first=Hannah|last=Driscoll|publisher=The Weekly Times|url=http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/sport/country-football/hawthorn-great-peter-knights-to-call-it-a-day/news-story/6215bc33e92cd6766ea78986ff3af82d}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n: ''Statistics are correct to the end of the 2016 season''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/stats/players/P/Peter_Knights.html|title=Peter Knights \u2013 Stats|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=16 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{AFL player statistics legend}}\n{{AFL player statistics start}}\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1969 VFL season|1969]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 5 || 3 || 1 || 34 || 9 || 43 || 10 || - || 0.6 || 0.2 || 6.8 || 1.8 || 8.6 || 2.0 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1970 VFL season|1970]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 5 || 0 || 265 || 28 || 293 || 84 || - || 0.3 || 0.0 || 14.7 || 1.6 || 16.3 || 4.7 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1971 VFL season|1971]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 4 || 1 || 320 || 29 || 349 || 130 || - || 0.2 || 0.0 || 14.5 || 1.3 || 15.9 || 5.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1972 VFL season|1972]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 20 || 46 || 27 || 247 || 15 || 262 || 111 || - || 2.3 || 1.4 || 12.4 || 0.8 || 13.1 || 5.6 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1973 VFL season|1973]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 15 || 8 || 5 || 157 || 30 || 187 || 50 || - || 0.5 || 0.3 || 10.5 || 2.0 || 12.5 || 3.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1974 VFL season|1974]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 24 || 1 || 1 || 328 || 39 || 367 || 121 || - || 0.0 || 0.0 || 13.7 || 1.6 || 15.3 || 5.0 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1975 VFL season|1975]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 23 || 3 || 4 || 326 || 35 || 361 || 123 || - || 0.1 || 0.2 || 14.2 || 1.5 || 15.7 || 5.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1976 VFL season|1976]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 18 || 2 || 0 || 241 || 46 || 287 || 76 || - || 0.1 || 0.0 || 13.4 || 2.6 || 15.9 || 4.2 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1977 VFL season|1977]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 19 || 15 || 8 || 222 || 70 || 292 || 82 || - || 0.8 || 0.4 || 11.7 || 3.7 || 15.4 || 4.3 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1978 VFL season|1978]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 22 || 8 || 10 || 329 || 105 || 434 || 142 || - || 0.4 || 0.5 || 15.0 || 4.8 || 19.7 || 6.5 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1979 VFL season|1979]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 11 || 10 || 7 || 143 || 54 || 197 || 53 || - || 0.9 || 0.6 || 13.0 || 4.9 || 17.9 || 4.8 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1980 VFL season|1980]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 7 || 1 || 3 || 79 || 24 || 103 || 25 || - || 0.1 || 0.4 || 11.3 || 3.4 || 14.7 || 3.6 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1981 VFL season|1981]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 8 || 1 || 2 || 91 || 39 || 130 || 47 || - || 0.1 || 0.3 || 11.4 || 4.9 || 16.3 || 5.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1982 VFL season|1982]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 14 || 14 || 18 || 141 || 52 || 193 || 54 || - || 1.0 || 1.3 || 10.1 || 3.7 || 13.8 || 3.9 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1983 VFL season|1983]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 21 || 38 || 29 || 279 || 108 || 387 || 144 || - || 1.8 || 1.4 || 13.3 || 5.1 || 18.4 || 6.9 || -\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1984 VFL season|1984]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 4 || 5 || 3 || 33 || 13 || 46 || 21 || - || 1.3 || 0.8 || 8.3 || 3.3 || 11.5 || 5.3 || -\n|- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\"\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center\" | [[1985 VFL season|1985]]\n|{{AFL Haw}}\n| 24 || 13 || 37 || 19 || 121 || 23 || 144 || 75 || - || 2.8 || 1.5 || 9.3 || 1.8 || 11.1 || 5.8 || -\n|- class=\"sortbottom\"\n! colspan=3| Career\n! 264\n! 201\n! 138\n! 3356\n! 719\n! 4075\n! 1348\n! -\n! 0.8\n! 0.5\n! 12.7\n! 2.7\n! 15.4\n! 5.1\n! -\n|}\n\n== Personal life ==\nKnights had a son, Benjamin, in 1978 with his first wife Julie.
