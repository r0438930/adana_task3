The extent of this difference has been the subject of debate among customizers and rodders for decades. Additionally, a [[street rod (car)|street rod]] can be considered a custom.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nCustom cars are not to be confused with [[coachbuilder|coachbuilt]] automobiles, historically [[rolling chassis]] fitted with luxury bodywork by specialty body builders.\n\n==History==\n[[File:T-bucket.jpg|thumb|The iconic \"[[T-bucket]]\" custom, with characteristic exposed engine, flat windshield, headers, and open pipes. Soft top (shown) is optional. Also features chrome five-spoke wheels, dropped tube axle, transverse front [[leaf spring]], front [[disc brake]]s, open-face [[air filter|aircleaner]], Weiand [[valve cover]]s, and single [[carburetor#Multiple carburetor barrels|4-barrel]] (probably a [[Rochester Products Division|QJ]]).]]<!--And don't go taking this out & claiming you can't see it; I shot the pictures myself!-->\n[[File:Rat rod flatty.jpg|thumb|\"Rat rodded\" [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Model A]] with [[Edelbrock]] [[cylinder head|head]] and chrome carb hats on late-model [[Ford V8|flatty]]]]\n\nA development of hot rodding, the change in name corresponded to the change in the [[design]] of the cars being modified. The first hot rods were pre-[[World War II]] cars, with [[running board]]s and simple fenders over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with light cycle fenders. Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The \"gow job\" morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.16.</ref> Typical of builds from before World War II were 1935 Ford [[wire wheel]]s.<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.18.</ref>\n\nMany cars were \"hopped up\" with engine modifications such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts. [[Engine swap]]s were often done, with the objective of placing the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination.<ref name=\"Custom history\">{{cite web|url= http://www.yourcustomcar.com/custom-car-history.html |title=The evolution of custom cars |accessdate=2016-10-11}}</ref> The suspension was usually altered, initially by lowering the rear end as much as possible using lowering blocks on the rear springs. Later cars were given a rake job by either adding a dropped front axle or heating front coil springs to make the front end of the car much lower than the rear. Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic (\"juice\") brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, pp.18\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, pp.18 and 20.</ref>\n\nThe mid-1950s and early 1960s custom Deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the {{convert|239|cid|cc|abbr=on}} flatty, introduced in 1939<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\">Shelton, p.20.</ref>); a [[Halibrand]] quick-change rearend was also typical, and an [[Edelbrock]] [[intake manifold]] or Harman and Collins [[ignition magneto]] would not be uncommon.<ref>Shelton, pp.17-18.</ref> Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\"/> Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro,<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\">Shelton, p.20 caption.</ref> [[Edelbrock|Vic Edelbrock]], and [[Offenhauser]]. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a \"slingshot\" design for the flatty.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\"/> Front suspension hairpins were adapted from [[sprint car]]s, such as the [[Kurtis Kraft]]s.<ref>Shelton, p.24 and p.26 caption.</ref> The first Jimmy [[Supercharging|supercharger]] on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.<ref>Shelton, p.26 caption.</ref>\n\nMuch later, rods and customs swapped the old solid rear axle for an independent rear, often from [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]. Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced another; the 1937 [[Buick]] grille was often used on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]. The original hot rods were plainly painted like the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A Fords]] from which they had been built up, and only slowly begun to take on colors, and eventually fancy orange-yellow flamed hoods or \"candy-like\" deep acrylic finishes in the various colors.<ref name=\"Custom history\" />\n\nWith the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, tremendous automotive advertising raised public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Thus, custom cars came into existence, swapping [[headlamp]] rings, grilles, bumpers, [[Chrome plating|chrome]] side strips, and taillights as well as [[Frenching (automobile)|frenching]] and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding [[lead]] to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term [[lead sled]]; [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] has since largely replaced lead.) [[Chopped and channeled#Chopping|Chopping]] made the roof lower<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/78, p.64.</ref> while [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]]<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.15; ''Custom Rodder'' 1/97, p.29.</ref> made the body thinner from top to bottom. [[Chopped and channeled#Channeling|Channeling]]<ref>Jezek, George. \"The All Deuce Round-Up\", in ''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.58.</ref> was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon. ''[[Juxtapoz Magazine]]'', founded by the artist [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], has covered [[Kustom Kulture]] art.\n\n==Customization style==\n[[File:Fuzzy dice 2.jpg|thumb|'55-7 Chevy with fuzzy dice]] <!--fuzzy dice are practically required-->\n[[File:Ed Roth 'bloodshot eyeball'.jpg|thumb|[[Ed Roth|'Big Daddy' Roth]] 'bloodshot eyeball' [[shift knob]] was a 1960s craze.]]\n\nCustom cars are distinct from cars in stock condition. Builders may adopt the visual and performance characteristics of some relevant modification styles, and combine these as desired. There are now several different custom themes, including:\n* [[Rat rod]]: imitates (or exaggerates) the \"unfinished\" and amateur-built appearance of hot rods of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s\n* Restomod - restored and modernized. Safety and convenience upgrades, such as disc brakes, AC, etc., but can include fuel injection and overdrive upgrades, etc. Externally might resemble a stock car with period correct mods rather than customs.\n* Street machines: Typically American cars with large-displacement engines modified for speed and often appearance.\n* Street rod - consist largely of period specific vehicles and components, or emulate visual characteristics of cars through the'40s vintage. There is a great deal of overlap here with [[hot rod]]s.\n\n==Features==\n===Paint===\n[[File:'34 3-window flame job.JPG|thumb|'32 three-window with a classic-style flame job and [[Dean Moon|Moon]] tank, reminiscent of [[Pete Chapouris|Chapouris]]' [[The California Kid (custom car)|''California Kid'']]]]\nPaint was an important concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and [[metalflake]] paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect \u2013 which in hot climates had a tendency to flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.\n\nCustomizers also continued the habit of adding decorative paint after the main coat was finished, of flames extending rearward from the front wheels, scallops, and hand-painted pinstripes of a contrasting color. The base color, most often a single coat, would be expected to be of a simpler paint. [[Flame job (painting technique)|Flame jobs]] later spread to the hood, encompassing the entire front end, and have progressed from traditional reds and yellows to blues and greens and body-color \"ghost\" flames. One particular style of flames, called \"crab claw flames\", which is still prevalent today, is attributed to Dean Jeffries.<ref>Hotrod magazine, 1999.</ref>\n\nPainting has become such a part of the custom car scene that now in many custom car competitions, awards for custom paint are as highly sought after as awards for the cars themselves.\n\n===Engine swaps===\nEngine swaps have always been commonplace. Once, the [[Ford flathead V8 engine]] was the preference, supplanted by the [[Chrysler FirePower engine|early hemi]] in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, the [[Chevrolet small-block engine#Small block Chevrolet V8 (1955\u20131998)|small-block Chevy]] was the most common option, and since the 1980s, the {{convert|350|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Chevy has been almost ubiquitous.<ref>See any issue of ''Street Rodder'', for instance.</ref> The {{convert|325|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[GM small-block engine#Generation III (1997\u20132007)|Chevrolet LS]] has begun replacing the 350.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Flatheads and early hemis have not entirely disappeared, but ready availability, ease of maintenance, and low cost of parts make the Chevrolet V8, in particular the first and third generation small block, the most frequent engine of choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOnce customizing post-war cars caught on, some of the practices were extended to pre-war cars, which would have been called fendered rods, with more body work done on them. An alternate rule for disambiguation developed: hot rods had the engine behind the front suspension, while customs had the engine over the front suspension. The clearest example of this is [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] prior to 1949 had [[Henry Ford]]'s old transverse front suspension, while 1949 models had a more modern suspension with the engine moved forward. However, an American museum has what could be the first true custom, built by [[Cletus Clobes]] in 1932, among its exhibits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | title=1932 Clobes | publisher=Wheels Through Time Museum | accessdate=2010-10-31 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928062921/http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | archivedate=2008-09-28 }}</ref> With the coming of the muscle car, and further to the high-performance luxury car, customization declined. One place where it persisted was the U.S. Southwest, where [[lowrider]]s were built similar in concept to the earlier customs, but of post-1950s cars.\n\nAs the supply of usable antique steel bodies has decreased, companies such [[Westcott Auto Restyling|Westcott's]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.44.</ref> [[Harwood Street Rods|Harwood]], [[Gibbon Fiberglass]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\">''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> and [[Speedway Motors]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\"/> have begun to fabricate new [[fiberglass]] copies,<ref>See, for instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.183.</ref> while [[Classic Manufacturing and Supply]], for one example, has been making a variety of new steel bodies since the 1970s.<ref>''Street Rodder'', 7/94, pp.132-4.</ref> California's \"junker\" (or \"crusher\") law, which pays a nominal sum to take \"gross polluters\" off the road, has been criticized by enthusiasts (and by SEMA) for accelerating this trend.<ref>See, for instance, Dick Wells column \"SRMA Update\", ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.234.</ref> Starting in the 1950s, it became popular among customizers to display their vehicles at drive-in restaurants, such as [[Johnie's Broiler]] in [[Downey, California]]. The practice continues in Southern California.\n\n==Customizers==\nExamples of notable customizers include [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], [[Vini Bergeman]], [[Bill Cushenberry]], the [[The Alexander Brothers|Alexander Brothers]], [[Gil Ayala]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.60.</ref> [[Darryl Starbird]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\">''Street Rodder'', 1/85, p.56.</ref> [[Roy Brizio]], [[Troy Trepanier]] (of [[Rad Rides by Troy]]), [[Boyd Coddington]], [[Darryl Hollenbeck]] (working out of at Vintage Color Studios; winner of the 2016 [[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]] (AMBR) trophy with a custom Deuce)<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\"/> [[Harry Westergaard]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.55.</ref> [[Dave Stuckey]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> [[Dean Jeffries]], [[Barry Lobeck]], [[Phil Cool]] (who won the 1978 AMBR trophy with a bright orange Deuce, cover car for the July 1978 issue of ''Hot Rod''),<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.23.</ref> [[Troy Ladd]] of [[Hollywood Hot Rods]], [[Doane Spencer]] (builder of a 1940s Deuce considered the template for the hiboy),<ref>Shelton, p.29.</ref> [[Ken Fenical|\"Posie\"]],<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/85, p.5.</ref> [[Ron Clark (customizer)|Ron Clark]] and [[Bob Kaiser (customizer)|Bob Kaiser]] (of [[Clarkaiser Custom]]s),<ref>Fetherston, David, \"Detroit Dreams\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.58.</ref> [[Joe Bailon]]<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> (inventor of candy apple paint),<ref>Ganahl, Pat, \"The Candy Man\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.81.</ref> [[Gene Winfield]], [[Rick Dore]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTCkZlTKrGsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22Rick+dore%22&source=bl&ots=5Kr7TMRKmR&sig=SAqsQAkP_wAUlEwNlKsxvLkTm6w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ze8nU4CeA-jhyQGb9IGQDw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22Rick+dore%22&f=false|title=Art of the Hot Rod|first=Ken|last=Gross|date=June 19, 2012|publisher=Motorbooks|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Joe Wilhelm]], [[Dick Megugorac|\"Magoo\"]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 12/98, p.206.</ref> [[Chip Foose]],<ref>Bishop, Mike, \"The 45th Grand National Roadster Show\", in ''American Rodder'', 6/94, p.27.</ref> and [[Pete Chapouris]].\n\nOthers, such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]], are best known as custom painters. Several customizers have become famous beyond the automobile community, including Barris, Jeffries, and Coddington, thanks to their proximity to [[Hollywood]]; Barris designed TV's [[Batmobile]], while Chapouris built the [[The California Kid (custom car)|flamed '34 three-window coup\u00e9]] in the eponymous [[television film|telefilm]] \"[[The California Kid]]\". Another Barris creation, [[Ala Kart (custom car)|''Ala Kart'']] (a '29 Ford [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] roadster pickup), made numerous appearances in film (usually in the background of diner scenes and such), after taking two AMBR wins in a row. Some customizers have become well-enough known to be referred to by given name alone. These include Boyd (Coddington), Pete (Chapouris), and Jake (Jim Jacobs).\n\n==Awards==\nThe highest award for customizers is the AMBR ([[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]]) trophy, presented annually at the Grand National Roadster Show since 1948 (also known within the customizer community as the Oakland Roadster Show until it was moved to Southern California in 2003). This competition has produced famous, and radical, customs.\n\nAnother is the [[Ridler Award]], presented at the [[Detroit Autorama]] since 1964 in honor of show promoter Don Ridler. With one of the most unusual of car show entry requirements, winners of the prestigious Ridler Award are selected as the most outstanding from among cars being shown for the first time. This prompts builders of many high-end roadsters to first enter the Autorama first and then the Grand National show in order to have the chance to win top honors at both shows. Few cars and owners can claim this achievement.\n\n==Notable customs==\nSome customs gained attention for winning the AMBR trophy, or for their outlandish styling. Notable among these is [[Silhouette (show car)|''Silhouette'']] and [[Ed Roth]]'s [[Mysterion (show rod)|''Mysterion'']]. Some of these more unusual projects turned into [[Hot Wheels]] cars, among them [[The Red Baron (custom car)|''The Red Baron'']].\n\nOther custom cars became notable for appearances in film (such as ''Ala Kart'' {1958},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29 sidebar.</ref> ''The California Kid'' three-window {1973},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29.</ref> or the yellow deuce from \"[[American Graffiti]]\" {1973}) or television (such as ''The [[Monkeemobile]]'', the [[The Munsters|\"Munsters\"]] hearse, or, more recently, Boyd's full-custom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Tool Time'']] '34, or [[Don Thelan]]'s<ref>Gingerelli, Dain. \"Jake's '34\".

Specialist vehicles, such as the [[Pontiac Trans-Am|T/A]], [[KITT]], from [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|''Knight Rider'']], are not usually considered customs, but movie or TV cars, because they retain a mostly stock exterior.\n\nStill others exemplified a trend. One of these is the '51 Merc built by the Barris brothers for Bob Hirohata in 1953, known forever after as the [[Hirohata Merc]]. Even without an appearance in film (\"Runnin' Wild\"), it is iconic of 1950s customs, and of how to do a Merc right.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, pp.8 & 10.</ref> The same year, [[Neil Emory]] and [[Clayton Jensen]] of [[Valley Custom Shop]] built [[Polynesian (custom car)|''Polynesian'']] for Jack Stewart, starting with a '50 [[Oldsmobile 88#First generation (1949\u20131953)|Holiday 88 sedan]].<ref>[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)</ref> ''Polynesian'' made the cover of [[Hot Rod Magazine|''Hot Rod'']] in August, and saw 54 pages of construction details in ''[[Motor Trend]] Custom Car Annual'' in 1954.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.68.</ref>\n\n==Language==<!--linked from [[Chevrolet Corvette C2]] -->\n[[File:'28 A roadster.jpg|thumb|'28 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|A]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] with [[Kelsey-Hayes]] [[wire wheel]]s]]\n\nCertain linguistic conventions are followed among rodders and customizers:\n* The [[model year]] is rarely given in full,<ref>For instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, ''passim''; ''Rod Action'', 2/78, ''passim''; ''Hot Rod'', October 1987, pp,8, 10, 18, 20, & 22.</ref> except when it might be confused, so a 1934 model is a '34, while a 2005 might be an '05 or not.\n** A '32 is usually a Deuce and most often a roadster, unless [[coup\u00e9]] is specified, and almost always a Ford, now commonly on [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|A]] [[chassis|frame rails]].<ref name=\"Fortier, Rob p.136\">Fortier, Rob. \"\"A Little Pinch Here, A Little Tuck There\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.136.</ref>\n** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 is usually a Chevrolet.\n** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 Chevrolet is often called a [[Tri-Five]].\n* A 3- or 5-window is usually a Ford, unless specified.\n* A flatty is a [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V8]]<ref>''American Rodder'', 6/94, pp.45 & 93.</ref> (always Ford, unless specified); a late (or late model) flatty is probably a [[Mercury (automobile)|Merc]].\n* A [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hemi design reintroduced|hemi]] (\"''hem'' ee\") is always a 426, unless displacement (331, 354, or 392) is specified;<ref>Geisert, Eric. \"Tom's Fun Run\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.149cap.</ref> a 426 is a hemi, unless [[Chrysler RB engine#426|Wedge]] is specified.

Many custom car shows will only accept 1948 and earlier models as entries, and many custom car organizations will not admit later model cars or trucks (also with some imports - this has been a gray area of what's acceptable e.g. an aircooled VW Beetle, a Big Three product manufactured overseas e.g. a [[Ford Capri]] built in the UK or a [[Holden|General Motors - Holden's]] product, not to mention [[captive imports|captives]]), and/or a vintage import automobile with an American driveline transplant but this practice is subject to change. Modern day custom car shows which allow the inclusion of [[muscle car]]s have used the 1972 model year as the cutoff since it is considered the end of the muscle car era prior to the introduction of the [[catalytic converter]]. The NSRA has announced that starting in 2011 it will switch to a shifting year method where any owner with a car 30 years or older will be allowed membership. So in 2011 the owner of a 1981 model year vehicle will qualify, then in 2012 the owner of a 1982 model year vehicle will quality, and so on.

Additionally, a [[street rod (car)|street rod]] can be considered a custom.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nCustom cars are not to be confused with [[coachbuilder|coachbuilt]] automobiles, historically [[rolling chassis]] fitted with luxury bodywork by specialty body builders.\n\n==History==\n[[File:T-bucket.jpg|thumb|The iconic \"[[T-bucket]]\" custom, with characteristic exposed engine, flat windshield, headers, and open pipes. Soft top (shown) is optional. Also features chrome five-spoke wheels, dropped tube axle, transverse front [[leaf spring]], front [[disc brake]]s, open-face [[air filter|aircleaner]], Weiand [[valve cover]]s, and single [[carburetor#Multiple carburetor barrels|4-barrel]] (probably a [[Rochester Products Division|QJ]]).]]<!--And don't go taking this out & claiming you can't see it; I shot the pictures myself!-->\n[[File:Rat rod flatty.jpg|thumb|\"Rat rodded\" [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|Model A]] with [[Edelbrock]] [[cylinder head|head]] and chrome carb hats on late-model [[Ford V8|flatty]]]]\n\nA development of hot rodding, the change in name corresponded to the change in the [[design]] of the cars being modified. The first hot rods were pre-[[World War II]] cars, with [[running board]]s and simple fenders over the wheels. Early model cars (1929 to 1934) were modified by removing the running boards and either removing the fenders entirely or replacing them with light cycle fenders. Later models usually had fender skirts installed. The \"gow job\" morphed into the hot rod in the early to middle 1950s.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.16.</ref> Typical of builds from before World War II were 1935 Ford [[wire wheel]]s.<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.18.</ref>\n\nMany cars were \"hopped up\" with engine modifications such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and dual exhausts. [[Engine swap]]s were often done, with the objective of placing the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination.<ref name=\"Custom history\">{{cite web|url= http://www.yourcustomcar.com/custom-car-history.html |title=The evolution of custom cars |accessdate=2016-10-11}}</ref> The suspension was usually altered, initially by lowering the rear end as much as possible using lowering blocks on the rear springs. Later cars were given a rake job by either adding a dropped front axle or heating front coil springs to make the front end of the car much lower than the rear. Immediately postwar, most rods would change from mechanical to hydraulic (\"juice\") brakes and from bulb to sealed-beam headlights.<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, pp.18\">Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, pp.18 and 20.</ref>\n\nThe mid-1950s and early 1960s custom Deuce was typically fenderless and steeply chopped, and almost all Ford (or Mercury, with the {{convert|239|cid|cc|abbr=on}} flatty, introduced in 1939<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\">Shelton, p.20.</ref>); a [[Halibrand]] quick-change rearend was also typical, and an [[Edelbrock]] [[intake manifold]] or Harman and Collins [[ignition magneto]] would not be uncommon.<ref>Shelton, pp.17-18.</ref> Reproduction spindles, brake drums, and backing based on the 1937s remain available today.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20\"/> Aftermarket flatty heads were available from Barney Navarro,<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\">Shelton, p.20 caption.</ref> [[Edelbrock|Vic Edelbrock]], and [[Offenhauser]]. The first intake manifold Edelbrock sold was a \"slingshot\" design for the flatty.<ref name=\"Shelton, p.20 caption\"/> Front suspension hairpins were adapted from [[sprint car]]s, such as the [[Kurtis Kraft]]s.<ref>Shelton, p.24 and p.26 caption.</ref> The first Jimmy [[Supercharging|supercharger]] on a V8 may have been by Navarro in 1950.<ref>Shelton, p.26 caption.</ref>\n\nMuch later, rods and customs swapped the old solid rear axle for an independent rear, often from [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]. Sometimes the grille of one make of car replaced another; the 1937 [[Buick]] grille was often used on a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, the grille swap of choice was the 1953 [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]]. The original hot rods were plainly painted like the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Model A Fords]] from which they had been built up, and only slowly begun to take on colors, and eventually fancy orange-yellow flamed hoods or \"candy-like\" deep acrylic finishes in the various colors.<ref name=\"Custom history\" />\n\nWith the change in automobile design to encase the wheels in fenders and to extend the hood to the full width of the car, the former practices were no longer possible. In addition, tremendous automotive advertising raised public interest in the new models in the 1950s. Thus, custom cars came into existence, swapping [[headlamp]] rings, grilles, bumpers, [[Chrome plating|chrome]] side strips, and taillights as well as [[Frenching (automobile)|frenching]] and tunnelling head- and taillights. The bodies of the cars were changed by cutting through the sheet metal, removing bits to make the car lower, welding it back together, and adding [[lead]] to make the resulting form smooth (hence the term [[lead sled]]; [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] has since largely replaced lead.) [[Chopped and channeled#Chopping|Chopping]] made the roof lower<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/78, p.64.</ref> while [[Chopped and channeled#Sectioning|sectioning]]<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.15; ''Custom Rodder'' 1/97, p.29.</ref> made the body thinner from top to bottom. [[Chopped and channeled#Channeling|Channeling]]<ref>Jezek, George. \"The All Deuce Round-Up\", in ''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.58.</ref> was cutting notches in the floorpan where the body touches the frame to lower the whole body. Fins were often added from other cars, or made up from sheet steel. In the custom car culture, someone who merely changed the appearance without also substantially improving the performance was looked down upon. ''[[Juxtapoz Magazine]]'', founded by the artist [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], has covered [[Kustom Kulture]] art.\n\n==Customization style==\n[[File:Fuzzy dice 2.jpg|thumb|'55-7 Chevy with fuzzy dice]] <!--fuzzy dice are practically required-->\n[[File:Ed Roth 'bloodshot eyeball'.jpg|thumb|[[Ed Roth|'Big Daddy' Roth]] 'bloodshot eyeball' [[shift knob]] was a 1960s craze.]]\n\nCustom cars are distinct from cars in stock condition. Builders may adopt the visual and performance characteristics of some relevant modification styles, and combine these as desired. There are now several different custom themes, including:\n* [[Rat rod]]: imitates (or exaggerates) the \"unfinished\" and amateur-built appearance of hot rods of the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s\n* Restomod - restored and modernized. Safety and convenience upgrades, such as disc brakes, AC, etc., but can include fuel injection and overdrive upgrades, etc. Externally might resemble a stock car with period correct mods rather than customs.\n* Street machines: Typically American cars with large-displacement engines modified for speed and often appearance.\n* Street rod - consist largely of period specific vehicles and components, or emulate visual characteristics of cars through the'40s vintage. There is a great deal of overlap here with [[hot rod]]s.\n\n==Features==\n===Paint===\n[[File:'34 3-window flame job.JPG|thumb|'32 three-window with a classic-style flame job and [[Dean Moon|Moon]] tank, reminiscent of [[Pete Chapouris|Chapouris]]' [[The California Kid (custom car)|''California Kid'']]]]\nPaint was an important concern. Once bodywork was done, the cars were painted unusual colors. Transparent but wildly colored candy-apple paint, applied atop a metallic undercoat, and [[metalflake]] paint, with aluminum glitter within candy-apple paint, appeared in the 1960s. These took many coats to produce a brilliant effect \u2013 which in hot climates had a tendency to flake off. This process and style of paint job was invented by Joe Bailon, a customizer from Northern California.\n\nCustomizers also continued the habit of adding decorative paint after the main coat was finished, of flames extending rearward from the front wheels, scallops, and hand-painted pinstripes of a contrasting color. The base color, most often a single coat, would be expected to be of a simpler paint. [[Flame job (painting technique)|Flame jobs]] later spread to the hood, encompassing the entire front end, and have progressed from traditional reds and yellows to blues and greens and body-color \"ghost\" flames. One particular style of flames, called \"crab claw flames\", which is still prevalent today, is attributed to Dean Jeffries.<ref>Hotrod magazine, 1999.</ref>\n\nPainting has become such a part of the custom car scene that now in many custom car competitions, awards for custom paint are as highly sought after as awards for the cars themselves.\n\n===Engine swaps===\nEngine swaps have always been commonplace. Once, the [[Ford flathead V8 engine]] was the preference, supplanted by the [[Chrysler FirePower engine|early hemi]] in the 1950s and 1960s. By the 1970s, the [[Chevrolet small-block engine#Small block Chevrolet V8 (1955\u20131998)|small-block Chevy]] was the most common option, and since the 1980s, the {{convert|350|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} Chevy has been almost ubiquitous.<ref>See any issue of ''Street Rodder'', for instance.</ref> The {{convert|325|cid|l|1|abbr=on}} [[GM small-block engine#Generation III (1997\u20132007)|Chevrolet LS]] has begun replacing the 350.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Flatheads and early hemis have not entirely disappeared, but ready availability, ease of maintenance, and low cost of parts make the Chevrolet V8, in particular the first and third generation small block, the most frequent engine of choice.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nOnce customizing post-war cars caught on, some of the practices were extended to pre-war cars, which would have been called fendered rods, with more body work done on them. An alternate rule for disambiguation developed: hot rods had the engine behind the front suspension, while customs had the engine over the front suspension. The clearest example of this is [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]] prior to 1949 had [[Henry Ford]]'s old transverse front suspension, while 1949 models had a more modern suspension with the engine moved forward. However, an American museum has what could be the first true custom, built by [[Cletus Clobes]] in 1932, among its exhibits.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | title=1932 Clobes | publisher=Wheels Through Time Museum | accessdate=2010-10-31 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928062921/http://www.wheelsthroughtime.com/content/view/23/90/ | archivedate=2008-09-28 }}</ref> With the coming of the muscle car, and further to the high-performance luxury car, customization declined. One place where it persisted was the U.S. Southwest, where [[lowrider]]s were built similar in concept to the earlier customs, but of post-1950s cars.\n\nAs the supply of usable antique steel bodies has decreased, companies such [[Westcott Auto Restyling|Westcott's]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.44.</ref> [[Harwood Street Rods|Harwood]], [[Gibbon Fiberglass]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\">''Street Rodder'', 2/78, p.&nbsp;43.</ref> and [[Speedway Motors]]<ref name=\"%2526quot%253BStreet Rodder, 2/78, p.43\"/> have begun to fabricate new [[fiberglass]] copies,<ref>See, for instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.183.</ref> while [[Classic Manufacturing and Supply]], for one example, has been making a variety of new steel bodies since the 1970s.<ref>''Street Rodder'', 7/94, pp.132-4.</ref> California's \"junker\" (or \"crusher\") law, which pays a nominal sum to take \"gross polluters\" off the road, has been criticized by enthusiasts (and by SEMA) for accelerating this trend.<ref>See, for instance, Dick Wells column \"SRMA Update\", ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.234.</ref> Starting in the 1950s, it became popular among customizers to display their vehicles at drive-in restaurants, such as [[Johnie's Broiler]] in [[Downey, California]]. The practice continues in Southern California.\n\n==Customizers==\nExamples of notable customizers include [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]], [[Bill Cushenberry]], the [[The Alexander Brothers|Alexander Brothers]], [[Gil Ayala]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.60.</ref> [[Darryl Starbird]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\">''Street Rodder'', 1/85, p.56.</ref> [[Roy Brizio]], [[Troy Trepanier]] (of [[Rad Rides by Troy]]), [[Boyd Coddington]], [[Darryl Hollenbeck]] (working out of at Vintage Color Studios; winner of the 2016 [[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]] (AMBR) trophy with a custom Deuce)<ref name=\"Shelton, Chris 2017, p.16\"/> [[Harry Westergaard]],<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.55.</ref> [[Dave Stuckey]],<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> [[Dean Jeffries]], [[Barry Lobeck]], [[Phil Cool]] (who won the 1978 AMBR trophy with a bright orange Deuce, cover car for the July 1978 issue of ''Hot Rod''),<ref>Shelton, Chris. \"Then, Now, and Forever\" in ''Hot Rod'', March 2017, p.23.</ref> [[Troy Ladd]] of [[Hollywood Hot Rods]], [[Doane Spencer]] (builder of a 1940s Deuce considered the template for the hiboy),<ref>Shelton, p.29.</ref> [[Ken Fenical|\"Posie\"]],<ref>''Rod Action'', 2/85, p.5.</ref> [[Ron Clark (customizer)|Ron Clark]] and [[Bob Kaiser (customizer)|Bob Kaiser]] (of [[Clarkaiser Custom]]s),<ref>Fetherston, David, \"Detroit Dreams\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.58.</ref> [[Joe Bailon]]<ref name=\"Street Rodder, 1/85, p.56\"/> (inventor of candy apple paint),<ref>Ganahl, Pat, \"The Candy Man\", in ''Rod & Custom'', 7/95, p.81.</ref> [[Gene Winfield]], [[Rick Dore]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTCkZlTKrGsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22Rick+dore%22&source=bl&ots=5Kr7TMRKmR&sig=SAqsQAkP_wAUlEwNlKsxvLkTm6w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ze8nU4CeA-jhyQGb9IGQDw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22Rick+dore%22&f=false|title=Art of the Hot Rod|first=Ken|last=Gross|date=June 19, 2012|publisher=Motorbooks|via=Google Books}}</ref> [[Joe Wilhelm]], [[Dick Megugorac|\"Magoo\"]],<ref>''Street Rodder'', 12/98, p.206.</ref> [[Chip Foose]],<ref>Bishop, Mike, \"The 45th Grand National Roadster Show\", in ''American Rodder'', 6/94, p.27.</ref> and [[Pete Chapouris]].\n\nOthers, such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch]], are best known as custom painters. Several customizers have become famous beyond the automobile community, including Barris, Jeffries, and Coddington, thanks to their proximity to [[Hollywood]]; Barris designed TV's [[Batmobile]], while Chapouris built the [[The California Kid (custom car)|flamed '34 three-window coup\u00e9]] in the eponymous [[television film|telefilm]] \"[[The California Kid]]\". Another Barris creation, [[Ala Kart (custom car)|''Ala Kart'']] (a '29 Ford [[Ford Model A (1927)|Model A]] roadster pickup), made numerous appearances in film (usually in the background of diner scenes and such), after taking two AMBR wins in a row. Some customizers have become well-enough known to be referred to by given name alone. These include Boyd (Coddington), Pete (Chapouris), and Jake (Jim Jacobs).\n\n==Awards==\nThe highest award for customizers is the AMBR ([[America's Most Beautiful Roadster]]) trophy, presented annually at the Grand National Roadster Show since 1948 (also known within the customizer community as the Oakland Roadster Show until it was moved to Southern California in 2003). This competition has produced famous, and radical, customs.\n\nAnother is the [[Ridler Award]], presented at the [[Detroit Autorama]] since 1964 in honor of show promoter Don Ridler. With one of the most unusual of car show entry requirements, winners of the prestigious Ridler Award are selected as the most outstanding from among cars being shown for the first time. This prompts builders of many high-end roadsters to first enter the Autorama first and then the Grand National show in order to have the chance to win top honors at both shows. Few cars and owners can claim this achievement.\n\n==Notable customs==\nSome customs gained attention for winning the AMBR trophy, or for their outlandish styling. Notable among these is [[Silhouette (show car)|''Silhouette'']] and [[Ed Roth]]'s [[Mysterion (show rod)|''Mysterion'']]. Some of these more unusual projects turned into [[Hot Wheels]] cars, among them [[The Red Baron (custom car)|''The Red Baron'']].\n\nOther custom cars became notable for appearances in film (such as ''Ala Kart'' {1958},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29 sidebar.</ref> ''The California Kid'' three-window {1973},<ref>''Hot Rod'', 12/86, p.29.</ref> or the yellow deuce from \"[[American Graffiti]]\" {1973}) or television (such as ''The [[Monkeemobile]]'', the [[The Munsters|\"Munsters\"]] hearse, or, more recently, Boyd's full-custom [[Home Improvement (TV series)|''Tool Time'']] '34, or [[Don Thelan]]'s<ref>Gingerelli, Dain. \"Jake's '34\".

Specialist vehicles, such as the [[Pontiac Trans-Am|T/A]], [[KITT]], from [[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|''Knight Rider'']], are not usually considered customs, but movie or TV cars, because they retain a mostly stock exterior.\n\nStill others exemplified a trend. One of these is the '51 Merc built by the Barris brothers for Bob Hirohata in 1953, known forever after as the [[Hirohata Merc]]. Even without an appearance in film (\"Runnin' Wild\"), it is iconic of 1950s customs, and of how to do a Merc right.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, pp.8 & 10.</ref> The same year, [[Neil Emory]] and [[Clayton Jensen]] of [[Valley Custom Shop]] built [[Polynesian (custom car)|''Polynesian'']] for Jack Stewart, starting with a '50 [[Oldsmobile 88#First generation (1949\u20131953)|Holiday 88 sedan]].<ref>[http://www.customrodder.com/features/0609cr_1950_oldsmobile_polynesian/index.html%7C_new ''Custom Rodder'' online] (retrieved 28 July 2018)</ref> ''Polynesian'' made the cover of [[Hot Rod Magazine|''Hot Rod'']] in August, and saw 54 pages of construction details in ''[[Motor Trend]] Custom Car Annual'' in 1954.<ref>''Rod & Custom'', 8/89, p.68.</ref>\n\n==Language==<!--linked from [[Chevrolet Corvette C2]] -->\n[[File:'28 A roadster.jpg|thumb|'28 [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|A]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] with [[Kelsey-Hayes]] [[wire wheel]]s]]\n\nCertain linguistic conventions are followed among rodders and customizers:\n* The [[model year]] is rarely given in full,<ref>For instance, ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, ''passim''; ''Rod Action'', 2/78, ''passim''; ''Hot Rod'', October 1987, pp,8, 10, 18, 20, & 22.</ref> except when it might be confused, so a 1934 model is a '34, while a 2005 might be an '05 or not.\n** A '32 is usually a Deuce and most often a roadster, unless [[coup\u00e9]] is specified, and almost always a Ford, now commonly on [[Ford Model A (1927\u20131931)|A]] [[chassis|frame rails]].<ref name=\"Fortier, Rob p.136\">Fortier, Rob. \"\"A Little Pinch Here, A Little Tuck There\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.136.</ref>\n** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 is usually a Chevrolet.\n** A 1955, 1956, or 1957 Chevrolet is often called a [[Tri-Five]].\n* A 3- or 5-window is usually a Ford, unless specified.\n* A flatty is a [[Ford flathead V8 engine|flathead V8]]<ref>''American Rodder'', 6/94, pp.45 & 93.</ref> (always Ford, unless specified); a late (or late model) flatty is probably a [[Mercury (automobile)|Merc]].\n* A [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hemi design reintroduced|hemi]] (\"''hem'' ee\") is always a 426, unless displacement (331, 354, or 392) is specified;<ref>Geisert, Eric. \"Tom's Fun Run\", in ''Street Rodder'', 8/99, p.149cap.</ref> a 426 is a hemi, unless [[Chrysler RB engine#426|Wedge]] is specified.

Many custom car shows will only accept 1948 and earlier models as entries, and many custom car organizations will not admit later model cars or trucks (also with some imports - this has been a gray area of what's acceptable e.g. an aircooled VW Beetle, a Big Three product manufactured overseas e.g. a [[Ford Capri]] built in the UK or a [[Holden|General Motors - Holden's]] product, not to mention [[captive imports|captives]]), and/or a vintage import automobile with an American driveline transplant but this practice is subject to change. Modern day custom car shows which allow the inclusion of [[muscle car]]s have used the 1972 model year as the cutoff since it is considered the end of the muscle car era prior to the introduction of the [[catalytic converter]]. The NSRA has announced that starting in 2011 it will switch to a shifting year method where any owner with a car 30 years or older will be allowed membership. So in 2011 the owner of a 1981 model year vehicle will qualify, then in 2012 the owner of a 1982 model year vehicle will quality, and so on. Additionally, the Goodguys car show organization has moved the year limit for its \"rod\" shows from 1949 to 1954 in recent years.\n\n===Types===\n* [[Hi-Riser (automobile)]]\n* [[Hot rod]]\n* [[Kustom (cars)]]\n* [[Lead sled]]\n* [[Lowrider]]\n* [[Rat rod]]\n* [[Rice burner]]\n* [[Three window coupe]]\n\n===Common terms===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Yellow Deuce front wb.jpg|thumb|Front suspension of a lowboy Deuce roadster, with color-matched springs on coilover shocks, tube axle, and vented disc brakes.
