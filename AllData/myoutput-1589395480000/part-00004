For a [[data set]], it may be thought of as the \"middle\" value. For example,\nthe basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] (often simply described as the \"average\") is that it is not [[Skewness|skewed]] so much by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a \"typical\" value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets, which vary greatly, the mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. [[Median income]], for example, may be a better way to suggest what a \"typical\" income is.\nBecause of this, the median is of central importance<!-- pun not entirely unintended --> in [[robust statistics]], as it is the most [[resistant statistic]], having a [[breakdown point]] of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Finite data set of numbers==\nThe median of a finite list of numbers is the \"middle\" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest.\n\nIf there is an odd number of numbers, the middle one is picked. For example, consider the list of numbers\n\n: 1, 3, 3, '''6''', 7, 8, 9\n\nThis list contains seven numbers. The median is the fourth of them, which is 6.\n\nIf there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then usually defined to be the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the two middle values.<ref name=\"StatisticalMedian\">{{MathWorld |urlname=StatisticalMedian |title=Statistical Median }}</ref><ref>Simon, Laura J.; [http://www.stat.psu.edu/old_resources/ClassNotes/ljs_07/sld008.htm \"Descriptive statistics\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730032416/http://www.stat.psu.edu/old_resources/ClassNotes/ljs_07/sld008.htm |date=2010-07-30 }}, ''Statistical Education Resource Kit'', Pennsylvania State Department of Statistics</ref> For example, in the data set\n\n: 1, 2, 3, '''4, 5''', 6, 8, 9\n\nthe median is the mean of the middle two numbers: this is <math>(4 + 5)/2</math>, which is <math>4.5</math>.

With this convention, the median can be described in a [[piecewise function|caseless]] formula, as follows:\n\n: <math>\\mathrm{median}(a) = \\frac{a_{\\left\\lfloor\\frac{l+1}{2}\\right\\rfloor} + a_{\\left\\lceil\\frac{l+1}{2}\\right\\rceil}}{2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> is an ordered list of <math>l</math> numbers, and <math>\\lfloor\\cdot\\rfloor</math> and <math>\\lceil\\cdot\\rceil</math> denote the [[floor and ceiling functions]], respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of common [[average]]s of values [ 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 ]\n!

As seen above, medians may not be unique.  If each set contains less than half the population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the unique median.\n\nThe median is well-defined for any [[Weak ordering|ordered]] (one-dimensional) data, and is independent of any [[distance metric]].  The median can thus be applied to ranked but not numerical classes (e.g. working out a median grade when students are graded from A to F), although the result might be halfway between classes if there is an even number of cases.\n\nA [[geometric median]], on the other hand, is defined in any number of dimensions.  A related concept, in which the outcome is forced to correspond to a member of the sample, is the [[medoid]].\n\nThere is no widely accepted standard notation for the median, but some authors represent the median of a variable ''x'' either as ''x\u0342'' or as ''\u03bc''<sub>1/2</sub><ref name=\"StatisticalMedian\" /> sometimes also ''M''.<ref name=\"Sheskin2003\">{{cite book|author=David J.

However, the widely cited empirical relationship that the mean is shifted \"further into the tail\" of a distribution than the median is not generally true.  At most, one can say that the two statistics cannot be \"too far\" apart; see {{slink||Inequality relating means and medians}} below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v13n2/vonhippel.html|title=Journal of Statistics Education, v13n2: Paul T. von Hippel|work=amstat.org}}</ref>\n\nAs a median is based on the middle data in a set, it is not necessary to know the value of extreme results in order to calculate it. For example, in a psychology test investigating the time needed to solve a problem, if a small number of people failed to solve the problem at all in the given time a median can still be calculated.<ref name=\"Robson\">{{cite book|last1=Robson|first1=Colin|title=Experiment, Design and Statistics in Psychology|date=1994|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0-14-017648-9|pages=42\u201345}}</ref>\n\nBecause the median is simple to understand and easy to calculate, while also a robust approximation to the [[mean]], the median is a popular [[summary statistic]] in [[descriptive statistics]].  In this context, there are several choices for a measure of [[variability (statistics)|variability]]: the [[Range (statistics)|range]], the [[interquartile range]], the [[mean absolute deviation]], and the [[median absolute deviation]].\n\nFor practical purposes, different measures of location and dispersion are often compared on the basis of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]] of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient [[if and only if|when \u2014 and only when \u2014]] data is uncontaminated by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  Even then, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean.<ref name=\"Williams 2001 165\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Weighing the Odds |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=052100618X |page=165}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Maindonald|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8bMj8m-4RDQC&pg=PA104|title=Data Analysis and Graphics Using R: An Example-Based Approach|last2=Braun|first2=W.

Using these relationships and setting both <math> \\alpha </math> and <math> \\beta </math> equal to  <math>n+1</math> allows the last expression to be written as\n\n: <math> \\frac{F(v)^n(1 - F(v))^n}{\\Beta(n+1,n+1)} \\, dF(v) </math>\n\nHence the density function of the median is a symmetric beta distribution [[pushforward measure|pushed forward]] by <math>F</math>.  Its mean, as we would expect, is 0.5 and its variance is  <math> 1/(4(N+2)) </math>.  By the [[chain rule]], the corresponding variance of the sample median is\n\n: <math>\\frac{ 1 }{ 4 (N + 2) f( m )^2 }</math>.\n\nThe additional 2 is negligible [[limit (mathematics)|in the limit]].\n\n=====Empirical local density=====\nIn practice, the functions <math> f </math> and <math> F </math> are often not known or assumed.  However, they can be estimated from an observed frequency distribution.  In this section, we give an example.  Consider the following table, representing a sample of 3,800 (discrete-valued) observations:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;\"\n! v !! 0 !! 0.5 !! 1 !! 1.5 !! 2 !! 2.5 !! 3 !! 3.5 !! 4 !! 4.5 !! 5\n|-\n! f(v)\n| 0.000 || 0.008 || 0.010 || 0.013 || 0.083 || 0.108 || 0.328 || 0.220 ||  0.202 || 0.023 || 0.005\n|-\n! F(v)\n| 0.000 || 0.008 || 0.018 || 0.031 || 0.114 || 0.222 || 0.550 || 0.770 ||  0.972 || 0.995 || 1.000\n|-\n|}\n\nBecause the observations are discrete-valued, constructing the exact distribution of the median is not an immediate translation of the above expression for <math> \\Pr(\\operatorname{Median} = v) </math>; one may (and typically does) have multiple instances of the median in one's sample.  So we must sum over all these possibilities:\n\n: <math> \\Pr(\\operatorname{Median} = v) = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{N!}{i!(N-i-k)!k!} F(v-1)^i(1 - F(v))^kf(v)^{N-i-k} </math>\n\nHere, ''i'' is the number of points strictly less than the median and ''k'' the number strictly greater.\n\nUsing these preliminaries, it is possible to investigate the effect of sample size on the standard errors of the mean and median.  The observed mean is 3.16, the observed raw median is 3 and the observed interpolated median is 3.174.  The following table gives some comparison statistics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;\"\n! {{Diagonal split header|Statistic|Sample size}} !! 3 !! 9 !! 15 !! 21\n|-\n! Expected value of median\n| 3.198 || 3.191 || 3.174 || 3.161\n|-\n! Standard error of median (above formula)\n| 0.482 || 0.305 || 0.257 || 0.239\n|-\n!

Standard error of mean\n| 0.421 || 0.243 || 0.188 || 0.159\n|}\nThe expected value of the median falls slightly as sample size increases while, as would be expected, the standard errors of both the median and the mean are proportionate to the inverse square root of the sample size.  The asymptotic approximation errs on the side of caution by overestimating the standard error.\n\n==== Estimation of variance from sample data ====\n\nThe value of <math>(2 f(x))^{-2}</math>\u2014the asymptotic value of <math>n^{-\\frac{1}{2}} (\\nu - m)</math> where <math>\\nu</math> is the population median\u2014has been studied by several authors.

An example of this is a Likert scale, on which opinions or preferences are expressed on a scale with a set number of possible responses. If the scale consists of the positive integers, an observation of 3 might be regarded as representing the interval from 2.50 to 3.50. It is possible to estimate the median of the underlying variable. If, say, 22% of the observations are of value 2 or below and 55.0% are of 3 or below (so 33% have the value 3), then the median <math> m </math> is 3 since the median is the smallest value of <math> x </math> for which <math> F(x) </math> is greater than a half. But the interpolated median is somewhere between 2.50 and 3.50.  First we add half of the interval width <math> w </math> to the median to get the upper bound of the median interval. Then we subtract that proportion of the interval width which equals the proportion of the 33% which lies above the 50% mark.  In other words, we split up the interval width pro rata to the numbers of observations.  In this case, the 33% is split into 28% below the median and 5% above it so we subtract 5/33 of the interval width from the upper bound of 3.50 to give an interpolated median of 3.35. More formally, if the values <math> f(x) </math> are known, the interpolated median can be calculated from\n\n: <math> m_\\text{int} = m + w\\left[\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{F( m ) - \\frac{1}{2} }{f( m )}\\right]. </math>\n\nAlternatively, if in an observed sample there are <math> k </math> scores above the median category, <math> j </math> scores in it and <math> i </math> scores below it then the interpolated median is given by\n\n: <math> m_\\text{int} = m - \\frac{w}{2} \\left[\\frac{k - i} j\\right]. </math>\n\n===Pseudo-median===\n{{Main|Pseudomedian}}\nFor univariate distributions that are ''symmetric'' about one median, the [[Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator]] is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median; for non-symmetric distributions, the Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population ''pseudo-median'', which is the median of a symmetrized distribution and which is close to the population median.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pratt|first=William K.|last2=Cooper|first2=Ted J.|last3=Kabir|first3=Ihtisham|editor1-first=Francis J|editor1-last=Corbett|date=1985-07-11|title=Pseudomedian Filter|journal=Architectures and Algorithms for Digital Image Processing II|volume=0534|pages=34|doi=10.1117/12.946562|bibcode=1985SPIE..534...34P}}</ref> The Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator has been generalized to multivariate distributions.<ref name=\"Oja 2010 xiv+232\">{{cite book|title=Multivariate nonparametric methods with&nbsp;''R'': An approach based on spatial signs and ranks|last=Oja|first=Hannu|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-0467-6|series=Lecture Notes in Statistics|volume=199|location=New York, NY|pages=xiv+232|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0468-3|mr=2598854|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Variants of regression===\nThe [[Theil\u2013Sen estimator]] is a method for [[robust statistics|robust]] [[linear regression]] based on finding medians of [[slope]]s.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Wilcox | first = Rand R.\n | contribution = Theil\u2013Sen estimator\n | isbn = 978-0-387-95157-7\n | pages = 207\u2013210\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag\n | title = Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods: Substantially Improving Power and Accuracy\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=YSFb4QX2UIoC&pg=PA207\n | year = 2001}}.</ref>\n\n===Median filter===\n{{Main|Median filter}}\nIn the context of [[image processing]] of [[monochrome]] [[raster image]]s there is a type of noise, known as the [[salt and pepper noise]], when each pixel independently becomes black (with some small probability) or white (with some small probability), and is unchanged otherwise (with the probability close to 1).

For a [[data set]], it may be thought of as the \"middle\" value. For example,\nthe basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the [[Arithmetic mean|mean]] (often simply described as the \"average\") is that it is not [[Skewness|skewed]] so much by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a \"typical\" value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets, which vary greatly, the mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. [[Median income]], for example, may be a better way to suggest what a \"typical\" income is.\nBecause of this, the median is of central importance<!-- pun not entirely unintended --> in [[robust statistics]], as it is the most [[resistant statistic]], having a [[breakdown point]] of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Finite data set of numbers==\nThe median of a finite list of numbers is the \"middle\" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest.\n\nIf there is an odd number of numbers, the middle one is picked. For example, consider the list of numbers\n\n: 1, 3, 3, '''6''', 7, 8, 9\n\nThis list contains seven numbers. The median is the fourth of them, which is 6.\n\nIf there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then usually defined to be the [[arithmetic mean|mean]] of the two middle values.<ref name=\"StatisticalMedian\">{{MathWorld |urlname=StatisticalMedian |title=Statistical Median }}</ref><ref>Simon, Laura J.; [http://www.stat.psu.edu/old_resources/ClassNotes/ljs_07/sld008.htm \"Descriptive statistics\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730032416/http://www.stat.psu.edu/old_resources/ClassNotes/ljs_07/sld008.htm |date=2010-07-30 }}, ''Statistical Education Resource Kit'', Pennsylvania State Department of Statistics</ref> For example, in the data set\n\n: 1, 2, 3, '''4, 5''', 6, 8, 9\n\nthe median is the mean of the middle two numbers: this is <math>(4 + 5)/2</math>, which is <math>4.5</math>.

As seen above, medians may not be unique.  If each set contains less than half the population, then some of the population is exactly equal to the unique median.\n\nThe median is well-defined for any [[Weak ordering|ordered]] (one-dimensional) data, and is independent of any [[distance metric]].  The median can thus be applied to ranked but not numerical classes (e.g. working out a median grade when students are graded from A to F), although the result might be halfway between classes if there is an even number of cases.\n\nA [[geometric median]], on the other hand, is defined in any number of dimensions.  A related concept, in which the outcome is forced to correspond to a member of the sample, is the [[medoid]].\n\nThere is no widely accepted standard notation for the median, but some authors represent the median of a variable ''x'' either as ''x\u0342'' or as ''\u03bc''<sub>1/2</sub><ref name=\"StatisticalMedian\" /> sometimes also ''M''.<ref name=\"Sheskin2003\">{{cite book|author=David J.

However, the widely cited empirical relationship that the mean is shifted \"further into the tail\" of a distribution than the median is not generally true.  At most, one can say that the two statistics cannot be \"too far\" apart; see {{slink||Inequality relating means and medians}} below.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v13n2/vonhippel.html|title=Journal of Statistics Education, v13n2: Paul T. von Hippel|work=amstat.org}}</ref>\n\nAs a median is based on the middle data in a set, it is not necessary to know the value of extreme results in order to calculate it. For example, in a psychology test investigating the time needed to solve a problem, if a small number of people failed to solve the problem at all in the given time a median can still be calculated.<ref name=\"Robson\">{{cite book|last1=Robson|first1=Colin|title=Experiment, Design and Statistics in Psychology|date=1994|publisher=Penguin|isbn=0-14-017648-9|pages=42\u201345}}</ref>\n\nBecause the median is simple to understand and easy to calculate, while also a robust approximation to the [[mean]], the median is a popular [[summary statistic]] in [[descriptive statistics]].  In this context, there are several choices for a measure of [[variability (statistics)|variability]]: the [[Range (statistics)|range]], the [[interquartile range]], the [[mean absolute deviation]], and the [[median absolute deviation]].\n\nFor practical purposes, different measures of location and dispersion are often compared on the basis of how well the corresponding population values can be estimated from a sample of data. The median, estimated using the sample median, has good properties in this regard. While it is not usually optimal if a given population distribution is assumed, its properties are always reasonably good. For example, a comparison of the [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]] of candidate estimators shows that the sample mean is more statistically efficient [[if and only if|when \u2014 and only when \u2014]] data is uncontaminated by data from heavy-tailed distributions or from mixtures of distributions.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}  Even then, the median has a 64% efficiency compared to the minimum-variance mean (for large normal samples), which is to say the variance of the median will be ~50% greater than the variance of the mean.<ref name=\"Williams 2001 165\">{{cite book |last=Williams |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Weighing the Odds |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=052100618X |page=165}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Maindonald|first=John|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8bMj8m-4RDQC&pg=PA104|title=Data Analysis and Graphics Using R: An Example-Based Approach|last2=Braun|first2=W.

A modern proof follows below.  Laplace's result is now understood as a special case of [[Quantile#Estimating quantiles from a sample|the asymptotic distribution of arbitrary quantiles]].\n\nFor normal samples, the density is <math>f(m)=1/\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}</math>, thus for large samples the variance of the median equals <math>({\\pi}/{2})\\cdot(\\sigma^2/n).</math><ref name=\"Williams 2001 165\"/>  (See also section [[#Efficiency]] below.)\n\n===== Derivation of the asymptotic distribution =====\nWe take the sample size to be an odd number <math> N = 2n + 1 </math> and assume our variable continuous; the formula for the case of discrete variables is given below in {{slink||Empirical local density}}.  The sample can be summarized as \"below median\", \"at median\", and \"above median\", which corresponds to a trinomial distribution with probabilities  <math> F(v - 1) </math>, <math> f(v) </math> and  <math> 1 - F(v) </math>.  For a continuous variable, the probability of multiple sample values being exactly equal to the median is 0, so one can calculate the density of at the point <math> v </math> directly from the trinomial distribution:\n\n: <math> \\Pr[\\operatorname{Median}=v]\\,dv=\\frac{(2n+1)!}{n!n!} F(v)^n(1 - F(v))^nf(v)\\, dv</math>.\n\nNow we introduce the beta function.  For integer arguments <math> \\alpha </math> and <math> \\beta </math>, this can be expressed as <math> \\Beta(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\frac{(\\alpha - 1)! (\\beta - 1)!}{(\\alpha + \\beta - 1)!} </math>.  Also, recall that <math> f(v)\\,dv = dF(v) </math>.  Using these relationships and setting both <math> \\alpha </math> and <math> \\beta </math> equal to  <math>n+1</math> allows the last expression to be written as\n\n: <math> \\frac{F(v)^n(1 - F(v))^n}{\\Beta(n+1,n+1)} \\, dF(v) </math>\n\nHence the density function of the median is a symmetric beta distribution [[pushforward measure|pushed forward]] by <math>F</math>.  Its mean, as we would expect, is 0.5 and its variance is  <math> 1/(4(N+2)) </math>.  By the [[chain rule]], the corresponding variance of the sample median is\n\n: <math>\\frac{ 1 }{ 4 (N + 2) f( m )^2 }</math>.\n\nThe additional 2 is negligible [[limit (mathematics)|in the limit]].\n\n=====Empirical local density=====\nIn practice, the functions <math> f </math> and <math> F </math> are often not known or assumed.  However, they can be estimated from an observed frequency distribution.  In this section, we give an example.  Consider the following table, representing a sample of 3,800 (discrete-valued) observations:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;\"\n! v !! 0 !! 0.5 !! 1 !! 1.5 !! 2 !! 2.5 !! 3 !! 3.5 !! 4 !! 4.5 !! 5\n|-\n! f(v)\n| 0.000 || 0.008 || 0.010 || 0.013 || 0.083 || 0.108 || 0.328 || 0.220 ||  0.202 || 0.023 || 0.005\n|-\n! F(v)\n| 0.000 || 0.008 || 0.018 || 0.031 || 0.114 || 0.222 || 0.550 || 0.770 ||  0.972 || 0.995 || 1.000\n|-\n|}\n\nBecause the observations are discrete-valued, constructing the exact distribution of the median is not an immediate translation of the above expression for <math> \\Pr(\\operatorname{Median} = v) </math>; one may (and typically does) have multiple instances of the median in one's sample.  So we must sum over all these possibilities:\n\n: <math> \\Pr(\\operatorname{Median} = v) = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\sum_{k=0}^n \\frac{N!}{i!(N-i-k)!k!} F(v-1)^i(1 - F(v))^kf(v)^{N-i-k} </math>\n\nHere, ''i'' is the number of points strictly less than the median and ''k'' the number strictly greater.\n\nUsing these preliminaries, it is possible to investigate the effect of sample size on the standard errors of the mean and median.  The observed mean is 3.16, the observed raw median is 3 and the observed interpolated median is 3.174.  The following table gives some comparison statistics.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;\"\n! {{Diagonal split header|Statistic|Sample size}} !! 3 !! 9 !! 15 !! 21\n|-\n!

Standard error of mean\n| 0.421 || 0.243 || 0.188 || 0.159\n|}\nThe expected value of the median falls slightly as sample size increases while, as would be expected, the standard errors of both the median and the mean are proportionate to the inverse square root of the sample size.  The asymptotic approximation errs on the side of caution by overestimating the standard error.\n\n==== Estimation of variance from sample data ====\n\nThe value of <math>(2 f(x))^{-2}</math>\u2014the asymptotic value of <math>n^{-\\frac{1}{2}} (\\nu - m)</math> where <math>\\nu</math> is the population median\u2014has been studied by several authors.

An example of this is a Likert scale, on which opinions or preferences are expressed on a scale with a set number of possible responses. If the scale consists of the positive integers, an observation of 3 might be regarded as representing the interval from 2.50 to 3.50. It is possible to estimate the median of the underlying variable. If, say, 22% of the observations are of value 2 or below and 55.0% are of 3 or below (so 33% have the value 3), then the median <math> m </math> is 3 since the median is the smallest value of <math> x </math> for which <math> F(x) </math> is greater than a half. But the interpolated median is somewhere between 2.50 and 3.50.  First we add half of the interval width <math> w </math> to the median to get the upper bound of the median interval. Then we subtract that proportion of the interval width which equals the proportion of the 33% which lies above the 50% mark.  In other words, we split up the interval width pro rata to the numbers of observations.  In this case, the 33% is split into 28% below the median and 5% above it so we subtract 5/33 of the interval width from the upper bound of 3.50 to give an interpolated median of 3.35. More formally, if the values <math> f(x) </math> are known, the interpolated median can be calculated from\n\n: <math> m_\\text{int} = m + w\\left[\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{F( m ) - \\frac{1}{2} }{f( m )}\\right]. </math>\n\nAlternatively, if in an observed sample there are <math> k </math> scores above the median category, <math> j </math> scores in it and <math> i </math> scores below it then the interpolated median is given by\n\n: <math> m_\\text{int} = m - \\frac{w}{2} \\left[\\frac{k - i} j\\right]. </math>\n\n===Pseudo-median===\n{{Main|Pseudomedian}}\nFor univariate distributions that are ''symmetric'' about one median, the [[Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator]] is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population median; for non-symmetric distributions, the Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator is a robust and highly efficient estimator of the population ''pseudo-median'', which is the median of a symmetrized distribution and which is close to the population median.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pratt|first=William K.|last2=Cooper|first2=Ted J.|last3=Kabir|first3=Ihtisham|editor1-first=Francis J|editor1-last=Corbett|date=1985-07-11|title=Pseudomedian Filter|journal=Architectures and Algorithms for Digital Image Processing II|volume=0534|pages=34|doi=10.1117/12.946562|bibcode=1985SPIE..534...34P}}</ref> The Hodges\u2013Lehmann estimator has been generalized to multivariate distributions.<ref name=\"Oja 2010 xiv+232\">{{cite book|title=Multivariate nonparametric methods with&nbsp;''R'': An approach based on spatial signs and ranks|last=Oja|first=Hannu|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-0467-6|series=Lecture Notes in Statistics|volume=199|location=New York, NY|pages=xiv+232|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0468-3|mr=2598854|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Variants of regression===\nThe [[Theil\u2013Sen estimator]] is a method for [[robust statistics|robust]] [[linear regression]] based on finding medians of [[slope]]s.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Wilcox | first = Rand R.\n | contribution = Theil\u2013Sen estimator\n | isbn = 978-0-387-95157-7\n | pages = 207\u2013210\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag\n | title = Fundamentals of Modern Statistical Methods: Substantially Improving Power and Accuracy\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=YSFb4QX2UIoC&pg=PA207\n | year = 2001}}.</ref>\n\n===Median filter===\n{{Main|Median filter}}\nIn the context of [[image processing]] of [[monochrome]] [[raster image]]s there is a type of noise, known as the [[salt and pepper noise]], when each pixel independently becomes black (with some small probability) or white (with some small probability), and is unchanged otherwise (with the probability close to 1).
