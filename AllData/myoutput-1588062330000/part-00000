It was used to defend a prison for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers on nearby [[Johnson's Island]]. Louis Zistel, a German immigrant, built two boats to transport the prisoners. According to some sources, in 1870 Zistel began to ferry locals to the Cedar Point peninsula (perhaps to the \"Biemiller's Cove\" area, which is not within the specific area of the present amusement-park).<ref name=history1 /> He charged 25 cents per person to ride from Sandusky to Cedar Point on his boat, ''Young Reindeer''. This marked the beginning of commercial tourism on the Cedar Point peninsula.<ref name=cphistorypage>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cedarpoint.com/media-center/park-history|title=The History of Fun: Cedar Point Celebrates Its Past|work=Cedar Point|accessdate=August 11, 2010}}</ref> However, the present amusement-park technically had its official beginning in 1888. <ref> FIRELANDS PIONEER (series) April 1925</ref>.  Benjamin F.

[[Mosquito]]s were becoming a problem, so in 1904, the park hired the Detroit Dredging Company to drain swampy areas on the peninsula. Detroit Dredging connected a series of [[lagoon]]s to form a water passageway that quickly became one of the park's signature attractions. Aside from sightseeing passenger boats, the passageway was used to transport coal to power plants near the center of the peninsula.<ref name=\"history1\" /> The historic [[Hotel Breakers]] opened in 1905 as one of the largest hotels in the Midwest; it had 600 guest rooms and a cafe that could seat 400 guests. A new area of the park called \"Amusement Circle\" was designed in 1906 to link the pier to the beach. It was located southeast of the Coliseum, a large arena built the same year that featured a grand ballroom and other attractions.<ref name=\"cphistorypage\" />\n\n[[File:Leap the Dips in the 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|Leap the Dips, circa 1920s]]\nIn 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway roller coaster opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 by the larger Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and replaced by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, though that was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures and other forms of entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Francis|first1=David W.|last2=Francis|first2=Diane DeMali|title=Cedar Point: The Queen of American Watering Places|year=1988|publisher=Daring Books|location=Canton, Ohio|isbn=0-938936-75-1|page=51|chapter=5}}</ref>\n\nMany more hotels and restaurants were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, a rickety and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides to make way for a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, but he continued to oversee park operations and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died from [[uremia]] on July 24, 1931. His portrait in the lobby of Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the ''G.A. Boeckling'' steamboat were lowered to half mast.<ref name=\"the pointol\">{{cite web |url=http://thepointol.com/cedar-point-history-1870-1904/ |title=The Point Online History |publisher=ThePointOL.com |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511013349/http://thepointol.com/cedar-point-history-1870-1904/ |archive-date=May 11, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===After Boeckling: the George A.

As a result of the [[The Great Depression|Great Depression]], little expansion happened through the 1930s. One of the few rides built in during this time was the Tumble Bug. The decaying Leap the Dips coaster was demolished in the mid-1930s. In the late 1930s, the resort was on the brink of being sold to the state of Ohio for {{USD|3000000|1937|round=-2|about=yes|link=yes}}. After the 1938 season, the directors had the second floor of the Coliseum modernized in the art deco style with a new stage. In the middle, the giant dance floor remained. Some of the top bands of the time played in the ballroom. As a result, it kept Cedar Point operating through the rest of the Depression.<ref name=\"the pointol\" /> Momma Berardi's Home Made French Fries came to Cedar Point, Momma Berardi's family played an important role in the food industry at Cedar Point.

The wood of the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957 and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.<ref name=\"PB Timeline\"/><ref name=\"history3 - timeline\"/>\n\n[[File:Blue streak1 CP.JPG|thumb|left|[[Blue Streak (Cedar Point)|Blue Streak]], built in 1964, is Cedar Point's oldest operating roller coaster.]]\nIn the 1950s, the Pagoda Gift Shop was a post-office and the Crystal Rock Castle was turned into a maintenance shop in the late-1950s. In 1959, the hotels were repainted, new admission gates were installed, and over {{USD|1200000|1959|round=-2|about=yes|link=yes}} was spent to refresh Cedar Point. The park's first roller coaster since the Cyclone, the Wild Mouse, was built. The resort also got a new kind of ride, a [[monorail]], that was the most popular ride in 1959. Breakers Hotel was restored and the neglected cottages were demolished. The Coliseum and Grand Pavilion were both painted and remodeled. The Crystal Rock Castle Maintenance Shop, bathhouses, and the old powerhouse were demolished, and a new $50,000 bathhouse, boiler house, and maintenance shop were built in their place.<ref name=\"PB Timeline\"/><ref name=\"history3 - timeline\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s, the idea of \"pay one price\" season passes became common.<ref name=\"history2\"/> On March 28, 1960, Cedar Point announced plans to transform the park into a \"Disneyland\" amusement center.<ref name=\"Disneyland section\">{{cite news |title=Cedar Point Disney project|url=http://i.pointbuzz.com/cedar-point-disney.pdf|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Those plans fell through, however.

[[Mosquito]]s were becoming a problem, so in 1904, the park hired the Detroit Dredging Company to drain swampy areas on the peninsula. Detroit Dredging connected a series of [[lagoon]]s to form a water passageway that quickly became one of the park's signature attractions. Aside from sightseeing passenger boats, the passageway was used to transport coal to power plants near the center of the peninsula.<ref name=\"history1\" /> The historic [[Hotel Breakers]] opened in 1905 as one of the largest hotels in the Midwest; it had 600 guest rooms and a cafe that could seat 400 guests. A new area of the park called \"Amusement Circle\" was designed in 1906 to link the pier to the beach. It was located southeast of the Coliseum, a large arena built the same year that featured a grand ballroom and other attractions.<ref name=\"cphistorypage\" />\n\n[[File:Leap the Dips in the 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|Leap the Dips, circa 1920s]]\nIn 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway roller coaster opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 by the larger Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and replaced by the Leap Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, though that was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures and other forms of entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Francis|first1=David W.|last2=Francis|first2=Diane DeMali|title=Cedar Point: The Queen of American Watering Places|year=1988|publisher=Daring Books|location=Canton, Ohio|isbn=0-938936-75-1|page=51|chapter=5}}</ref>\n\nMany more hotels and restaurants were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, a rickety and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides to make way for a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, but he continued to oversee park operations and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died from [[uremia]] on July 24, 1931. His portrait in the lobby of Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the ''G.A. Boeckling'' steamboat were lowered to half mast.<ref name=\"the pointol\">{{cite web |url=http://thepointol.com/cedar-point-history-1870-1904/ |title=The Point Online History |publisher=ThePointOL.com |date= |accessdate=January 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511013349/http://thepointol.com/cedar-point-history-1870-1904/ |archive-date=May 11, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===After Boeckling: the George A.

As a result of the [[The Great Depression|Great Depression]], little expansion happened through the 1930s. One of the few rides built in during this time was the Tumble Bug. The decaying Leap the Dips coaster was demolished in the mid-1930s. In the late 1930s, the resort was on the brink of being sold to the state of Ohio for {{USD|3000000|1937|round=-2|about=yes|link=yes}}. After the 1938 season, the directors had the second floor of the Coliseum modernized in the art deco style with a new stage. In the middle, the giant dance floor remained.

The wood of the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957 and is still in use.

The park's first roller coaster since the Cyclone, the Wild Mouse, was built. The resort also got a new kind of ride, a [[monorail]], that was the most popular ride in 1959. Breakers Hotel was restored and the neglected cottages were demolished. The Coliseum and Grand Pavilion were both painted and remodeled. The Crystal Rock Castle Maintenance Shop, bathhouses, and the old powerhouse were demolished, and a new $50,000 bathhouse, boiler house, and maintenance shop were built in their place.<ref name=\"PB Timeline\"/><ref name=\"history3 - timeline\"/>\n\nIn the 1960s, the idea of \"pay one price\" season passes became common.<ref name=\"history2\"/> On March 28, 1960, Cedar Point announced plans to transform the park into a \"Disneyland\" amusement center.<ref name=\"Disneyland section\">{{cite news |title=Cedar Point Disney project|url=http://i.pointbuzz.com/cedar-point-disney.pdf|accessdate=April 29, 2012}}</ref> Those plans fell through, however.
