His first original invention, the [[Ballbarrow]], was a modified version of a wheelbarrow using a ball instead of a wheel. This was featured on the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'' television programme. Dyson stuck with the idea of a ball, inventing the Trolleyball, a trolley that launched boats. He then designed the Wheelboat,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.dyson.co.nz/about/story/default.asp?searchType=story&story=earlydesigns|title=Inside Dyson|publisher=Dyson|access-date=22 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018160236/http://content.dyson.co.nz/about/story/default.asp?searchType=story&story=earlydesigns|archive-date=18 October 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> which could travel at speeds of 64 kilometres per hour (40&nbsp;mph) on both land and water.\n\n==Vacuum cleaners==\n[[File:Dyson.cleaner.dc07.arp.jpg|thumb|upright|DC07 bagless [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]] [[vacuum cleaner]]]]\nIn the late 1970s, Dyson had the idea of using [[cyclonic separation]] to create a [[vacuum cleaner]] that would not lose suction as it picked up dirt. He became frustrated with his [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] Junior's diminishing performance: the dust bag pores kept becoming clogged with dust thus reducing suction.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dyson.co.uk/community/aboutdyson.aspx |title=About Dyson |publisher=Dyson |year=2015}}</ref> The cyclone idea came from a [[sawmill]] that used cyclone technology (''qv.''

It won the [[iF product design award|1991 International Design Fair Prize]] in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP0037674A1?cl=pt EP0037674] in 1980.\n\nAfter his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]]. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in [[Malmesbury]], Wiltshire.\n\nDyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100&nbsp;million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag&nbsp;\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Against The Odds |last=Dyson |first=James |authorlink=James Dyson |first2=Giles |last2=Coren |year=1997 |edition=1st |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7528-0981-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 134, 135, 244] |url=https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 }}</ref> In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n\nDyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to [[Fantom Technologies]], after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n\nFollowing his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued [[The Hoover Company|Hoover (UK)]] for patent infringement.  The [[High Court]] ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dyson cleans up in patent battle with rival Hoover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-up-in-patent-battle-with-rival-Hoover.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=3 October 2000}}</ref> Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n\nIn mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]].<ref name=360Eye>{{cite web|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nInterviewed by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'' (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure. I've always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they've had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.\"<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\"/>\n\n== Other inventions ==\nIn 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a [[washing machine]] called the [[List of Dyson products#Contrarotator washing machine|ContraRotator]], which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. It was not a commercial success, and is no longer available.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |title=Dyson declines to commit to controversial Contrarotator <!--sic--> |date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Current.com.au |accessdate=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603160954/http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |archivedate=3 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the [[optical illusion]]s depicted in the [[Lithography|lithographs]] of Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]]. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a [[water sculpture]] in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called ''Wrong Garden'', it was displayed at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3046791.stm |work=BBC News| title=How does Dyson make water go uphill? | date=21 May 2003 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.\n\n[[File:DysonAirblade.jpg|thumb|Dyson Airblade [[hand dryer]]]]\nIn October 2006 Dyson launched the [[Dyson Airblade]], a fast [[hand dryer]] that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a [[squeegee]] to remove water, rather than attempting to [[evaporation|evaporate]] it with heat. This allows faster drying, while using much less energy than traditional electrical hand dryers.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAnother product, launched on 18 October 2009, is a [[Bladeless fan|fan without external blades]], which he calls the Air Multiplier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dyson.com/fans/ |title=Dyson air multiplier fan |publisher=Dyson}}</ref> In addition to a cooling fan, a model which distributes electrically produced heat and an ultrasonic humidifier model are also available.\n\nIn April 2016, Dyson launched the Dyson Supersonic, a [[hair dryer]] with a smaller motor located in the handle so as to provide better balance and smaller size, as well as quieter operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dyson.com/haircare/supersonic.aspx|title=The Dyson Supersonic\u2122 hair dryer|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=27 April 2016}}</ref> Commenting on the launch, [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]] said \"as the first product to launch from Dyson's new UK state-of-the-art hair laboratory, we have high hopes for the future of our blow-dries.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/beauty/2016/04/27/dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-review | work=Vogue | title=Blown Away | date=27 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Research and development==\n\nIn 2017 Dyson spent \u00a37m a week on research and development of new products.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/03/27/sir-james-dyson-remain-controls-dyson-reports-record-results/|title=Sir James Dyson to remain at controls as Dyson reports record results|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=27 March 2017}}</ref> The company is the UK's biggest investor in robotics and artificial intelligence research, employing over 3,500 engineers and scientists, and engaging in more than 40 university research programmes.

The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for [[Key Stage]] 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of ''Genius of Britain'', a [[Channel 4]] TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the [[University of Cambridge]]. A new four-storey building will house 1,200 postgraduate engineers and support world-leading research. The donation will also allow for a design and making lab to be developed for undergraduate engineering students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/news/the-james-dyson-foundation-donates-ps8m-to-fuel-invention-powerhouse|title=The James Dyson Foundation donates \u00a38m to fuel invention powerhouse |date=6 May 2014 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, the foundation pledged a \u00a312m donation to [[Imperial College London]] to allow the purchase of a Post Office building in [[Exhibition Road]] from the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]].

It won the [[iF product design award|1991 International Design Fair Prize]] in Japan. He filed a series of patents for his dual cyclone vacuum cleaner [https://encrypted.google.com/patents/EP0037674A1?cl=pt EP0037674] in 1980.\n\nAfter his invention was rejected by the major manufacturers, Dyson set up his own manufacturing company, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson Ltd]]. In June 1993, he opened a research centre and factory in [[Malmesbury]], Wiltshire.\n\nDyson's breakthrough in the UK market came more than ten years after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was \u00a3100&nbsp;million. The slogan \"say goodbye to the bag\" proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the disposable bag&nbsp;\u2013 users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience.  The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming one of the most popular brands in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Against The Odds |last=Dyson |first=James |authorlink=James Dyson |first2=Giles |last2=Coren |year=1997 |edition=1st |publisher=Orion Publishing |location=London, UK |isbn=0-7528-0981-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 134, 135, 244] |url=https://archive.org/details/againstoddsautob0000dyso/page/134 }}</ref> In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).\n\nDyson licensed the technology in North America from 1986 to 2001 to [[Fantom Technologies]], after which Dyson entered the market directly.\n\nFollowing his success, other major manufacturers began to market their own cyclonic vacuum cleaners. In 1999, Dyson sued [[The Hoover Company|Hoover (UK)]] for patent infringement.  The [[High Court]] ruled that Hoover had deliberately copied a fundamental part of his patented designs in making its Triple Vortex bagless vacuum cleaner range.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dyson cleans up in patent battle with rival Hoover|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1368860/Dyson-cleans-up-in-patent-battle-with-rival-Hoover.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=3 October 2000}}</ref> Hoover agreed to pay damages of \u00a34&nbsp;million.\n\nIn 2005, Dyson incorporated the wheel ball from his Ballbarrow concept into a vacuum cleaner, creating the Dyson Ball.  This ball, rather than the static wheels on existing vacuums, enabled it to become more steerable, which was more useful for navigating around obstacles and corners.\n\nIn mid-2014, Dyson personally appeared in Tokyo to introduce his \"360 Eye\" [[robotic vacuum cleaner]]. Dyson's initial entry into this market segment features 360\u00b0 scanning and mapping for navigation, cyclonic dust separation, a custom-designed digital motor for high suction, tank treads for traction, a full-width brushroll bar, and user interface via a free [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Mobile app|app]].<ref name=360Eye>{{cite web|title=Dyson 360 Eye\u2122 robot|url=https://www.dyson360eye.com/|publisher=Dyson|accessdate=26 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326022104/https://www.dyson360eye.com/|archivedate=26 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nInterviewed by ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company magazine]]'' (May 2007), Dyson asserted the importance of failure in one's life, \"I made 5,127 prototypes of my vacuum before I got it right. There were 5,126 failures. But I learned from each one. That's how I came up with a solution. So I don't mind failure. I've always thought that schoolchildren should be marked by the number of failures they've had. The child who tries strange things and experiences lots of failures to get there is probably more creative.\"<ref name=\"Failure Doesn\u2019t Suck\"/>\n\n== Other inventions ==\nIn 2000, Dyson expanded his appliance range to include a [[washing machine]] called the [[List of Dyson products#Contrarotator washing machine|ContraRotator]], which had two rotating drums moving in opposite directions. The range was decorated in the usual bright Dyson colours, rather than the traditional white, grey or black of most other machines. It was not a commercial success, and is no longer available.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |title=Dyson declines to commit to controversial Contrarotator <!--sic--> |date=11 December 2007 |publisher=Current.com.au |accessdate=19 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603160954/http://www.current.com.au/2007/12/11/article/UUFGGOHYWY |archivedate=3 June 2011  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2002, Dyson created a realisation of the [[optical illusion]]s depicted in the [[Lithography|lithographs]] of Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]]. Engineer Derek Phillips was able to accomplish the task after a year of work, creating a [[water sculpture]] in which the water appears to flow up to the tops of four ramps arranged in a square, before cascading to the bottom of the next ramp. Called ''Wrong Garden'', it was displayed at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]] in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3046791.stm |work=BBC News| title=How does Dyson make water go uphill? | date=21 May 2003 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> The illusion is accomplished with water containing air bubbles pumped through a chamber underneath the transparent glass ramps to a slit at the top from which the bulk of the water cascades down. This makes it appear that the water is flowing up, when really, a small amount of water diverted from the slit at the top flows back down the ramps in a thin layer.\n\n[[File:DysonAirblade.jpg|thumb|Dyson Airblade [[hand dryer]]]]\nIn October 2006 Dyson launched the [[Dyson Airblade]], a fast [[hand dryer]] that uses a thin sheet of moving air as a [[squeegee]] to remove water, rather than attempting to [[evaporation|evaporate]] it with heat.

The foundation's aim is to inspire young people to study engineering and become engineers by encouraging students to think differently and to make mistakes.  The foundation supports engineering education in schools and universities, as well as medical and scientific research in partnership with charities. It achieves this by funding different resources such as the \"Engineering Box\", a box filled with activities for a school to use as a teaching aid. The foundation loans the boxes to schools for four weeks free of charge, they are suitable for [[Key Stage]] 4 and above.  The Engineering Box enables students to take apart and examine a Dyson DC22 Telescope vacuum cleaner. In addition, a school is allowed to retain a James Dyson Foundation teacher pack, and a copy of ''Genius of Britain'', a [[Channel 4]] TV series featuring Dyson, and design engineering posters. Other resources are also available.\n\nIn May 2014, the foundation announced an \u00a38m donation to create a technology hub at the [[University of Cambridge]].
