Early roles were rather strait-laced; he then sometimes played his ''snide'' character: quite slimy and smarmy with a distinctive nasal voice. Later the haughty, proud and easily outraged elitist became more frequent and Williams' best known character type. Williams sometimes played characters of other nationalities, such as in ''Up the Khyber''. In some roles, when not actually playing his role in ''snide'' mode, Williams might deliver a single joke using his snide voice.  A running gag in many of the films was that Williams' character would be embroiled in an extra-marital affair with that of Hattie Jacques\u2014this plot device was used to greatest effect in the hospital-based films, which gave rise to Williams' famous catchphrase \"ohhh Matron!\".\n* [[Joan Sims]] (1930\u20132001) (24) had the longest uninterrupted run of roles in ''Carry On'' films, being in all 20 films (excluding ''That's Carry On'') from ''Carry On Cleo'' to ''Carry On Emmannuelle''. She  played a range of characters from jolly and assertive young women with sturdy moral standards (''Camping'', ''Loving'') to sexy and lusty matrons \u2013 either desired (''At Your Convenience'') or coarse and unattractive (''Henry'', ''Up the Khyber''), to a chatty glutton (in ''Matron''), a battleaxe wife (''Cleo'', ''Screaming'') and an unattractive spinster (''Doctor''). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eleven episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.\n* [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] (1914\u20131988) (23) often played a meek, rather effete 'mummy's boy' who could suddenly erupt into riotous behaviour.  Other roles were as a strict, officious and prissy person in an authority role.  Hawtrey's characters were often bumbling and accident prone, and the victim of various mishaps and complex misunderstandings. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials.\n* [[Sid James]] (1913\u20131976) (19) always played a lead character, usually a laconic member of the working class. His characters were often lecherous womanisers, something that caused problems in James' private life. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and four episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.\n* [[Kenneth Connor]] (1918\u20131993) (17) often played put-upon men ranging in character from pompous to meek, and often leering.  He also provided some additional voice-work in ''Emmannuelle'' when he dubbed the dialogue of Howard Nelson (Harry Hernia). He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Peter Butterworth]] (1919\u20131979) (16) frequently played major roles in the films, often as a generally benign, unflappable but bumbling assistant or servant unable to see the chaos around him. Unusually for a regular, in some films, including ''Again Doctor'', ''Henry'' and ''Loving'', his role consists of a cameo appearance in a single scene. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and nine episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Hattie Jacques]] (1922\u20131980) (14) played the haughty matron, school senior mistress or other archetypal authority figure in several films. Later she branched out into more varied comic roles (e.g. ''At Your Convenience'', ''Loving'' and ''Abroad'', in which she played a chef embroiled in a constant battle with the stove). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Bernard Bresslaw]] (1934\u20131993) (14) varied between playing the clumsy dimwit or the heavy, or the lusty and bombastic \"foreigner\". In the later films his characterisation developed greater depth, such as in ''Dick'', ''Behind''. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and five episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Jim Dale]] (1935-) (11) joined the series with support roles, but quickly progressed to playing the younger, sympathetic male lead, often in the film's romance plot strand. From his debut had an uninterrupted nine-film run. After a two-film absence (''Camping'' and ''Up The Khyber'') returned for ''Again Doctor'', his final ''Carry On'' until taking the lead role in the 1992 revival film ''Carry On Columbus''.\n* [[Barbara Windsor]] (b.1937) (10, including co-presenting ''That's Carry On'' with Williams) played main roles in all her ''Carry On'' appearances. Her characters were always the cheeky and saucy young blonde, often in revealing costumes. Sometimes her characters were chaste (and very often chased), some were easily swayed. She also appeared in all four of the ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eight episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Patsy Rowlands]] (1931\u20132005) (9) started in support roles, often as undervalued, meek and mousey secretary or assistant who undergoes transformation into a more assertive and sexually aware woman. She also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]] (1927\u20132008) (8) joined the series with a cameo appearance in ''Matron'', where he appears in one scene with a single line of dialogue. After an only slightly larger role in the following film ''Abroad'', where he again plays his established ''Alf Ippititimus''-type character, his roles increased in size and increasingly diverged from the familiar Alf performance. After his d\u00e9but Douglas appeared in all subsequent films in the original series, and was one of the few returners for ''Columbus''. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Terry Scott]] (1927\u20131994) (7) appeared briefly in the first film ''Sergeant'' and returned 10 years later when he played, among others, the put-upon husband (''Camping''), the barking sergeant (''Up the Khyber'') and lusty doctor (''Matron'').  Additionally, he appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials. He also filmed a scene for ''At Your Convenience'' as union big-wig Mr Allcock, which was not used in the finished film.<ref>Robert Ross, ITV-DVD edition (Trivia Notes)</ref>\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] (b.1924) (4) appeared in three early films \u2013 ''Nurse'', ''Teacher'' and ''Constable'' \u2013 after which he left the series only to return 32 years later for ''Columbus'' as the King of Spain.\n\n=== Regular cast roles ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:89%;\"\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Title!! rowspan=\"2\" |Year!! colspan=\"14\" |Actor\n|-\n\n![[Kenneth Williams]]!![[Joan Sims]]!![[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]]!![[Sid James]]!![[Kenneth Connor]]!![[Peter Butterworth]]!![[Hattie Jacques]]!![[Bernard Bresslaw]]!![[Jim Dale]]!![[Barbara Windsor]]!![[Patsy Rowlands]]!![[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]]!![[Terry Scott]]!![[Leslie Phillips]]\n|-\n!''[[Carry On Sergeant|Sergeant]]''||1958\n|James Bailey||-||Peter Golightly||-||Horace Strong||-||Capt.

He had a larger role as Melly's Driver in ''England''.  He also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Ronnie Brody]] (2) made his first unaccredited appearance in ''Don't Lose Your Head'', followed up by the small role of Henry in ''Loving''.  Brody also appeared in 2 episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Abroad''.\n* [[Jeremy Bulloch]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance as a schoolboy in ''Teacher''.\n* [[Gerald Campion]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Sergeant''.\n* [[Brian Capron]] (0), the future ''Coronation Street'' baddie does not appear in any ''Carry On'' films.  He does, however, feature in two episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Patrick Cargill]] (2) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack''.  ''Carry On Nurse'' is based in part on the stage play ''Ring For Catty'' which he co-wrote with [[Jack Beale (writer)|Jack Beale]].  Three years later [[Peter Rogers]] used the same play as the basis for his film ''Twice Round The Daffodils''.\n* [[John Carlin (actor)|John Carlin]] (2) made just two small appearances in the film series (in ''England'' and ''Emmannuelle'').  However, before these roles he had been seen as a semi-regular performer (frequently 'camping it up') in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series, notching up six episodes.\n* [[Norman Chappell]] (2) made his ''Carry On'' debut in ''Cabby'' in a role originally offered to [[Kenneth Williams]].  When Williams refused it, the part of the Shop Steward was decreased and offered to Chappell.  His other appearance was in ''Henry''.

He also appeared in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' and ''Henry''.\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] (1) put in a supporting role in ''Cleo''.\n* [[Noel Dyson]] (2) was everyone's favourite nanny in ''[[Father, Dear Father]]'', and a founder cast member in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.  She appeared in ''Constable'' and ''Cabby''.\n* [[E. V. H. Emmett]] (1) brought his newsreading authority to the narrator of ''Cleo''.  Although several other films in the series used a narrator, none used them as effectively as ''Cleo'' where the conceit runs throughout the film.  Emmett was the only person to get credited for narrating a ''Carry On'' film.  He had previously been a [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont British News]] newsreader and commentator, and also provided narration for the first series of ''[[Dad's Army]]''.\n* [[Hilda Fenemore]] (2) had a main part in ''Nurse'' as a snob's loud-mouthed wife, and had a cameo appearance in ''Constable'' as a woman who wanted to use the public convenience.

For the latter role her voice was redubbed by [[John Bluthal]] in order to give the character a more asexual sound.\n* [[Fred Griffiths (actor)|Fred Griffiths]] (3) appears as an ambulance man in ''Nurse'', and as a taxi driver in ''Regardless'' and ''Loving''.\n* [[Sheila Hancock]] (1) lends her comic support to ''Cleo'' as Hengist Pod's wife Senna.\n* [[Irene Handl]] (2) appeared in ''Nurse'' and ''Constable''.\n* [[Sherrie Hewson]] (1) appeared in the large supporting role of Carol in ''Behind''.  However, she also made 4 appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Linda Hooks]] (3) the former Miss Great Britain had small glamorous roles in 3 later films, plus two appearances in episodes on the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Laraine Humphrys]] (2) brought glamour to ''Girls'' and ''Dick''.  Laraine also appeared in the 1975 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] (1) has a significant guest role in ''Nurse''.\n* [[Vivienne Johnson]] (1) is only credited with appearing in ''England''.  However, the previous year had seen her make three significant appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Elizabeth Knight]] (2) makes eye-catching appearances in ''Camping'' (as Jane), and ''Again Doctor'' (as Nurse Willing).\n* [[Ian Lavender]] (1) has a large supporting role in ''Behind''.\n* [[George Layton]] (1) was probably best known at the time for playing Dr Paul Collier in the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV)|Doctor...]]'' TV series. In ''Behind'' he makes a 'gag' appearance as a Doctor.  He also co-wrote an unused script for a potential ''Carry On'' film in the 1980s. \n* [[Tutte Lemkow]] (1) brought his distinctive face to British film and television productions for 40 years.  Sadly, his only ''Carry On'' contribution was as an unaccredited walk-on in ''Spying''.\n* [[John Levene]] (0) made an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in one of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV episodes.  Best known for playing UNIT soldier Corporal Benton in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', he appears briefly as a mediaeval soldier in the episode ''The Baron Outlook''.  He did not appear in any of the films.\n* [[Harry Locke]] (3) was a well-used supporting artist within the British film industry.  His 3 ''Carry On'' appearances are all in medical comedies: ''Nurse'', ''Doctor'', and ''Again Doctor''.\n* [[Reuben Martin (actor)|Reuben Martin]] (2) played gorillas in both ''Up The Jungle'' and ''Emmannuelle'' (the latter unaccredited).  He also donned his gorilla suit for an episode of the TV ''Carry On Laughing'' series.\n* [[Derek Martinus]] (1) appeared in just one of the series, ''Sergeant''.  He went on to become a TV director of note, directing (amongst other things) 9 episodes of [[William Hartnell]] era ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 17 further episodes of ''Doctor Who'', and 2 episodes of ''[[Blake's 7]]''.\n* [[Larry Martyn]] (2) had small roles in ''Convenience'' and ''Behind''.\n* [[Rik Mayall]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[William Mervyn]] (3) has cameo roles in ''Follow That Camel'', ''Again Doctor'', and ''Henry''.\n* [[Olive Milbourne]] (1) later found fame as Terry's mum in ''[[The Likely Lads]]'' (on both TV and radio), and its sequel ''[[Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads]]'', but an early unaccredited appearance was as a sexy GlamCab driver in ''Cabby''.\n* [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[Warren Mitchell]] (1) made an entertaining, single appearance in ''Cleo''.  He went on to create the role of [[Alf Garnett]] for writer [[Johnny Speight]].\n* [[Trisha Noble]] (1) had a large supporting role in ''Camping'', but her role was decreased during editing.\n* [[Cecil Parker]] (1) makes a guest appearance topping-and-tailing ''Jack''.\n* [[Daniel Peacock]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[Ambrosine Phillpotts]] (2) brings an aristocratic air to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.\n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] (2) brings something sinister to ''Regardless'', and shines in the supporting role of a foreign spy in ''Spying''.\n* [[Brian Rawlinson]] (3) appeared in ''Cruising'', ''Cleo'' and ''Cowboy''.\n* [[Linda Regan]] (1) appears as one of the ATS girls in ''England''.  Six years earlier she had also appeared uncredited in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Beryl Reid]] (1) made a guest appearance in ''Emmannuelle''.\n* [[Wendy Richard]] (2) made her ''Carry On'' film debut in ''Matron'', following it up with a larger supporting role in ''Girls''.  However, two years earlier she had also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Anton Rodgers]] (2) appeared in ''Cruising'' and ''Jack''.\n* [[Carole Shelley]] (2) brought 'ditzy' glamour to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.  \n* [[Vicki Smith]] (3) added unaccredited sex-appeal to ''Spying'', ''Cleo'', and ''Cowboy''.\n* [[Yutte Stensgaard]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance in ''Again Doctor'' as a nurse.  She also filmed a scene for ''Loving'' alongside [[Dad's Army]] star [[James Beck]], but their scene was removed from the film before release.\n* [[Jimmy Thompson (actor)|Jimmy Thompson]] (3) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack'', with a large supporting role in ''Cruising'' in the middle.\n* [[Bob Todd]] (1) makes an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in ''Again Doctor''.  He also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Nikki van der Zyl]] (2) was one of British cinema's most prolific voice-over artistes, dubbing many of the original Bond girls (including [[Shirley Eaton]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'').  She appears unaccredited in two of the films, none of them dubbing work.  In ''Cleo'' she doubles for [[Amanda Barrie]] when Cleo is rolled out of her carpet, whilst in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' she provides stunt work and appears as the messenger who brings a letter to [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] at the start of the film when he is about to be executed.\n* [[Wanda Ventham]] (2) has an unaccredited cameo in ''Cleo'', and a slightly larger role as the Khasi's first wife in ''Up The Khyber''.\n* [[Kenneth Waller]] (1) stepped into the role of the Barman in ''Behind'' at the last minute replacing the now unavailable [[Chris Gannon (actor)|Chris Gannon]].\n* [[Geoffrey Hughes]] (1) played Willie in ''Carry on at your convenience''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.carryonline.com/carryonline/reframe.html?http://www.carryonline.com/carryonline/castandcrew.html List of cast members from the official website]\n\n{{Carry On Films}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of actors by film series|Carry On]]\n[[Category:Carry On (franchise)|Cast]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=October 2018}}\n{{Fansite|date=October 2018}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2018}}}}\n\nThis is a list of actors who have appeared in [[Carry On (franchise)|''Carry On'' films]].\n\n== Regular cast ==\nThe following actors are considered to be the core members of the ''Carry On'' team:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewhippitinn.com/carry_on_people/|title=The Whippit Inn :  Carry On People|website=Thewhippitinn.com|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Kenneth Williams]] (1926\u20131988) (25 films, and co-presenting ''[[That's Carry On!]]'') played a range of character types, nearly always a lead character. Early roles were rather strait-laced; he then sometimes played his ''snide'' character: quite slimy and smarmy with a distinctive nasal voice. Later the haughty, proud and easily outraged elitist became more frequent and Williams' best known character type. Williams sometimes played characters of other nationalities, such as in ''Up the Khyber''. In some roles, when not actually playing his role in ''snide'' mode, Williams might deliver a single joke using his snide voice.  A running gag in many of the films was that Williams' character would be embroiled in an extra-marital affair with that of Hattie Jacques\u2014this plot device was used to greatest effect in the hospital-based films, which gave rise to Williams' famous catchphrase \"ohhh Matron!\".\n* [[Joan Sims]] (1930\u20132001) (24) had the longest uninterrupted run of roles in ''Carry On'' films, being in all 20 films (excluding ''That's Carry On'') from ''Carry On Cleo'' to ''Carry On Emmannuelle''. She  played a range of characters from jolly and assertive young women with sturdy moral standards (''Camping'', ''Loving'') to sexy and lusty matrons \u2013 either desired (''At Your Convenience'') or coarse and unattractive (''Henry'', ''Up the Khyber''), to a chatty glutton (in ''Matron''), a battleaxe wife (''Cleo'', ''Screaming'') and an unattractive spinster (''Doctor''). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eleven episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.\n* [[Charles Hawtrey (actor, born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] (1914\u20131988) (23) often played a meek, rather effete 'mummy's boy' who could suddenly erupt into riotous behaviour.  Other roles were as a strict, officious and prissy person in an authority role.  Hawtrey's characters were often bumbling and accident prone, and the victim of various mishaps and complex misunderstandings. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials.\n* [[Sid James]] (1913\u20131976) (19) always played a lead character, usually a laconic member of the working class. His characters were often lecherous womanisers, something that caused problems in James' private life. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and four episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' television series.\n* [[Kenneth Connor]] (1918\u20131993) (17) often played put-upon men ranging in character from pompous to meek, and often leering.  He also provided some additional voice-work in ''Emmannuelle'' when he dubbed the dialogue of Howard Nelson (Harry Hernia). He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' television specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Peter Butterworth]] (1919\u20131979) (16) frequently played major roles in the films, often as a generally benign, unflappable but bumbling assistant or servant unable to see the chaos around him. Unusually for a regular, in some films, including ''Again Doctor'', ''Henry'' and ''Loving'', his role consists of a cameo appearance in a single scene. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and nine episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Hattie Jacques]] (1922\u20131980) (14) played the haughty matron, school senior mistress or other archetypal authority figure in several films. Later she branched out into more varied comic roles (e.g. ''At Your Convenience'', ''Loving'' and ''Abroad'', in which she played a chef embroiled in a constant battle with the stove). She also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Bernard Bresslaw]] (1934\u20131993) (14) varied between playing the clumsy dimwit or the heavy, or the lusty and bombastic \"foreigner\". In the later films his characterisation developed greater depth, such as in ''Dick'', ''Behind''. He also appeared in three of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and five episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Jim Dale]] (1935-) (11) joined the series with support roles, but quickly progressed to playing the younger, sympathetic male lead, often in the film's romance plot strand. From his debut had an uninterrupted nine-film run. After a two-film absence (''Camping'' and ''Up The Khyber'') returned for ''Again Doctor'', his final ''Carry On'' until taking the lead role in the 1992 revival film ''Carry On Columbus''.\n* [[Barbara Windsor]] (b.1937) (10, including co-presenting ''That's Carry On'' with Williams) played main roles in all her ''Carry On'' appearances. Her characters were always the cheeky and saucy young blonde, often in revealing costumes. Sometimes her characters were chaste (and very often chased), some were easily swayed. She also appeared in all four of the ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and eight episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Patsy Rowlands]] (1931\u20132005) (9) started in support roles, often as undervalued, meek and mousey secretary or assistant who undergoes transformation into a more assertive and sexually aware woman. She also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]] (1927\u20132008) (8) joined the series with a cameo appearance in ''Matron'', where he appears in one scene with a single line of dialogue. After an only slightly larger role in the following film ''Abroad'', where he again plays his established ''Alf Ippititimus''-type character, his roles increased in size and increasingly diverged from the familiar Alf performance. After his d\u00e9but Douglas appeared in all subsequent films in the original series, and was one of the few returners for ''Columbus''. He also appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials, and twelve episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Terry Scott]] (1927\u20131994) (7) appeared briefly in the first film ''Sergeant'' and returned 10 years later when he played, among others, the put-upon husband (''Camping''), the barking sergeant (''Up the Khyber'') and lusty doctor (''Matron'').  Additionally, he appeared in two of the four ''Carry On Christmas'' TV specials. He also filmed a scene for ''At Your Convenience'' as union big-wig Mr Allcock, which was not used in the finished film.<ref>Robert Ross, ITV-DVD edition (Trivia Notes)</ref>\n* [[Leslie Phillips]] (b.1924) (4) appeared in three early films \u2013 ''Nurse'', ''Teacher'' and ''Constable'' \u2013 after which he left the series only to return 32 years later for ''Columbus'' as the King of Spain.\n\n=== Regular cast roles ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:89%;\"\n|- valign=\"center\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Title!! rowspan=\"2\" |Year!! colspan=\"14\" |Actor\n|-\n\n![[Kenneth Williams]]!![[Joan Sims]]!![[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]]!![[Sid James]]!![[Kenneth Connor]]!![[Peter Butterworth]]!![[Hattie Jacques]]!![[Bernard Bresslaw]]!![[Jim Dale]]!![[Barbara Windsor]]!![[Patsy Rowlands]]!![[Jack Douglas (actor)|Jack Douglas]]!![[Terry Scott]]!![[Leslie Phillips]]\n|-\n!''[[Carry On Sergeant|Sergeant]]''||1958\n|James Bailey||-||Peter Golightly||-||Horace Strong||-||Capt.

He had a larger role as Melly's Driver in ''England''.  He also appeared in one episode of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Ronnie Brody]] (2) made his first unaccredited appearance in ''Don't Lose Your Head'', followed up by the small role of Henry in ''Loving''.  Brody also appeared in 2 episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Ray Brooks (actor)|Ray Brooks]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Abroad''.\n* [[Jeremy Bulloch]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance as a schoolboy in ''Teacher''.\n* [[Gerald Campion]] (1) had a sizeable supporting role in ''Sergeant''.\n* [[Brian Capron]] (0), the future ''Coronation Street'' baddie does not appear in any ''Carry On'' films.  He does, however, feature in two episodes of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Patrick Cargill]] (2) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack''.  ''Carry On Nurse'' is based in part on the stage play ''Ring For Catty'' which he co-wrote with [[Jack Beale (writer)|Jack Beale]].  Three years later [[Peter Rogers]] used the same play as the basis for his film ''Twice Round The Daffodils''.\n* [[John Carlin (actor)|John Carlin]] (2) made just two small appearances in the film series (in ''England'' and ''Emmannuelle'').  However, before these roles he had been seen as a semi-regular performer (frequently 'camping it up') in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series, notching up six episodes.\n* [[Norman Chappell]] (2) made his ''Carry On'' debut in ''Cabby'' in a role originally offered to [[Kenneth Williams]].  When Williams refused it, the part of the Shop Steward was decreased and offered to Chappell.  His other appearance was in ''Henry''.  He was also to appear in ''Loving'', but his part was edited out of the film before release.

He also appeared in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' and ''Henry''.\n* [[Francis de Wolff]] (1) put in a supporting role in ''Cleo''.\n* [[Noel Dyson]] (2) was everyone's favourite nanny in ''[[Father, Dear Father]]'', and a founder cast member in ''[[Coronation Street]]''.  She appeared in ''Constable'' and ''Cabby''.\n* [[E. V. H. Emmett]] (1) brought his newsreading authority to the narrator of ''Cleo''.  Although several other films in the series used a narrator, none used them as effectively as ''Cleo'' where the conceit runs throughout the film.  Emmett was the only person to get credited for narrating a ''Carry On'' film.  He had previously been a [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont British News]] newsreader and commentator, and also provided narration for the first series of ''[[Dad's Army]]''.\n* [[Hilda Fenemore]] (2) had a main part in ''Nurse'' as a snob's loud-mouthed wife, and had a cameo appearance in ''Constable'' as a woman who wanted to use the public convenience.

For the latter role her voice was redubbed by [[John Bluthal]] in order to give the character a more asexual sound.\n* [[Fred Griffiths (actor)|Fred Griffiths]] (3) appears as an ambulance man in ''Nurse'', and as a taxi driver in ''Regardless'' and ''Loving''.\n* [[Sheila Hancock]] (1) lends her comic support to ''Cleo'' as Hengist Pod's wife Senna.\n* [[Irene Handl]] (2) appeared in ''Nurse'' and ''Constable''.\n* [[Sherrie Hewson]] (1) appeared in the large supporting role of Carol in ''Behind''.  However, she also made 4 appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Linda Hooks]] (3) the former Miss Great Britain had small glamorous roles in 3 later films, plus two appearances in episodes on the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Laraine Humphrys]] (2) brought glamour to ''Girls'' and ''Dick''.  Laraine also appeared in the 1975 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] (1) has a significant guest role in ''Nurse''.\n* [[Vivienne Johnson]] (1) is only credited with appearing in ''England''.  However, the previous year had seen her make three significant appearances in the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV series.\n* [[Elizabeth Knight]] (2) makes eye-catching appearances in ''Camping'' (as Jane), and ''Again Doctor'' (as Nurse Willing).\n* [[Ian Lavender]] (1) has a large supporting role in ''Behind''.\n* [[George Layton]] (1) was probably best known at the time for playing Dr Paul Collier in the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV)|Doctor...]]'' TV series. In ''Behind'' he makes a 'gag' appearance as a Doctor.  He also co-wrote an unused script for a potential ''Carry On'' film in the 1980s. \n* [[Tutte Lemkow]] (1) brought his distinctive face to British film and television productions for 40 years.  Sadly, his only ''Carry On'' contribution was as an unaccredited walk-on in ''Spying''.\n* [[John Levene]] (0) made an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in one of the ''Carry On Laughing'' TV episodes.  Best known for playing UNIT soldier Corporal Benton in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', he appears briefly as a mediaeval soldier in the episode ''The Baron Outlook''.  He did not appear in any of the films.\n* [[Harry Locke]] (3) was a well-used supporting artist within the British film industry.  His 3 ''Carry On'' appearances are all in medical comedies: ''Nurse'', ''Doctor'', and ''Again Doctor''.\n* [[Reuben Martin (actor)|Reuben Martin]] (2) played gorillas in both ''Up The Jungle'' and ''Emmannuelle'' (the latter unaccredited).  He also donned his gorilla suit for an episode of the TV ''Carry On Laughing'' series.\n* [[Derek Martinus]] (1) appeared in just one of the series, ''Sergeant''.  He went on to become a TV director of note, directing (amongst other things) 9 episodes of [[William Hartnell]] era ''[[Doctor Who]]'', 17 further episodes of ''Doctor Who'', and 2 episodes of ''[[Blake's 7]]''.\n* [[Larry Martyn]] (2) had small roles in ''Convenience'' and ''Behind''.\n* [[Rik Mayall]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[William Mervyn]] (3) has cameo roles in ''Follow That Camel'', ''Again Doctor'', and ''Henry''.\n* [[Olive Milbourne]] (1) later found fame as Terry's mum in ''[[The Likely Lads]]'' (on both TV and radio), and its sequel ''[[Whatever Happened To The Likely Lads]]'', but an early unaccredited appearance was as a sexy GlamCab driver in ''Cabby''.\n* [[Larry Miller (entertainer)|Larry Miller]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[Warren Mitchell]] (1) made an entertaining, single appearance in ''Cleo''.  He went on to create the role of [[Alf Garnett]] for writer [[Johnny Speight]].\n* [[Trisha Noble]] (1) had a large supporting role in ''Camping'', but her role was decreased during editing.\n* [[Cecil Parker]] (1) makes a guest appearance topping-and-tailing ''Jack''.\n* [[Daniel Peacock]] (1) ''Columbus''.\n* [[Ambrosine Phillpotts]] (2) brings an aristocratic air to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.\n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] (2) brings something sinister to ''Regardless'', and shines in the supporting role of a foreign spy in ''Spying''.\n* [[Brian Rawlinson]] (3) appeared in ''Cruising'', ''Cleo'' and ''Cowboy''.\n* [[Linda Regan]] (1) appears as one of the ATS girls in ''England''.  Six years earlier she had also appeared uncredited in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Beryl Reid]] (1) made a guest appearance in ''Emmannuelle''.\n* [[Wendy Richard]] (2) made her ''Carry On'' film debut in ''Matron'', following it up with a larger supporting role in ''Girls''.  However, two years earlier she had also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Anton Rodgers]] (2) appeared in ''Cruising'' and ''Jack''.\n* [[Carole Shelley]] (2) brought 'ditzy' glamour to ''Regardless'' and ''Cabby''.  \n* [[Vicki Smith]] (3) added unaccredited sex-appeal to ''Spying'', ''Cleo'', and ''Cowboy''.\n* [[Yutte Stensgaard]] (1) made an unaccredited appearance in ''Again Doctor'' as a nurse.  She also filmed a scene for ''Loving'' alongside [[Dad's Army]] star [[James Beck]], but their scene was removed from the film before release.\n* [[Jimmy Thompson (actor)|Jimmy Thompson]] (3) appeared in ''Regardless'' and ''Jack'', with a large supporting role in ''Cruising'' in the middle.\n* [[Bob Todd]] (1) makes an unaccredited 'gag' appearance in ''Again Doctor''.  He also appeared in the 1970 ''Carry On Again Christmas'' TV special.\n* [[Nikki van der Zyl]] (2) was one of British cinema's most prolific voice-over artistes, dubbing many of the original Bond girls (including [[Shirley Eaton]] in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'').  She appears unaccredited in two of the films, none of them dubbing work.  In ''Cleo'' she doubles for [[Amanda Barrie]] when Cleo is rolled out of her carpet, whilst in ''Don't Lose Your Head'' she provides stunt work and appears as the messenger who brings a letter to [[Charles Hawtrey (actor born 1914)|Charles Hawtrey]] at the start of the film when he is about to be executed.\n* [[Wanda Ventham]] (2) has an unaccredited cameo in ''Cleo'', and a slightly larger role as the Khasi's first wife in ''Up The Khyber''.\n* [[Kenneth Waller]] (1) stepped into the role of the Barman in ''Behind'' at the last minute replacing the now unavailable [[Chris Gannon (actor)|Chris Gannon]].\n* [[Geoffrey Hughes]] (1) played Willie in ''Carry on at your convenience''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.carryonline.com/carryonline/reframe.html?http://www.carryonline.com/carryonline/castandcrew.html List of cast members from the official website]\n\n{{Carry On Films}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of actors by film series|Carry On]]\n[[Category:Carry On (franchise)|Cast]]\n", "name_user": "Hammersfan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRegular cast roles", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Carry_On_films_cast_members"}
