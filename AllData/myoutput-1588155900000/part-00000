Plunkett at Warwick Electronics Inc./[[Thomas Organ Company]] in November 1966. This pedal is the original [[prototype]] made from a [[transistor]]ized MRB (mid-range boost) [[potentiometer]] [[Breadboard|bread-boarded]] [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] and the housing of a [[Vox Continental]] Organ [[volume pedal]].  The concept, however, was not new. Country guitar virtuoso [[Chet Atkins]] had used a similar, self-designed device on his late 1950s recordings of \"Hot Toddy\" and \"Slinkey\". Jazz guitarist [[Peter Van Wood]] had a modified [[Hammond organ]] expression\npedal; he recorded in 1955 a version of [[George Gershwin]]'s \"[[Summertime (George Gershwin song)|Summertime]]\" with a \"crying\" tone, and other recordings including humorous \"novelty\" effects. A DeArmond Tone and Volume pedal was used in the early 1960s by [[Big Jim Sullivan]], notably in some [[Krew Cats]] instrumental tracks, and in [[Dave Berry (musician)|Dave Berry]]'s song \"The Crying Game\".\n\nThe creation of the modern wah pedal was an accident which stemmed from the redesign of the [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox]] Super Beatle [[Instrument amplifier|guitar amplifier]] in 1966.  Warwick Electronics Inc. also owned Thomas Organ Company and had earlier entered into an agreement with [[Jennings Musical Instruments]] (JMI) of England for Thomas to distribute the Vox name and products in the United States.  In addition to distributing the British-made Vox amplifiers, the Thomas Organ Company also designed and manufactured much of the Vox equipment sold in the US The more highly regarded British Vox amplifiers were designed by Dick Denney and made by JMI, the parent company of Vox.  Warwick assigned Thomas Organ Company to create a new product line of [[Solid-state electronics|solid state]] Vox amplifiers called Vox Amplifonic Orchestra, which included the Super Beatle amplifier, named to capitalize on the Vox brand name's popularity in association with [[the Beatles]], who used the JMI English Vox amplifiers such as the famous [[Vox AC30]] (although the Beatles did use several American-made Super Beatle units on their 1966 US tour).  The US-made Vox product line development was headed by musician and bandleader [[Bill Page]]. While creating the Vox Amplifonic Orchestra, the Thomas Organ Company decided to create an American-made equivalent of the British Vox amplifier but with [[transistor]]ized (solid state) circuits, rather than [[vacuum tube]]s, which would be less expensive to manufacture. During the re-design of the USA Vox amplifier, Stan Cuttler, head engineer of Thomas Organ Company, assigned Brad Plunkett, a junior electronics engineer, to replace the expensive Jennings 3-position MRB circuit switch with a transistorized solid state MRB circuit.\n\nPlunkett had lifted and bread-boarded a transistorized tone-circuit from the Thomas Organ (an electric solid state transistorized organ) to duplicate the Jennings 3-position circuit. After adjusting and testing the amplifier with an [[electronic oscillator]] and [[oscilloscope]], Plunkett connected the output to the speaker and tested the circuit audibly. At that point, several engineers and technical consultants, including Bill Page and [[Del Casher]], noticed the sound effect caused by the circuit. Page insisted on testing this bread-boarded circuit while he played his saxophone through an amplifier. John Glennon, an assistant junior electronics engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, was summoned to bring a volume control pedal which was used in the Vox Continental Organ so that the transistorized MRB potentiometer bread-boarded circuit could be installed in the pedal's housing. After the installation, Page began playing his saxophone through the pedal and had asked Joe Banaron, CEO of Warwick Electronics Inc./Thomas Organ Company, to listen to the effect. At this point the first electric guitar was plugged into the prototype wah pedal by guitarist Del Casher who suggested to Joe Banaron that this was a guitar effects pedal rather than a wind instrument effects pedal. Banaron, being a fan of the [[big band]] style of music, was interested in marketing the wah pedal for wind instruments as suggested by Page rather than for the electric guitar as suggested by Casher. After a remark by Casher to Banaron regarding the [[Harmon mute]] style of trumpet playing in the famous recording of \"[[Sugar Blues (song)|Sugar Blues]]\" from the 1930s, Banaron decided to market the wah-wah pedal using [[Clyde McCoy]]'s name for endorsement.\n\nAfter the invention of the wah pedal, the prototype was modified by Casher and Plunkett to better accommodate the harmonic qualities of the electric guitar. However, since Vox had no intention of marketing the wah pedal for electric guitar players, the prototype wah-wah pedal was given to Del Casher for performances at Vox press conferences and film scores for [[Universal Pictures]]. The un-modified version of the Vox wah pedal was released to the public in February 1967 with an image of Clyde McCoy on the bottom of the pedal.\n\nWarwick Electronics Inc. assigned Lester L. Kushner, an engineer with the Thomas Organ Company, and Brad Plunkett to write and submit the documentation for the wah-wah pedal patent. The patent application was submitted on 24 February 1967, which included technical diagrams of the pedal being connected to a four-stringed \"guitar\" (as noted from the \"Description of the Preferred Embodiment\"). Warwick Electronics Inc. was granted {{US patent| 3530224}} (\"foot-controlled continuously variable preference circuit for musical instruments\") on 22 September 1970.\n\nEarly versions of the Clyde McCoy featured an image of McCoy on the bottom panel, which soon gave way to only his signature. Thomas Organ then wanted the effect branded as their own for the American market, changing it to Cry Baby which was sold in parallel to the Italian Vox V846. Thomas Organ's failure to trademark the Cry Baby name soon led to the market being flooded with Cry Baby imitations from various parts of the world, including Italy, where all of the original Vox and Cry Babys were made.<ref>[http://www.guitarplayer.com/article/vox-v848-clyde/Apr-07/26876 Guitar Player: The Complete Electric Guitar Package<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Jen, who had been responsible for the manufacture of Thomas Organ and Vox wah pedals, also made rebranded pedals for companies such as [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] and [[Gretsch]] and under their own Jen brand. When Thomas Organ moved production completely to Sepulveda, California and Chicago, Illinois these Italian models continued to be made and are among the more collectible wah pedals today.\n\n== Cream and Jimi Hendrix ==\n[[File:Pink Floyd Their Mortal Remains - 2017-10-13 - Andy Mabbett - 28 (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|[[David Gilmour]]'s VOX Wah Wah guitar effects pedal, as used on ''[[Obscured by Clouds]]'' (1972), displayed at the [[Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains]] exhibition]]\n\nSome of the most famous electric guitarists of the day were keen to adopt the wah-wah pedal soon after its release. Among the first recordings featuring wah-wah pedal were \"[[Tales of Brave Ulysses]]\" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]] with [[Eric Clapton]] on guitar and \"[[Burning of the Midnight Lamp]]\" by the [[Jimi Hendrix Experience]],<ref>http://www.jimdunlop.com/product/jh1d-7-10137-04796-9.do</ref> both released in 1967. Hendrix also used wah wah on his famous song Voodoo Child, in intro and in soloing. Clapton, in particular, used the device on many of the [[Cream (band)|Cream]] songs included on their second and third albums, ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' (1967) and ''[[Wheels of Fire]]'' (1968) respectively.  Clapton would subsequently employ it again on \"[[Wah-Wah (song)|Wah-Wah]]\", from his good friend [[George Harrison]]'s solo album ''[[All Things Must Pass (album)|All Things Must Pass]]'', upon the dissolution of [[The Beatles]] in 1970. Another prominent use occurred in the recording of \"[[Crimson and Clover]]\" by [[Tommy James and the Shondells]] in late 1968, with the single version eventually reaching number one in early 1969. [[Terry Kath]], lead guitarist for the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], used it on many of their early recordings as well. [[Martin Barre]], lead guitarist for the fledgling [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], also employed it to great effect on their second album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', particularly on \"We Used to Know\" and \"Look into the Sun\".  [[Jimmy Page]] featured the wah-wah pedal on several songs from the final [[Yardbirds]] album ''[[Little Games]]'', as well as the solo on the [[Led Zeppelin]] song \"[[Custard Pie]]\", and throughout \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\", both from ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''. [[Tony Iommi]] used it on the songs \"[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]\", \"[[The Wizard (Black Sabbath song)|The Wizard]]\" and [[Geezer Butler]] (Bass) \"[[N.I.B.]]\" from their self-titled debut album, \"[[Electric Funeral]]\" from ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' album. He also employed it on later recordings, such as \"Shock Wave\" on ''[[Never Say Die!]]'' (1978), \"Lady Evil\" from the first [[Ronnie James Dio]]-era album ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1980), and \"Turn Up the Night\" on the subsequent ''[[Mob Rules (album)|Mob Rules]]'' (1981).\n\nThe wah-wah pedal was revived in the British music industry in the late 1980s by [[John Squire]] of [[The Stone Roses]] whose squelching licks graced most of the Roses songs from 1988 to 1990, particularly \"[[Elephant Stone]]\", \"Waterfall\" and in particular \"[[Fools Gold/What the World Is Waiting For|Fools Gold]]\". By the late 80s Squire had tired of the overly angular guitar riffs which dominated British music and had bought a wah wah pedal to soften the Roses sound. The wah would also be used by the Roses contemporaries such as the Happy Mondays and The Charlatans [UK], and became one of the defining sounds of British guitar music in the late 80s/early 90s.\n\n== Other functions ==\n\nIn addition to rocking the pedal up and down to crest a spectral glide, another function of the pedal is to use it in a fixed position. A guitarist using the wah in this way selects a position on the wah pedal and leaves the pedal there. Depending on the position of the pedal, this will boost or cut a specific frequency. This can be used for emphasizing the \"sweet spot\" in the tonal spectrum of a particular instrument. One electric guitar player to use the pedal in this way was [[Jimi Hendrix]], who revolutionized its application by combining a [[Fender Stratocaster]] with stacked Marshall Amplifiers (in both static and modulated mode) for lead and rhythm guitar applications unheard of before then. According to Del Casher, Hendrix learned about the pedal from [[Frank Zappa]], another well-known early user.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title= The Frank Zappa companion: four decades of commentary\n | first1= Richard\n | last1= Kostelanetz\n | first2= John M.\n | last2= Rocco\n | publisher= Schirmer Books\n | year= 1997\n | isbn= 0-02-864628-2\n | page= 94\n | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pCYIAQAAMAAJ\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Wallace\n | first= Amy\n | title= With a Flip of a Knob, He Heard the Future\n | work= [[The New York Times]]\n | date= 6 August 2011\n | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/business/del-casher-and-the-story-of-the-wah-wah-pedal.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\n | accessdate= 12 November 2012\n}}\n</ref>\nMilestones of this signature guitar and amplifier combination include songs such as \"[[Voodoo Child (Slight Return)]]\" as well as the \"[[Star Spangled Banner]]\" which was played by Hendrix at [[Woodstock]] in 1969.

This is done by muting strings, holding down a chord and moving the pedal at the same time. This was first heard on the song \"Little Miss Lover\" (1967) by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. One of the most famous uses of this effect is heard on [[Isaac Hayes]]'s \"[[Theme from Shaft]]\" (1971), [[Charles Pitts]] playing the guitar.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title= The Boss Book: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Most Popular Compact Effects for Guitar\n | publisher= Hal Leonard\n | year= 2002\n | page= 89\n | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7uumqHg4zAC&pg=RA1-PT89\n | isbn= 978-0-634-04480-9\n}}\n</ref>\nThe \"wah-wah\" and \"wacka-wacka\" effects are often associated with the bands on 1970s TV [[variety show]]s, like those of [[Sonny and Cher]], [[Flip Wilson]], or [[Donny and Marie Osmond]]; or with the soundtracks of [[pornographic film]]s, the sound referenced in TV commercials for [[Axe (brand)|Axe]] body spray as \"bow chicka wow wow.\"\n\n[[David Gilmour]] ([[Pink Floyd]]) used the pedal to create the \"whale\" effect during ''[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]''. He discovered this effect as a result of a roadie accidentally plugging his guitar into the output of the pedal and the input being plugged into his amp. The effect was first used during live performances of ''[[Embryo (Pink Floyd song)|The Embryo]]'' during 1970 but was then switched into ''Echoes'' as it was being developed before being released on the ''[[Meddle]]'' album on 31 October 1971.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Riis\n | first= Bj\u00f8rn\n | title= Echoes \"seagull\" effect tutorial\n | website= Gilmourish\n | date= 26 October 2009\n | url= http://www.gilmourish.com/?p=754\n | accessdate= 6 April 2017\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Other instruments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\nMany bassists have also used the wah-wah effect, for example [[Michael Henderson]] on [[Miles Davis]]'s album ''[[On the Corner]]'' (1972). Funk band [[Kool & the Gang]], [[B. T. Express]], and [[Jimmy Castor Bunch]] also used a wah-wah pedal. Melvin Ragin, better known by the nickname [[Wah Wah Watson]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wahwah.com/history |title= A brief history of Wah Wah Watson |publisher= Wah Wah Watson Music. |accessdate= 17 December 2019}}</ref>, was a member of the Motown Records studio band, The Funk Brothers, where he recorded with artists such as [[The Temptations]] \"Papa was a Rolling Stone\", Marvin Gaye \"Let's Get It On\", [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]], and [[The Supremes]], Undisputed Truth \"Smilin' Faces\".<ref>http://www.wahwah.com/history</ref> He played on numerous sessions in the 1970s and 1980s for many top [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] acts, including [[Herbie Hancock]]. \n\nHeavy Metal bassist [[Cliff Burton]] of [[Metallica]] used a [[Morley Pedals|Morley]] Wah pedal (along with a [[Big Muff]] Distortion) extensively, including on \"[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]\", which is a bass solo recorded for ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' (1983), and \"The Call of Ktulu\" and \"[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]\", both recorded for ''[[Ride the Lightning]]''. [[Geezer Butler]], bassist of [[Black Sabbath]], used it when playing his solo \"Bassically\", along with the bass line in \"[[N.I.B.]]\". [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] used a wah-wah pedal on his solo piece \"[[The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)|The Fish]]\" on the album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]''. While wah pedals are less popular as a bass effect, various companies now offer pedals designed specifically for bass guitars.\n\nMany [[steel guitar]] players use a wah-wah, such as Robert Randolph from the [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]].\n\nKeyboardists have also made use of the wah-wah effect both in the studio and during live performances. [[Garth Hudson]] famously used a wah-wah pedal on a [[clavinet]] in [[The Band]]'s song \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\" to emulate a [[jaw harp]]. [[Richard Wright (musician)|Rick Wright]] of Pink Floyd played a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] through a wah-wah pedal in their song \"[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]\" to give the impression of many consecutive chords being played. [[John Medeski]] of [[Medeski, Martin, and Wood]] uses a wah pedal with his clavinet.\n\nMany [[jazz fusion]] records feature wind and brass instruments with the effect \u2013 Miles Davis's trumpet being a well-known example. Davis first used this technique in 1970 (at concerts documented on ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' and ''[[The Cellar Door Sessions]]'') at a time when he also made his keyboard players ([[Keith Jarrett]] and [[Chick Corea]]) play [[electric piano]]s with a wah-wah pedal. [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] played a saxophone amplified through a wah-wah pedal in the [[Frank Zappa]] movie ''[[The Dub Room Special]]'', as well as on some of Zappa's albums. [[David Sanborn]] can be heard playing an alto saxophone modified by a wah-wah pedal on the [[David Bowie]] album ''[[Young Americans]]''. Noted saxophonist [[King Curtis]] was also known to use a wah-wah pedal. Dick Sims, the keyboard player with Eric Clapton in the late 1970s, used a Hammond organ in conjunction with a wah-wah pedal.\n\nThe effect is also extensively used with the electric violin. Notable examples are [[Jerry Goodman]] with the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and [[L. Shankar|Shankar]] with [[Frank Zappa]], all usually engaged in long wah-wah violin/guitar duels. [[Boyd Tinsley]] of the [[Dave Matthews Band]] is known to use a wah-wah pedal live.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Talk box]]\n*[[Equalization (audio)|EQ]]\n*[[Auto-wah]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further information==\n* ''Cry Baby: The Pedal that Rocks the World'' (documentary, 2011)\n\n{{Music production}}\n{{Music technology}}\n\n[[Category:Audio engineering]]\n[[Category:Effects units]]\n[[Category:Tone, EQ and filter]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Thomas Organ Crybaby.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Thomas Organ Cry Baby (1970) manufactured by JEN]]\n[[File:Wah-wah + distortion (guitar).ogg|thumb|Wah-wah pedal ([[Dunlop Manufacturing|Dunlop]] Crybaby 535q) on electric guitar with [[Distortion (music)|distortion]].]]\n\nA '''wah-wah pedal''' (or simply '''wah pedal''') is a type of electric guitar [[effects unit|effects pedal]] that alters the tone and frequencies of the guitar signal to create a distinctive sound, mimicking the [[human voice]] saying the [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] name \"wah-wah\".

Another prominent use occurred in the recording of \"[[Crimson and Clover]]\" by [[Tommy James and the Shondells]] in late 1968, with the single version eventually reaching number one in early 1969. [[Terry Kath]], lead guitarist for the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], used it on many of their early recordings as well. [[Martin Barre]], lead guitarist for the fledgling [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], also employed it to great effect on their second album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', particularly on \"We Used to Know\" and \"Look into the Sun\".  [[Jimmy Page]] featured the wah-wah pedal on several songs from the final [[Yardbirds]] album ''[[Little Games]]'', as well as the solo on the [[Led Zeppelin]] song \"[[Custard Pie]]\", and throughout \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\", both from ''[[Physical Graffiti]]''. [[Tony Iommi]] used it on the songs \"[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]\", \"[[The Wizard (Black Sabbath song)|The Wizard]]\" and [[Geezer Butler]] (Bass) \"[[N.I.B.]]\" from their self-titled debut album, \"[[Electric Funeral]]\" from ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' album. He also employed it on later recordings, such as \"Shock Wave\" on ''[[Never Say Die!]]'' (1978), \"Lady Evil\" from the first [[Ronnie James Dio]]-era album ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' (1980), and \"Turn Up the Night\" on the subsequent ''[[Mob Rules (album)|Mob Rules]]'' (1981).\n\nThe wah-wah pedal was revived in the British music industry in the late 1980s by [[John Squire]] of [[The Stone Roses]] whose squelching licks graced most of the Roses songs from 1988 to 1990, particularly \"[[Elephant Stone]]\", \"Waterfall\" and in particular \"[[Fools Gold/What the World Is Waiting For|Fools Gold]]\". By the late 80s Squire had tired of the overly angular guitar riffs which dominated British music and had bought a wah wah pedal to soften the Roses sound. The wah would also be used by the Roses contemporaries such as the Happy Mondays and The Charlatans [UK], and became one of the defining sounds of British guitar music in the late 80s/early 90s.\n\n== Other functions ==\n\nIn addition to rocking the pedal up and down to crest a spectral glide, another function of the pedal is to use it in a fixed position. A guitarist using the wah in this way selects a position on the wah pedal and leaves the pedal there. Depending on the position of the pedal, this will boost or cut a specific frequency. This can be used for emphasizing the \"sweet spot\" in the tonal spectrum of a particular instrument. One electric guitar player to use the pedal in this way was [[Jimi Hendrix]], who revolutionized its application by combining a [[Fender Stratocaster]] with stacked Marshall Amplifiers (in both static and modulated mode) for lead and rhythm guitar applications unheard of before then. According to Del Casher, Hendrix learned about the pedal from [[Frank Zappa]], another well-known early user.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title= The Frank Zappa companion: four decades of commentary\n | first1= Richard\n | last1= Kostelanetz\n | first2= John M.\n | last2= Rocco\n | publisher= Schirmer Books\n | year= 1997\n | isbn= 0-02-864628-2\n | page= 94\n | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pCYIAQAAMAAJ\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Wallace\n | first= Amy\n | title= With a Flip of a Knob, He Heard the Future\n | work= [[The New York Times]]\n | date= 6 August 2011\n | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/business/del-casher-and-the-story-of-the-wah-wah-pedal.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\n | accessdate= 12 November 2012\n}}\n</ref>\nMilestones of this signature guitar and amplifier combination include songs such as \"[[Voodoo Child (Slight Return)]]\" as well as the \"[[Star Spangled Banner]]\" which was played by Hendrix at [[Woodstock]] in 1969.

This is done by muting strings, holding down a chord and moving the pedal at the same time. This was first heard on the song \"Little Miss Lover\" (1967) by the Jimi Hendrix Experience. One of the most famous uses of this effect is heard on [[Isaac Hayes]]'s \"[[Theme from Shaft]]\" (1971), [[Charles Pitts]] playing the guitar.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title= The Boss Book: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Most Popular Compact Effects for Guitar\n | publisher= Hal Leonard\n | year= 2002\n | page= 89\n | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7uumqHg4zAC&pg=RA1-PT89\n | isbn= 978-0-634-04480-9\n}}\n</ref>\nThe \"wah-wah\" and \"wacka-wacka\" effects are often associated with the bands on 1970s TV [[variety show]]s, like those of [[Sonny and Cher]], [[Flip Wilson]], or [[Donny and Marie Osmond]]; or with the soundtracks of [[pornographic film]]s, the sound referenced in TV commercials for [[Axe (brand)|Axe]] body spray as \"bow chicka wow wow.\"\n\n[[David Gilmour]] ([[Pink Floyd]]) used the pedal to create the \"whale\" effect during ''[[Echoes (Pink Floyd song)|Echoes]]''. He discovered this effect as a result of a roadie accidentally plugging his guitar into the output of the pedal and the input being plugged into his amp. The effect was first used during live performances of ''[[Embryo (Pink Floyd song)|The Embryo]]'' during 1970 but was then switched into ''Echoes'' as it was being developed before being released on the ''[[Meddle]]'' album on 31 October 1971.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last= Riis\n | first= Bj\u00f8rn\n | title= Echoes \"seagull\" effect tutorial\n | website= Gilmourish\n | date= 26 October 2009\n | url= http://www.gilmourish.com/?p=754\n | accessdate= 6 April 2017\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Other instruments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\nMany bassists have also used the wah-wah effect, for example [[Michael Henderson]] on [[Miles Davis]]'s album ''[[On the Corner]]'' (1972). Funk band [[Kool & the Gang]], [[B. T. Express]], and [[Jimmy Castor Bunch]] also used a wah-wah pedal. Melvin Ragin, better known by the nickname [[Wah Wah Watson]]<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wahwah.com/history |title= A brief history of Wah Wah Watson |publisher= Wah Wah Watson Music. |accessdate= 17 December 2019}}</ref>, was a member of the Motown Records studio band, The Funk Brothers, where he recorded with artists such as [[The Temptations]] \"Papa was a Rolling Stone\", Marvin Gaye \"Let's Get It On\", [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Gladys Knight & The Pips]], and [[The Supremes]], Undisputed Truth \"Smilin' Faces\".<ref>http://www.wahwah.com/history</ref> He played on numerous sessions in the 1970s and 1980s for many top [[soul music|soul]], [[funk]] and [[disco]] acts, including [[Herbie Hancock]]. \n\nHeavy Metal bassist [[Cliff Burton]] of [[Metallica]] used a [[Morley Pedals|Morley]] Wah pedal (along with a [[Big Muff]] Distortion) extensively, including on \"[[(Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth]]\", which is a bass solo recorded for ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' (1983), and \"The Call of Ktulu\" and \"[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]\", both recorded for ''[[Ride the Lightning]]''. [[Geezer Butler]], bassist of [[Black Sabbath]], used it when playing his solo \"Bassically\", along with the bass line in \"[[N.I.B.]]\". [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]] used a wah-wah pedal on his solo piece \"[[The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus)|The Fish]]\" on the album ''[[Fragile (Yes album)|Fragile]]''. While wah pedals are less popular as a bass effect, various companies now offer pedals designed specifically for bass guitars.\n\nMany [[steel guitar]] players use a wah-wah, such as Robert Randolph from the [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band]].\n\nKeyboardists have also made use of the wah-wah effect both in the studio and during live performances. [[Garth Hudson]] famously used a wah-wah pedal on a [[clavinet]] in [[The Band]]'s song \"[[Up on Cripple Creek]]\" to emulate a [[jaw harp]]. [[Richard Wright (musician)|Rick Wright]] of Pink Floyd played a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] through a wah-wah pedal in their song \"[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]\" to give the impression of many consecutive chords being played. [[John Medeski]] of [[Medeski, Martin, and Wood]] uses a wah pedal with his clavinet.\n\nMany [[jazz fusion]] records feature wind and brass instruments with the effect \u2013 Miles Davis's trumpet being a well-known example. Davis first used this technique in 1970 (at concerts documented on ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' and ''[[The Cellar Door Sessions]]'') at a time when he also made his keyboard players ([[Keith Jarrett]] and [[Chick Corea]]) play [[electric piano]]s with a wah-wah pedal. [[Napoleon Murphy Brock]] played a saxophone amplified through a wah-wah pedal in the [[Frank Zappa]] movie ''[[The Dub Room Special]]'', as well as on some of Zappa's albums. [[David Sanborn]] can be heard playing an alto saxophone modified by a wah-wah pedal on the [[David Bowie]] album ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]''. Noted saxophonist [[King Curtis]] was also known to use a wah-wah pedal. Dick Sims, the keyboard player with Eric Clapton in the late 1970s, used a Hammond organ in conjunction with a wah-wah pedal.\n\nThe effect is also extensively used with the electric violin. Notable examples are [[Jerry Goodman]] with the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and [[L. Shankar|Shankar]] with [[Frank Zappa]], all usually engaged in long wah-wah violin/guitar duels. [[Boyd Tinsley]] of the [[Dave Matthews Band]] is known to use a wah-wah pedal live.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Talk box]]\n*[[Equalization (audio)|EQ]]\n*[[Auto-wah]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further information==\n* ''Cry Baby: The Pedal that Rocks the World'' (documentary, 2011)\n\n{{Music production}}\n{{Music technology}}\n\n[[Category:Audio engineering]]\n[[Category:Effects units]]\n[[Category:Tone, EQ and filter]]\n", "name_user": "Bumm13", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOther instruments:formatting fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wah-wah_pedal"}
