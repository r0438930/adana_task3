In 1945, he enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]]. He graduated in 1949, and returned to Jamaica to serve as an editor and columnist for the newspaper ''Public Opinion''. At about the same time, he became involved in the [[trade union]] movement, becoming a [[negotiation|negotiator]] for the [[National Workers Union (Jamaica)|National Workers Union]]. In August 1953, he became a full-time official of that union.<ref name=\"Lentz\">{{cite book|last=Lentz|first=Harris M., III|title=''Heads of States and Governments''|year=1994|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=[[Jefferson, NC]]|isbn=0-89950-926-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/headsofstatesgov00lent/page/451 451]\u2013452|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/headsofstatesgov00lent}}</ref>\n\n==Entry into politics==\nWhen his father was elected premier of Jamaica in 1955, Manley resisted entering politics, not wanting to be seen as capitalizing on his family name. However, in 1962, he accepted an appointment to the Senate of the [[Parliament of Jamaica]]. He won election to the Jamaican House of Representatives for the Central Kingston constituency in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Manley|title=Michael Manley - prime minister of Jamaica|author=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter his father's retirement in 1969, Manley was elected leader of the [[People's National Party]], defeating [[Vivian Blake (politician)|Vivian Blake]].<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3tmxS6La_EC&pg=PA98|first=Anita M.|last=Waters|title=Race, Class, and Political Symbols: Rastafari and Reggae in Jamaican Politics|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1985|page=98|access-date=8 July 2012}}</ref> He then served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Jamaica)|leader of the Opposition]], until his party won in the general elections of 1972.<ref name=\"Lentz\"/>\n\n==Domestic reforms==\nIn the election of 1972, Manley defeated the unpopular incumbent Prime Minister, [[Hugh Shearer]], as his People's National Party swept to a landslide victory with 37 of 53 seats.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHe instituted a series of socio-economic reforms that produced mixed results. Although he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful [[trade union]] background helped him to maintain a close relationship with the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/trade-unionist/|title=Trade Unionist|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear [[jacket]]s and [[Necktie|ties]] to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the [[Kariba suit]], a type of formal bush jacket suit with trousers and worn without a shirt and tie.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nUnder Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Michael-Manley---the-visionary-who-will-never-be|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas.<ref>Ewart Walters, ''We Come From Jamaica''  (Ottawa: Boyd McRubie, 2014), p. 198</ref> The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/>\n\nLand reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilizers, and access to credit.<ref>Walters, p. 198</ref> An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration or purchased by large [[bauxite]] companies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Insight Guide: Jamaica'', Insight Guides, APA Publications, 2009.</ref> Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The [[Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights. The National Housing Trust was established, providing \"the means for most employed people to own their own homes,\" and greatly stimulated housing construction, with more than 40,000 houses built between 1974 and 1980.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSubsidised meals, transportation and uniforms for schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds were introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> together with free education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Chuck Stewart, ''The Greenwood Encyclopaedia of LGBT Issues Worldwide'', Volume 1.</ref> Special employment programmes were also launched,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kari Levitt, ''Reclaiming Development: independent thought and Caribbean community''.</ref> together with programmes designed to combat illiteracy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Increases in pensions and poor relief were carried out,<ref name=Kaufman>Michael Kaufman, ''Jamaica under Manley: dilemmas of socialism and democracy''.</ref> along with a reform of local government taxation, an increase in youth training,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> an expansion of day care centres.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> and an upgrading of hospitals.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Euclid A.

Various clinics were also set up to facilitate access to medical drugs. Spending on education was significantly increased, while the number of doctors and dentists in the country rose.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Project Lend Lease, an agricultural programme designed to provide rural labourers and smallholders with more land through tenancy, was introduced, together with a National Youth Service Programme for high school graduates to teach in schools, vocational training, and the literacy programme, comprehensive rent and price controls, protection for workers against unfair dismissal, subsidies (in 1973) on basic food items,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> and the automatic recognition of unions in the workplace.<ref name=Kaufman />\n\nManley was the first Jamaican prime minister to support [[Jamaican republicanism]] (the replacement of the [[Monarchy of Jamaica|constitutional monarchy]] with a republic). In 1975, his government established a commission into constitutional reform, which recommended that Jamaica become a republic. In July 1977, after a march to commemorate the [[Morant Bay Rebellion]], Manley announced that Jamaica would become a republic by 1981. This did not occur, however.<ref name=\"burke\">Michael Burke, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Queen--emperor-and-republican-status_58297 \"Queen, emperor and republican status\"], ''[[The Jamaica Observer]]'', 21 April 2016.

Supporters of his opponent [[Edward Seaga]] and the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and Manley's [[People's National Party]] (PNP) engaged in a bloody struggle which began before the 1976 election and ended when Seaga was installed as Prime Minister in 1980. While the violent political culture was not invented by Seaga or Manley, and had its roots in conflicts between the parties from as early as the beginning of the [[two-party system]] in the 1940s, political violence reached unprecedented levels in the 1970s. Indeed, the two elections accompanied by the greatest violence were those (1976 and 1980) in which Seaga was trying to unseat Manley.<ref>Walters, pp. 200-5.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10173302|title=Jamaica violence 'linked to US drug market'|first=Jon|last=Silverman|date=27 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn response to a wave of killings in 1974, Manley oversaw the passage of the [[Gun Court]] Act and the Suppression of Crime Act, giving the police and the army new powers to seal off and disarm high-violence neighborhoods. The Gun Court imposed a mandatory sentence of indefinite imprisonment with hard labour for all firearms offences, and ordinarily tried cases ''[[in camera]]'', without a jury.  Manley declared that \"There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.\"<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|title=Stalag in Kingston|work=[[Time Magazine]]|date=23 September 1974|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908746,00.html|access-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nViolence flared in January 1976 in anticipation of elections. A [[state of emergency]] was declared by Manley's party the PNP in June and 500 people, including some prominent members of the JLP, were accused of trying to overthrow the government and were detained, without charges, in the [[South Camp Adult Correctional Centre|South Camp Prison]] at the [[Up-Park Camp]] military headquarters.<ref name=\"jg\">''The Daily Gleaner'', Monday, 6 July 1986, p. 14.</ref> Elections were held on 15 December that year, while the state of emergency was still in effect. The PNP was returned to office. The state of emergency continued into the next year. Extraordinary powers granted the police by the Suppression of Crime Act of 1974 continued to the end of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Can-we-really-entrust-the-JCF-with-the-anti-gang-legislation-_16149216|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nViolence continued to blight political life in the 1970s. Gangs armed by both parties fought for control of urban constituencies. In the election year of 1980 over 800 Jamaicans were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-bloody-general-election-that-changed-Jamaica|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Jamaicans were particularly shocked by the violence at that time.\n\nIn the 1980 elections, Seaga's JLP won and he became Prime Minister.\n\n==Opposition==\nAs [[Official opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] Manley became an outspoken critic of the new conservative administration. He strongly opposed intervention in Grenada after Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] was overthrown and executed. Immediately after committing Jamaican troops to [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]] in 1983, Seaga called a snap election \u2013 two years early \u2013 on the pretext that Dr Paul Robertson, General Secretary of the PNP, had called for his resignation. Manley, who may have been taken by surprise by the maneuver, led his party in a boycott of the elections, and so the Jamaica Labour Party won all seats in parliament against only marginal opposition in six of the sixty electoral constituencies.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nManley was largely opposed by the United States government for conducting close relations with Fidel Castro and Cuba during the Cold War. Manley allowed Cuban technicians to work on Jamaican soil for projects. In 1977, Manley visited President Jimmy Carter at the White House to remedy the situation. Details of the meeting, however, were never disclosed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nDuring his period of opposition in the 1980s, Manley, a compelling speaker,{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} travelled extensively, speaking to audiences around the world. He taught a graduate seminar and gave a series of public lectures at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1986, Manley travelled to Britain and visited [[Birmingham]]. He attended a number of venues including the Afro Caribbean Resource Centre in [[Winson Green]] and [[Digbeth Civic Hall]]. The mainly black audiences turned out ''en masse'' to hear Manley speak.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, Seaga's failure to deliver on his promises to the US and foreign investors, as well as complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake [[Hurricane Gilbert]]'s devastation in 1988, also contributed to his defeat by the popular Manley in the [[1989 Jamaican general election|1989 elections]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Re-election==\nBy 1989, some right-wing critics had begun to assert that Manley had softened his [[socialist]] rhetoric, explicitly advocating a role for [[private enterprise]].<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he also supposedly ceased his support for a variety of international causes. In the election of that year he campaigned on what appeared to be a more moderate platform.{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} Seaga's administration had fallen out of favour \u2013 both with the electorate and the US \u2013 and the PNP was elected. He was sworn in as a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nManley's second term focused on liberalizing Jamaica's economy, with the pursuit of a neoliberal programme that stood in marked contrast to the more social democratic economic policies pursued by Manley's first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of austerity and structural adjustment. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nThe government also announced a 50% increase in the amount of nutritional assistance for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children). A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nIn 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott|last=Chrysalis|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> His former Deputy Prime Minister, [[Percival Patterson]], assumed both offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/|title=The Rt.

In 1945, he enrolled at the [[London School of Economics]]. He graduated in 1949, and returned to Jamaica to serve as an editor and columnist for the newspaper ''Public Opinion''. At about the same time, he became involved in the [[trade union]] movement, becoming a [[negotiation|negotiator]] for the [[National Workers Union (Jamaica)|National Workers Union]]. In August 1953, he became a full-time official of that union.<ref name=\"Lentz\">{{cite book|last=Lentz|first=Harris M., III|title=''Heads of States and Governments''|year=1994|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=[[Jefferson, NC]]|isbn=0-89950-926-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/headsofstatesgov00lent/page/451 451]\u2013452|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/headsofstatesgov00lent}}</ref>\n\n==Entry into politics==\nWhen his father was elected premier of Jamaica in 1955, Manley resisted entering politics, not wanting to be seen as capitalizing on his family name. However, in 1962, he accepted an appointment to the Senate of the [[Parliament of Jamaica]]. He won election to the Jamaican House of Representatives for the Central Kingston constituency in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Manley|title=Michael Manley - prime minister of Jamaica|author=|date=|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter his father's retirement in 1969, Manley was elected leader of the [[People's National Party]], defeating [[Vivian Blake (politician)|Vivian Blake]].<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3tmxS6La_EC&pg=PA98|first=Anita M.|last=Waters|title=Race, Class, and Political Symbols: Rastafari and Reggae in Jamaican Politics|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=1985|page=98|access-date=8 July 2012}}</ref> He then served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Jamaica)|leader of the Opposition]], until his party won in the general elections of 1972.<ref name=\"Lentz\"/>\n\n==Domestic reforms==\nIn the election of 1972, Manley defeated the unpopular incumbent Prime Minister, [[Hugh Shearer]], as his People's National Party swept to a landslide victory with 37 of 53 seats.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nHe instituted a series of socio-economic reforms that produced mixed results. Although he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful [[trade union]] background helped him to maintain a close relationship with the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/trade-unionist/|title=Trade Unionist|first=Peter Scott Chrysalis|last=Communications|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear [[jacket]]s and [[Necktie|ties]] to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the [[Kariba suit]], a type of formal bush jacket suit with trousers and worn without a shirt and tie.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nUnder Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Michael-Manley---the-visionary-who-will-never-be|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas.<ref>Ewart Walters, ''We Come From Jamaica''  (Ottawa: Boyd McRubie, 2014), p. 198</ref> The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/>\n\nLand reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilizers, and access to credit.<ref>Walters, p. 198</ref> An estimated 14 percent of idle land was redistributed through this program, much of which had been abandoned during the post-war urban migration or purchased by large [[bauxite]] companies.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''Insight Guide: Jamaica'', Insight Guides, APA Publications, 2009.</ref> Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The [[Masters and Servants Act]] was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights. The National Housing Trust was established, providing \"the means for most employed people to own their own homes,\" and greatly stimulated housing construction, with more than 40,000 houses built between 1974 and 1980.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSubsidised meals, transportation and uniforms for schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds were introduced,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> together with free education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Chuck Stewart, ''The Greenwood Encyclopaedia of LGBT Issues Worldwide'', Volume 1.</ref> Special employment programmes were also launched,<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Kari Levitt, ''Reclaiming Development: independent thought and Caribbean community''.</ref> together with programmes designed to combat illiteracy.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Increases in pensions and poor relief were carried out,<ref name=Kaufman>Michael Kaufman, ''Jamaica under Manley: dilemmas of socialism and democracy''.</ref> along with a reform of local government taxation, an increase in youth training,<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> an expansion of day care centres.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> and an upgrading of hospitals.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\">Euclid A.

Levi, ''Michael Manley: the making of a leader''.</ref> and the family court.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Free health care for all Jamaicans was introduced, while health clinics and a paramedical system in rural areas were established. Various clinics were also set up to facilitate access to medical drugs. Spending on education was significantly increased, while the number of doctors and dentists in the country rose.<ref name=\"ReferenceF\"/> Project Lend Lease, an agricultural programme designed to provide rural labourers and smallholders with more land through tenancy, was introduced, together with a National Youth Service Programme for high school graduates to teach in schools, vocational training, and the literacy programme, comprehensive rent and price controls, protection for workers against unfair dismissal, subsidies (in 1973) on basic food items,<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/> and the automatic recognition of unions in the workplace.<ref name=Kaufman />\n\nManley was the first Jamaican prime minister to support [[Jamaican republicanism]] (the replacement of the [[Monarchy of Jamaica|constitutional monarchy]] with a republic). In 1975, his government established a commission into constitutional reform, which recommended that Jamaica become a republic. In July 1977, after a march to commemorate the [[Morant Bay Rebellion]], Manley announced that Jamaica would become a republic by 1981. This did not occur, however.<ref name=\"burke\">Michael Burke, [http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Queen--emperor-and-republican-status_58297 \"Queen, emperor and republican status\"], ''[[The Jamaica Observer]]'', 21 April 2016.

Supporters of his opponent [[Edward Seaga]] and the [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP) and Manley's [[People's National Party]] (PNP) engaged in a bloody struggle which began before the 1976 election and ended when Seaga was installed as Prime Minister in 1980. While the violent political culture was not invented by Seaga or Manley, and had its roots in conflicts between the parties from as early as the beginning of the [[two-party system]] in the 1940s, political violence reached unprecedented levels in the 1970s. Indeed, the two elections accompanied by the greatest violence were those (1976 and 1980) in which Seaga was trying to unseat Manley.<ref>Walters, pp. 200-5.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10173302|title=Jamaica violence 'linked to US drug market'|first=Jon|last=Silverman|date=27 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 February 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn response to a wave of killings in 1974, Manley oversaw the passage of the [[Gun Court]] Act and the Suppression of Crime Act, giving the police and the army new powers to seal off and disarm high-violence neighborhoods. The Gun Court imposed a mandatory sentence of indefinite imprisonment with hard labour for all firearms offences, and ordinarily tried cases ''[[in camera]]'', without a jury.  Manley declared that \"There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.\"<ref name=\"time\">{{cite news|title=Stalag in Kingston|work=[[Time Magazine]]|date=23 September 1974|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908746,00.html|access-date=14 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nViolence flared in January 1976 in anticipation of elections. A [[state of emergency]] was declared by Manley's party the PNP in June and 500 people, including some prominent members of the JLP, were accused of trying to overthrow the government and were detained, without charges, in the [[South Camp Adult Correctional Centre|South Camp Prison]] at the [[Up-Park Camp]] military headquarters.<ref name=\"jg\">''The Daily Gleaner'', Monday, 6 July 1986, p. 14.</ref> Elections were held on 15 December that year, while the state of emergency was still in effect. The PNP was returned to office. The state of emergency continued into the next year. Extraordinary powers granted the police by the Suppression of Crime Act of 1974 continued to the end of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/columns/Can-we-really-entrust-the-JCF-with-the-anti-gang-legislation-_16149216|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nViolence continued to blight political life in the 1970s. Gangs armed by both parties fought for control of urban constituencies. In the election year of 1980 over 800 Jamaicans were killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/The-bloody-general-election-that-changed-Jamaica|title=Jamaica Observer Limited|author=|date=|website=Jamaica Observer|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> Jamaicans were particularly shocked by the violence at that time.\n\nIn the 1980 elections, Seaga's JLP won and he became Prime Minister.\n\n==Opposition==\nAs [[Official opposition|Leader of the Opposition]] Manley became an outspoken critic of the new conservative administration. He strongly opposed intervention in Grenada after Prime Minister [[Maurice Bishop]] was overthrown and executed. Immediately after committing Jamaican troops to [[Invasion of Grenada|Grenada]] in 1983, Seaga called a snap election \u2013 two years early \u2013 on the pretext that Dr Paul Robertson, General Secretary of the PNP, had called for his resignation. Manley, who may have been taken by surprise by the maneuver, led his party in a boycott of the elections, and so the Jamaica Labour Party won all seats in parliament against only marginal opposition in six of the sixty electoral constituencies.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nManley was largely opposed by the United States government for conducting close relations with Fidel Castro and Cuba during the Cold War. Manley allowed Cuban technicians to work on Jamaican soil for projects. In 1977, Manley visited President Jimmy Carter at the White House to remedy the situation. Details of the meeting, however, were never disclosed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nDuring his period of opposition in the 1980s, Manley, a compelling speaker,{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} travelled extensively, speaking to audiences around the world. He taught a graduate seminar and gave a series of public lectures at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1986, Manley travelled to Britain and visited [[Birmingham]]. He attended a number of venues including the Afro Caribbean Resource Centre in [[Winson Green]] and [[Digbeth Civic Hall]]. The mainly black audiences turned out ''en masse'' to hear Manley speak.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, Seaga's failure to deliver on his promises to the US and foreign investors, as well as complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake [[Hurricane Gilbert]]'s devastation in 1988, also contributed to his defeat by the popular Manley in the [[1989 Jamaican general election|1989 elections]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Re-election==\nBy 1989, some right-wing critics had begun to assert that Manley had softened his [[socialist]] rhetoric, explicitly advocating a role for [[private enterprise]].<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/> After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he also supposedly ceased his support for a variety of international causes. In the election of that year he campaigned on what appeared to be a more moderate platform.{{Opinion|date=February 2019}} Seaga's administration had fallen out of favour \u2013 both with the electorate and the US \u2013 and the PNP was elected. He was sworn in as a Member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom]] in 1989.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nManley's second term focused on liberalizing Jamaica's economy, with the pursuit of a neoliberal programme that stood in marked contrast to the more social democratic economic policies pursued by Manley's first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of austerity and structural adjustment. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nThe government also announced a 50% increase in the amount of nutritional assistance for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children). A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.<ref name=\"ReferenceD\"/>\n\nIn 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader.<ref name=\"jamaicaobserver.com\"/><ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=http://michaelmanley.org/about/political-career/|title=Political Leader|first=Peter Scott|last=Chrysalis|date=|publisher=|access-date=11 February 2019}}</ref> His former Deputy Prime Minister, [[Percival Patterson]], assumed both offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nlj.gov.jm/biographies/rt-hon-percival-james-patterson-1935/|title=The Rt.

In 1946, he married Jacqueline Kamellard, but the marriage was dissolved in 1951. In 1955 he married Thelma Verity the adopted daughter of Sir Philip Sherlock OM and his wife Grace Verity ; in 1960, this marriage was also dissolved. In 1966, Manley married Barbara Lewars (died in 1968); in 1972, he married Beverley Anderson, but the marriage was dissolved in 1990.
