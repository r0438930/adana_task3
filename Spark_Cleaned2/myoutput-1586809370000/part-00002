Their purpose was \"To provide the people of the county and the surrounding area with the opportunity to participate in and enjoy live theatre.\" For the first seasons, the plays and musicals were presented in various venues around the Greencastle. For the seasons of 1981 and 1982, plays and musicals were presented on an outdoor stage with bleacher seating. By 1983, the funds had been raised to convert a larger structure, a barn built in 1918, into an intimate 220-seat theater. The Hazel Day Longden Barn Theatre had its grand opening on June 4, 1983. Past performers presented a program of scenes and songs that had been produced by the PCP in its early years. In 1993, extensive work was done on the physical plant. A fly area was added and a new workshop and costume loft were constructed. The following year, a moderate cooling system was added and posts in the auditorium were removed. In April 2000, aluminum siding was added to the barn. Most recently, the seating system was completely replaced and the theater now seats 198 people.\n\nThe Putnam County Playhouse is active from June through September each year. It presents two musicals and two plays during those sixteen weeks. Every other year, a children's workshop play is also produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com/about/history.html|title=Putnam County Playhouse - History of the Putnam County Playhouse|website=www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com}}</ref>\n\n==Covered Bridges==\n[[Image:Dunbar (Covered Bridge Greenfield).JPG|thumb|300 px|right|Dunbar Covered Bridge]]\n\nThe [[Dick Huffman Covered Bridge|Dick Huffman]] or '''Webster CB''' is the furthest south, just off [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]].

Their purpose was \"To provide the people of the county and the surrounding area with the opportunity to participate in and enjoy live theatre.\" For the first seasons, the plays and musicals were presented in various venues around the Greencastle. For the seasons of 1981 and 1982, plays and musicals were presented on an outdoor stage with bleacher seating. By 1983, the funds had been raised to convert a larger structure, a barn built in 1918, into an intimate 220-seat theater. The Hazel Day Longden Barn Theatre had its grand opening on June 4, 1983. Past performers presented a program of scenes and songs that had been produced by the PCP in its early years. In 1993, extensive work was done on the physical plant. A fly area was added and a new workshop and costume loft were constructed. The following year, a moderate cooling system was added and posts in the auditorium were removed. In April 2000, aluminum siding was added to the barn. Most recently, the seating system was completely replaced and the theater now seats 198 people.\n\nThe Putnam County Playhouse is active from June through September each year. It presents two musicals and two plays during those sixteen weeks. Every other year, a children's workshop play is also produced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com/about/history.html|title=Putnam County Playhouse - History of the Putnam County Playhouse|website=www.putnamcountyplayhouse.com}}</ref>\n\n==Covered Bridges==\n[[Image:Dunbar (Covered Bridge Greenfield).JPG|thumb|300 px|right|Dunbar Covered Bridge]]\n\nThe [[Dick Huffman Covered Bridge|Dick Huffman]] or '''Webster CB''' is the furthest south, just off [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]].
