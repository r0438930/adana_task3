Another possible mode of introduction is on anchors and chains, although this has not been proven.

Trailered boat traffic is the most likely vector for invasion into [[Western Cordillera (North America)|Western North America]]. This spread is preventable if boaters thoroughly clean and dry their boats and associated equipment before transporting them to new bodies of water. Since no North American predator or combination of predators has been shown to significantly reduce zebra mussel numbers, such spread would most likely result in permanent establishment of zebra mussels in many North American [[waterway]]s.\n\nA major decrease in the concentration of dissolved oxygen was observed in the Seneca River in central New York in the summer of 1993. This decrease was caused by extremely high concentrations of zebra mussels in the watershed. Additionally, the Seneca River had significantly less chlorophyll in the water, which is used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass, because of the presence of zebra mussels.<ref>Effler, Steven W., Carol M.

According to the Center for Invasive Species Research at the University of California, Riverside,<ref name=\"copper\"/> the cost of management of zebra mussel in the Great Lakes alone exceeds $500 million per year. A more conservative study estimated total economic costs of $267 million for electric-generation and water-treatment facilities in the entire United States from 1989 through 2004.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Economic impacts of zebra mussels on drinking water treatment and electric power generation facilities |date=2007-05-24 | pmid=17530329 | doi=10.1007/s00267-006-0296-5 |volume=40 |issue=1 |journal=Environ Manage |pages=105\u201312 | last1 = Connelly | first1 = NA | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = CR Jr | last3 = Knuth | first3 = BA | last4 = Brown | first4 = TL}}</ref>\n\n== Effects==\n[[File:Zebra mussel GLERL 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Zebra mussel-encrusted vector averaging current meter from Lake Michigan]]\n\nZebra mussels are [[filter feeder]]s. When in the water, they open their shells to admit [[detritus]].

They have also spread into streams and rivers throughout the U.S. In some areas they completely cover the [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], sometimes covering other freshwater mussels. They can grow so densely that they block pipelines, clogging water intakes of municipal water supplies and [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] companies. Zebra mussels do not attach to [[cupronickel]] alloys, which can be used to coat intake and discharge grates, navigational buoys, boats, and motors where the species tends to congregate.<ref name=\"copper\"/>\n\nZebra mussels are believed to be the source of deadly [[Botulism|avian botulism]] poisoning that has killed tens of thousands of birds in the Great Lakes since the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Tribune\"/> They are edible, but since they are so efficient at filtering water, they tend to accumulate pollutants and toxins.

There are a few protocols that boat-owners should follow prior to putting their boat into a new lake and after removing their boat from the lake in order to stop the spreading of the species. Boat owners should make sure to inspect their boat, trailer, and other recreational equipment that have been in contact with water, remove all mud, plants, or animals, drain all bilge water, live wells, bait buckets, and all other water from their boat, engine and equipment, wash all parts of their boat, paddles, and other equipment that have been in contact with water, and dry their boats and trailers in the sun for five days before launching into another body of water. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mass.gov/service-details/help-stop-the-spread-of-zebra-mussels}}</ref> This is important because adult zebra mussels are able to close their shells and may survive out of water for several days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stopaquatichitchhikers.org/hitchhikers/mollusks-zebra-mussel/}}</ref> When washing their boat, boat owners should be sure to wash with warm, soapy water as well. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-can-spread-zebra-mussels-be-prevented?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products}}</ref> If these precautions are followed, the spread of the species will slow down, and more lakes will be saved from contamination.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Mussel]], mostly about true mussels\n* [[Quagga mussel]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist\n|colwidth=30em\n|refs=\n<ref name=\"copper\">\n{{cite web\n |title       = Zebra Mussels Overwhelm U.S. Waterways in the Great Lakes Region and Beyond \u2013 Copper Screens and Coatings Provide a Solution to this $500 million Problem\n |publisher   = Copper Development Association\n |date        = 2009-07-30\n |url         = http://www.copper.org/about/pressreleases/2009/pr2009_July_30.html\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101215202436/http://copper.org/about/pressreleases/2009/pr2009_July_30.html\n |archivedate = 2010-12-15\n |access-date = 2011-03-13\n |url-status    = live\n}}\n</ref><ref name=Tribune>{{cite news\n |last        = Janega\n |first       = James\n |title       = Botulism takes fatal toll on thousands of Great Lakes birds\n |newspaper   = [[Chicago Tribune]]\n |date        = 2008-01-15\n |url         = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-01-15/news/0801150030_1_lake-michigan-zebra-mussels-dead-birds\n |accessdate  = 2011-04-05\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120928134029/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-01-15/news/0801150030_1_lake-michigan-zebra-mussels-dead-birds\n |archivedate = 2012-09-28\n |url-status    = live\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite journal\n | url =\n | last1 = Minchin | first1 = D\n | year = 2003\n | title = The Zebra Mussel ''Dreissena polymopha'' (Pallas) extends its range westwards in Ireland\n | journal = [[Bulletin of the Irish Biogeographical Society]] |issn=0332-1185\n | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 176\u2013182 }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons|Dreissena polymorpha}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100527124727/http://www.nationalatlas.gov/articles/biology/a_zm.html Zebra Mussel on National Atlas]\n* [https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/factsheet.aspx?speciesid=5 Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) \u2013 FactSheet]\n* [https://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/profile/zebra-mussel Species Profile - Zebra Mussel (''Dreissena polymorpha'')], National Invasive Species Information Center, [[United States National Agricultural Library]].
