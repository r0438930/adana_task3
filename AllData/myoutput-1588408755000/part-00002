In Tray It, teams had to go to the [[dry dock]] where the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] was built to prepare and serve [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|the ship's last]] five-course dinner to a group of first-class passengers. Using the menu provided, as well as a seating chart, teams had to choose the proper dishes for each course from a table full of unmarked plates and serve them to the passengers in the dining room at the drydock. When the waiter was satisfied that each passenger received the correct order for each course, the team was allowed to move on to the next course. Once all five courses were served correctly, a Captain [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward Smith]] impersonator would give teams their next clue. In Spray It, teams had to go to a [[skate park]] located in a warehouse, where they had to finish half of a [[Art graffiti|graffiti painting]] using a photograph as reference to receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the All-Route Shipping Warehouse, teams had to choose a Ford Fiesta and drive themselves to [[Peatlands Park]] to find their next clue.\n*After the Roadblock, teams had to find \"The Thing With a Ring\", leaving them to figure out it referred to the ''[[Beacon of Hope (sculpture)|Beacon of Hope]]'' sculpture in [[Thanksgiving Square (Belfast)|Thanksgiving Square]].\n\n;Additional note\n*Teams began the penultimate leg at Johnston Terrace.\n\n===Leg 12 (United Kingdom \u2192 United States)===\n<!-- Do not change the header from \"United Kingdom \u2192 United States\" to any form that lists Northern Ireland or England.

One team member had to take the briefcase and find one of fifty \"spies\" around the Tidal Basin who would respond to their given code phrase with another supplied code phrase (Max: \"Where can I get a good [[half-smoke]] with chili?\" / \"I've heard there's a [[Ben's Chili Bowl|great place]] on [[U Street]].\"; Bates: \"I did not dress warm enough for this weather.\" / \"Perhaps you would like to borrow my gloves.\"; Beth: \"The [[cherry blossom]]s are beautiful here in April.\" / \"I'll have to bring my mother next spring.\"). The team member then swapped briefcases with the spy, and the spy told them that the combination code to open their new briefcase was their final placement in New Zealand (Leg 3), Indonesia (Leg 4), and Vietnam (Leg 5). After they unlocked the briefcase, they could retrieve their next clue from inside.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the Euston Tap, teams had to order a [[pint]] of beer for each racer before they were given their next clue.\n*Once in [[Washington, D.C.]], teams had to find the location where [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] gave his famous \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, leaving them to figure out it was the on the steps of the [[Lincoln Memorial]]. Teams would find the man standing on the spot on the steps where the speech was delivered with their next clue.\n*At 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, teams were escorted by a \"[[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent\" and were told they were to have their photograph taken with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. In reality, they were taken to a souvenir photography studio where they posed for a photograph in which their face was superimposed over a photograph of someone else meeting President Obama. The next clue was located on the back of the photograph.\n*At the Tidal Basin, teams had to search for a marked car near the paddle boat docks. After knocking on the rear passenger side window three times, the occupant would give them a briefcase along with their next clue.\n*After the Roadblock, teams were instructed to travel to \"The Home of the [[Washington Nationals|Nats]]\", leaving teams to figure out that their next destination was [[Nationals Park]]. There, one team member had to ride a [[zip line]] across the stadium and toss a baseball, while their partner, dressed as a baseball mascot, attempted to catch it. Once they successfully caught the ball, they could read it to see it had \"[[Hains Point]]\" written on it, which was their next destination.<ref group=Note>Teams' clue stated that once the team member on the ground caught the ball, they had to toss the ball to a pitcher. The pitcher would pitch the ball to a batter, who would hit it into the outfield. The team member on the ground then had to retrieve the ball before reuniting with their partner. This aspect of the task went unaired.</ref>\n*At Hains Point, teams had to enter a giant [[ball pit]] to find globes marked with the various countries they had visited during the ''Race''. Only one team member was allowed in the pit at one time, and they have to pass the globes to their partner, who would place the globes into the corresponding podiums. Once all ten globes were placed onto the correct podiums, a giant globe would open revealing teams' final clue.\n*The final clue told teams to travel to \"The Home of the First President\". Teams were left to figure out that the \"First President\" was referring to [[George Washington]] and the location of the Finish Line was at his home: [[Mount Vernon]].\n\n==Ratings==\nNo episode aired on April 7, 2013, due to CBS and CTV's broadcasts of the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]].\n\n===U.S. Nielsen ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| #\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Airdate\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Episode\n!

In Pick a Pearl, teams traveled to a point a half-mile offshore in the open water, where they had to dive and untie lines of [[pearl oyster]]s. They had to shuck them open to find two red [[pearl]]s and then swim to an oyster farmer to trade the red pearls for their next clue. In Take a Trunk, teams dove underwater, wearing special diving helmets, to look for a series of treasure trunks. They then had to take a trunk over to a submerged umbrella and unpack its contents, setting up an underwater picnic table to the waiter's approval to receive their next clue.\n\nFor the Roadblock, one team member participated in a traditional Polynesian test of strength by walking on a pair of sparring [[stilts]] while kicking a [[coconut]] across a {{convert|35|yd|m|adj=on}} stretch of beach.

In Rev It Up, both team members had to drive a modified vintage car through a set of cones in under a combined 83-second time limit of the race car driver \"Flash\", to receive their next clue. In Reel It In, each team member had to use a rod and reel to catch one fish that was at least {{convert|12|in|cm}} long  champion fisherman Dirk. If either team members reel one, Dirk would give the teams their next clue.\n\nThe Roadblock required one team member to run a muddy obstacle course known as a \"[[Shemozzle (race)|Shemozzle]]\". The racer had to dress in [[gum boot]]s, [[Stubbies (brand)|stubbies]] shorts, and a [[Hessian (cloth)|burlap sack]]. Then, along with a shepherd and farm dog, they had to run through the course, where they were covered in [[molasses]] and [[feather]]s, climbed over hay bales, then finally rode an [[inner tube]] down a slide into a manure pond, all while collecting [[chicken egg]]s along the way which they had to put in a basket at the end of the course. Once they had 12 unbroken eggs in their basket, a shepherd would give them their next clue,\n\n;Additional task\n*After arriving in [[Christchurch]], teams picked up a [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus]] and drove to the [[Rakaia River]] [[Rakaia Gorge|Gorge]].
