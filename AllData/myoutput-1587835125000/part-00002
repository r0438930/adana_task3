Brooks asked Bettis whether he wanted to move to fullback for the upcoming 1996 season or preferred to be traded. Bettis stated he thought he could still help an NFL team with his running.\n\nOn April 20, 1996, Bettis was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers with a third-round pick in the [[1996 NFL Draft]], in exchange for the Steelers' second-round pick and their fourth-round pick in the [[1997 NFL Draft]].<ref>Clarochi, Paul (April 21, 1996), \"Steelers Bet on Bettis to Fill RB Void\".[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wIkyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TLYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1859,4370381&dq=bettis+traded&hl=en Beaver County Times] Retrieved September 12, 2010.</ref> The Rams gave Bettis the option of which team he wanted to be traded to, and he chose the Steelers over their [[AFC North|AFC Central]] [[Steelers-Titans rivalry|rival]] [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] (who would draft [[Eddie George]] that year instead) due to the Steelers more storied history.<ref>https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=i8LfQvT0b-0</ref>\n\nIn exchange for Bettis, the Rams drafted [[Ernie Conwell]] (second round of 1996 draft) and also received the Steelers fourth-round pick in 1997.

The Steelers drafted [[Steve Conley]] (third round of 1996 draft) with the draft selection they acquired from the Bettis trade with the Rams. Conley was traded to the Colts two seasons later for a fifth-round pick.\n\n===Pittsburgh Steelers===\nThe Steelers were in need of a running back because [[Bam Morris]], their power running back for the 1994 and 1995 seasons, was arrested in March 1996 for marijuana possession.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-03-27/sports/9603270102_1_drug-charges-assault-charge-morris.|title=Steelers' Morris Indicted On Drug Charges|date=March 27, 1996|website=ChicagoTribune.com|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> The Steelers traded for Bettis on the day of the [[1996 NFL Draft]]. Morris eventually pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was cut by the team in June 1996, leaving Bettis as the featured back. In his first season in Pittsburgh, Bettis rushed for a then career-high 1,431 yards and 11 touchdowns and was named to his second 1st team [[1996 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] team. He also won the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]], NFL Alumni Running Back of the Year, was voted Steelers' team MVP and finished the 1996 season as the leader in [[Football Outsiders]] rushing [[Football Outsiders#DYAR|DYAR]] [[advanced metrics|metric]].<ref>[http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/rb1996] Footballoutsiders.com.

Included in that run were three campaigns of over 1,300 yards. In 1997, Bettis rushed for a career-best 1,665 yards in the team's first 15 games. However, because the team had already wrapped up its playoff position, he was rested for the regular-season finale and finished 26 yards short of the team's single-season record. Bettis does hold the Steelers' franchise record for rushing yards in a single-season when including postseason play.<ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/pgl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=single&year_min=1950&year_max=2017&season_start=1&season_end=-1&pos=0&game_type=E&team_id=pit&career_game_num_min=1&career_game_num_max=400&game_num_min=0&game_num_max=99&week_num_min=0&week_num_max=99&c5val=1.0&order_by=rush_yds] Pro-Football-Reference.com.</ref> Bettis was a second-team All-Pro choice in 1997 and set a then NFL record with two overtime touchdowns in the same season.\n\nBettis was leading the league with 1,072 rushing yards in 2001 when he suffered a serious hip and groin injury that sidelined him for the remainder of the regular season. Injuries would also cost him significant parts of the 2002 season and he then began the 2003 season as a backup to [[Amos Zereou\u00e9]]. Despite regaining his starting role midway through the 2003 season, Bettis again found himself a backup to start the 2004 season, this time to free-agent acquisition [[Duce Staley]]. But when an injury took Staley out of action midway through the year, Bettis stepped in and gained 100-plus yards in six of the next eight games, and in seven consecutive starts. The late season effort led to the sixth Pro-Bowl berth of his career.\n\nBettis spent the 2005 season as a short-yardage running back, but managed two notable games along the way: First, a 101-yard, two touchdown effort in a pivotal week 14 win over Chicago (his second-to-last game in Pittsburgh).  This game included a play in which he ran over Bears' safety [[Mike Green (defensive back)|Mike Green]] and the NFL's [[Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year]] linebacker [[Brian Urlacher]] on the goal line during a heavy snow squall. Secondly, he scored three touchdowns in a win over Detroit to clinch a playoff berth on the last day of the season, which was his last game in Pittsburgh. He finished the season and his career as the NFL's 5th leading all-time [[Rush (American football)|rusher]].\n\nBettis was also at the center of one of the most controversial calls in NFL history. During a Thanksgiving Day game with the [[Detroit Lions]] on November 26, 1998, Bettis was sent out as the Steelers representative for the overtime coin toss. Bettis appeared to call \"tails\" while the coin was in the air but referee [[Phil Luckett]] declared that Bettis called \"heads\" and awarded possession to Detroit, who would go on to win the game before Pittsburgh had the chance to have possession. After reviewing the incident, the NFL changed the rule and declared that the call of \"heads\" or \"tails\" would be made before the coin was tossed rather than during the coin toss and that at least two officials would be present during the coin toss. The readers of ESPN voted the incident as No. 8 on its list of the ten worst sports officiating calls of all time, even though later sound enhancements of the audio showed that Bettis said \"hea-tails\" and Bettis admitted starting to call \"heads\" before changing it to tails.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/worstcalls.html The Readers' List:Worst calls in history]. ESPN. August 27, 2001. Retrieved on 2013-07-23.</ref>  Immediately after the incident, however, Bettis commented \"I did not say 'heads-tails.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/27/sports/pro-football-heads-tails-referee-chooses-then-steelers-lose.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; 'Heads'?

Referee Chooses, Then Steelers Lose|date=November 27, 1998|publisher=|access-date=December 25, 2017|work=New York Times|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Bettis later put together one of the most bizarre single-game statistics in NFL history. In the 2004 season opener, he carried the ball five times for a total of only one yard, a 0.2 yards per carry average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=240912023.|title=NFL Football Scores - NFL Scoreboard - ESPN|date=September 12, 2004|website=ESPN.com|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> However, he scored 18 points on those carries with three touchdowns.\n\nDuring that 2004 season, Bettis and [[New York Jets]] running back [[Curtis Martin]] dueled for position on the all-time rushing yards leaderboard. Bettis entered the season in 6th place all-time and 684 yards ahead of Martin in 9th place. Because Bettis was the backup in Pittsburgh for the start of the season, Martin was able to pass Bettis in week 13 until the Steelers played their game later in the day and Bettis retook the lead by 6 yards. When the Jets traveled to Martin's home town of Pittsburgh to play the Steelers the following week, both backs would cross the 13,000-yard mark, making this the first time two players crossed the 13,000 yard mark (or other similarly high yardage milestones) in the same game. Their combined career totals were also one of the biggest combined career totals for opposing running backs in history. At the end of the game, Martin would lead Bettis by 9 yards. Two weeks later in week 16, Bettis would again pass Martin and establish himself with a lead of 81 yards. In doing so, Bettis passed [[Eric Dickerson]] for 4th place on the all-time list. Bettis sat out the final week of the season, and when Martin rushed for 153 yards that week he passed Dickerson and Bettis for the final time.\n\nAfter the Steelers' defeat in the [[NFL playoffs, 2004\u201305|2004 AFC Championship Game]] on January 23, 2005, Bettis announced that he was considering retirement, but would not make a final decision for several months to prevent the sting of the defeat from clouding his judgment. Later, Bettis agreed to stay with the Steelers for another season. He stated he would love to play in the [[Super Bowl]] in 2006 since it was to be played in his hometown of Detroit. His wish came true as the Steelers played in, and won, [[Super Bowl XL]] (40) against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], 21\u201310, on February 5, 2006.\n\nBettis finished his 13 NFL seasons as the NFL's 5th all-time leading rusher with 13,662 yards and 91 touchdowns. He also caught 200 passes for 1,449 yards and 3 touchdowns and threw 3 career touchdown passes. He was named to the [[Pro Bowl]] in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, and 2004. Bettis won the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] award in 1996, and in 2002 he was the recipient of the [[Walter Payton Man of the Year Award]]. While Bettis finished with 1,542 more yards than [[Franco Harris]] on the NFL's all-time rushing list, Harris remains the Steelers all-time leading rusher because 3,091 of those yards came while Bettis was with the Rams.\n\nRadio color commentator [[Myron Cope]] popularized the nickname \"'''The Bus'''\" after hearing a brother of a fellow Notre Dame alumni call Jerome \"Bussy\" in Green Bay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The nickname comes from his ability to carry multiple defenders on his back, like a bus ride, during his carries. It was during the Green Bay broadcast that Cope started using the nickname \"The Bus.\" Jerome credits the Notre Dame school newspaper with first using the nickname.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/steelers/20001221steele2.asp.|title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=December 21, 2000|website=Post-Gazette.com|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother lesser known nickname for Bettis was \"'''The Closer'''.\" He was given this nickname by former Steeler head coach [[Bill Cowher]] because whenever Pittsburgh was ahead and was ready to close out the game, Cowher would send in Bettis to run out the clock. He did this because of Bettis's very low fumbling percentage and the fact that he was difficult to tackle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n====Super Bowl XL====\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2012}}\nShortly after the Steelers lost the 2004\u20132005 AFC Championship game to the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] champion [[New England Patriots]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]] approached Bettis. He promised Bettis that if he came back for one last season, he would get him to the Super Bowl. Apparently, it was this promise that got Jerome Bettis to play one last season.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 12 NFL seasons, Bettis had reached the playoffs five times, but had never been in the Super Bowl.\n\nIn week 17 of the 2005 NFL season, Bettis rushed for 41 yards and three touchdowns against the [[Detroit Lions]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=260101023]. espn.go.com (January 1, 2006). Retrieved on August 20, 2015.</ref> The Steelers won, 35\u201321, and thanks to Bettis's three touchdowns, they clinched a playoff berth. When [[Bill Cowher]] pulled Bettis from the game late in the fourth quarter, he was given a standing ovation from the Steeler fans. This game would be the last home game (not including the neutral-site [[Super Bowl]]) for Jerome Bettis.\n\nBettis contributed 52 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers' wildcard playoff victory over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] on January 8. After their wildcard win, Ben Roethlisberger revealed to the team that he promised to Bettis that he would get him to the Super Bowl, in order to get him to come back for the 2005 season.\n\nOn January 15, 2006, Bettis was the center of one of football's most memorable{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} endings in a divisional playoff game against the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. While the Steelers offensive attack was mostly pass driven during the game, Bettis ran well, taking in 46 yards on 17 rushes, including one touchdown. When the Steelers took possession of the ball on the Indianapolis 2-yard line with 1:20 remaining in the game, leading 21-18, the outcome seemed almost certain. The first play from scrimmage went to the surehanded Bettis, who had not fumbled once the entire year. As Bettis ran towards the end zone, Colts linebacker [[Gary Brackett]] popped the ball out of Jerome's hands, where, in seemingly another occurrence of the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' \"cover jinx,\" it was picked up by cornerback [[Nick Harper (American football)|Nick Harper]], who was [[Pittsburgh sports lore#The Tackle|stopped from returning the fumble all the way for a touchdown]] by Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]]. Ultimately, however, Bettis's mistake did not result in a Steelers loss, as Colts kicker [[Mike Vanderjagt]] missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal, ending the game with a 21-18 Steelers victory.\n\nThe next week, the Steelers were set to face off against the [[Denver Broncos]] in the AFC Championship game. Bettis delivered a rousing speech to his teammates the day before the game, asking them to \"Just get me to Detroit\", his hometown, where [[Super Bowl XL]] was to be played.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Bettis's wish was granted, as he and the Steelers advanced to [[Super Bowl XL]] with a 34\u201317 win over the Broncos, led by [[Ben Roethlisberger]]'s arm and Bettis's 39 yards on 15 carries, including a touchdown. After the game was over, Bettis found his parents in the crowd and mouthed the words \"We're going home\" to them.\n\n===NFL statistics===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games \n! colspan=\"6\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"2\"| Fumbles\n|- \n!

Injuries would also cost him significant parts of the 2002 season and he then began the 2003 season as a backup to [[Amos Zereou\u00e9]]. Despite regaining his starting role midway through the 2003 season, Bettis again found himself a backup to start the 2004 season, this time to free-agent acquisition [[Duce Staley]]. But when an injury took Staley out of action midway through the year, Bettis stepped in and gained 100-plus yards in six of the next eight games, and in seven consecutive starts. The late season effort led to the sixth Pro-Bowl berth of his career.\n\nBettis spent the 2005 season as a short-yardage running back, but managed two notable games along the way: First, a 101-yard, two touchdown effort in a pivotal week 14 win over Chicago (his second-to-last game in Pittsburgh).  This game included a play in which he ran over Bears' safety [[Mike Green (defensive back)|Mike Green]] and the NFL's [[Associated Press NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|Defensive Player of the Year]] linebacker [[Brian Urlacher]] on the goal line during a heavy snow squall. Secondly, he scored three touchdowns in a win over Detroit to clinch a playoff berth on the last day of the season, which was his last game in Pittsburgh. He finished the season and his career as the NFL's 5th leading all-time [[Rush (American football)|rusher]].\n\nBettis was also at the center of one of the most controversial calls in NFL history. During a Thanksgiving Day game with the [[Detroit Lions]] on November 26, 1998, Bettis was sent out as the Steelers representative for the overtime coin toss. Bettis appeared to call \"tails\" while the coin was in the air but referee [[Phil Luckett]] declared that Bettis called \"heads\" and awarded possession to Detroit, who would go on to win the game before Pittsburgh had the chance to have possession. After reviewing the incident, the NFL changed the rule and declared that the call of \"heads\" or \"tails\" would be made before the coin was tossed rather than during the coin toss and that at least two officials would be present during the coin toss. The readers of ESPN voted the incident as No. 8 on its list of the ten worst sports officiating calls of all time, even though later sound enhancements of the audio showed that Bettis said \"hea-tails\" and Bettis admitted starting to call \"heads\" before changing it to tails.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/readers/worstcalls.html The Readers' List:Worst calls in history].

Retrieved on 2013-07-23.</ref>  Immediately after the incident, however, Bettis commented \"I did not say 'heads-tails.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/27/sports/pro-football-heads-tails-referee-chooses-then-steelers-lose.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; 'Heads'?

Referee Chooses, Then Steelers Lose|date=November 27, 1998|publisher=|access-date=December 25, 2017|work=New York Times|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Bettis later put together one of the most bizarre single-game statistics in NFL history. In the 2004 season opener, he carried the ball five times for a total of only one yard, a 0.2 yards per carry average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/boxscore?gameId=240912023.|title=NFL Football Scores - NFL Scoreboard - ESPN|date=September 12, 2004|website=ESPN.com|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref> However, he scored 18 points on those carries with three touchdowns.\n\nDuring that 2004 season, Bettis and [[New York Jets]] running back [[Curtis Martin]] dueled for position on the all-time rushing yards leaderboard. Bettis entered the season in 6th place all-time and 684 yards ahead of Martin in 9th place. Because Bettis was the backup in Pittsburgh for the start of the season, Martin was able to pass Bettis in week 13 until the Steelers played their game later in the day and Bettis retook the lead by 6 yards. When the Jets traveled to Martin's home town of Pittsburgh to play the Steelers the following week, both backs would cross the 13,000-yard mark, making this the first time two players crossed the 13,000 yard mark (or other similarly high yardage milestones) in the same game. Their combined career totals were also one of the biggest combined career totals for opposing running backs in history. At the end of the game, Martin would lead Bettis by 9 yards. Two weeks later in week 16, Bettis would again pass Martin and establish himself with a lead of 81 yards. In doing so, Bettis passed [[Eric Dickerson]] for 4th place on the all-time list. Bettis sat out the final week of the season, and when Martin rushed for 153 yards that week he passed Dickerson and Bettis for the final time.\n\nAfter the Steelers' defeat in the [[NFL playoffs, 2004\u201305|2004 AFC Championship Game]] on January 23, 2005, Bettis announced that he was considering retirement, but would not make a final decision for several months to prevent the sting of the defeat from clouding his judgment. Later, Bettis agreed to stay with the Steelers for another season. He stated he would love to play in the [[Super Bowl]] in 2006 since it was to be played in his hometown of Detroit. His wish came true as the Steelers played in, and won, [[Super Bowl XL]] (40) against the [[Seattle Seahawks]], 21\u201310, on February 5, 2006.\n\nBettis finished his 13 NFL seasons as the NFL's 5th all-time leading rusher with 13,662 yards and 91 touchdowns. He also caught 200 passes for 1,449 yards and 3 touchdowns and threw 3 career touchdown passes. He was named to the [[Pro Bowl]] in 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, and 2004. Bettis won the [[NFL Comeback Player of the Year]] award in 1996, and in 2002 he was the recipient of the [[Walter Payton Man of the Year Award]]. While Bettis finished with 1,542 more yards than [[Franco Harris]] on the NFL's all-time rushing list, Harris remains the Steelers all-time leading rusher because 3,091 of those yards came while Bettis was with the Rams.\n\nRadio color commentator [[Myron Cope]] popularized the nickname \"'''The Bus'''\" after hearing a brother of a fellow Notre Dame alumni call Jerome \"Bussy\" in Green Bay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The nickname comes from his ability to carry multiple defenders on his back, like a bus ride, during his carries. It was during the Green Bay broadcast that Cope started using the nickname \"The Bus.\" Jerome credits the Notre Dame school newspaper with first using the nickname.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/steelers/20001221steele2.asp.|title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=December 21, 2000|website=Post-Gazette.com|access-date=December 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAnother lesser known nickname for Bettis was \"'''The Closer'''.\" He was given this nickname by former Steeler head coach [[Bill Cowher]] because whenever Pittsburgh was ahead and was ready to close out the game, Cowher would send in Bettis to run out the clock. He did this because of Bettis's very low fumbling percentage and the fact that he was difficult to tackle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n====Super Bowl XL====\n{{BLP unsourced section|date=March 2012}}\nShortly after the Steelers lost the 2004\u20132005 AFC Championship game to the eventual [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] champion [[New England Patriots]], [[Ben Roethlisberger]] approached Bettis. He promised Bettis that if he came back for one last season, he would get him to the Super Bowl. Apparently, it was this promise that got Jerome Bettis to play one last season.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In 12 NFL seasons, Bettis had reached the playoffs five times, but had never been in the Super Bowl.\n\nIn week 17 of the 2005 NFL season, Bettis rushed for 41 yards and three touchdowns against the [[Detroit Lions]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=260101023]. espn.go.com (January 1, 2006). Retrieved on August 20, 2015.</ref> The Steelers won, 35\u201321, and thanks to Bettis's three touchdowns, they clinched a playoff berth. When [[Bill Cowher]] pulled Bettis from the game late in the fourth quarter, he was given a standing ovation from the Steeler fans. This game would be the last home game (not including the neutral-site [[Super Bowl]]) for Jerome Bettis.\n\nBettis contributed 52 yards and a touchdown in the Steelers' wildcard playoff victory over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] on January 8. After their wildcard win, Ben Roethlisberger revealed to the team that he promised to Bettis that he would get him to the Super Bowl, in order to get him to come back for the 2005 season.\n\nOn January 15, 2006, Bettis was the center of one of football's most memorable{{According to whom|date=December 2017}} endings in a divisional playoff game against the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. While the Steelers offensive attack was mostly pass driven during the game, Bettis ran well, taking in 46 yards on 17 rushes, including one touchdown. When the Steelers took possession of the ball on the Indianapolis 2-yard line with 1:20 remaining in the game, leading 21-18, the outcome seemed almost certain. The first play from scrimmage went to the surehanded Bettis, who had not fumbled once the entire year. As Bettis ran towards the end zone, Colts linebacker [[Gary Brackett]] popped the ball out of Jerome's hands, where, in seemingly another occurrence of the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' \"cover jinx,\" it was picked up by cornerback [[Nick Harper (American football)|Nick Harper]], who was [[Pittsburgh sports lore#The Tackle|stopped from returning the fumble all the way for a touchdown]] by Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]]. Ultimately, however, Bettis's mistake did not result in a Steelers loss, as Colts kicker [[Mike Vanderjagt]] missed a 46-yard game-tying field goal, ending the game with a 21-18 Steelers victory.\n\nThe next week, the Steelers were set to face off against the [[Denver Broncos]] in the AFC Championship game. Bettis delivered a rousing speech to his teammates the day before the game, asking them to \"Just get me to Detroit\", his hometown, where [[Super Bowl XL]] was to be played.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Bettis's wish was granted, as he and the Steelers advanced to [[Super Bowl XL]] with a 34\u201317 win over the Broncos, led by [[Ben Roethlisberger]]'s arm and Bettis's 39 yards on 15 carries, including a touchdown. After the game was over, Bettis found his parents in the crowd and mouthed the words \"We're going home\" to them.\n\n===NFL statistics===\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Team\n! colspan=\"2\"| Games \n! colspan=\"6\"| Rushing\n! colspan=\"2\"| Fumbles\n|- \n!
