By the late 1980s three competitors were established, [[Lufttransport]], [[M\u00f8refly]] and [[Braathens Helikopter]], but by 1992 Helikopter Service had bought all three of these. Both the authorities and the oil companies wanted multiple operators to stimulate competition. Norsk Helikopter was incorporated in 1993 to fill this gap. It was initially owned as a [[joint venture]] between [[Andreas Ugland]] and Bristow Helicopter, with the Norwegian shipping billionaire owning 51 percent. This resulted in a close technical cooperation with Bristow's other helicopter companies.
