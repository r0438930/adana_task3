Set in Edwardian England, the film is based on an [[Alan Sharp]] adaptation of Irish author [[Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]'s 1936 novella ''My Talks with Dean Spanley''. It stars [[Sam Neill]] as the Dean, [[Jeremy Northam]] and [[Peter O'Toole]] as Fisk Junior and Fisk Senior respectively and [[Bryan Brown]] as Wrather.\n\n==Plot==\nThe narrative is called \"a surreal period comedic tale of canine reincarnation exploring the relationships between father and son and master and dog\".<ref>[http://www.villagefilmfestival.co.uk/films/deanspanley.html Village Film Festival]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Peter O'Toole said that the film's use of comedy to explore the relationship between a father and son was part of the attraction for him: \"All of us have had these difficult familial relationships and I think it's a film for all of us who understand the relationship between a father and son.

The Fisk family has suffered first the loss of its younger son, Harrington Fisk (Xavier Horan), killed in the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]], shortly followed by the death of Horatio's wife. Fisk Senior is looked after by his housekeeper Mrs Brimley ([[Judy Parfitt]]) who has lost her husband. Fisk Junior reluctantly visits his father every Thursday.\n\nOne day, trying to entertain his father, Fisk Junior takes him to a lecture by a visiting [[swami]] ([[Art Malik]]) about the [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] of souls. The lecture is also attended by the new local clergyman, Dean Spanley ([[Sam Neill]]).\n\nLater the same day Fisk Junior encounters the Dean at his father's club. A chance third meeting leads to an introduction. Fisk Junior, initially intrigued by the Dean's oddly open-minded views on reincarnation, is prompted to look beyond the Dean's appearance (that of an affable, rather bland clergyman) by his weakness for certain peculiar sensations produced by Hungarian Imperial [[Tokaji|Tokay]] wine, which leads him into a dreamlike state. Working with his clever friend Wrather ([[Bryan Brown]]), an Australian \"[[conveyancer]]\", Fisk secures a batch of Tokay and the two entertain the Dean, who acts ever more strangely, starting to reveal memories of his previous life \u2014 as a [[Welsh Springer Spaniel|Welsh Spaniel]]. These memories are acute and convincing, including rich feelings around food and communication with other canines, a deep distaste for cats and pigs, and the joy of serving his master. As the story unfolds, Fisk Junior comes to understand his father's background better and the two draw closer. There is a sub-plot concerning Fisk Senior's childhood that receives an unexpected resolution forming the climax of the story.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col begin}}\n* [[Jeremy Northam]] as Fisk Junior (Henslowe)\n* [[Sam Neill]] as Dean Spanley\n* [[Bryan Brown]] as J.J.
