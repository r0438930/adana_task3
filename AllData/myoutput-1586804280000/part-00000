In modern times, various economists within the [[Georgism]] movement propose measures like the [[land value tax]] to enhance access to the natural world for all. Poverty occurs in both [[developing country|developing countries]] and [[developed country|developed countries]]. While poverty is much more widespread in developing countries, both types of countries undertake poverty reduction measures.\n\nPoverty has been historically accepted in some parts of the world as inevitable as non-industrialized economies produced very little, while populations grew almost as fast, making wealth scarce.<ref>\"Under traditional (i.e., non-industrialized) modes of economic production, widespread poverty had been accepted as inevitable. The total output of goods and services, even if equally distributed, would still have been insufficient to give the entire population a [[right to an adequate standard of living]] by prevailing standards.

According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.<ref name=ODI2/>\n\nIncreases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \"[[working poor]]\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \"quality\" and not \"quantity\" in labour market policies.<ref name=ODI2/> This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show.<ref name=ODI2/> In [[Vietnam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.<ref name=ODI2/> Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.<ref name=ODI2/> The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as [[manufacturing]].<ref name=ODI2/> The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth.

The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty.

With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.<ref>Mukherji, A.

One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.<ref>[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/Landing_Pages/WIB8.aspx ''Water, poverty and equity''].

In his book ''Out of Poverty'' he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems.

During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: \"China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil's case for lack of growth and in India's case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China's case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India's case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/poverty-reduction-brazil-china-india/ |title = Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n==Aid==\n{{main|Aid}}\n\n===Welfare===\n{{Main|Welfare's effect on poverty}}\nAid in its simplest form is a [[basic income grant]], a form of [[social security]] periodically providing citizens with money. In pilot projects in [[Namibia]], where such a program pays just $13 a month, people were able to pay tuition fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, child [[malnutrition]] rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew 10%.<ref name=\"Spiegel\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/a-new-approach-to-aid-how-a-basic-income-program-saved-a-namibian-village-a-642310.html|title=A New Approach to Aid it was known by the development day which has been given a holiday for countries: How a Basic Income Program Saved a Namibian Village|last=Krahe|first=Dialika|date=2009-08-10|work=Spiegel Online|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Namibians line up\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7415814.stm|title=Namibians line up for free cash|date=2008-05-23|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> Aid could also be rewarded based on doing certain requirements.

Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Julia A.|author2=Kenneth S. Warren|title=Selective primary health care: An interim strategy for disease control in developing countries.|journal=Social Science & Medicine.

The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions from which they came. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Birn|first=Anne-Emanuelle|author2=Armando Sol\u00f3rzano|title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.|journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=49|issue=9|year=1999|page=1209|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4|pmid=10501641}}</ref>\n\nSome [[think tanks]] and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,<ref>[http://www.heritagekonpa.com/archives/Haiti;s%20rice%20farmers%20suffered%20since%20trade%20barrier%20in%201994.htm Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994.] By Jane Regan</ref> or because it is tied to the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives.<ref name=tiedaid/> Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,<ref>[http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp US and Foreign Aid], GlobalIssues.org</ref> and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance.

Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations \"to get out of the hole\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/|title=World Bank Group - International Development, Poverty, & Sustainability|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health-care and education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4081220.stm|title=Q&A: African debt relief|date=2005-06-11|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of debt relief in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4883062.stm|title= Zambia overwhelmed by free health care|publisher=BBC NEWS \u2013 Africa}}</ref>\n\n== The role of education and skillbuilding as precursors to economic development ==\n\n[[File:Working Together To End Poverty One Nail At A Time - 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|\"Working together to end poverty one nail at a time,\" T-shirt, 50th anniversary of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]\nUniversal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size\u2014an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.\n\n===Microloans===\n\nOne of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the [[Grameen Bank]] in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of [[irrigation]]. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. [[IFAD|The International Fund for Agricultural Development]] [[IFAD Vietnam|(IFAD) Vietnam]] country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to [[microcredit]] for taking up small-scale farm activities.<ref>RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Empowering women==\n{{See also|Women's education and development}}\nThe [[empowerment]] of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with [[gender inequality]]. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zuckerman, Elaine. 2002 \"Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Gender\". Berlin, Germany: Conference on Sustainable Poverty Reduction and PRSPs.</ref> In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the [[feminization of poverty]], policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In addition to engendering poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the [[World Bank]], suggesting that promoting [[gender equality]] through empowerment of women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy.<ref>World Bank. 2001a \"Engendering Development: Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice\".

Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty.<ref>Narayan, Deepa and Nicholas Stern. 2002. \"Empowerment and Poverty Reduction: A Sourcebook\", pp. 1\u2013272.

These \"hard states\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for [[wage|pay]] and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.\n\nThe [[United Nations Development Program]] published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that \"Without [[good governance]], reliance on [[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]] economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.\"<ref name=\"undp2000\">United Nations Development Report. 2000.

Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before [[colonialism]], as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world.<ref name=\"kerbo\"/>\n\n==Other approaches==\nAnother approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is [[Fair Trade]] which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.\n\nCommunity and monetary economist [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]] has argued that the mainstream [[international finance|global economy]] with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern [[barter]] clubs and historical local currencies such as the [[W\u00f6rgl Experiment]] at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of [[community currency]] as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.<ref>Thomas Greco, Jr., ''Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender'', Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-890132-37-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Toronto Dollar]] is an example of a [[local currency]] oriented towards reducing poverty.

There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented.

The Campaign believes that a human rights framework, based on the value of inherent dignity and worth of all persons, offers the best means by which to organize for a political solution to poverty. \n\n===Climate change adaptation===\n{{main|Climate change and poverty}}\nThe increase in extreme weather events, linked to climate change, and resulting disasters is expected to continue.  Disasters are a major cause of impoverishment and can reverse progress towards poverty reduction.<ref name=ODI2013>Andrew Shepherd, Tom Mitchell, Kirsty Lewis, Amanda Lenhardt, Lindsey Jones, Lucy Scott and Robert Muir-Wood (2013) [http://www.odi.org/publications/7491-geography-poverty-disasters-climate-change-2030 \"The geography of poverty, disasters and climate extremes in 2030\"] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref>\n\nIt is predicted that by 2030, 325 million (plus) extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard prone countries.

For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3\u201310 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.\n\n===Millennium Development Goals ===\nEradication of [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 is one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). In addition to broader approaches, the [[Jeffrey Sachs|Sachs]] Report (for the UN Millennium Project)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/|title=UN Millennium Project \u2013 Publications}}</ref> proposes a series of \"quick wins\", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are:\n* Access to information on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexual and reproductive health]].\n* Action against [[domestic violence]].\n* Appointing government scientific advisors in every country.\n* Deworming school children in affected areas.\n* Drugs for AIDS, [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].\n* Eliminating [[tuition|school fees]].\n* Ending [[Fee-for-service|user fees]] for basic health care in [[Developing country|developing countries]].\n* [[Free school meal]]s for schoolchildren.\n* Legislation for [[women's rights]], including rights to property.\n* [[Planting trees]].\n* Providing [[fertilizer|soil nutrients]] to farmers in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].\n* Providing [[mosquito net]]s.\n* [[Rural electrification|Access to electricity]], water and [[sanitation]].\n* Supporting [[breast-feeding]].\n* Training programs for [[community health]] in rural areas.\n* Upgrading slums, and providing land for [[public housing]].\n\n=== Sustainable Development Goals ===\nThe first of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1|title=Goal 1 .:.

If during those 10 years growth rates prevailed over the next 15 years,{{clarify|date=July 2019}} it is possible to decrease the rate of extreme poverty in the world to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth will benefit all income groups of the population on an equal footing. However, if the growth rates over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates.\n\n===Poverty targeting===\nPoverty reduction requires governments to identify and reach out to extremely poor and help them out of poverty through sustainable measures. One such approach supported by many international donors is of targeted poverty reduction programmes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Costs and benefits of poverty targeting|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/more-accurate-poverty-targeting-strategy-more-expensive-it|author=James G.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome |publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}</ref>\n\nThe main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/2013/12/pope-francis-denounces-global-scandal-hunger/|title=Pope Francis denounces 'global scandal' of hunger|date=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe partnership Compact2025, led by [[International Food Policy Research Institute|IFPRI]] with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compact2025.org/about-compact2025/governance/leadership-council/|title=Leadership Council}}</ref> develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifpri.org/publication/compact-2025-ending-hunger-and-undernutrition|title=Compact2025: Ending hunger and undernutrition |publisher=IFPRI}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations#Online campaign against hunger|EndingHunger]] campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world.\n\nAnother initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement (SUN). Started in 2010, this movement of people from governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses and researchers publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 57 partner countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scalingupnutrition.org/about|title=SUN communication materials}}</ref>\n\n=== Poverty reduction in Taiwan ===\nIn spite of the intensive reduction [[Strategy|strategies]] deployed in the previous two decades, poverty levels in several countries of the world has not been reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chinn|first=Dennis|title=The University of Chicago Press Journals|journal=Rural Poverty and the Structure of Farm Household Income in Developing Countries: Evidence from Taiwan|volume=27|issue=2|pages=283\u2013301|jstor=1153441|year=1979|doi=10.1086/451093}}</ref> Recent research has demonstrated that the low wage levels of the needy families have risen gradually, although in some scenarios they have declined.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rajamann|title=Poverty inequality and economic growth: Rural Punjab|journal=Journal of Development Studies|volume=11}}</ref> While wage level is the main median pointer of welfare, such results  suggest that past poverty reduction procedures have not been precise.

According to the [[UNRISD]], increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%.<ref name=ODI2/>\n\nIncreases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \"[[working poor]]\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \"quality\" and not \"quantity\" in labour market policies.<ref name=ODI2/> This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show.<ref name=ODI2/> In [[Vietnam]], for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued.<ref name=ODI2/> Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.<ref name=ODI2/> The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as [[manufacturing]].<ref name=ODI2/> The [[services sector]] is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth.

The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty. The authors concluded that further investments in the [[chickpea]] and other legume research in [[Ethiopia]] were therefore justified as a means of poverty alleviation.<ref>Macharia I, Orr A, Simtowe F and Asfaw, S., ''Potential economic and poverty impact of improved chickpea technologies in Ethiopia'' http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/chickpea/685/107.

With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.<ref>Mukherji, A. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071102102545/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Other/index.aspx Revitalising Asia's Irrigation: To sustainably meet tomorrow's food needs] 2009, [[IWMI]] and [[FAO]]</ref>\n\nThe [[International Water Management Institute]] in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]] aims to improve the management of land and water resources for food, livelihoods and the environment. One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.<ref>[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/Landing_Pages/WIB8.aspx ''Water, poverty and equity''].

Poverty activist [[Paul Polak]] has based his career around doing both at once, creating companies that employ the poor while creating \"radically\" affordable goods. In his book ''Out of Poverty'' he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems. He lists \"Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths\": that we can donate people out of poverty, that national economic growth will end poverty, and that Big Business, operating as it does now, will end poverty.<ref>{{cite web|last=Polak|first=Paul|title=Out of Poverty|url=http://www.bkconnection.com/ProdDetails.asp?ID=9781605092768&PG=1&Type=BL&PCS=BKP}}</ref> Economic models which lead to national growth and more big business will not necessarily lead to more opportunities for self-sufficiency.

During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: \"China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil's case for lack of growth and in India's case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China's case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India's case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/poverty-reduction-brazil-china-india/ |title = Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India |publisher=Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n==Aid==\n{{main|Aid}}\n\n===Welfare===\n{{Main|Welfare's effect on poverty}}\nAid in its simplest form is a [[basic income grant]], a form of [[social security]] periodically providing citizens with money.

Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=Julia A.|author2=Kenneth S.

The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions from which they came. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Birn|first=Anne-Emanuelle|author2=Armando Sol\u00f3rzano|title=Public health policy paradoxes: science and politics in the Rockefeller Foundation's hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s.|journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=49|issue=9|year=1999|page=1209|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(99)00160-4|pmid=10501641}}</ref>\n\nSome [[think tanks]] and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,<ref>[http://www.heritagekonpa.com/archives/Haiti;s%20rice%20farmers%20suffered%20since%20trade%20barrier%20in%201994.htm Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994.] By Jane Regan</ref> or because it is tied to the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives.<ref name=tiedaid/> Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,<ref>[http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp US and Foreign Aid], GlobalIssues.org</ref> and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance.

Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations \"to get out of the hole\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldbank.org/|title=World Bank Group - International Development, Poverty, & Sustainability|website=World Bank|language=en|access-date=2019-11-01}}</ref> If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health-care and education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4081220.stm|title=Q&A: African debt relief|date=2005-06-11|access-date=2019-11-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of debt relief in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4883062.stm|title= Zambia overwhelmed by free health care|publisher=BBC NEWS \u2013 Africa}}</ref>\n\n== The role of education and skillbuilding as precursors to economic development ==\n\n[[File:Working Together To End Poverty One Nail At A Time - 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.jpg|thumb|right|\"Working together to end poverty one nail at a time,\" T-shirt, 50th anniversary of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]\nUniversal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size\u2014an important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty.\n\n===Microloans===\n\nOne of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the [[Grameen Bank]] in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of [[irrigation]]. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. [[IFAD|The International Fund for Agricultural Development]] [[IFAD Vietnam|(IFAD) Vietnam]] country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to [[microcredit]] for taking up small-scale farm activities.<ref>RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Empowering women==\n{{See also|Women's education and development}}\nThe [[empowerment]] of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with [[gender inequality]]. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zuckerman, Elaine. 2002 \"Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Gender\". Berlin, Germany: Conference on Sustainable Poverty Reduction and PRSPs.</ref> In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the [[feminization of poverty]], policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In addition to engendering poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the [[World Bank]], suggesting that promoting [[gender equality]] through empowerment of women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy.<ref>World Bank. 2001a \"Engendering Development: Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice\".

Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty.<ref>Narayan, Deepa and Nicholas Stern. 2002. \"Empowerment and Poverty Reduction: A Sourcebook\", pp. 1\u2013272.

These \"hard states\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for [[wage|pay]] and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development.\n\nThe [[United Nations Development Program]] published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that \"Without [[good governance]], reliance on [[trickle-down economics|trickle-down]] economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.\"<ref name=\"undp2000\">United Nations Development Report. 2000. ''Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000.''

Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before [[colonialism]], as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world.<ref name=\"kerbo\"/>\n\n==Other approaches==\nAnother approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is [[Fair Trade]] which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial.\n\nCommunity and monetary economist [[Thomas H. Greco, Jr.]] has argued that the mainstream [[international finance|global economy]] with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern [[barter]] clubs and historical local currencies such as the [[W\u00f6rgl Experiment]] at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of [[community currency]] as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.<ref>Thomas Greco, Jr., ''Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender'', Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. {{ISBN|978-1-890132-37-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Toronto Dollar]] is an example of a [[local currency]] oriented towards reducing poverty.

There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented.

The Campaign believes that a human rights framework, based on the value of inherent dignity and worth of all persons, offers the best means by which to organize for a political solution to poverty. \n\n===Climate change adaptation===\n{{main|Climate change and poverty}}\nThe increase in extreme weather events, linked to climate change, and resulting disasters is expected to continue.  Disasters are a major cause of impoverishment and can reverse progress towards poverty reduction.<ref name=ODI2013>Andrew Shepherd, Tom Mitchell, Kirsty Lewis, Amanda Lenhardt, Lindsey Jones, Lucy Scott and Robert Muir-Wood (2013) [http://www.odi.org/publications/7491-geography-poverty-disasters-climate-change-2030 \"The geography of poverty, disasters and climate extremes in 2030\"] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref>\n\nIt is predicted that by 2030, 325 million (plus) extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard prone countries.

For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3\u201310 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations.\n\n===Millennium Development Goals ===\nEradication of [[extreme poverty]] and hunger by 2015 is one of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs). In addition to broader approaches, the [[Jeffrey Sachs|Sachs]] Report (for the UN Millennium Project)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/|title=UN Millennium Project \u2013 Publications}}</ref> proposes a series of \"quick wins\", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are:\n* Access to information on [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexual and reproductive health]].\n* Action against [[domestic violence]].\n* Appointing government scientific advisors in every country.\n* Deworming school children in affected areas.\n* Drugs for AIDS, [[tuberculosis]], and [[malaria]].\n* Eliminating [[tuition|school fees]].\n* Ending [[Fee-for-service|user fees]] for basic health care in [[Developing country|developing countries]].\n* [[Free school meal]]s for schoolchildren.\n* Legislation for [[women's rights]], including rights to property.\n* [[Planting trees]].\n* Providing [[fertilizer|soil nutrients]] to farmers in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].\n* Providing [[mosquito net]]s.\n* [[Rural electrification|Access to electricity]], water and [[sanitation]].\n* Supporting [[breast-feeding]].\n* Training programs for [[community health]] in rural areas.\n* Upgrading slums, and providing land for [[public housing]].\n\n=== Sustainable Development Goals ===\nThe first of the 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg1|title=Goal 1 .:.

However, if the growth rates over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates.\n\n===Poverty targeting===\nPoverty reduction requires governments to identify and reach out to extremely poor and help them out of poverty through sustainable measures. One such approach supported by many international donors is of targeted poverty reduction programmes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Costs and benefits of poverty targeting|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/more-accurate-poverty-targeting-strategy-more-expensive-it|author=James G.

In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome |publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center}}</ref>\n\nThe main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]].
