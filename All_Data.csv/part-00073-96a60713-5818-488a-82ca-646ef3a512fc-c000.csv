'''Daniel Riquelme García''' ([[Santiago]], [[Chile]], 1857– [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], 1912) was a writer, journalist and chronicler of [[Chile]].

==Biography==
He was a son of Jose Riquelme Orozco, the first Chilean [[stenography|stenographer]], and Bruna Garcia Venegas, a professor of music. He was the younger brother of Ernesto Riquelme. In 1865, his father died and his mother took over his education. He studied at the National Institute of Santiago, then law at the [[University of Chile]], although he subsequently abandoned his studies.

He began as a writer on various topics in [[Santiago]] magazines, and then devoted himself to journalism. In 1876 he entered public service, serving as auxiliary official of the Ministry of Finance under the government of President [[Aníbal Pinto]]. As public functionary he was part of an integrated civilian entourage that accompanied the [[Chilean Army]] during the [[War of the Pacific]], and he used his stay at the [[Front (military)|war front]] to work as a correspondent for ''El Heraldo'' of [[Valparaiso]], a newspaper that published his articles from November 1880 until June 1881.

In 1885 he published ''Military Chascarillos'', or ''Military Jokes'', which recounted his experiences at the front, dealing with topics such as jokes, table manners and various stories. The book was edited, enhanced and then republished in the work that made him most famous, ''Under the tent'' (1888).

From 1887 to 1891, Riqueme wrote stories, chronicles and articles under the [[pseudonym]] with which he popularly became known: Innocent Conchalí. During this period his works included his urban portraits of bohemian Santiago in the late nineteenth century, in particular around the Orphans, Merced and Recoleta streets, where he spent much of his life. His writings combined nascent modernism techniques with the metaphors and sayings drawn from the local Creole. This contributed to Chilean prose of the nineteenth century, and was adopted by later writers including [[Baldomero Lillo]] and [[Olegario Lazo Baeza]].

After the fall of President [[José Manuel Balmaceda]], Riquelme continued to work as a writer periodically, but abandoned his light and adorned style of writing to instead engage in works on various historical events, a task that continued during his years at the ''[[El Mercurio]]'' of Santiago until 1911.

Sick with [[tuberculosis]], Riqueme traveled to [[Paris]] and then moved to [[Switzerland]]. He died in [[Lausanne]] in 1912, and his remains were interred there until 1942, when they were thrown into a [[common grave]]. At present, the precise location of his remains is unknown.

==Work==
In addition to his work on the War of the Pacific, Riquelme portrayed the political and social life of Santiago in the late nineteenth century through articles on folklore, chronicles of the day, and various tales and short stories. In the latter stage of his career as an author, he wrote extensively on history, and he proposed a rereading of some of the foundational accounts of Chile.

'''Feldkirch''' is a very small town (population 900<ref name=\"data\"/>) in [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]], a few minutes from the [[France|French]] border (4&nbsp;km) and near [[Switzerland]]. It is part of the town [[Hartheim am Rhein]].

It has a small bakery, 3 restaurants, and 3 hotels (guesthouses).
The village is known for its crops, especially for the asparagus. 
They also grow onions, potatoes, strawberries and other berries.

It is famous as the childhood home of Sybille von Schoenebeck, later to gain fame as author [[Sybille Bedford]], in the 1910s. It has really only come to full prominence in the 21st century with the publication of her final autobiography ''Quicksands: A Memoir'', though it was mentioned in her 1989 [[Booker Prize]]-nominated ''Jigsaw: An Unsentimental Education''.

==History==

The name Veltkilcha appears in documents in 1160. 1475 there were 10 hearths, i.e. 10 families who have settled around the \"church on the field\". During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48), the village and the church were completely destroyed. In 1690 the reconstruction of the Bergische Whose castle began. It received much of its present form. In 1866 the presence of Whose Berger in Feldkirch ends. Since that time, the castle changed its owners frequently. By 1899, the mayor Heinrich Rinderle was in the possession of the castle. He generously distributed the property to the farmers of the community. In 1960, a comprehensive restoration of the Martin Church was completed. In 1964 Feldkirch celebrated the construction of Wessenberg school. Ten years later, in 1974, the kindergarten St. Martin was founded. In the same year, Feldkirch became part of Hartheim.

'''Eudore Évanturel''' ([[Quebec (city)|Quebec]], 22 September 1852 – [[Boston]], 16 May 1919) is a Quebec poet, [[Canada]].

== Biography ==
Interested very early in poetry, he frequented clubs of young writers. In October [[1875]], his play \"Crâne et cervelle\" was read before an audience in Quebec. The work, which tells the story of a medical student who steals corpses to dissect them and who falls on the remains of his own fiancée, is scandalous. The reaction will be just as lively in the following days with some of his poems published in the newspaper ''[[L'Évènement-Journal|L'Évènement]]''.

Shaken but encouraged by the novelist [[Joseph Marmette]], his friend, Évanturel published in [[1878]] a volume of ''Premier poésies''. This collection, inspired by [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]] but with accents [[Paul Verlaine|verlainiens]], still scandalizes the conservative literary milieu of [[Quebec]] at the time. The ruthless and unfair criticism of [[Jules-Paul Tardivel]] in particular closes doors for him and drives his friends away. He lost his job and even the support of Joseph Marmette. Thus dissuaded from going further in his career, unemployed, Évanturel went into exile in [[United States]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] where he founded a French-language newspaper. He married in Quebec in [[1884]] Esther Casgrain and returned to settle in Quebec in [[1887]] where he died in [[1919]].

The author only publishes a few isolated poems thereafter. He was however one of the first to deal with themes different from those in force at the time: wide open spaces, patriotic impulses, glorification of God, etc. Évanturel tackles rather subjects which strike the ambient conservatism. He takes an observer position on art, love, death, the middle classes, social disparities, sadness, scenes of private life, etc. In this sense, he appears to be a pioneer who sought to break conventions. His work is still unknown, but he is nonetheless one of the most sensitive, original and inspired poets of Quebec before [[Émile Nelligan|Nelligan]].

He is buried in [[Cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont]], in [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]].

'''Eudore Évanturel''' ([[Quebec (city)|Quebec]], 22 September 1852 – [[Boston]], 16 May 1919) is a Quebec poet, [[Canada]].

== Biography ==
Interested very early in poetry, he frequented clubs of young writers. In October [[1875]], his play \"Crâne et cervelle\" was read before an audience in Quebec. The work, which tells the story of a medical student who steals corpses to dissect them and who falls on the remains of his own fiancée, is scandalous. The reaction will be just as lively in the following days with some of his poems published in the newspaper ''[[L'Évènement-Journal|L'Évènement]]''.

Shaken but encouraged by the novelist [[Joseph Marmette]], his friend, Évanturel published in [[1878]] a volume of ''Premier poésies''. This collection, inspired by [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]] but with accents [[Paul Verlaine|verlainiens]], still scandalizes the conservative literary milieu of [[Quebec]] at the time. The ruthless and unfair criticism of [[Jules-Paul Tardivel]] in particular closes doors for him and drives his friends away. He lost his job and even the support of Joseph Marmette. Thus dissuaded from going further in his career, unemployed, Évanturel went into exile in [[United States]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] where he founded a French-language newspaper. He married in Quebec in [[1884]] Esther Casgrain and returned to settle in Quebec in [[1887]] where he died in [[1919]].

The author only publishes a few isolated poems thereafter. He was however one of the first to deal with themes different from those in force at the time: wide open spaces, patriotic impulses, glorification of God, etc. Évanturel tackles rather subjects which strike the ambient conservatism. He takes an observer position on art, love, death, the middle classes, social disparities, sadness, scenes of private life, etc. In this sense, he appears to be a pioneer who sought to break conventions. His work is still unknown, but he is nonetheless one of the most sensitive, original and inspired poets of Quebec before [[Émile Nelligan|Nelligan]].

He is buried in [[Cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont]], in [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]].

The 4th constituency of [[Maine-et-Loire]] ([[French language|French]]: ''Quatrième circonscription de Maine-et-Loire'') is a French legislative [[Constituency (France)|constituency]] in the Maine-et-Loire ''[[Departments of France|département]]''. Like the other 576 French constituencies, it elects one [[National Assembly of France|MP]] using the [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] election system with a run-off.

==Description==
The 4th Constituency of [[Maine-et-Loire]] is situated in the south east of the department. It includes the south of [[Saumur]] a town famed for its wine production, the northern half of the town is contained within [[Maine-et-Loire's 3rd constituency]].

'''Eudore Évanturel''' ([[Quebec (city)|Quebec]], 22 September 1852 – [[Boston]], 16 May 1919) is a Quebec poet, [[Canada]].

== Biography ==
Interested very early in poetry, he frequented clubs of young writers. In October [[1875]], his play \"Crâne et cervelle\" was read before an audience in Quebec. The work, which tells the story of a medical student who steals corpses to dissect them and who falls on the remains of his own fiancée, is scandalous. The reaction will be just as lively in the following days with some of his poems published in the newspaper ''[[L'Évènement-Journal|L'Évènement]]''.

Shaken but encouraged by the novelist [[Joseph Marmette]], his friend, Évanturel published in [[1878]] a volume of ''Premier poésies''. This collection, inspired by [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]] but with accents [[Paul Verlaine|verlainiens]], still scandalizes the conservative literary milieu of [[Quebec]] at the time. The ruthless and unfair criticism of [[Jules-Paul Tardivel]] in particular closes doors for him and drives his friends away. He lost his job and even the support of Joseph Marmette. Thus dissuaded from going further in his career, unemployed, Évanturel went into exile in [[United States]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] where he founded a French-language newspaper. He married in Quebec in [[1884]] Esther Casgrain and returned to settle in Quebec in [[1887]] where he died in [[1919]].

The author only publishes a few isolated poems thereafter. He was however one of the first to deal with themes different from those in force at the time: wide open spaces, patriotic impulses, glorification of God, etc. Évanturel tackles rather subjects which strike the ambient conservatism. He takes an observer position on art, love, death, the middle classes, social disparities, sadness, scenes of private life, etc. In this sense, he appears to be a pioneer who sought to break conventions. His work is still unknown, but he is nonetheless one of the most sensitive, original and inspired poets of Quebec before [[Émile Nelligan|Nelligan]].

He is buried in [[Cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont]], in [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]].

Incorporation by reference is often done in creating laws as well as in [[Contract|contract law]] and [[Property law|trust and estate law]].

In law regarding [[Will and testament|wills]], it is a doctrine at [[common law]] which allows a testator, or a creator of a will, to dispose of assets in his estate in accordance with a separate document. To be valid, such a document must comply with the following requirements:
# it must have existed at the time the will was executed;
# the will must describe the document with particularity, so that it may be identified; and
# the will must clearly manifest the intent that the document be incorporated.
An exception to the first requirement is made for small gifts of tangible [[personal property]], such as household furniture and items of sentimental value.

Oral instructions can ''not'' be subject to incorporation by reference. For example, if a [[testator]] states in the will that he has recited to a third party the intended disposition of testamentary assets, such attempt to circumvent the requirements of a written will is [[Void (law)|void]].

In American [[administrative law]], incorporation by reference is a drafting tool that enables federal agencies to give legal effect to materials that are already published elsewhere.

Section 552(a) requires agencies to publish regulations in the [[Federal Register]] in order to enforce them.  Section 552(a)(1) provides that if material published elsewhere is \"reasonably available to the class of persons affected\" and the Director of the Federal Register approves its incorporation by reference, that material will be \"deemed published\" in the Federal Register.  It is most controversially used to incorporate privately authored voluntary consensus standards into health and safety regulations without infringing the standards developers' copyright.  Federal law and policy, embodied in the [[National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act]] of 1995 and [[Office of Management and Budget]] (OMB) Circular A-119, requires federal agencies to use these standards instead of creating \"government-unique\" technical standards purely to serve regulatory purposes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bremer|first=Emily S.|title=Incorporation by Reference in an Open-Government Age|journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy|year=2013|volume=36|issue=1|page=131|ssrn=2127288}}</ref>

Interested very early in poetry, he frequented clubs of young writers. In October [[1875]], his play \"Crâne et cervelle\" was read before an audience in Quebec. The work, which tells the story of a medical student who steals corpses to dissect them and who falls on the remains of his own fiancée, is scandalous. The reaction will be just as lively in the following days with some of his poems published in the newspaper ''[[L'Évènement-Journal|L'Évènement]]''.

Shaken but encouraged by the novelist [[Joseph Marmette]], his friend, Évanturel published in [[1878]] a volume of ''Premier poésies''. This collection, inspired by [[Alfred de Musset|Musset]] but with accents [[Paul Verlaine|verlainiens]], still scandalizes the conservative literary milieu of [[Quebec]] at the time. The ruthless and unfair criticism of [[Jules-Paul Tardivel]] in particular closes doors for him and drives his friends away. He lost his job and even the support of Joseph Marmette. Thus dissuaded from going further in his career, unemployed, Évanturel went into exile in [[United States]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] where he founded a French-language newspaper. He married in Quebec in [[1884]] Esther Casgrain and returned to settle in Quebec in [[1887]] where he died in [[1919]].

The author only publishes a few isolated poems thereafter. He was however one of the first to deal with themes different from those in force at the time: wide open spaces, patriotic impulses, glorification of God, etc. Évanturel tackles rather subjects which strike the ambient conservatism. He takes an observer position on art, love, death, the middle classes, social disparities, sadness, scenes of private life, etc. In this sense, he appears to be a pioneer who sought to break conventions. His work is still unknown, but he is nonetheless one of the most sensitive, original and inspired poets of Quebec before [[Émile Nelligan|Nelligan]].

He is buried in [[Cimetière Notre-Dame-de-Belmont]], in [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]].

==Biography==
Beginning in 1888, in addition to a career as a lawyer, he served as editor for the periodical ''[[The Artist and Journal of Home Culture]]'', which became something of an official periodical for the movement. In it, he praised such artists as [[Henry Scott Tuke]] (to whom he dedicated a homo-erotic sonnet entitled \"Sonnet on a picture by Tuke\") and [[Henry Oliver Walker]]. He also befriended such similar-minded contemporaries as [[Frederick William Rolfe]], [[Lord Alfred Douglas]] and [[John Addington Symonds]].<ref>Aldrich, Robert and Garry Wotherspoon (eds.): Who's Who in Contemporary Gay and Lesbian History: From World War II to the Present Day, page 236. Routledge, 2001</ref>

The homosexual and pederastic aspects of ''The Artist and Journal of Home Culture'' declined after the replacement of Kains Jackson as an editor in 1894. The final issue edited by Kains Jackson included his essay, ''the New Chivalry'', an argument for the moral and societal benefits of [[pederasty]] and erotic male friendship on the grounds of both [[Platonism]] and [[Social Darwinism]].<ref>Frantzen, Allen J.: Bloody Good: chivalry, sacrifice, and the Great War, page 145. University of Chicago Press, 2003</ref> According to Kains Jackson, the New Chivalry would promote \"the youthful masculine ideal\" over the Old Chivalry's emphasis on the feminine. Jackson's volumes of poetry include ''Finibus Cantat Amor'' (1922) and ''Lysis'' (1924).

Kains Jackson was a member of the [[Order of Chaeronea]], a secret society for homosexuals founded in 1897 by [[George Cecil Ives|George Ives]], which was named after the location of [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|the battle]] where the [[Sacred Band of Thebes]] was finally annihilated in 338 BC.<ref>The Knitting Circle: George Ives. {{cite web |url=http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/georgeives.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070115163735/http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/georgeives.html |archivedate=2007-01-15 }}</ref> Other members included [[Samuel Elsworth Cottam]], [[Montague Summers]], and John Gambril Nicholson.

Jackson discovered the poetry of [[Edward Cracroft Lefroy]]. He published two small books of poetry, both concerning his romance with his cousin Cecil Castle who died in 1922. A third unpublished collection of 85 poems, titled ''Alba Ligustra'', dating from 1925&ndash;28, was sold by an American book dealer in 2017. Many of the poems concerned Kains-Jackson's memories of Castle, and other poems and notes referred to [[Henry Scott Tuke]].

==Biography==
Masoumeh Aghapour Alishahi, born in [[Tehran, Iran]], has a [[Doctorate degree]] (Ph.D.) in economics, with a major in Labour Management, from [[Islamic Azad University]] in [[Qods]], Tehran province, Iran.<ref name=\"parl\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilica.com/Paper-ICMNG01-ICMNG01_465.html|title=Investigating the relationship between organizational culture and staff education on acceptance of management information systems|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Civilica|publisher=21st Century International Management Conference|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>She lectures at [[Allameh Tabataba'i University]], Islamic Azad University and [[University of Applied Science and Technology]], Tehran, Iran. Aside from academics, she featured in politics as shabester constituency representative in the Islamic consultative assembly. This position took effect during the June 2016 [[parliament]]ary elections where she was elected as a member of the tenth Islamic parliament under the [[auspices]] of reformist universal alliance party, with 24,952 out of a total 40,472 valid votes. The post was halted after she was declared ineligible to participate in the 2020 parliamentary elections for religious reasons. She was also a member of [[Iranian parliament]]'s economy commission.

These political positions availed her of the opportunity to be one of the attendees of the 15th parliamentary union of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) member states (PUIC) held in Burkina Faso on 28 January 2020, where sharing experiences in law formulation with other Muslim lawmakers was the subject of discussion.

As a member of the tenth Islamic parliament, she advocated for [[privatization]] of the automobile industry, to ensure industry protection, enhancement and promotion. This strong support for the automobile industry was eminent in her remarks during her site visit to Crouse auto part manufacturing company, Iran. She also banged the drum for easy access to bank loans, financial resources and modern technologies in industries. This was declared, alongside a host of commission members at the [[Mobarakeh Steel Company]] (MSC), prior to its anniversary.

Masoumeh Aghapour Alishahi's advocacies were obvious efforts of the parliament, during her tenure, to work with the Iranian government to improve the country's economic situation.

On February 2020, after the 2019 [[Corona virus]] epidemic spread to Iran, she was reportedly infected with [[SARS-COV-2]], also known as [[COVID-19]].

'''Masoumeh Aghapour Alishahi''' (born 30 March 1969) is a Lecturer and Iranian politician.<ref name=\"parl\">{{Cite web|url=https://en.parliran.ir/eng/en/Content/_/Aghapour-Alishahi-Masoumeh28773|title=Aghapour Alishahi|last=|first=|date=|website=Islamic Parliament of IRAN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>

==Biography==
Masoumeh Aghapour Alishahi, born in [[Tehran, Iran]], has a [[Doctorate degree]] (Ph.D.) in economics, with a major in Labour Management, from [[Islamic Azad University]] in [[Qods]], Tehran province, Iran.<ref name=\"parl\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.civilica.com/Paper-ICMNG01-ICMNG01_465.html|title=Investigating the relationship between organizational culture and staff education on acceptance of management information systems|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Civilica|publisher=21st Century International Management Conference|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 April 2020}}</ref>She lectures at [[Allameh Tabataba'i University]], Islamic Azad University and [[University of Applied Science and Technology]], Tehran, Iran. Aside from academics, she featured in politics as shabester constituency representative in the Islamic consultative assembly. This position took effect during the June 2016 [[parliament]]ary elections where she was elected as a member of the tenth Islamic parliament under the [[auspices]] of reformist universal alliance party, with 24,952 out of a total 39,754 valid votes. The post was halted after she was declared ineligible to participate in the 2020 parliamentary elections for religious reasons. She was also a member of [[Iranian parliament]]'s economy commission.

These political positions availed her of the opportunity to be one of the attendees of the 15th parliamentary union of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) member states (PUIC) held in Burkina Faso on 28 January 2020, where sharing experiences in law formulation with other Muslim lawmakers was the subject of discussion.

As a member of the tenth Islamic parliament, she advocated for [[privatization]] of the automobile industry, to ensure industry protection, enhancement and promotion. This strong support for the automobile industry was eminent in her remarks during her site visit to Crouse auto part manufacturing company, Iran. She also banged the drum for easy access to bank loans, financial resources and modern technologies in industries. This was declared, alongside a host of commission members at the [[Mobarakeh Steel Company]] (MSC), prior to its anniversary.

Masoumeh Aghapour Alishahi's advocacies were obvious efforts of the parliament, during her tenure, to work with the Iranian government to improve the country's economic situation.

On February 2020, after the 2019 [[Corona virus]] epidemic spread to Iran, she was reportedly infected with [[SARS-COV-2]], also known as [[COVID-19]].

'''Lake Michigan Shore AVA''' is an [[American Viticultural Area]] located in southwest [[Michigan]].

==Climate and geography==
The AVA boundaries include the smaller [[Fennville AVA]] and extend as far as {{convert|45|mi|km|0}} inland from the lakeshore; however, the climate and [[glacial moraine]] soils are relatively similar throughout. The \"[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]\" off of [[Lake Michigan]] tempers the northern climate. Lake Michigan Shore AVA has a warmer growing season, as much as two weeks longer than the only other Michigan AVAs, [[Leelanau Peninsula AVA]], and [[Old Mission Peninsula AVA]], both of which are in [[Northern Michigan]].
