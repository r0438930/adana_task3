{"title_page": "Hermitian symmetric space", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Manifold with inversion symmetry}}\n{{Lie groups |Homogeneous spaces}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' is a [[Hermitian manifold]] which at every point has as an inversion symmetry preserving the Hermitian structure. First studied by [[\u00c9lie Cartan]], they form a natural generalization of the notion of [[Riemannian symmetric space]] from [[real manifold]]s to [[complex manifold]]s.\n\nEvery Hermitian symmetric space is a homogeneous space for its isometry group and has a unique decomposition as a product of irreducible spaces and a Euclidean space. The irreducible spaces arise in pairs as a non-compact space that, as [[Armand Borel|Borel]] showed, can be embedded as an open subspace of its compact dual space. [[Harish Chandra]] showed that each non-compact space can be realized as a '''bounded symmetric domain''' in a complex vector space. The simplest case involves the groups SU(2), SU(1,1) and their common complexification SL(2,'''C'''). In this case the non-compact space is the [[unit disk]], a homogeneous space for SU(1,1). It is a bounded domain in the complex plane '''C'''. The one-point compactification of '''C''', the [[Riemann sphere]], is the dual space, a homogeneous space for SU(2) and SL(2,'''C''').\n\nIrreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are exactly the homogeneous spaces of simple compact Lie groups by maximal closed connected subgroups which contain a maximal torus and have center isomorphic to '''T'''.  There is a complete classification of irreducible spaces, with four classical series, studied by Cartan, and two exceptional cases; the classification can be deduced from [[Borel\u2013de Siebenthal theory]], which classifies closed connected subgroups containing a maximal torus. Hermitian symmetric spaces appear in the theory of [[Jordan triple system]]s, [[several complex variables]], [[complex geometry]], [[automorphic form]]s and [[group representation]]s, in particular permitting the construction of the [[holomorphic discrete series representation]]s of semisimple Lie groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|1972}}</ref>\n\n==Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type==\n\n===Definition===\nLet ''H'' be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, \u03c3 an automorphism of ''H'' of order 2 and ''H''<sup>\u03c3</sup> the fixed point subgroup of \u03c3.  Let ''K'' be a closed subgroup of ''H'' lying between ''H''<sup>\u03c3</sup> and its [[identity component]]. The compact homogeneous space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a [[symmetric space|symmetric space of compact type]]. The Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> admits a decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus\\mathfrak{m},}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace of \u03c3 and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> the \u20131 eigenspace. If <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> contains no simple summand of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, the pair (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, \u03c3) is called an [[orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]] of ''compact type''.<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\">{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nAny inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, invariant under the [[adjoint representation]] and \u03c3, induces a Riemannian structure on ''H'' / ''K'', with ''H'' acting by isometries. A canonical example is given by minus the [[Killing form]]. Under such an inner product, <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> are orthogonal. ''H'' / ''K'' is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}\n</ref>\n\nThe symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' if it has an [[almost complex structure]] preserving the Riemannian metric. This is equivalent to the existence of a linear map ''J'' with ''J''<sup>2</sup> = \u2212''I'' on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of ''K''.\n\n===Symmetry and center of isotropy subgroup===\nIf (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>,\u03c3) is Hermitian, ''K'' has non-trivial center and the symmetry \u03c3 is inner, implemented by an element of the center of ''K''.\n\nIn fact ''J'' lies in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and exp ''tJ'' forms a one-parameter group in the center of ''K''.  This follows because if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' lie in  <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>, then by the invariance of the inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math><ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=149\u2013150}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{([[A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=([[C,D],B],A).}</math>\n\nReplacing ''A'' and ''B'' by ''JA'' and ''JB'', it follows that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].}</math>\n\nDefine a linear map \u03b4 on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> by extending ''J'' to be 0 on  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>. The last relation shows that \u03b4 is a derivation of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. Since <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is semisimple, \u03b4 must be an inner derivation, so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\delta(X)=[T + A,X],}</math>\n\nwith ''T'' in  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and ''A'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. Taking ''X'' in  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, it follows that ''A'' = 0 and ''T'' lies in the center of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and hence that ''K'' is non-semisimple. The symmetry \u03c3 is implemented by ''z'' = exp \u03c0''T'' and the almost complex structure by exp \u03c0/2 ''T''.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=261\u2013262}}</ref>\n\nThe innerness of \u03c3 implies that ''K'' contains a maximal torus of ''H'', so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus ''S'' of elements exp ''tT'' is connected, since if ''x'' is any element in ''K'' there is a maximal torus containing ''x'' and ''S'',  which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains ''K'' since ''S'' is central in ''K'' and is contained in ''K'' since ''z'' lies in ''S''. So ''K'' is the centralizer of ''S'' and hence connected. In particular ''K'' contains the center of ''H''.<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\" />\n\n===Irreducible decomposition===\nThe symmetric space or the pair (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, \u03c3) is said to be ''irreducible'' if the adjoint action of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> (or equivalently the identity component of ''H''<sup>\u03c3</sup> or  ''K'') is irreducible on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. This is equivalent to the maximality of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> as a subalgebra.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=378}}</ref>\n\nIn fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras <math>\\mathfrak{l}</math> and ''K''-invariant subspaces \n<math>\\mathfrak{m}_1</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{l}=\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus \\mathfrak{m}_1,\\,\\,\\,\\ \\mathfrak{m}_1=\\mathfrak{l}\\cap \\mathfrak{m}.}</math>\n\nAny orthogonal symmetric algebra  (<math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, \u03c3) of Hermitian type can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras of Hermitian type.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=378\u2013379}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nIn fact <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{h}=\\oplus_{i=1}^N \\mathfrak{h}_i,}</math>\n\neach of which is left invariant by the automorphism \u03c3 and the complex structure ''J'', since they are both inner. The eigenspace decomposition of <math>\\mathfrak{h}_1</math> coincides with its intersections with <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. So the restriction of \u03c3 to <math>\\mathfrak{h}_1</math> is irreducible.\n\nThis decomposition of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' when ''H'' is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup ''H''<sup>\u03c3</sup> is automatically connected. For simply connected ''H'', the symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is the direct product of ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> with ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> simply connected and simple. In the irreducible case, ''K'' is a maximal connected subgroup of ''H''. Since ''K'' acts irreducibly on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> (regarded as a complex space for the complex structure defined by ''J''), the center of ''K'' is a one-dimensional torus '''T''', given by the operators exp ''tT''. Since each ''H'' is simply connected and ''K'' connected, the quotient ''H''/''K'' is simply connected.<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}</ref>\n\n===Complex structure===\n{{Main article|Complex structures on homogeneous spaces}}\nif ''H'' / ''K'' is irreducible with ''K'' non-semisimple, the compact group ''H'' must be simple and ''K'' of maximal rank. From [[Borel-de Siebenthal theory]], the involution \u03c3 is inner and ''K'' is the centralizer of its center, which is isomorphic to '''T'''. In particular ''K'' is connected. It follows that ''H'' / ''K'' is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] ''G'' of ''H'' such that ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P''. In particular there is a complex structure on ''H'' / ''K'' and the action of ''H'' is holomorphic. Since any Hermitian symmetric space is a product of irreducible spaces, the same is true in general.\n\nAt the [[Lie algebra]] level, there is a symmetric decomposition\n:<math>\\mathfrak h = \\mathfrak k\\oplus\\mathfrak m,</math>\nwhere <math>(\\mathfrak m,J)</math> is a real vector space with a complex structure ''J'', whose complex dimension is given in the table. Correspondingly, there is a [[graded Lie algebra]] decomposition\n:<math>\\mathfrak g = \\mathfrak{m}_{+}\\oplus\\mathfrak l\\oplus\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak m\\otimes\\mathbb C= \\mathfrak m_{-}\\oplus\\mathfrak m_{+}</math> is the decomposition into +''i'' and &minus;''i'' eigenspaces of ''J'' and <math>\\mathfrak l=\\mathfrak k\\otimes\\mathbb C</math>. The Lie algebra of ''P'' is the semidirect product <math>\\mathfrak m^{+}\\oplus\\mathfrak l</math>. The complex Lie algebras  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> are Abelian. Indeed, if ''U'' and ''V'' lie in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math>, [''U'',''V''] = ''J''[''U'',''V''] = [''JU'',''JV''] = [\u00b1''iU'',\u00b1''iV''] = \u2013[''U'',''V''], so the Lie bracket must vanish.\n\nThe complex subspaces <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb C}</math> are irreducible for the action of ''K'', since ''J'' commutes with ''K'' so that each is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> with complex structure \u00b1''J''.  Equivalently the centre '''T''' of ''K'' acts on <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> by the identity representation and on <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> by its conjugate.<ref>{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}</ref>\n\nThe realization of ''H''/''K'' as a generalized flag variety ''G''/''P'' is obtained by taking ''G'' as in the table (the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H'') and ''P'' to be the [[parabolic subgroup]] equal to the semidirect product of ''L'', the complexification of ''K'', with the complex Abelian subgroup exp <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math>. (In the language of [[algebraic groups]],  ''L'' is the [[Levi factor]] of ''P''.)\n\n===Classification===\nAny Hermitian symmetric space of compact type is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> with ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> simple, ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> connected of maximal rank with center '''T'''. The irreducible ones are therefore exactly the non-semisimple cases classified by [[Borel\u2013de Siebenthal theory]].<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\" />\n \nAccordingly, the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' are classified as follows.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The corresponding symmetry \u03c3 of the simply connected simple compact Lie group is inner, given by conjugation by the unique element ''S'' in ''Z''(''K'') / ''Z''(''H'') of period 2. For the classical groups, as in the table above, these symmetries are as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=444\u2013447,451\u2013455}}</ref>\n\n*AIII: <math>S=\\begin{pmatrix}-\\alpha I_p & 0\\\\ 0 & \\alpha I_q\\end{pmatrix}</math> in S(U(''p'')\u00d7U(''q'')), where \u03b1<sup>''p''+''q''</sup>=(\u22121)<sup>''p''</sup>.\n*DIII: ''S'' = ''iI'' in U(''n'') \u2282 SO(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to <math>J_n=\\begin{pmatrix}0 &I_n \\\\ -I_n & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>.\n*CI: ''S''=''iI'' in U(''n'') \u2282 Sp(''n'') = Sp(''n'','''C''') \u2229 U(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to ''J''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n*BDI: <math>S=\\begin{pmatrix}I_p & 0\\\\ 0 & -I_2\\end{pmatrix}</math> in SO(''p'')\u00d7SO(2).\n\nThe maximal parabolic subgroup ''P'' can be described explicitly in these classical cases. For AIII\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{P(p,q)= \\begin{pmatrix}A_{pp} & B_{pq}\\\\ 0 & D_{qq}\\end{pmatrix}}</math>\n\nin SL(''p''+''q'','''C'''). ''P''(''p'',''q'') is the stabilizer of a subspace of dimension ''p'' in '''C'''<sup>''p''+''q''</sup>.\n\nThe other groups arise as fixed points of involutions. Let ''J'' be the ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' matrix with 1's on the antidiagonal and 0's elsewhere and set\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & J\\\\ -J & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nThen Sp(''n'','''C''') is the fixed point subgroup of the involution \u03b8(''g'') = ''A'' (''g''<sup>''t''</sup>)<sup>\u22121</sup> ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup> of SL(2''n'','''C'''). SO(''n'','''C''') can be realised as the fixed points of \u03c8(''g'') = ''B'' (''g''<sup>''t''</sup>)<sup>\u22121</sup> ''B''<sup>\u22121</sup> in SL(''n'','''C''') where ''B'' = ''J''. These involutions leave invariant ''P''(''n'',''n'') in the cases DIII and CI and ''P''(''p'',2) in the case BDI. The corresponding parabolic subgroups ''P'' are obtained by taking the fixed points. The compact group ''H'' acts transitively on ''G'' / ''P'', so that ''G'' / ''P'' = ''H'' / ''K''.\n\n==Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type==\n\n===Definition===\nAs with symmetric spaces in general, each compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' has a noncompact dual ''H''<sup>*</sup>/''K'' obtained by replacing ''H'' with the closed real Lie subgroup ''H''<sup>*</sup> of the complex Lie group ''G'' with Lie algebra\n:<math>\\mathfrak h^* = \\mathfrak k \\oplus i\\mathfrak m\\subset\\mathfrak g.</math>\n\n===Borel embedding===\nWhereas the natural map from ''H''/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is an isomorphism, the natural map from ''H''<sup>*</sup>/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is only an inclusion onto an open subset. This inclusion is called the '''Borel embedding''' after [[Armand Borel]]. In fact ''P'' \u2229 ''H'' = ''K'' = ''P'' \u2229 ''H''*. The images of ''H'' and ''H''* have the same dimension so are open. Since the image of ''H'' is compact, so closed, it follows that ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P''.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Borel|1952}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}</ref>\n\n===Cartan decomposition===\nThe polar decomposition in the complex linear group ''G'' implies the Cartan decomposition ''H''* = ''K'' \u22c5 exp <math>i\\mathfrak{m}</math> in ''H''*.<ref>{{harvnb|Dieudonn\u00e9|1977}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, given a maximal Abelian subalgebra <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> in t, ''A'' = exp  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is a toral subgroup such that \u03c3(''a'') = ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> on ''A''; and any two such <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>'s are conjugate by an element of ''K''. A similar statement holds for <math>\\mathfrak{a}^*=i\\mathfrak{a}</math>. Morevoer if ''A''* = exp <math>\\mathfrak{a}^*</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{H^*=KA^*K.}</math>\n\nThese results are special cases of the Cartan decomposition in any Riemannian symmetric space and its dual. The geodesics emanating from the origin in the homogeneous spaces can be identified with one parameter groups with generators in  <math>i\\mathfrak{m}</math> or <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. Similar results hold for in the compact case: ''H''= ''K'' \u22c5 exp <math>i\\mathfrak{m}</math> and ''H'' = ''KAK''.<ref>{{harvnb||Helgason|1978}}</ref>\n\nThe properties of the [[totally geodesic]] subspace ''A'' can be shown directly.  ''A'' is closed because the closure of ''A'' is a toral subgroup satisfying \u03c3(''a'') = ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>, so its Lie algebra lies in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> and hence equals <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> by maximality. ''A'' can be generated topologically by a single element exp ''X'', so  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is the centralizer of ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. In the ''K''-orbit of any element of <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> there is an element ''Y'' such that (X,Ad ''k'' Y) is minimized at ''k'' = 1. Setting ''k'' = exp ''tT'' with ''T'' in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, it follows that (''X'',[''T'',''Y'']) = 0 and hence [''X'',''Y''] = 0, so that ''Y'' must lie in <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>. Thus <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> is the union of the conjugates of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>. In particular some conjugate of ''X'' lies in any other choice of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>, which centralizes that conjugate; so by maximality the only possibilities are conjugates of  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>.\n<ref>{{harvnb||Helgason|1978|p=248}}</ref>\n\nThe decompositions\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{H=KAK,\\,\\,\\,H = K\\cdot \\exp \\mathfrak{m}}</math>\n\ncan be proved directly by applying the [[slice theorem (differential geometry)|slice theorem]] for [[transformation group|compact transformation groups]] to the action of ''K'' on ''H'' / ''K''.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}\n*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=35\u201336}}\n*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=8\u20139}}</ref> In fact the space ''H'' / ''K'' can be identified with\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{M=\\{ \\sigma(g)g^{-1}:g\\in H\\},}</math>\n\na closed submanifold of ''H'', and the Cartan decomposition follows by showing that ''M'' is the union of the ''kAk''<sup>\u22121</sup> for ''k'' in ''K''. Since this union is the continuous image of ''K'' \u00d7 ''A'', it is compact and connected. So it suffices to show that the union is open in ''M'' and for this it is enough to show each ''a'' in ''A'' has an open neighbourhood in this union. Now by computing derivatives at 0, the union contains an open neighbourhood of 1. If ''a'' is central the union is invariant under multiplication by ''a'', so contains an open neighbourhood of ''a''. If ''a'' is not central, write ''a'' = ''b''<sup>2</sup> with ''b'' in ''A''. Then \u03c4 = Ad ''b'' \u2212  Ad ''b''<sup>\u22121</sup> is a skew-adjoint operator on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> anticommuting with \u03c3, which can be regarded as a '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading operator \u03c3 on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. By an [[Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 characteristic]] argument it follows that the superdimension of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> coincides with the superdimension of the kernel of \u03c4. In other words,\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{k} - \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{k}_a = \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{m} - \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{m}_a,}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_a</math> are the subspaces fixed by Ad ''a''. Let the orthogonal complement of  <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a</math> in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> be <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a^\\perp</math>. Computing derivstives it follows that Ad ''e''<sup>''X''</sup> (''a'' ''e''<sup>''Y''</sup>), where ''X'' lies in <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a^\\perp</math> and ''Y'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_a</math>, is an open neighbourhood of ''a'' in the union. Here the terms ''a'' ''e''<sup>''Y''</sup> lie in the union by the argument for central ''a'': indeed ''a'' is in the center of the identity component of the centralizer of ''a'' which is invariant under \u03c3 and contains ''A''.\n\nThe dimension of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is called the '''rank''' of the Hermitian symmetric space.\n\n===Strongly orthogonal roots===\nIn the case of Hermitian symmetric spaces, Harish-Chandra gave a canonical choice for <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>. \nThis choice of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is determined by taking a maximal torus ''T'' of ''H'' in ''K'' with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>. Since the symmetry \u03c3 is implemented by an element of ''T'' lying in the centre of ''H'', the root spaces <math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha</math> in  <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are left invariant by \u03c3. It acts as the identity on those contained in <math>\\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> and minus the identity on those in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math>.\n\nThe roots with root spaces in <math>\\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> \nare called '''compact roots''' and those with root spaces in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> are called '''noncompact roots'''. (This terminology originates from the symmetric space of noncompact type.)   If ''H'' is simple, the generator ''Z'' of the centre of ''K'' can be used to define a set of positive roots, according to the sign of \u03b1(''Z''). With this choice of roots  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> are the direct sum of the root spaces <math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha</math> over positive and negative noncompact roots \u03b1. Root vectors ''E''<sub>\u03b1</sub> can be chosen so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{X_\\alpha=E_\\alpha + E_{-\\alpha}, \\,\\,\\, Y_\\alpha=i(E_\\alpha - E_{-\\alpha})}</math>\n\nlie in <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. The simple roots \u03b1<sub>1</sub>, ...., \u03b1<sub>''n''</sub> are the indecomposable positive roots. These can be numbered so that  \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> vanishes on the center of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> for ''i'', whereas \u03b1<sub>1</sub> does not. Thus \u03b1<sub>1</sub> is the unique noncompact simple root and the other simple roots are compact. Any positive noncompact root then has the form \u03b2 = \u03b1<sub>1</sub> + ''c''<sub>2</sub> \u03b1<sub>2</sub> + \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 +  ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> \u03b1<sub>''n''</sub> with non-negative coefficients ''c''<sub>''i''</sub>. These coefficients lead to a [[lexicographic order]] on positive roots. The coefficient of \u03b1<sub>1</sub> is always one because <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> is irreducible for ''K'' so is spanned by vectors obtained by successively applying the lowering operators ''E''<sub>\u2013\u03b1</sub> for simple compact roots \u03b1.\n\nTwo roots \u03b1 and \u03b2 are said to be '''strongly orthogonal''' if  \u00b1\u03b1 \u00b1\u03b2 are not roots or zero, written  \u03b1 \u2250 \u03b2. The highest positive root \u03c8<sub>1</sub> is noncompact. Take \u03c8<sub>2</sub> to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to \u03c8<sub>1</sub> (for the lexicographic order). Then continue in this way taking \u03c8<sub>''i'' + 1</sub> to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to \u03c8<sub>1</sub>, ..., \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> until the process terminates.

This follows by showing inductively that if ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2260 0, then \u03b1 is strongly orthogonal to \u03c8<sub>1</sub>, \u03c8<sub>2</sub>, ... a contradiction. Indeed, the above relation shows \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> + \u03b1 cannot be a root; and that if \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> \u2013 \u03b1 is a root, then it would necessarily have the form \u03b2 \u2013 \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>.

This result reduces the geometry to products of the prototypic example  involving SL(2,'''C'''), SU(1,1) and SU(2), namely the unit disk inside the Riemann sphere.\n\nIn the case of ''H'' = SU(2) the symmetry \u03c3 is given by conjugation by the diagonal matrix with entries \u00b1''i'' so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\sigma\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta\\\\ -\\overline{\\beta} & \\overline{\\alpha}\\end{pmatrix} = \n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta\\\\ \\overline{\\beta} & \\overline{\\alpha}\\end{pmatrix}}</math>\n\nThe fixed point subgroup is the maximal torus ''T'', the diagonal matrices with entries ''e''<sup> \u00b1''it''</sup>. SU(2) acts on the Riemann sphere <math>\\mathbf{CP}^1</math> transitively by M\u00f6bius transformations and ''T'' is the stabilizer of 0. SL(2,'''C'''), the complexification of SU(2), also acts by M\u00f6bius transformations and the stabiliser of 0 is the subgroup ''B'' of lower triangular matrices. The noncompact subgroup SU(1,1) acts with precisely three orbits: the open unit disk |''z''| < 1; the unit circle ''z'' = 1; and its exterior |''z''| > 1. Thus\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{SU}(1,1)/\\mathbf{T} = \\{z: |z|<1\\} \\,\\,\\, \\subset \\,\\,\\, B_+/\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathbb{C}} = \\mathbb{C}\\,\\,\\, \\subset \\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})/B = \\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},}</math>\n\nwhere ''B''<sub>+</sub>  and ''T''<sub>'''C'''</sub> denote the subgroups of upper triangular and diagonal matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The middle term is the orbit of 0 under the upper unitriangular matrices\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & z\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix} =\\exp \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & z\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nNow for each root \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> there is a homomorphism of \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> of SU(2) into ''H'' which is compatible with the symmetries. It extends uniquely to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''') into ''G''. The images of the Lie algebras for different \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>'s commute since they are strongly orthogonal. Thus there is a homomorphism \u03c0 of the direct product SU(2)<sup>''r''</sup> into ''H'' compatible with the symmetries. It extends to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''')<sup>''r''</sup> into ''G''. The kernel of \u03c0 is contained in the center (\u00b11)<sup>''r''</sup> of SU(2)<sup>''r''</sup> which is fixed pointwise by the symmetry. So the image of the center under \u03c0 lies in ''K''. Thus there is an embedding of the polysphere (SU(2)/T)<sup>''r''</sup> into ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P'' and the polysphere contains the polydisk (SU(1,1)/T)<sup>''r''</sup>. The polysphere and polydisk are the direct product of ''r'' copies of the Riemann sphere and the unit disk. By the Cartan decompositions in SU(2) and SU(1,1), \nthe polysphere is the orbit of ''T''<sub>r</sub>''A'' in ''H'' / ''K'' and the polydisk is the orbit of ''T''<sub>''r''</sub>''A''*, where ''T''<sub>''r''</sub> = \u03c0('''T'''<sup>''r''</sup>) \u2286 ''K''. On the other hand, ''H'' = ''KAK'' and ''H''* = ''K'' ''A''* ''K''.\n\nHence every element in the compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polysphere; and every element in the image  under the Borel embedding of the noncompact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''* / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polydisk.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}\n&{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88\u201394}}</ref>\n\n===Harish-Chandra embedding===\n''H''* / ''K'', the  Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type, lies in the image of <math>\\exp \\mathfrak m_+</math>, a dense open subset of ''H'' / ''K'' biholomorphic to  <math>\\mathfrak m_+</math>. The corresponding domain in <math>\\mathfrak m_+</math> is bounded. This is the '''Harish-Chandra embedding''' named after [[Harish-Chandra]]. \n \nIn fact Harish-Chandra showed the following properties of the space <math>\\mathbf{X}=\\exp (\\mathfrak{m}_+)\\cdot K_{\\mathbb{C}} \\cdot \\exp(\\mathfrak{m}_-)=\\exp (\\mathfrak{m}_+)\\cdot P</math>:\n\n# As a space, '''X''' is the direct product of the three factors.\n# '''X''' is open in ''G''.\n# '''X''' is dense in ''G''.\n# '''X''' contains ''H''*.\n# The closure of ''H''* / ''K'' in '''X''' / ''P'' = <math>\\exp \\mathfrak{m}_+ </math> is compact.\n\nIn fact <math>M_\\pm=\\exp \\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> are complex Abelian groups normalised by ''K''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. Moreover, <math>[\\mathfrak{m}_+,\\mathfrak{m}_-] \\subset \\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathfrak{C}}</math> since <math>[\\mathfrak{m},\\mathfrak{m}] \\subset \\mathfrak{k}</math>.\n\nThis implies ''P'' \u2229 ''M''<sub>+</sub> = {1}. For if ''x'' = ''e''<sup>''X''</sup> with ''X'' in \n<math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> lies in ''P'', it must normalize ''M''<sub>\u2212</sub> and hence <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>. But if ''Y'' lies in  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Y=\\mathrm{Ad}(X)\\cdot Y= Y + [X,Y] + {1\\over 2} [X,[X,Y]]\\in \\mathfrak{m}_+ \\oplus \\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m}_-,}</math>\n\nso that ''X'' commutes with <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>. But if ''X'' commutes with every noncompact root space, it must be 0, so ''x'' = 1. It follows that the multiplication map \u03bc on ''M''<sub>+</sub> \u00d7 ''P'' is injective so (1) follows. Similarly the derivative of \u03bc at (''x'',''p'') is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mu^\\prime(X,Y)=\\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})X + Y =\\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})(X\\oplus\\mathrm{Ad}(p)Y),}</math>\n\nwhich is injective, so (2) follows. For the special case ''H'' = SU(2), ''H''* = SU(1,1) and ''G'' = SL(2,'''C''') the remaining assertions are consequences of the identification with the Riemann sphere, '''C''' and unit disk. They can be applied to the groups defined for each root \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>. By the polysphere and polydisk theorem ''H''*/''K'', '''X'''/''P'' and ''H''/''K'' are the union of the ''K''-translates of the polydisk, '''C'''<sup>''r''</sup> and the polysphere. So ''H''* lies in '''X''', the closure of ''H''*/''K'' is compact in '''X'''/''P'', which is in turn dense in ''H''/''K''.\n\nNote that (2) and (3) are also consequences of the fact that the image of ''X'' in ''G''/''P'' is that of the big cell ''B''<sub>+</sub>''B'' in the [[Complexification (Lie group)#Gauss decomposition|Gauss decomposition]] of ''G''.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=382\u2013396}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|p=281}}\n*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}\n</ref>\n\nUsing results on the [[restricted root system]] of the symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' and ''H''*/''K'', \n[[Robert Hermann (mathematician)|Hermann]] showed that the image of ''H''*/''K'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> is a generalized unit disk. In fact it is the [[convex set]] of ''X'' for which the [[operator norm]] of ad Im ''X'' is less than one.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=284\u2013286}}\n*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|p=98}}</ref>\n\n===Bounded symmetric domains===\nA bounded domain ''&Omega;'' in a complex vector space is said to be a '''bounded symmetric domain''' if for every ''x'' in ''&Omega;'', there is an involutive biholomorphism ''&sigma;''<sub>''x''</sub> of ''&Omega;'' for which ''x'' is an isolated fixed point. The Harish-Chandra embedding exhibits every Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type ''H''* / ''K'' as a bounded symmetric domain. The biholomorphism group of ''H''<sup>*</sup> / ''K'' is equal to its isometry group ''H''<sup>*</sup>.\n\nConversely every bounded symmetric domain arises in this way. Indeed, given a bounded symmetric domain ''&Omega;'', the [[Bergman kernel]] defines a [[Riemannian metric|metric]] on ''&Omega;'', the [[Bergman metric]], for which every biholomorphism is an isometry.

In fact this follows from the [[polar decomposition]] for ''p'' \u00d7 ''p'' matrices.\n* '''Type III'''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub>: for every complex symmetric ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix ''U'' such that ''UMU''<sup>''t''</sup> is diagonal. This is proved by a classical argument of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel|Siegel]]. Take ''V'' unitary so that ''V''*''M''*''MV'' is diagonal. Then ''V''<sup>''t''</sup>''MV'' is symmetric and its real and imaginary parts commute. Since they are real symmetric matrices they can be simultaneously diagonalized by a real orthogonal matrix ''W''. So ''UMU''<sup>''t''</sup> is diagonal if ''U'' = ''WV''<sup>''t''</sup>.\n* '''Type II'''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub>: for every complex skew symmetric ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' matrix ''M'' there is a unitary matrix such that ''UMU''<sup>''t''</sup> is made up of diagonal blocks <math>\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & a\\\\ -a & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math> and one zero if ''n'' is odd. As in Siegel's artgument, this can be reduced to case where the real and imaginary parts of ''M'' commute. Any real skew-symmetric matrix can be reduced to the given [[Skew-symmetric matrix#Spectral theory|canonical form]] by an orthogonal matrix and this can be done simultaneously for commuting matrices.\n* '''Type IV'''<sub>'''''n'''''</sub>: by a transformation in SO(''n'') \u00d7 SO(2) any vector can be transformed so that all but the first two coordinates are non-zero.\n\n===Boundary components===\nThe noncompact group ''H''* acts on the complex Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' = ''G''/''P'' with only finitely many orbits. The orbit structure is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Wolf|1972}}. In particular the closure of the bounded domain ''H''*/''K'' has a unique closed orbit, which is the [[Shilov boundary]] of the domain. In general the orbits are unions of Hermitian symmetric spaces of lower dimension. The complex function theory of the domains, in particular the analogue of the [[Cauchy integral formula]]s, are described for the Cartan domains in {{harvtxt|Hua|1979}}. The closure of the bounded domain is the [[Baily\u2013Borel compactification]] of ''H''*/''K''.<ref>{{harvnb|Borel|Ji|2006|pp=77\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe boundary structure can be described using [[Cayley transform]]s. For each copy of SU(2) defined by one of the noncompact roots \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>, there is a Cayley transform ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> which as a M\u00f6bius transformation maps the unit disk onto the upper half plane. Given a subset ''I'' of indices of the strongly orthogonal family \u03c8<sub>1</sub>, ..., \u03c8<sub>''r''</sub>, the ''partial Cayley transform'' ''c''<sub>''I''</sub> is defined as the product of the ''c''<sub>''i''</sub>'s with ''i'' in ''I'' in the product of the groups \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub>. Let ''G''(''I'') be the centralizer of this product in ''G'' and ''H''*(''I'') = ''H''* \u2229 ''G''(''I''). Since \u03c3 leaves ''H''*(''I'') invariant, there is a corresponding Hermitian symmetric space ''M''<sub>''I''</sub> ''H''*(''I'')/''H''*(''I'')\u2229''K'' \u2282 ''H''*/''K'' = ''M'' . The boundary component for the subset ''I'' is the union of the ''K''-translates of ''c''<sub>''I''</sub> ''M''<sub>''I''</sub>. When ''I'' is the set of all indices, ''M''<sub>''I''</sub> is a single point and the boundary component is the Shilov boundary. Moreover, ''M''<sub>''I''</sub> is in the closure of ''M''<sub>''J''</sub> if and only if ''I'' \u2287 ''J''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=286\u2013293}}</ref>\n\n==Geometric properties==\nEvery Hermitian symmetric space is a [[K\u00e4hler manifold]]. They can be defined equivalently as Riemannian symmetric spaces with a parallel complex structure with respect to which the Riemannian metric is [[Hermitian metric|Hermitian]]. The complex structure is automatically preserved by the isometry group ''H'' of the metric, and so any Hermitian symmetric space ''M'' is a homogeneous complex manifold. Some examples are [[complex vector space]]s and [[complex projective space]]s, with their usual Hermitian metrics and [[Fubini\u2013Study metric]]s, and the complex [[unit ball]]s with suitable metrics so that they become [[Complete metric space|complete]] and Riemannian symmetric. The [[compact space|compact]] Hermitian symmetric spaces are [[projective variety|projective varieties]], and admit a strictly larger [[Lie group]] ''G'' of [[biholomorphism]]s with respect to which they are homogeneous: in fact, they are [[generalized flag manifold]]s, i.e., ''G'' is [[semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] and the stabilizer of a point is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' of ''G''. Among (complex) generalized flag manifolds ''G''/''P'', they are characterized as those for which the [[Nilradical of a Lie algebra|nilradical]] of the Lie algebra of ''P'' is abelian. Thus they are contained within the family of symmetric R-spaces which conversely comprises Hermitian symmetric spaces and their real forms. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded domains in complex vector spaces.\n\n==Jordan algebras==\n{{See also|Mutation (Jordan algebra)|Symmetric cone|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}\nAlthough the classical Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed by ad hoc methods, [[Jordan triple system]]s, or equivalently Jordan pairs, provide a uniform algebraic means of describing all the basic properties connected with a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type and its non-compact dual. This theory is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} and {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} and summarized in {{harvtxt|Satake|1981}}. The development is in the reverse order from that using the structure theory of compact Lie groups. It starting point is the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type realized as a bounded symmetric domain. It can be described in terms of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]]. This Jordan algebra structure can be used to reconstruct the dual Hermitian symmetric space of compact type, including in particular all the associated Lie algebras and Lie groups.\n\nThe theory is easiest to describe when the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric space is of tube type. In that case the space is determined by a simple real Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>\nwith negative definite Killing form. It must admit an action of SU(2) which only acts via the trivial and adjoint representation, both types occurring. Since <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is simple, this action is inner, so implemented by an inclusion of the Lie algebra of SU(2) in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. The complexification of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> decomposes as a direct sum of three eigenspaces for the diagonal matrices in SU(2). It is a three-graded complex Lie algebra, with the Weyl group element of SU(2) providing the involution. Each of the \u00b11 eigenspaces has the structure of a unital complex Jordan algebra explicitly arising as the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra. It can be identified with the multiplicity space of the adjoint representation  of SU(2) in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThe description of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type starts from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E''. It admits [[Jordan frame (Jordan algebra)|Jordan frames]], i.e. sets of orthogonal minimal idempotents ''e''<sub>''1''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''m''</sub>. Any two are related by an automorphism of ''E'', so that the integer ''m'' is an invariant called the '''rank''' of ''E''. Moreover, if ''A'' is the complexification of ''E'', it has a unitary [[structure group (Jordan algebra)|structure group]]. It is a subgroup of GL(''A'') preserving the natural complex inner product on ''A''. Any element ''a'' in ''A'' has a polar decomposition {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' \u2211 \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with  {{math|1=\u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> \u2265 0}}. The spectral norm is defined by ||a|| = sup \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub>. The associated [[bounded symmetric domain]] is just the open unit ball ''D'' in ''A''. There is a biholomorphism between ''D'' and the tube domain ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC'' where ''C'' is the open self-dual convex cone of elements in ''E'' of the form {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' \u2211 \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with ''u'' an automorphism of ''E'' and \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> > 0. This gives two descriptions of the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. There is a natural way of using [[mutation (Jordan algebra)|mutations]] of the Jordan algebra ''A'' to compactify the space ''A''. The compactification ''X'' is a complex manifold and the finite-dimensional Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> of holomorphic vector fields on ''X'' can be determined explicitly. One parameter groups of biholomorphisms can be defined such that the corresponding holomorphic vector fields span <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. This includes the group of all complex M\u00f6bius transformations corresponding to matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The subgroup SU(1,1) leaves invariant the unit ball and its closure. The subgroup SL(2,'''R''') leaves invariant the tube domain and its closure. The usual Cayley transform and its inverse, mapping the unit disk in '''C''' to the upper half plane, establishes analogous maps between ''D'' and ''T''. The polydisk corresponds to the real and complex Jordan subalgebras generated by a fixed Jordan frame. It admits a transitive action of SU(2)<sup>''m''</sup> and this action extends to ''X''. The group ''G'' generated by the one-parameter groups of biholomorphisms acts faithfully on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. The subgroup generated by the identity component ''K'' of the unitary structure group and the operators in SU(2)<sup>''m''</sup>. It defines a compact Lie group ''H'' which acts transitively on ''X''. Thus ''H'' / ''K'' is the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. The group ''G'' can be identified with the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H''. The subgroup ''H''* leaving ''D'' invariant is a  noncompact real form of ''G''. It acts transitively on ''D'' so that ''H''* / ''K'' is the dual Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. The inclusions ''D'' \u2282 ''A'' \u2282 ''X'' reproduce the Borel and Harish-Chandra embeddings. The classification of Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type reduces to that of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. These were classified by {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}} in terms of [[Euclidean Hurwitz algebra]]s, a special type of [[composition algebra]].\n\nIn general a Hermitian symmetric space gives rise to a 3-graded Lie algebra with a period 2 conjugate linear automorphism switching the parts of degree \u00b11 and preserving the degree 0 part. This gives rise to the structure of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]], to which {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} extended the theory of Jordan algebras. All irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed uniformly within this framework. {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} constructed the irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of non-tube type from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra together with a period 2 automorphism. The \u22121 eigenspace of the automorphism has the structure of a Jordan pair, which can be deduced from that of the larger Jordan algebra. In the non-tube type case corresponding to a [[Siegel domain]] of type II, there is no distinguished subgroup of real or complex M\u00f6bius transformations.

This contains a detailed account of Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type.\n\n[[Category:Differential geometry]]\n[[Category:Complex manifolds]]\n[[Category:Riemannian geometry]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Homogeneous spaces]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Manifold with inversion symmetry}}\n{{Lie groups |Homogeneous spaces}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' is a [[Hermitian manifold]] which at every point has as an inversion symmetry preserving the Hermitian structure. First studied by [[\u00c9lie Cartan]], they form a natural generalization of the notion of [[Riemannian symmetric space]] from [[real manifold]]s to [[complex manifold]]s.\n\nEvery Hermitian symmetric space is a homogeneous space for its isometry group and has a unique decomposition as a product of irreducible spaces and a Euclidean space. The irreducible spaces arise in pairs as a non-compact space that, as [[Armand Borel|Borel]] showed, can be embedded as an open subspace of its compact dual space. [[Harish Chandra]] showed that each non-compact space can be realized as a '''bounded symmetric domain''' in a complex vector space. The simplest case involves the groups SU(2), SU(1,1) and their common complexification SL(2,'''C'''). In this case the non-compact space is the [[unit disk]], a homogeneous space for SU(1,1). It is a bounded domain in the complex plane '''C'''. The one-point compactification of '''C''', the [[Riemann sphere]], is the dual space, a homogeneous space for SU(2) and SL(2,'''C''').\n\nIrreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are exactly the homogeneous spaces of simple compact Lie groups by maximal closed connected subgroups which contain a maximal torus and have center isomorphic to '''T'''.  There is a complete classification of irreducible spaces, with four classical series, studied by Cartan, and two exceptional cases; the classification can be deduced from [[Borel\u2013de Siebenthal theory]], which classifies closed connected subgroups containing a maximal torus. Hermitian symmetric spaces appear in the theory of [[Jordan triple system]]s, [[several complex variables]], [[complex geometry]], [[automorphic form]]s and [[group representation]]s, in particular permitting the construction of the [[holomorphic discrete series representation]]s of semisimple Lie groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|1972}}</ref>\n\n==Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type==\n\n===Definition===\nLet ''H'' be a connected compact semisimple Lie group, \u03c3 an automorphism of ''H'' of order 2 and ''H''<sup>\u03c3</sup> the fixed point subgroup of \u03c3.  Let ''K'' be a closed subgroup of ''H'' lying between ''H''<sup>\u03c3</sup> and its [[identity component]]. The compact homogeneous space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a [[symmetric space|symmetric space of compact type]]. The Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> admits a decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus\\mathfrak{m},}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace of \u03c3 and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> the \u20131 eigenspace. If <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> contains no simple summand of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, the pair (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, \u03c3) is called an [[orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]] of ''compact type''.<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\">{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nAny inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, invariant under the [[adjoint representation]] and \u03c3, induces a Riemannian structure on ''H'' / ''K'', with ''H'' acting by isometries. A canonical example is given by minus the [[Killing form]]. Under such an inner product, <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> are orthogonal. ''H'' / ''K'' is then a Riemannian symmetric space of compact type.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}\n</ref>\n\nThe symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is called a '''Hermitian symmetric space''' if it has an [[almost complex structure]] preserving the Riemannian metric. This is equivalent to the existence of a linear map ''J'' with ''J''<sup>2</sup> = \u2212''I'' on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of ''K''.\n\n===Symmetry and center of isotropy subgroup===\nIf (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>,\u03c3) is Hermitian, ''K'' has non-trivial center and the symmetry \u03c3 is inner, implemented by an element of the center of ''K''.\n\nIn fact ''J'' lies in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and exp ''tJ'' forms a one-parameter group in the center of ''K''.  This follows because if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' lie in  <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>, then by the invariance of the inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math><ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=149\u2013150}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{([[A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=([[C,D],B],A).}</math>\n\nReplacing ''A'' and ''B'' by ''JA'' and ''JB'', it follows that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].}</math>\n\nDefine a linear map \u03b4 on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> by extending ''J'' to be 0 on  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>. The last relation shows that \u03b4 is a derivation of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. Since <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is semisimple, \u03b4 must be an inner derivation, so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\delta(X)=[T + A,X],}</math>\n\nwith ''T'' in  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and ''A'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. Taking ''X'' in  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, it follows that ''A'' = 0 and ''T'' lies in the center of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and hence that ''K'' is non-semisimple. The symmetry \u03c3 is implemented by ''z'' = exp \u03c0''T'' and the almost complex structure by exp \u03c0/2 ''T''.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=261\u2013262}}</ref>\n\nThe innerness of \u03c3 implies that ''K'' contains a maximal torus of ''H'', so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus ''S'' of elements exp ''tT'' is connected, since if ''x'' is any element in ''K'' there is a maximal torus containing ''x'' and ''S'',  which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains ''K'' since ''S'' is central in ''K'' and is contained in ''K'' since ''z'' lies in ''S''. So ''K'' is the centralizer of ''S'' and hence connected. In particular ''K'' contains the center of ''H''.<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\" />\n\n===Irreducible decomposition===\nThe symmetric space or the pair (<math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, \u03c3) is said to be ''irreducible'' if the adjoint action of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> (or equivalently the identity component of ''H''<sup>\u03c3</sup> or  ''K'') is irreducible on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. This is equivalent to the maximality of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> as a subalgebra.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|p=378}}</ref>\n\nIn fact there is a one-one correspondence between intermediate subalgebras <math>\\mathfrak{l}</math> and ''K''-invariant subspaces \n<math>\\mathfrak{m}_1</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{l}=\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus \\mathfrak{m}_1,\\,\\,\\,\\ \\mathfrak{m}_1=\\mathfrak{l}\\cap \\mathfrak{m}.}</math>\n\nAny orthogonal symmetric algebra  (<math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, \u03c3) of Hermitian type can be decomposed as an (orthogonal) direct sum of irreducible orthogonal symmetric algebras of Hermitian type.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=378\u2013379}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nIn fact <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> can be written as a direct sum of simple algebras\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{h}=\\oplus_{i=1}^N \\mathfrak{h}_i,}</math>\n\neach of which is left invariant by the automorphism \u03c3 and the complex structure ''J'', since they are both inner. The eigenspace decomposition of <math>\\mathfrak{h}_1</math> coincides with its intersections with <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. So the restriction of \u03c3 to <math>\\mathfrak{h}_1</math> is irreducible.\n\nThis decomposition of the orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra yields a direct product decomposition of the corresponding compact symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' when ''H'' is simply connected. In this case the fixed point subgroup ''H''<sup>\u03c3</sup> is automatically connected. For simply connected ''H'', the symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is the direct product of ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> with ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> simply connected and simple. In the irreducible case, ''K'' is a maximal connected subgroup of ''H''. Since ''K'' acts irreducibly on <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> (regarded as a complex space for the complex structure defined by ''J''), the center of ''K'' is a one-dimensional torus '''T''', given by the operators exp ''tT''. Since each ''H'' is simply connected and ''K'' connected, the quotient ''H''/''K'' is simply connected.<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}</ref>\n\n===Complex structure===\n{{Main article|Complex structures on homogeneous spaces}}\nif ''H'' / ''K'' is irreducible with ''K'' non-semisimple, the compact group ''H'' must be simple and ''K'' of maximal rank. From [[Borel-de Siebenthal theory]], the involution \u03c3 is inner and ''K'' is the centralizer of its center, which is isomorphic to '''T'''. In particular ''K'' is connected. It follows that ''H'' / ''K'' is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] ''G'' of ''H'' such that ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P''. In particular there is a complex structure on ''H'' / ''K'' and the action of ''H'' is holomorphic. Since any Hermitian symmetric space is a product of irreducible spaces, the same is true in general.\n\nAt the [[Lie algebra]] level, there is a symmetric decomposition\n:<math>\\mathfrak h = \\mathfrak k\\oplus\\mathfrak m,</math>\nwhere <math>(\\mathfrak m,J)</math> is a real vector space with a complex structure ''J'', whose complex dimension is given in the table. Correspondingly, there is a [[graded Lie algebra]] decomposition\n:<math>\\mathfrak g = \\mathfrak{m}_{+}\\oplus\\mathfrak l\\oplus\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak m\\otimes\\mathbb C= \\mathfrak m_{-}\\oplus\\mathfrak m_{+}</math> is the decomposition into +''i'' and &minus;''i'' eigenspaces of ''J'' and <math>\\mathfrak l=\\mathfrak k\\otimes\\mathbb C</math>. The Lie algebra of ''P'' is the semidirect product <math>\\mathfrak m^{+}\\oplus\\mathfrak l</math>. The complex Lie algebras  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> are Abelian. Indeed, if ''U'' and ''V'' lie in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math>, [''U'',''V''] = ''J''[''U'',''V''] = [''JU'',''JV''] = [\u00b1''iU'',\u00b1''iV''] = \u2013[''U'',''V''], so the Lie bracket must vanish.\n\nThe complex subspaces <math>\\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb C}</math> are irreducible for the action of ''K'', since ''J'' commutes with ''K'' so that each is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> with complex structure \u00b1''J''.  Equivalently the centre '''T''' of ''K'' acts on <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> by the identity representation and on <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> by its conjugate.<ref>{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}</ref>\n\nThe realization of ''H''/''K'' as a generalized flag variety ''G''/''P'' is obtained by taking ''G'' as in the table (the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H'') and ''P'' to be the [[parabolic subgroup]] equal to the semidirect product of ''L'', the complexification of ''K'', with the complex Abelian subgroup exp <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math>. (In the language of [[algebraic groups]],  ''L'' is the [[Levi factor]] of ''P''.)\n\n===Classification===\nAny Hermitian symmetric space of compact type is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> with ''H''<sub>''i''</sub> simple, ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> connected of maximal rank with center '''T'''. The irreducible ones are therefore exactly the non-semisimple cases classified by [[Borel\u2013de Siebenthal theory]].<ref name=\"Wolf-2010\" />\n \nAccordingly, the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' are classified as follows.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The corresponding symmetry \u03c3 of the simply connected simple compact Lie group is inner, given by conjugation by the unique element ''S'' in ''Z''(''K'') / ''Z''(''H'') of period 2. For the classical groups, as in the table above, these symmetries are as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=444\u2013447,451\u2013455}}</ref>\n\n*AIII: <math>S=\\begin{pmatrix}-\\alpha I_p & 0\\\\ 0 & \\alpha I_q\\end{pmatrix}</math> in S(U(''p'')\u00d7U(''q'')), where \u03b1<sup>''p''+''q''</sup>=(\u22121)<sup>''p''</sup>.\n*DIII: ''S'' = ''iI'' in U(''n'') \u2282 SO(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to <math>J_n=\\begin{pmatrix}0 &I_n \\\\ -I_n & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>.\n*CI: ''S''=''iI'' in U(''n'') \u2282 Sp(''n'') = Sp(''n'','''C''') \u2229 U(2''n''); this choice is equivalent to ''J''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n*BDI: <math>S=\\begin{pmatrix}I_p & 0\\\\ 0 & -I_2\\end{pmatrix}</math> in SO(''p'')\u00d7SO(2).\n\nThe maximal parabolic subgroup ''P'' can be described explicitly in these classical cases. For AIII\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{P(p,q)= \\begin{pmatrix}A_{pp} & B_{pq}\\\\ 0 & D_{qq}\\end{pmatrix}}</math>\n\nin SL(''p''+''q'','''C'''). ''P''(''p'',''q'') is the stabilizer of a subspace of dimension ''p'' in '''C'''<sup>''p''+''q''</sup>.\n\nThe other groups arise as fixed points of involutions. Let ''J'' be the ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' matrix with 1's on the antidiagonal and 0's elsewhere and set\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & J\\\\ -J & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nThen Sp(''n'','''C''') is the fixed point subgroup of the involution \u03b8(''g'') = ''A'' (''g''<sup>''t''</sup>)<sup>\u22121</sup> ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup> of SL(2''n'','''C'''). SO(''n'','''C''') can be realised as the fixed points of \u03c8(''g'') = ''B'' (''g''<sup>''t''</sup>)<sup>\u22121</sup> ''B''<sup>\u22121</sup> in SL(''n'','''C''') where ''B'' = ''J''. These involutions leave invariant ''P''(''n'',''n'') in the cases DIII and CI and ''P''(''p'',2) in the case BDI. The corresponding parabolic subgroups ''P'' are obtained by taking the fixed points. The compact group ''H'' acts transitively on ''G'' / ''P'', so that ''G'' / ''P'' = ''H'' / ''K''.\n\n==Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type==\n\n===Definition===\nAs with symmetric spaces in general, each compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''/''K'' has a noncompact dual ''H''<sup>*</sup>/''K'' obtained by replacing ''H'' with the closed real Lie subgroup ''H''<sup>*</sup> of the complex Lie group ''G'' with Lie algebra\n:<math>\\mathfrak h^* = \\mathfrak k \\oplus i\\mathfrak m\\subset\\mathfrak g.</math>\n\n===Borel embedding===\nWhereas the natural map from ''H''/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is an isomorphism, the natural map from ''H''<sup>*</sup>/''K'' to ''G''/''P'' is only an inclusion onto an open subset.

''A'' is closed because the closure of ''A'' is a toral subgroup satisfying \u03c3(''a'') = ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>, so its Lie algebra lies in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> and hence equals <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> by maximality. ''A'' can be generated topologically by a single element exp ''X'', so  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is the centralizer of ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. In the ''K''-orbit of any element of <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> there is an element ''Y'' such that (X,Ad ''k'' Y) is minimized at ''k'' = 1. Setting ''k'' = exp ''tT'' with ''T'' in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, it follows that (''X'',[''T'',''Y'']) = 0 and hence [''X'',''Y''] = 0, so that ''Y'' must lie in <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>.

Since this union is the continuous image of ''K'' \u00d7 ''A'', it is compact and connected. So it suffices to show that the union is open in ''M'' and for this it is enough to show each ''a'' in ''A'' has an open neighbourhood in this union. Now by computing derivatives at 0, the union contains an open neighbourhood of 1. If ''a'' is central the union is invariant under multiplication by ''a'', so contains an open neighbourhood of ''a''. If ''a'' is not central, write ''a'' = ''b''<sup>2</sup> with ''b'' in ''A''. Then \u03c4 = Ad ''b'' \u2212  Ad ''b''<sup>\u22121</sup> is a skew-adjoint operator on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> anticommuting with \u03c3, which can be regarded as a '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading operator \u03c3 on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. By an [[Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 characteristic]] argument it follows that the superdimension of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> coincides with the superdimension of the kernel of \u03c4. In other words,\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{k} - \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{k}_a = \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{m} - \\mathrm{dim} \\,\\mathfrak{m}_a,}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_a</math> are the subspaces fixed by Ad ''a''. Let the orthogonal complement of  <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a</math> in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> be <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a^\\perp</math>. Computing derivstives it follows that Ad ''e''<sup>''X''</sup> (''a'' ''e''<sup>''Y''</sup>), where ''X'' lies in <math>\\mathfrak{k}_a^\\perp</math> and ''Y'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_a</math>, is an open neighbourhood of ''a'' in the union. Here the terms ''a'' ''e''<sup>''Y''</sup> lie in the union by the argument for central ''a'': indeed ''a'' is in the center of the identity component of the centralizer of ''a'' which is invariant under \u03c3 and contains ''A''.\n\nThe dimension of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is called the '''rank''' of the Hermitian symmetric space.\n\n===Strongly orthogonal roots===\nIn the case of Hermitian symmetric spaces, Harish-Chandra gave a canonical choice for <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>. \nThis choice of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is determined by taking a maximal torus ''T'' of ''H'' in ''K'' with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>. Since the symmetry \u03c3 is implemented by an element of ''T'' lying in the centre of ''H'', the root spaces <math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha</math> in  <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are left invariant by \u03c3. It acts as the identity on those contained in <math>\\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> and minus the identity on those in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math>.\n\nThe roots with root spaces in <math>\\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> \nare called '''compact roots''' and those with root spaces in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_{\\mathbb{C}}</math> are called '''noncompact roots'''. (This terminology originates from the symmetric space of noncompact type.)   If ''H'' is simple, the generator ''Z'' of the centre of ''K'' can be used to define a set of positive roots, according to the sign of \u03b1(''Z''). With this choice of roots  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> are the direct sum of the root spaces <math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha</math> over positive and negative noncompact roots \u03b1. Root vectors ''E''<sub>\u03b1</sub> can be chosen so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{X_\\alpha=E_\\alpha + E_{-\\alpha}, \\,\\,\\, Y_\\alpha=i(E_\\alpha - E_{-\\alpha})}</math>\n\nlie in <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. The simple roots \u03b1<sub>1</sub>, ...., \u03b1<sub>''n''</sub> are the indecomposable positive roots. These can be numbered so that  \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> vanishes on the center of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> for ''i'', whereas \u03b1<sub>1</sub> does not. Thus \u03b1<sub>1</sub> is the unique noncompact simple root and the other simple roots are compact. Any positive noncompact root then has the form \u03b2 = \u03b1<sub>1</sub> + ''c''<sub>2</sub> \u03b1<sub>2</sub> + \u22c5\u22c5\u22c5 +  ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> \u03b1<sub>''n''</sub> with non-negative coefficients ''c''<sub>''i''</sub>. These coefficients lead to a [[lexicographic order]] on positive roots. The coefficient of \u03b1<sub>1</sub> is always one because <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math> is irreducible for ''K'' so is spanned by vectors obtained by successively applying the lowering operators ''E''<sub>\u2013\u03b1</sub> for simple compact roots \u03b1.\n\nTwo roots \u03b1 and \u03b2 are said to be '''strongly orthogonal''' if  \u00b1\u03b1 \u00b1\u03b2 are not roots or zero, written  \u03b1 \u2250 \u03b2. The highest positive root \u03c8<sub>1</sub> is noncompact. Take \u03c8<sub>2</sub> to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to \u03c8<sub>1</sub> (for the lexicographic order). Then continue in this way taking \u03c8<sub>''i'' + 1</sub> to be the highest noncompact positive root strongly orthogonal to \u03c8<sub>1</sub>, ..., \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> until the process terminates. The corresponding vectors\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{X_i= E_{\\psi_i} + E_{-\\psi_i}}</math>\n\nlie in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> and commute by strong orthogonality. Their span <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is Harish-Chandra's canonical maximal Abelian subalgebra.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=375\u2013387}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}\n*{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88\u201394}}</ref> (As Sugiura later showed, having fixed ''T'', the set of strongly orthogonal roots is uniquely determined up to applying an element in the Weyl group of ''K''.<ref>{{harvnb|Agaoka|Kaneda|2002}}</ref>)\n\nMaximality can be checked by showing that if\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[\\sum c_\\alpha E_\\alpha + \\overline{c_\\alpha}E_{-\\alpha}, E_{\\psi_i} + E_{-\\psi_i}]=0}</math>\n\nfor all ''i'', then ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub> = 0 for all positive noncompact roots \u03b1  different from the \u03c8<sub>''j''</sub>'s. This follows by showing inductively that if ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2260 0, then \u03b1 is strongly orthogonal to \u03c8<sub>1</sub>, \u03c8<sub>2</sub>, ... a contradiction. Indeed, the above relation shows \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> + \u03b1 cannot be a root; and that if \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> \u2013 \u03b1 is a root, then it would necessarily have the form \u03b2 \u2013 \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>. If \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> \u2013 \u03b1 were negative, then \u03b1 would be a higher positive root than  \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>, strongly orthogonal to the \u03c8<sub>''j''</sub> with ''j'' < ''i'', which is not possible; similarly if  \u03b2 \u2013 \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> were positive.\n\n===Polysphere and polydisk theorem===\nHarish-Chandra's canonical choice of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> leads to a polydisk and polysphere theorem in ''H''*/''K'' and ''H''/''K''. This result reduces the geometry to products of the prototypic example  involving SL(2,'''C'''), SU(1,1) and SU(2), namely the unit disk inside the Riemann sphere.\n\nIn the case of ''H'' = SU(2) the symmetry \u03c3 is given by conjugation by the diagonal matrix with entries \u00b1''i'' so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\sigma\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta\\\\ -\\overline{\\beta} & \\overline{\\alpha}\\end{pmatrix} = \n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & -\\beta\\\\ \\overline{\\beta} & \\overline{\\alpha}\\end{pmatrix}}</math>\n\nThe fixed point subgroup is the maximal torus ''T'', the diagonal matrices with entries ''e''<sup> \u00b1''it''</sup>. SU(2) acts on the Riemann sphere <math>\\mathbf{CP}^1</math> transitively by M\u00f6bius transformations and ''T'' is the stabilizer of 0. SL(2,'''C'''), the complexification of SU(2), also acts by M\u00f6bius transformations and the stabiliser of 0 is the subgroup ''B'' of lower triangular matrices. The noncompact subgroup SU(1,1) acts with precisely three orbits: the open unit disk |''z''| < 1; the unit circle ''z'' = 1; and its exterior |''z''| > 1. Thus\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{SU}(1,1)/\\mathbf{T} = \\{z: |z|<1\\} \\,\\,\\, \\subset \\,\\,\\, B_+/\\mathbf{T}_{\\mathbb{C}} = \\mathbb{C}\\,\\,\\, \\subset \\,\\,\\,\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})/B = \\mathbb{C}\\cup\\{\\infty\\},}</math>\n\nwhere ''B''<sub>+</sub>  and ''T''<sub>'''C'''</sub> denote the subgroups of upper triangular and diagonal matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The middle term is the orbit of 0 under the upper unitriangular matrices\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & z\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix} =\\exp \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & z\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nNow for each root \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> there is a homomorphism of \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> of SU(2) into ''H'' which is compatible with the symmetries. It extends uniquely to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''') into ''G''. The images of the Lie algebras for different \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>'s commute since they are strongly orthogonal. Thus there is a homomorphism \u03c0 of the direct product SU(2)<sup>''r''</sup> into ''H'' compatible with the symmetries. It extends to a homomorphism of SL(2,'''C''')<sup>''r''</sup> into ''G''. The kernel of \u03c0 is contained in the center (\u00b11)<sup>''r''</sup> of SU(2)<sup>''r''</sup> which is fixed pointwise by the symmetry. So the image of the center under \u03c0 lies in ''K''. Thus there is an embedding of the polysphere (SU(2)/T)<sup>''r''</sup> into ''H'' / ''K'' = ''G'' / ''P'' and the polysphere contains the polydisk (SU(1,1)/T)<sup>''r''</sup>. The polysphere and polydisk are the direct product of ''r'' copies of the Riemann sphere and the unit disk. By the Cartan decompositions in SU(2) and SU(1,1), \nthe polysphere is the orbit of ''T''<sub>r</sub>''A'' in ''H'' / ''K'' and the polydisk is the orbit of ''T''<sub>''r''</sub>''A''*, where ''T''<sub>''r''</sub> = \u03c0('''T'''<sup>''r''</sup>) \u2286 ''K''. On the other hand, ''H'' = ''KAK'' and ''H''* = ''K'' ''A''* ''K''.\n\nHence every element in the compact Hermitian symmetric space ''H'' / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polysphere; and every element in the image  under the Borel embedding of the noncompact Hermitian symmetric space ''H''* / ''K'' is in the ''K''-orbit of a point in the polydisk.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}\n&{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=88\u201394}}</ref>\n\n===Harish-Chandra embedding===\n''H''* / ''K'', the  Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type, lies in the image of <math>\\exp \\mathfrak m_+</math>, a dense open subset of ''H'' / ''K'' biholomorphic to  <math>\\mathfrak m_+</math>. The corresponding domain in <math>\\mathfrak m_+</math> is bounded. This is the '''Harish-Chandra embedding''' named after [[Harish-Chandra]]. \n \nIn fact Harish-Chandra showed the following properties of the space <math>\\mathbf{X}=\\exp (\\mathfrak{m}_+)\\cdot K_{\\mathbb{C}} \\cdot \\exp(\\mathfrak{m}_-)=\\exp (\\mathfrak{m}_+)\\cdot P</math>:\n\n# As a space, '''X''' is the direct product of the three factors.\n# '''X''' is open in ''G''.\n# '''X''' is dense in ''G''.\n# '''X''' contains ''H''*.\n# The closure of ''H''* / ''K'' in '''X''' / ''P'' = <math>\\exp \\mathfrak{m}_+ </math> is compact.\n\nIn fact <math>M_\\pm=\\exp \\mathfrak{m}_\\pm</math> are complex Abelian groups normalised by ''K''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. Moreover, <math>[\\mathfrak{m}_+,\\mathfrak{m}_-] \\subset \\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathfrak{C}}</math> since <math>[\\mathfrak{m},\\mathfrak{m}] \\subset \\mathfrak{k}</math>.\n\nThis implies ''P'' \u2229 ''M''<sub>+</sub> = {1}. For if ''x'' = ''e''<sup>''X''</sup> with ''X'' in \n<math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> lies in ''P'', it must normalize ''M''<sub>\u2212</sub> and hence <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>. But if ''Y'' lies in  <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Y=\\mathrm{Ad}(X)\\cdot Y= Y + [X,Y] + {1\\over 2} [X,[X,Y]]\\in \\mathfrak{m}_+ \\oplus \\mathfrak{k}_{\\mathbb{C}} \\oplus \\mathfrak{m}_-,}</math>\n\nso that ''X'' commutes with <math>\\mathfrak{m}_-</math>. But if ''X'' commutes with every noncompact root space, it must be 0, so ''x'' = 1. It follows that the multiplication map \u03bc on ''M''<sub>+</sub> \u00d7 ''P'' is injective so (1) follows. Similarly the derivative of \u03bc at (''x'',''p'') is\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mu^\\prime(X,Y)=\\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})X + Y =\\mathrm{Ad}(p^{-1})(X\\oplus\\mathrm{Ad}(p)Y),}</math>\n\nwhich is injective, so (2) follows. For the special case ''H'' = SU(2), ''H''* = SU(1,1) and ''G'' = SL(2,'''C''') the remaining assertions are consequences of the identification with the Riemann sphere, '''C''' and unit disk. They can be applied to the groups defined for each root \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>. By the polysphere and polydisk theorem ''H''*/''K'', '''X'''/''P'' and ''H''/''K'' are the union of the ''K''-translates of the polydisk, '''C'''<sup>''r''</sup> and the polysphere. So ''H''* lies in '''X''', the closure of ''H''*/''K'' is compact in '''X'''/''P'', which is in turn dense in ''H''/''K''.\n\nNote that (2) and (3) are also consequences of the fact that the image of ''X'' in ''G''/''P'' is that of the big cell ''B''<sub>+</sub>''B'' in the [[Complexification (Lie group)#Gauss decomposition|Gauss decomposition]] of ''G''.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=382\u2013396}}\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|p=281}}\n*{{harvnb|Mok|1989}}\n</ref>\n\nUsing results on the [[restricted root system]] of the symmetric spaces ''H''/''K'' and ''H''*/''K'', \n[[Robert Hermann (mathematician)|Hermann]] showed that the image of ''H''*/''K'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}_+</math> is a generalized unit disk.

This is proved by a classical argument of [[Carl Ludwig Siegel|Siegel]]. Take ''V'' unitary so that ''V''*''M''*''MV'' is diagonal. Then ''V''<sup>''t''</sup>''MV'' is symmetric and its real and imaginary parts commute.

The orbit structure is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Wolf|1972}}. In particular the closure of the bounded domain ''H''*/''K'' has a unique closed orbit, which is the [[Shilov boundary]] of the domain. In general the orbits are unions of Hermitian symmetric spaces of lower dimension. The complex function theory of the domains, in particular the analogue of the [[Cauchy integral formula]]s, are described for the Cartan domains in {{harvtxt|Hua|1979}}. The closure of the bounded domain is the [[Baily\u2013Borel compactification]] of ''H''*/''K''.<ref>{{harvnb|Borel|Ji|2006|pp=77\u201391}}</ref>\n\nThe boundary structure can be described using [[Cayley transform]]s. For each copy of SU(2) defined by one of the noncompact roots \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>, there is a Cayley transform ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> which as a M\u00f6bius transformation maps the unit disk onto the upper half plane. Given a subset ''I'' of indices of the strongly orthogonal family \u03c8<sub>1</sub>, ..., \u03c8<sub>''r''</sub>, the ''partial Cayley transform'' ''c''<sub>''I''</sub> is defined as the product of the ''c''<sub>''i''</sub>'s with ''i'' in ''I'' in the product of the groups \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub>.

The boundary component for the subset ''I'' is the union of the ''K''-translates of ''c''<sub>''I''</sub> ''M''<sub>''I''</sub>. When ''I'' is the set of all indices, ''M''<sub>''I''</sub> is a single point and the boundary component is the Shilov boundary. Moreover, ''M''<sub>''I''</sub> is in the closure of ''M''<sub>''J''</sub> if and only if ''I'' \u2287 ''J''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|1972|pp=286\u2013293}}</ref>\n\n==Geometric properties==\nEvery Hermitian symmetric space is a [[K\u00e4hler manifold]]. They can be defined equivalently as Riemannian symmetric spaces with a parallel complex structure with respect to which the Riemannian metric is [[Hermitian metric|Hermitian]]. The complex structure is automatically preserved by the isometry group ''H'' of the metric, and so any Hermitian symmetric space ''M'' is a homogeneous complex manifold. Some examples are [[complex vector space]]s and [[complex projective space]]s, with their usual Hermitian metrics and [[Fubini\u2013Study metric]]s, and the complex [[unit ball]]s with suitable metrics so that they become [[Complete metric space|complete]] and Riemannian symmetric. The [[compact space|compact]] Hermitian symmetric spaces are [[projective variety|projective varieties]], and admit a strictly larger [[Lie group]] ''G'' of [[biholomorphism]]s with respect to which they are homogeneous: in fact, they are [[generalized flag manifold]]s, i.e., ''G'' is [[semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] and the stabilizer of a point is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' of ''G''. Among (complex) generalized flag manifolds ''G''/''P'', they are characterized as those for which the [[Nilradical of a Lie algebra|nilradical]] of the Lie algebra of ''P'' is abelian. Thus they are contained within the family of symmetric R-spaces which conversely comprises Hermitian symmetric spaces and their real forms. The non-compact Hermitian symmetric spaces can be realized as bounded [[domain (mathematics)|domains]] in complex vector spaces.\n\n==Jordan algebras==\n{{See also|Mutation (Jordan algebra)|Symmetric cone|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}\nAlthough the classical Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed by ad hoc methods, [[Jordan triple system]]s, or equivalently Jordan pairs, provide a uniform algebraic means of describing all the basic properties connected with a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type and its non-compact dual. This theory is described in detail in {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} and {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} and summarized in {{harvtxt|Satake|1981}}. The development is in the reverse order from that using the structure theory of compact Lie groups. It starting point is the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type realized as a bounded symmetric domain. It can be described in terms of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]]. This Jordan algebra structure can be used to reconstruct the dual Hermitian symmetric space of compact type, including in particular all the associated Lie algebras and Lie groups.\n\nThe theory is easiest to describe when the irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric space is of tube type. In that case the space is determined by a simple real Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>\nwith negative definite Killing form. It must admit an action of SU(2) which only acts via the trivial and adjoint representation, both types occurring. Since <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is simple, this action is inner, so implemented by an inclusion of the Lie algebra of SU(2) in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. The complexification of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> decomposes as a direct sum of three eigenspaces for the diagonal matrices in SU(2). It is a three-graded complex Lie algebra, with the Weyl group element of SU(2) providing the involution. Each of the \u00b11 eigenspaces has the structure of a unital complex Jordan algebra explicitly arising as the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra. It can be identified with the multiplicity space of the adjoint representation  of SU(2) in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThe description of irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type starts from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E''. It admits [[Jordan frame (Jordan algebra)|Jordan frames]], i.e. sets of orthogonal minimal idempotents ''e''<sub>''1''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''m''</sub>. Any two are related by an automorphism of ''E'', so that the integer ''m'' is an invariant called the '''rank''' of ''E''. Moreover, if ''A'' is the complexification of ''E'', it has a unitary [[structure group (Jordan algebra)|structure group]]. It is a subgroup of GL(''A'') preserving the natural complex inner product on ''A''. Any element ''a'' in ''A'' has a polar decomposition {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' \u2211 \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with  {{math|1=\u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> \u2265 0}}. The spectral norm is defined by ||a|| = sup \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub>. The associated [[bounded symmetric domain]] is just the open unit ball ''D'' in ''A''. There is a biholomorphism between ''D'' and the tube domain ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC'' where ''C'' is the open self-dual convex cone of elements in ''E'' of the form {{math|1=''a'' = ''u'' \u2211 \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with ''u'' an automorphism of ''E'' and \u03b1<sub>''i''</sub> > 0. This gives two descriptions of the Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. There is a natural way of using [[mutation (Jordan algebra)|mutations]] of the Jordan algebra ''A'' to compactify the space ''A''. The compactification ''X'' is a complex manifold and the finite-dimensional Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> of holomorphic vector fields on ''X'' can be determined explicitly. One parameter groups of biholomorphisms can be defined such that the corresponding holomorphic vector fields span <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. This includes the group of all complex M\u00f6bius transformations corresponding to matrices in SL(2,'''C'''). The subgroup SU(1,1) leaves invariant the unit ball and its closure. The subgroup SL(2,'''R''') leaves invariant the tube domain and its closure. The usual Cayley transform and its inverse, mapping the unit disk in '''C''' to the upper half plane, establishes analogous maps between ''D'' and ''T''. The polydisk corresponds to the real and complex Jordan subalgebras generated by a fixed Jordan frame. It admits a transitive action of SU(2)<sup>''m''</sup> and this action extends to ''X''. The group ''G'' generated by the one-parameter groups of biholomorphisms acts faithfully on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. The subgroup generated by the identity component ''K'' of the unitary structure group and the operators in SU(2)<sup>''m''</sup>. It defines a compact Lie group ''H'' which acts transitively on ''X''. Thus ''H'' / ''K'' is the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. The group ''G'' can be identified with the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of ''H''. The subgroup ''H''* leaving ''D'' invariant is a  noncompact real form of ''G''. It acts transitively on ''D'' so that ''H''* / ''K'' is the dual Hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type. The inclusions ''D'' \u2282 ''A'' \u2282 ''X'' reproduce the Borel and Harish-Chandra embeddings. The classification of Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type reduces to that of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras. These were classified by {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}} in terms of [[Euclidean Hurwitz algebra]]s, a special type of [[composition algebra]].\n\nIn general a Hermitian symmetric space gives rise to a 3-graded Lie algebra with a period 2 conjugate linear automorphism switching the parts of degree \u00b11 and preserving the degree 0 part. This gives rise to the structure of a [[Jordan pair]] or hermitian [[Jordan triple system]], to which {{harvtxt|Loos|1977}} extended the theory of Jordan algebras. All irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces can be constructed uniformly within this framework. {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} constructed the irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of non-tube type from a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra together with a period 2 automorphism. The \u22121 eigenspace of the automorphism has the structure of a Jordan pair, which can be deduced from that of the larger Jordan algebra. In the non-tube type case corresponding to a [[Siegel domain]] of type II, there is no distinguished subgroup of real or complex M\u00f6bius transformations. For irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces, tube type is characterized by the real dimension of the Shilov boundary {{math|''S''}} being equal to the complex dimension of {{math|''D''}}.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Invariant convex cone]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Agaoka|first= Yoshio|last2=Kaneda|first2= Eiji|title= Strongly orthogonal subsets in root systems|journal= Hokkaido Math.
