It forms the large majority of the '''N1 [[national primary road]]''' connecting [[Dublin]] towards [[Belfast]] along the east of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. The route heads north via [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] to the [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border|Northern Irish border]] just south of [[Newry]] in [[County Armagh]], where it joins the [[A1 road (Northern Ireland)|A1 road]] and further on, the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 motorway]] in Northern Ireland. It also forms a significant part of the road connection between Dublin and the Northern Irish cities of [[Newry]], and [[Lisburn]].\nThe route is part of [[International E-road network|European route]] [[European route E01|E01]].\n\n==Route==\n[[File:The M1 Boyne Bridge, near Drogheda, Co. Louth - geograph.org.uk - 1414270.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge]] carries the [[Drogheda]] bypass across the [[river Boyne]].]]\n\nAlmost the entire length of the N1 has been upgraded to motorway standard and is designated the M1 motorway. It runs from the Junction 3 of the M50 [[ring road]] in Dublin, past [[Cloghran, Coolock|Cloghran]], [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]], [[Balbriggan]], [[Drogheda]] and [[Dundalk]] before ending at Ballymascanlon north of Dundalk. It by-passes many towns through which the N1 travelled.<ref>http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2012/en/si/0053.html S.I.

No. 54/2012 \u2014 Roads Act 1993 (Classification of Regional Roads) Order 2012</ref> At Ballymascanlon, it becomes the N1 dual carriageway and continues to the border with [[Northern Ireland]]. The motorway section of the N1 uses the M1 designation. Small yellow route markers along the motorway route also read N1.\n\nThe motorway was built in several stages as short disconnected bypasses, replacing the original N1 route. The first section opened (in 1983) was from Whitehall to Coolock Lane followed (in 1985) by the ''Airport Motorway'' between Whitehall and [[Dublin Airport]], only the third section of motorway opened in Ireland. 1980s style [[road signs in the Republic of Ireland|direction signs]] were still intact on this route up until 2006. Part of this original M1 is now a spur to Dublin Airport, while another part between Whitehall to the [[Dublin Port Tunnel|Port Tunnel]] portals is now narrowed to two+one lanes (although still grade separated) as a result of the Dublin Port Tunnel work.\n\nThere are toll fees for use of the motorway between junctions 7 and 10, the section which forms the [[Drogheda]] bypass.  Work began in 2004 on a bypass of Dundalk, and was completed three months ahead of schedule in 2005, extending the motorway to just south of the border.\n\nConstruction finished in 2007 on a cross-border stretch of [[grade-separated]] dual-carriageway linking the northern end of the M1 with the A1 near Newry in County Armagh. This was opened to traffic on 2 August 2007. Its length is 14&nbsp;km, 4.6&nbsp;km north of the border and 9.4&nbsp;km south of the border. This allows traffic to flow freely from [[Dublin Port]] on motorway/dual-carriageway standard road to the Hillsborough Roundabout, located south of Lisburn.\n\n==Junctions==\n[[Image:M1County

(Northern Ireland)}}\n\nThe upgrade of the N1 is now complete in the Republic of Ireland, the first major route to be completely upgraded to motorway/dual carriageway standard (outside of Dublin city centre) as per the [[National Development Plan]]. The [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] authorities have no plans to replace the A1 route (currently dual carriageway) with motorway, although many junctions have now been grade separated. Currently, to drive from Dublin city centre to [[Belfast]], one travels along the M1 (Republic of Ireland), N1, A1 and M1 (Northern Ireland).\n\n==Motorway service areas==\nThe first official on-line [[Motorway service area]] in Ireland opened on the M1 on 8 September 2010, located near [[Lusk services|Lusk]]. A second near Castlebellingham (M1 North service area) opened on 29 September 2010. Each location has northbound and southbound facilities, with no connection across the motorway between each side. Open 24 hours a day, they provide fuel and food and are of a design similar to those found in other European countries. The service areas are run by a consortium of companies known as Superstop.\n\n==ITS on the M1==\nAs with other sections of Irish motorways which feature [[Variable-message sign]]s, the M1 is also connected to an [[Intelligent transportation system]] providing real-time journey time information for motorists. The system works by recognising vehicle number plates at intervals along the motorway, and uses this information to calculate average vehicle speeds and hence travel times. Northbound, VMSs near Malahide and Balbriggan provide information on the journey times to the Drogheda (J7) and Dundalk (J16) exits. Similar signs southbound provide information on the travel time to Dublin airport and the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]].\n\n==Roadside art on the M1==\nRoadside art is funded under the Percentage For Arts Scheme where 1% of the scheme budget is allocated to roadside art with a cap of \u20ac63,000. The local authorities decide on a theme and are responsible for commissioning the work, usually by open competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604142819/http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |archivedate=4 June 2009 }}</ref> There are several examples along the M1\n* '''The Beehives'''.

(Northern Ireland)}}\n\nThe upgrade of the N1 is now complete in the Republic of Ireland, the first major route to be completely upgraded to motorway/dual carriageway standard (outside of Dublin city centre) as per the [[National Development Plan]]. The [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] authorities have no plans to replace the A1 route (currently dual carriageway) with motorway, although many junctions have now been grade separated. Currently, to drive from Dublin city centre to [[Belfast]], one travels along the M1 (Republic of Ireland), N1, A1 and M1 (Northern Ireland).\n\n==Motorway service areas==\nThe first official on-line [[Motorway service area]] in Ireland opened on the M1 on 8 September 2010, located near [[Lusk services|Lusk]]. A second near Castlebellingham (M1 North service area) opened on 29 September 2010. Each location has northbound and southbound facilities, with no connection across the motorway between each side. Open 24 hours a day, they provide fuel and food and are of a design similar to those found in other European countries. The service areas are run by a consortium of companies known as Superstop.\n\n==ITS on the M1==\nAs with other sections of Irish motorways which feature [[Variable-message sign]]s, the M1 is also connected to an [[Intelligent transportation system]] providing real-time journey time information for motorists. The system works by recognising vehicle number plates at intervals along the motorway, and uses this information to calculate average vehicle speeds and hence travel times. Northbound, VMSs near Malahide and Balbriggan provide information on the journey times to the Drogheda (J7) and Dundalk (J16) exits. Similar signs southbound provide information on the travel time to Dublin airport and the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]].\n\n==Roadside art on the M1==\nRoadside art is funded under the Percentage For Arts Scheme where 1% of the scheme budget is allocated to roadside art with a cap of \u20ac63,000. The local authorities decide on a theme and are responsible for commissioning the work, usually by open competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604142819/http://www.arts-sport-tourism.gov.ie/pdfs/English-text5.htm |archivedate=4 June 2009 }}</ref> There are several examples along the M1\n* '''The Beehives'''.
