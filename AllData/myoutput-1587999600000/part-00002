It was reported by the ''[[The Inverness Courier]]'' that the Sheriff Taylor at the head of about thirty-five men traveled from [[Tain]] and arrived at Greenyards at about dawn. Their arrival was expected and they were met by a crowed of about 300 people, two thirds of whom were women. They were all apparently prepared to ''resist the execution of the law''. The women lined up at the front armed with stones and the men at the rear armed with sticks. The Sheriff tried to persuade them not to resist, as did Cummings who was the super-intendant of the Ross-shire police. The sheriff reluctantly then had to use force and the police attacked the crowed and dispersed them. However, during the violence, fifteen or sixteen women were seriously hurt, some requiring medical treatment, as the police appeared to have used their batons with great force. The sheriff had served summonses on four tenants. The police tried to capture some of them, but only captured five women. Sheriff Mackenzie later gave an account in which he said that the large number of people who had arrived to resist had been signaled to the spot by gun-shots.<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=Eric |year=2012 |title=The Highland Clearances |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ari8BQAAQBAJ&pg=PT219&lpg=PT219&dq=Resistance+during+Highland+Clearances&source=bl&ots=5pbIYuJ6he&sig=ACfU3U0pUx0LDp4uBIVEbwAmYa28yYO82Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi08pTwrPfoAhUvQEEAHVodAt04FBDoATABegQIDBAn#v=onepage&q=Greenyards&f=false |publisher=[[Birlinn (publisher)|Birlinn]] |page=none given |accessdate=April 27, 2020}}</ref> The women who had been captured were taken to the prison at Tain but they were released on bail the next day.
