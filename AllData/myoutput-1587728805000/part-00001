The first condition is that we go back to the great 'traditions of the classics, Kalecki and Keynes, whose work was rooted in the economic policy problems of their time, and derived its relevance from them. They asked what should be done and how. Economic policy is the main inspiration of economic theory. The second condition is that a tremendous lot of new work is done in the no-man's land between the established disciplines which are entrenched in their organised fields, fearful of each other and speaking different languages. We must have close cooperation with other disciplines: engineering, science, history, sociology, biology, political science etc. I think the chances of a new start are not bad, because the dominant economics has largely run its course ...
