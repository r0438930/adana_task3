One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his [[Newspaper delivery|paper round]] and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/>\n\nJeffreys was a pupil at Luton Grammar School and then [[Luton Sixth Form College]].<ref name=\"UofL 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |title=The Gene Genius |date=September 2004 |publisher=University of Leicester |accessdate=17 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109215809/http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> He won a scholarship to study at [[Merton College, Oxford]] on a four-year course, where he graduated in 1972 with [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] in [[biochemistry]].<ref name=CV-AJ/> Jeffreys completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree on the [[mitochondria]] of cultured mammalian cells, as a postgraduate student at the Genetics Laboratory at the University of Oxford.<ref name=jeffreysphd>{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |first=Alec|last=Jeffreys |title=Studies on the mitochondria of cultured mammalian cells |publisher=University of Oxford |date=1975 |url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph019879695|website=bodleian.ox.ac.uk|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.460797}}|oclc=500483911}}</ref>\n\n==Career and research==\n[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|Alec Jeffreys]]\nAfter finishing his doctorate, he moved to the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he worked on mammalian genes as a research fellow,<ref name = \"UofL 2004\"/> and then to the [[University of Leicester]] in 1977, where in 1984 he discovered a method of showing variations between individuals' DNA, inventing and developing [[genetic fingerprinting]].<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/><ref name = \"welcome 2004\"/>\n\n===Genetic fingerprinting===\nJeffreys says he had a \"[[eureka moment]]\" in his lab in Leicester after looking at the [[X-ray]] film image of a [[DNA]] experiment on 10 September 1984, which unexpectedly showed both similarities and differences between the DNA of different members of his technician's family.<ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref name = \"welcome 2004\"/> Within about half an hour, he continued, he realized the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the [[genetic code]] to identify individuals. The method has become important in [[forensic science]] to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife [[population genetics]] studies.<ref name=\"DNA Fingerprinting Zoology 2014\" /> Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/><ref name=\"welcome 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |title=Discovering DNA fingerprinting: Sir Alec Jeffreys describes its development |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |date=4 February 2004 |first=Giles |last=Newton |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135415/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nJeffreys's DNA method was first put to use in 1985 when he was asked to help in a disputed immigration case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from [[Ghana]].<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to the other members of the family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face when she heard the results.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched [[semen]] samples taken from the two dead girls.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys's work in this case prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. The story behind the investigations is told in [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s 1989 best selling book ''The Blooding: The True Story of the Narborough Village Murders'' and the murders and subsequent solving of the crimes was featured in Episode 1 of the first season of the 1996 American TV series ''[[Forensic Files|Medical Detectives]]'' in which Jeffreys himself also appears. A further television mini-series based on these events was released in 2015, [[Code of a Killer]]. In 1992, Jeffreys's methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the Nazi Dr. [[Josef Mengele]], who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a [[femur]] bone of his exhumed skeleton,<ref name = \"nature med 2005\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = J. | title = Ten years of biotech gaffes|doi = 10.1038/nbt0306-270|journal = Nature Biotechnology|volume = 24|issue = 3|pages = 270\u2013273|year = 2006|pmid =  16525384|pmc =}}</ref> with DNA from his mother and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/>\n\n===DNA profiling===\n[[DNA profiling]], based on typing individual highly variable [[minisatellite]]s in the [[human genome]], was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985,<ref>{{Cite journal \n|last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n|last2 = Wilson | first2 = V. \n|last3 = Thein | first3 = S. \n|title = Hypervariable 'minisatellite' regions in human DNA \n|journal = Nature \n|volume = 314 \n|issue = 6006 \n|pages = 67\u201373 \n|year = 1985 \n|pmid = 3856104\n|doi=10.1038/314067a0\n| bibcode = 1985Natur.314...67J \n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal \n|last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n|last2 = Wilson | first2 = V. \n|last3 = Thein | first3 = S. \n|title = Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA \n|journal = Nature \n|volume = 316 \n|issue = 6023 \n|pages = 76\u201379 \n|year = 1975\n|pmid = 2989708\n|doi=10.1038/316076a0\n}}</ref> with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many [[minisatellite]]s simultaneously. By focusing on just a few of these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and [[paternity testing]] worldwide.\n\nThe development of DNA amplification by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) opened up new approaches to forensic DNA testing, allowing automation, greatly increased sensitivity and a move to alternative marker systems. The most commonly used markers are now variable [[microsatellite]]s, also known as [[short tandem repeat]]s (STRs), which Jeffreys first exploited in 1990 in the [[Joseph Mengele|Mengele]] case.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n| last2 = Allen | first2 = M. \n| last3 = Hagelberg | first3 = E. |authorlink3=Erika Hagelberg\n| last4 = Sonnberg | first4 = A. \n| title = Identification of the skeletal remains of Josef Mengele by DNA analysis \n| journal = Forensic Science International \n| volume = 56 \n| issue = 1 \n| pages = 65\u201376 \n| year = 1992 \n| pmid = 1398379 | doi=10.1016/0379-0738(92)90148-P\n}}</ref> STR profiling was further refined by a team of scientists led by Peter Gill at the Forensic Science Service in the 1990s, allowing the launch of the [[UK National DNA Database]] (NDNAD) in 1995.{{fact|date=March 2018}} With highly automated and sophisticated equipment, modern-day DNA profiling can process hundreds of samples each day. Sixteen micro satellites, plus a marker for sex determination, are used with the current system developed for the NDNAD, giving a discrimination power of one in over a billion. Under British law, anyone arrested in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has their DNA profile taken and stored on the database whether or not they are convicted (different rules apply in Scotland).<ref name=\"DNA and Crime Investigation: Scotland and the UK National DNA Database\"/> The national database now contains the DNA information of nearly five million people. Jeffreys has opposed the current use of DNA profiling, where the government has access to that database,<ref name=\"The informer in your blood\"/> and has instead proposed a database of all people's DNA, access to which would be controlled by an independent third party.<ref name=\"Privacy fears over DNA database\"/>\n\n===Awards and honours===\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* 1986 \u2013 Elected a

One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his [[Newspaper delivery|paper round]] and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/>\n\nJeffreys was a pupil at Luton Grammar School and then [[Luton Sixth Form College]].<ref name=\"UofL 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |title=The Gene Genius |date=September 2004 |publisher=University of Leicester |accessdate=17 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109215809/http://www.le.ac.uk/ua/pr/gen%20supp.pdf |archivedate=9 November 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> He won a scholarship to study at [[Merton College, Oxford]] on a four-year course, where he graduated in 1972 with [[British undergraduate degree classification|first-class honours]] in [[biochemistry]].<ref name=CV-AJ/> Jeffreys completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree on the [[mitochondria]] of cultured mammalian cells, as a postgraduate student at the Genetics Laboratory at the University of Oxford.<ref name=jeffreysphd>{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |first=Alec|last=Jeffreys |title=Studies on the mitochondria of cultured mammalian cells |publisher=University of Oxford |date=1975 |url=http://solo.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/OXVU1:LSCOP_OX:oxfaleph019879695|website=bodleian.ox.ac.uk|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.460797}}|oclc=500483911}}</ref>\n\n==Career and research==\n[[File:Alec Jeffreys -2008.jpg|thumb|Alec Jeffreys]]\nAfter finishing his doctorate, he moved to the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he worked on mammalian genes as a research fellow,<ref name = \"UofL 2004\"/> and then to the [[University of Leicester]] in 1977, where in 1984 he discovered a method of showing variations between individuals' DNA, inventing and developing [[genetic fingerprinting]].<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/><ref name = \"welcome 2004\"/>\n\n===Genetic fingerprinting===\nJeffreys says he had a \"[[eureka moment]]\" in his lab in Leicester after looking at the [[X-ray]] film image of a [[DNA]] experiment on 10 September 1984, which unexpectedly showed both similarities and differences between the DNA of different members of his technician's family.<ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref name = \"welcome 2004\"/> Within about half an hour, he continued, he realized the possible scope of DNA fingerprinting, which uses variations in the [[genetic code]] to identify individuals. The method has become important in [[forensic science]] to assist police detective work, and it has also proved useful in resolving paternity and immigration disputes.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> The method can also be applied to non-human species, for example in wildlife [[population genetics]] studies.<ref name=\"DNA Fingerprinting Zoology 2014\" /> Before his methods were commercialised in 1987, his laboratory was the only centre in the world that carried out DNA fingerprinting, and was consequently very busy, receiving inquiries from all over the globe.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/><ref name=\"welcome 2004\">{{cite web|url=http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |title=Discovering DNA fingerprinting: Sir Alec Jeffreys describes its development |publisher=[[Wellcome Trust]] |date=4 February 2004 |first=Giles |last=Newton |accessdate=23 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135415/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/doc_wtd020877.html |archivedate=5 March 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nJeffreys's DNA method was first put to use in 1985 when he was asked to help in a disputed immigration case to confirm the identity of a British boy whose family was originally from [[Ghana]].<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> The case was resolved when the DNA results proved that the boy was closely related to the other members of the family, and Jeffreys saw the relief in the mother's face when she heard the results.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> DNA fingerprinting was first used in a police forensic test to identify the killer of two teenagers, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, who had been raped and murdered in [[Narborough, Leicestershire]], in 1983 and 1986 respectively. [[Colin Pitchfork]] was identified and convicted of their murders after samples taken from him matched [[semen]] samples taken from the two dead girls.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/> This turned out to be a specifically important identification; British authorities believe that without it an innocent man would have inevitably been convicted. Not only did Jeffreys's work in this case prove who the real killer was, but it exonerated Richard Buckland, initially a prime suspect, who likely would have spent his life in prison otherwise. The story behind the investigations is told in [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s 1989 best selling book ''The Blooding: The True Story of the Narborough Village Murders'' and the murders and subsequent solving of the crimes was featured in Episode 1 of the first season of the 1996 American TV series ''[[Forensic Files|Medical Detectives]]'' in which Jeffreys himself also appears. A further television mini-series based on these events was released in 2015, [[Code of a Killer]]. In 1992, Jeffreys's methods were used to confirm the identity for German prosecutors of the Nazi Dr. [[Josef Mengele]], who had died in 1979, by comparing DNA obtained from a [[femur]] bone of his exhumed skeleton,<ref name = \"nature med 2005\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hodgson | first1 = J. | title = Ten years of biotech gaffes|doi = 10.1038/nbt0306-270|journal = Nature Biotechnology|volume = 24|issue = 3|pages = 270\u2013273|year = 2006|pmid =  16525384|pmc =}}</ref> with DNA from his mother and son, in a similar way to paternity testing.<ref name=\"DIDiscs AJ\"/>\n\n===DNA profiling===\n[[DNA profiling]], based on typing individual highly variable [[minisatellite]]s in the [[human genome]], was also developed by Alec Jeffreys and his team in 1985,<ref>{{Cite journal \n|last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n|last2 = Wilson | first2 = V. \n|last3 = Thein | first3 = S. \n|title = Hypervariable 'minisatellite' regions in human DNA \n|journal = Nature \n|volume = 314 \n|issue = 6006 \n|pages = 67\u201373 \n|year = 1985 \n|pmid = 3856104\n|doi=10.1038/314067a0\n| bibcode = 1985Natur.314...67J \n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal \n|last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n|last2 = Wilson | first2 = V. \n|last3 = Thein | first3 = S. \n|title = Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA \n|journal = Nature \n|volume = 316 \n|issue = 6023 \n|pages = 76\u201379 \n|year = 1975\n|pmid = 2989708\n|doi=10.1038/316076a0\n}}</ref> with the term (DNA fingerprinting) being retained for the initial test that types many [[minisatellite]]s simultaneously. By focusing on just a few of these highly variable minisatellites, DNA profiling made the system more sensitive, more reproducible and amenable to computer databases. It soon became the standard forensic DNA system used in criminal case work and [[paternity testing]] worldwide.\n\nThe development of DNA amplification by the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) opened up new approaches to forensic DNA testing, allowing automation, greatly increased sensitivity and a move to alternative marker systems. The most commonly used markers are now variable [[microsatellite]]s, also known as [[short tandem repeat]]s (STRs), which Jeffreys first exploited in 1990 in the [[Joseph Mengele|Mengele]] case.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Jeffreys | first1 = A. \n| last2 = Allen | first2 = M. \n| last3 = Hagelberg | first3 = E. |authorlink3=Erika Hagelberg\n| last4 = Sonnberg | first4 = A. \n| title = Identification of the skeletal remains of Josef Mengele by DNA analysis \n| journal = Forensic Science International \n| volume = 56 \n| issue = 1 \n| pages = 65\u201376 \n| year = 1992 \n| pmid = 1398379 | doi=10.1016/0379-0738(92)90148-P\n}}</ref> STR profiling was further refined by a team of scientists led by Peter Gill at the Forensic Science Service in the 1990s, allowing the launch of the [[UK National DNA Database]] (NDNAD) in 1995.{{fact|date=March 2018}} With highly automated and sophisticated equipment, modern-day DNA profiling can process hundreds of samples each day. Sixteen micro satellites, plus a marker for sex determination, are used with the current system developed for the NDNAD, giving a discrimination power of one in over a billion. Under British law, anyone arrested in England, Wales or Northern Ireland has their DNA profile taken and stored on the database whether or not they are convicted (different rules apply in Scotland).<ref name=\"DNA and Crime Investigation: Scotland and the UK National DNA Database\"/> The national database now contains the DNA information of nearly five million people. Jeffreys has opposed the current use of DNA profiling, where the government has access to that database,<ref name=\"The informer in your blood\"/> and has instead proposed a database of all people's DNA, access to which would be controlled by an independent third party.<ref name=\"Privacy fears over DNA database\"/>\n\n===Awards and honours===\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* 1986 \u2013 Elected a
