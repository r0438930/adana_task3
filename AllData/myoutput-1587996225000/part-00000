His new wife is shown to be callous and selfish. The swordsman regrets leaving his more devoted and patient ex-wife.\n\nThe second wife is furious when she realizes that the swordsman not only married her to obtain her family's wealth, but also still longs for his old life in Kyoto with his ex-wife.

They have heard the story of Hoichi the earless and wish to hear him play his biwa.  \nHe is brought to court of the lord.

While the party is resting there, Sekinai sees the face of a strange man in a cup of tea.

Sekinai runs to tell the other attendants, but they laugh and tell him he is seeing things. Later that night at his own residence, Sekinai is visited by three ghostly attendants of Heinai Shikibu. He duels them and is nearly defeated, but the author notes the tale ends before things are resolved and suggests that he could write a complete ending, but prefers to leave the ending to the reader's imagination.\n\nThe publisher soon arrives and asks the Madame for the author, who is nowhere to be found.

His friends drag him home as he refuses to leave before his performance is completed.\n\nThe priest tell Hoichi he is in great danger and that this was a vast illusion from the spirit of the dead.  They tell Hoichi that if he obeys them again they will tear him to pieces.  Concerned for Hoichi\u2019s safety, a priest and his acolyte write the text of The Heart Sutra on his entire body including his face to make him invisible to the ghosts and instruct him to meditate. The samurai re-appears and calls out for Hoichi.  Hoichi does not answer.  Hoichi's ears are visible to the samurai as they forgot to write the text on his ears.  The samurai, wanting to bring back as much of Hoichi as possible, rips his ears off to show his lord his commands have been obeyed. \n\nThe next morning, the priest and the attendants see a trail of blood leading from the temple.  The priest and the acolyte realize their error and believe the ears were a trade for Hoichi's life.  They believe the spirits will now leave him alone.\n\nA local lord attend at the temple with a full retinue.  They have heard the story of Hoichi the earless and wish to hear him play his biwa.  \nHe is brought to court of the lord.  Hoichi says he will play to console the sorrowful spirits and allow them to rest.  \n\nThe narrator indicates than many wealthy noble person would come to the temple with large gifts of money and Hoichi-the-earless became a wealthy person.\n\n===In a Cup of Tea===\n{{nihongo|\"In a Cup of Tea\"|\u8336\u7897\u306e\u4e2d|Chawan no Naka}} is adapted from Hearn's ''Kott\u014d: Being Japanese Curios, with Sundry Cobwebs'' (1902).\n\nAnticipating a visit from his publisher, a writer relates an old tale of an attendant of Lord Nakagawa Sadono named Sekinai. While Lord Nakagawa is his way to make a New Year's visit, he halts with his train at a tea-house in [[Hakusan, Ishikawa|Hakusan]]. While the party is resting there, Sekinai sees the face of a strange man in a cup of tea. Despite being perturbed, he drinks the cup.\n\nLater, while Sekinai is guarding his Lord, the man whose face appeared in the tea reappears, calling himself Heinai Shikibu. Sekinai runs to tell the other attendants, but they laugh and tell him he is seeing things. Later that night at his own residence, Sekinai is visited by three ghostly attendants of Heinai Shikibu. He duels them and is nearly defeated, but the author notes the tale ends before things are resolved and suggests that he could write a complete ending, but prefers to leave the ending to the reader's imagination.\n\nThe publisher soon arrives and asks the Madame for the author, who is nowhere to be found. They both flee the scene in terror when they discover the author trapped inside a large jar of water.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Kurokami===\n\n* [[Michiyo Aratama]] as First wife\n* [[Misako Watanabe]] as Second Wife\n* [[Rentar\u014d Mikuni]] as Husband\n* [[Kenjiro Ishiyama]] as Father\n* [[Ranko Akagi]] as Mother\n\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Yuki-Onna===\n* [[Tatsuya Nakadai]] as Minokichi\n* [[Keiko Kishi]] as the Yuki-Onna \n* [[Y\u016bko Mochizuki]] as Minokichi's mother\n* [[Kin Sugai]] as Village woman\n* [[Noriko Sengoku]] as Village woman\n\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Miminashi H\u014dichi no Hanashi===\n* [[Katsuo Nakamura]] as Hoichi\n* [[Tetsur\u014d Tamba]] as Warrior\n* [[Takashi Shimura]] as Head priest\n* [[Yoichi Hayashi]] as [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]]\n{{Col-4}}\n\n===Chawan no naka===\n* [[Haruko Sugimura]] as Madame\n* [[Osamu Takizawa]] as Author / Narrator\n* [[Ganjir\u014d Nakamura]] as Publisher\n* [[Noboru Nakaya]] as Shikibu Heinai\n* [[Seiji Miyaguchi]] as Old man\n* [[Kei Sat\u014d]] as Ghost samurai\n\n{{Col-end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn 1964, [[Toho]] began a three-film deal with director [[Masaki Kobayashi]] that concluded with the production ''Kwaidan''.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=451}}\n\n==Release==\nThe [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] version of ''Kwaidan'' was released theatrically in Japan on January 6, 1965 where it was distributed by [[Toho]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} The Japanese general release for ''Kwaidan'' began on February 27, 1965.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=218}} ''Kwaidan'' was reedited to 125 minutes in the United States for its theatrical release which eliminated the segment \"The Woman of the Snow\" after the film's Los Angeles premiere.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} It was released in the United States on July 15, 1965 where it was distributed by [[Continental Distributing]].{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=217}} ''Kwaidan'' was re-released theatrically in Japan on November 29, 1982 in Japan as part of Toho's 50th anniversary.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|2008|p=332}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=August 2015}}\nIn Japan the film won [[Yoko Mizuki]] the [[Kinema Junpo]] award for Best Screenplay.
