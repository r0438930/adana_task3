It produces approximately 600 codes and standards covering many technical areas, such as fasteners, plumbing fixtures, elevators, pipelines, and power plant systems and components.  ASME's standards are developed by committees of subject matter experts using an open, consensus-based process.  Many ASME standards are cited by government agencies as tools to meet their regulatory objectives.  ASME standards are therefore voluntary, unless the standards have been incorporated into a legally binding business contract or incorporated into regulations enforced by an authority having jurisdiction, such as a federal, state, or local government agency.  ASME's standards are used in more than 100 countries and have been translated into numerous languages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Standards Are Global|url=http://www.asme.org/kb/standards/history-of-asme-standards|work=History of ASME Standards|publisher=ASME|accessdate=7 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===ASME boiler and pressure vessel code (BPVC)===\n{{main article|ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code}}\nThe largest ASME standard, both in size and in the number of volunteers involved in its preparation, is the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC). The BPVC provides rules for the design, fabrication, installation, inspection, care, and use of [[boiler]]s, [[pressure vessel]]s, and nuclear components. The code also includes standards on materials, welding and brazing procedures and qualifications, nondestructive examination, and nuclear in-service inspection.\n\n===Other notable standardization areas===\n\nOther Notable Standardization Areas include but not limited to are; Elevators and Escalators (A17 Series), Overhead and Mobile Cranes and related lifting and rigging equipment (B30 Series), Piping and Pipelines (B31 Series), Bio-processing Equipment (BPE), Valves Flanges, [[B16 Standardization of Valves, Flanges, Fittings, and Gaskets|Fittings and Gaskets (B16)]], Nuclear Components and Processes Performance Test Codes.\n\n==Society awards==\nASME offers four categories of awards: achievement awards to recognize \"eminently distinguished engineering achievement\"; literature awards for original papers; service awards for voluntary service to ASME; and unit awards, jointly awarded by six societies in recognition of advancement in the field of transportation. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards|title=Honors & Awards|website=www.asme.org}}</ref>\n\n* [[ASME Medal]]\n* Charles T.
