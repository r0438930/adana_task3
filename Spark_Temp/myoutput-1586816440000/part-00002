Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref> [[Citizen]]s acting alone or together to protect public values or make a change or difference in the community are common types of civic engagement. Civic\nengagement includes communities working together in both political and non-political actions. The goal of civic engagement is to address public concerns and promote the quality of the community.\n\nCivic engagement \"is a process in which people take collective action to address issues of public concern\" and is absolutely \"instrumental to [[democracy]]\" (Checkoway & Aldana, 2012).<ref>Checkoway, B., & Aldana, A.

One potential solution is to create a mandatory training course for younger voters to learn of the opportunities with civic engagement. Additionally historically lower voter turnout groups may lack basic resources to understand how to register to vote or even how to get to voting locations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/collegespecial2/coll_aascu_defi.html|title=The Definition of Civic Engagement|date=2003-07-07|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref>\n\n==Forms==\nCivic engagement can take many forms\u2014from individual [[volunteerism]], community engagement efforts, organizational involvement and government work such as electoral participation.

Putnam argued that despite rapid increases in higher education opportunities that may foster civic engagement, Americans were dropping out of political and organized community life. A number of studies suggested that while more youth are volunteering, fewer are voting or becoming politically engaged.<ref>Putnam, R. (2000). ''Bowling Alone.'' Simon and Schuster: New York. p. 64.</ref>\n\n==Role of volunteerism in transforming governance==\n\nThe State of the World's [[Volunteerism]] Report 2015, the first global review of the power of volunteer voices to help improve the way people are governed, draws on evidence from countries as diverse as Brazil, Kenya, Lebanon and Bangladesh. The [[UN]] report shows how ordinary people are volunteering their time, energies and skills to improve the way they are governed and engaged at local, national and global levels. Better governance at every level is a pre-requisite for the success of the new set of targets for future international development, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which has been agreed upon by the United Nations in September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}</ref>\n\nAt the global level, for instance, a diverse group of 37 [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged in 4 months of intense collaboration with the [[United Nations Department of Economic Affairs]] (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2014 UN [[E-Government]] Survey. The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/stories/2013_undesa.html|title=Home - UNV Online Volunteering service}}</ref>\u2014more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries\u2014mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\nCivic engagement can foster [[community]] participation and government involvement.\n\nAccording to ICMA: Leaders at the Core of Better Communities, these are the benefits of civic engagement:<ref>\"How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships.\" ''How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships'' 43 (2011): n.p. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref>\n\n* Achieving greater buy-in to decisions with fewer backlashes such as lawsuits, special elections, or a council recall.\n* Engendering trust between citizens and government, which improves public behavior at council meetings. \n* Attaining successful outcomes on toxic issues, which helps elected officials avoid choosing between equally unappealing solutions. \n* Developing better and more creative ideas and solutions. \n* Implementing ideas, programs, and [[policies]] faster and more easily. \n* Creating involved citizens instead of demanding customers. \n* Building community within a city. \n* Making your job easier and more relaxing.\n\n== Local civic engagement ==\nWhen those who serve listen to the citizens, they become better informed of what is needed by the community and generally make better decisions.  Miriam Porter states that elected officials should communicate with their citizens to have this better understanding, \"Without this, turmoil, suspicion, and reduction of public trust ensues\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=25038780&site=eds-live&scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login}}</ref>\n\nVolunteering personal time to community projects is widely believed to support the growth of a community as a whole. [[Community engagement]] could be found at: Food pantries, community clean-up programs and the like can bolster efforts to create a strong community bond.\n\n===Community collaboration===\nCommunity [[collaboration]] includes democratic spaces where people are open to discuss concerns for particular issues regarding [[public interest]] and means to make the changes necessary. These spaces are often resource centers, such as neighborhood associations or school boards where citizens can obtain information regarding the community (upcoming changes, proposed solutions to existing problems, etc.).\nColleges and universities are also offering more opportunities and expecting more students to engage in community volunteer work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=Constance|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Engagement and the Transition to Adulthood|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=159\u201379|pmid=20364626|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0043}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a case study conducted in a U.S college on September 2014, there are pivotal leadership qualities that contribute to the development of civic engagement. The study mentions 3 main themes: active, adaptive and resilient leadership, learning for leadership and engagement for the greater good as the main reasons for the success of The Democracy Commitment (TDC) in the college. TDC is a national initiative that intend to help U.S community colleges educate their students for democracy. <ref>Clifford P. Harbour. (2016). Civic Engagement and Cosmopolitan Leadership. En Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement (51\u201359). Estados Unidos: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</ref>\n\nPolitical participation is another key element that is practiced with regularity. Involvement in public council meeting sessions for discussions informs citizens of necessities and changes that need to be made. Casting an informed vote at the local level, can change many things that affect day-to-day life.\n\nOnline engagement gives citizens the opportunity to be involved in their [[local government]] that they would not have otherwise, by allowing them to voice themselves from the comfort of their own home. Online Engagement involves things such as online voting and public discussion forums that give citizens the opportunity to voice their opinions on topics and offer solutions as well as find others with common interests and creating the possibility of forming [[advocacy group]]s pertaining to particular interests. The use of the internet has allowed for people to have access to information easily and has resulted in a better informed public as well as creating a new sense of community for citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engaging the Public at a Local Level to Strengthen Civic Engagement|url=http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|publisher=San Antonio Area Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191630/http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|archive-date=16 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==In the role of state government==\nCivic engagement has an interrelated relationship within the various entities of the state. Through the values, knowledge, liberties, skills, ideas, attitudes and beliefs the population holds, civic engagement cultivates and shapes the state to be a representation of vast cultural, social, and economic identities.\n\nCivic engagement applied within the state is not possible without local civic engagement. As in a democratic society, citizens are the source to give life to a representative democracy. Application of this principle can be found within programs and laws that states have implemented based in a variety of areas concerns for that particular state. Health, education, equality, immigration are a few examples of entities that civic engagement can shape within a state.\n\n===Application in health===\nStates implement public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society. The State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), for example, is the largest public investment in child health care aiding over 11 million uninsured children in the United States. \"This statewide health insurance program for low-income children was associated with improved access, utilization, and quality of care, suggesting that SCHIP has the potential to improve health care for low-income American children\".<ref>Szilagyi, Peter G., et al. \"Evaluation of a state health insurance program for low-income children: implications for state child health insurance programs.\" ''Pediatrics'' 105.2 (2000): 363\u201371</ref> States take part in the program and sculpt it to better fit the needs of that state's demographics, making their healthcare and the civic engagement process of individuals that take part in the program as well help reform and fix it apart of the state's identity.\n\n===In comparison with other countries===\nStates practicing public involvement and implementing public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society is a concept that is also shared by other countries, such as England. A study conducted by Department of Primary Care, University of Liverpool, the Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol,  the Department of Geography and Geology, McMaster Institute of Environment and Health, McMaster University, Avon Health Authority, the School of Journalism, Tom Hopkinson Centre for Media Research, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University, and the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, McMaster University stated that \"There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\">Litva, Andrea, et al. \"'The public is too subjective': public involvement at different levels of health-care decision making.\" ''Social Science & Medicine'' 54.12 (2002): 1825\u201337.</ref>\n\nTheir research included critical examination of the degree of involvement by the public in healthcare decision making. It is suggested that \"public participation in decision making can promote goals, bind individuals or groups together, impart a sense of competence and responsibility and help express political or civic identity\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\" /> The action of the citizens aimed at influencing decisions of representatives ultimately affects the state as a whole. Voting is a key component in civic engagement for the voice of the masses to be heard.\n\n===Importance of voter turnout===\n[[File:I voted on November 8 2016.jpg|thumb|Voter turn out sticker]]\nThe goal for state government in elections is to promote civic engagement.  Director Regina Lawrence of Annette Strauss Institute for Civic Life states \"Politics and all other forms of engagement are really about trying to make your community, your state, and your nation a better place to live.\"<ref>Andrew Roush,  N.p..

SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 12 Apr. 2016.</ref> In addition, specifically Black Youth, there is an underlying gap of early civic education where there is lack of and where it thrives. According to Hope and Jagers, they studied civic engagement among Black youth using data acquired from the Youth Culture Survey from the Black Youth Project. The assumption is that Black youth who experience racial discrimination are fueled to be aware and participate in politics.<ref>Hope, Elan C., and Robert J. Jagers. \"The Role Of Sociopolitical Attitudes And Civic Education In The Civic Engagement Of Black Youth.\" ''Journal of Research on Adolescence (Wiley-Blackwell)'' 24.3 (2014): 460\u201370.

Their research resulted in variations according to their participants as the racial minority youth were motivated and had aspiring goals for their futures due to early participation in civic engagement activities, but there was no sufficient evidence that this type of mindset will follow them into their adulthood.<ref>Chan, Wing, Suh-Ruu Ou, and Arthur Reynolds. \"Adolescent Civic Engagement And Adult Outcomes: An Examination Among Urban Racial Minorities.\" ''Journal of Youth & Adolescence'' 43.11 (2014): 1829\u201343  ''CINAHL Complete''.

The Hispanic demographic is becoming a potential influence of power within political polls.<ref>Suro, Roberto. \"Whatever Happened to Latino Political Power?\" ''The New York Times''. 2 January 2016. Web. 12 April 2016.</ref> To expand on another group that are oppressed is immigrant parents and their children in Jensen's study their concentration is on Asia and Latin America. In their study they sampled a small group from a metropolitan area, the difference between both generations varies as the children who were in high school which is 87.5% were stated to be civically engaged. Whereas for the parents they were not civically engaged in issues but developed \"bilcultural consciousness\" such as sending money back their original country of origin and these participants saw it as their duty in their current state of opportunity to be civically engaged.<ref>Jensen, Lene Arnett. \"Immigrants' Cultural Identities As Sources Of Civic Engagement.\" ''Applied Developmental Science'' 12.2 (2008): 74\u201383. Science & Technology Collection. Web. 13 Apr. 2016.</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\n\n'''Civic engagement, interpersonal trust, and television use''' \u2013 [[Social capital]] has been on the decline for years and Putnam looked into why this is. One of the areas the study covered was television and its effects on social and civic engagements. Shah writes that Putnam found the more TV a person watches, the less they are active in outside activities. This is shown with the rise of TV in the 60s and the fall of civic engagements. They found that though news and educational programming can actually aide in a citizen's knowledge, but the lack of engaging in outside activities and social events hurts civic engagement in general.<ref>Shah, D. V. (1998). \"Civic Engagement, Interpersonal Trust, and Television Use: An Individual\u2010Level Assessment of Social Capital\". ''Political Psychology'', 19(3), 469\u201396.</ref>\n\nNowadays, the internet has become the main social media outlet. Xenos and Moy found that the internet does help civic engagement but also give \"unjustifiable euphoria, abrupt and equally unjustifiable skepticism, and gradual realization that web-based human interaction really does have unique and politically significant properties\".<ref>Xenos, M., & Moy, P. (2007). \"Direct and differential effects of the Internet on political and civic engagement\". ''Journal of communication'', 57(4), 704\u201318.</ref>  We have all the information we want about and candidate at our fingertips, and the wealth of information is creating a more informed body. But with this comes misinformation and the two collide and do the opposite, creating a public with clashing opinions.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/digitalcitizensh0000moss|url-access=registration|quote=civic engagement technology.|title=Digital Citizenship: The Internet, Society, and Participation|last=Mossberger|first=Karen|author-link1=Karen Mossberger|last2=Tolbert|first2=Caroline J.|author-link2=Caroline Tolbert|last3=McNeal|first3=Ramona S.|date=2007-10-12|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262250191|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe Knight Foundation outlines four different ways technology can assist in civic engagement. The four different ways include upgrading and providing e-services, making information more transparent, allowing e-democracy, and a service they call co-production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/four-ideas-on-how-tech-can-increase-civic-engagement|title=Knight Foundation|website=www.knightfoundation.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> E-services would allow digital technologies to improve the efficiency of urban services within a city. This would allow the services to become more effective as well as give the public a way to get involved. E-Democracy and Co-Production would work by allowing citizens to shape public policy by allowing them to partake in actions through technology. The Knight Foundation claims technology can make information more transparent, allowing the public to access the information and get involved.\n\nThere are countries, like Romania, where the new technologies started to influence the civic participation, in the last years. New media is becoming a factor of increasing civic mobilization for the new generations. New studies about that, at [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] from [[SNSPA]], [[Romania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civicparticipation.ro/|title=SNSPA \u2013 Center for Civic Participation and Democracy|website=civicparticipation.ro|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] (CPD) is a unit of research, analysis, and evaluation of citizen participation in the democratic process, both at the national and [[European Union|European]] level.Created at the [[National University of Political Studies and Public Administration|National School of Political Science and Public Administration]], CPD brings together experts in areas such as Political Science, Sociology, Administrative Sciences, Communications, International Relations and European Studies and it objectifies the SNSPA role and status of ''School of governance''.

According to Diann Cameron Kelly, \"When our young children serve their communities through volunteerism, political participation or through vocal activism, they are more likely to emerge...voting and serving all aspects of society\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Civic readiness: Preparing toddlers and young children for civic education and sustained engagement|author=Kelly, DC|journal=National Civic Review|date=Winter 2008|volume=97|issue= 4|pages=55\u201359|doi=10.1002/ncr.234}}</ref>   Kelly argues that children should be taught how their community works and who chooses the rules we live by even before they enter school.  Other voices maintain that civic education is a lifelong process, even for those who make decisions on behalf of the citizens they serve.\n\nTo answer this challenge, the incorporation of [[service-learning]] into collegiate course design has gained acceptance as a pedagogy that links curricular content with civic education. In a recent study, students who participated in service learning even one time appear to have made gains in knowledge of and commitment to civic engagement when compared to non-service learners.<ref>Prentice, M. & G. Robinson (2010) ''Linking Service Learning and Civic Engagement in Community College Students''. American Association of Community Colleges: Washington, D.C.</ref> [[Campus Compact]], a coalition of nearly 1200 college presidents (as of 2013) promotes the development of citizenship skills by creating community partnerships and providing resources to train faculty to integrate civic and community-based learning into the curriculum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.compact.org/about/history-mission-vision/|title=Mission & Vision - Campus Compact}}</ref> Building on the acceptance of service learning and civic engagement in higher education, The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement in Teaching created the Political Engagement Project in 2003 to develop the political knowledge and skills of college-aged students.<ref>McCartney, A., Bennion, E. & D.

The American Democracy Project also sponsors campus-based initiatives including voter registration, curriculum revision projects, and special days of action and reflection, such as the MLK Day of Service. In a report entitled,'' A Crucible Moment: College Learning and Democracy's Future ''issued in 2012 by the National Task Force on Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement, a joint project of the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] and the American Association of Colleges and Universities, the authors argue that higher education must serve as an intellectual incubator and socially responsible partner in advancing civic learning and democratic engagement.\n\n'''The report recommends four basic steps to build civic minded institutions:'''\n\n# Foster a civic ethos across the campus culture.\n# Make civic literacy a core expectation for all students.\n# Practice civic inquiry across all fields of study.\n# Advance civic action through transformative partnerships.<ref>The National Task Force of Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement. 2012. ''A Crucible Moment: College Learning and Democracy's Future.''

Edwin Fogelman, author of ''Civic Engagement at the University of Minnesota,'' states that true civic engagement can only be practiced by those living within a Democracy. According to Fogelman, civic engagement is largely shaped by schools. Education institutions have the skills to foster \"civic competence, critical thinking, and Public Spirit, which empower citizens to become engaged\". Many claim that civic engagement ought to become part of the curriculum and that higher education institutions should provide opportunities to become engaged such as internships, service-learning, and community based activities. Institutions also need to provide outlets where students can have open discussions over concerns and controversial issues.<ref>Fogelman, Edwin. \"Civic Engagement At The University Of Minnesota.\" ''Journal of Public Affairs'' 6.(2002): 103.

A number of studies suggested that while more youth are volunteering, fewer are voting or becoming politically engaged.<ref>Putnam, R. (2000). ''Bowling Alone.''

The [[UN]] report shows how ordinary people are volunteering their time, energies and skills to improve the way they are governed and engaged at local, national and global levels. Better governance at every level is a pre-requisite for the success of the new set of targets for future international development, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which has been agreed upon by the United Nations in September 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|publisher=United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}}</ref>\n\nAt the global level, for instance, a diverse group of 37 [[Online volunteering|online volunteers]] from across the globe engaged in 4 months of intense collaboration with the [[United Nations Department of Economic Affairs]] (UN DESA) to process 386 research surveys carried out across 193 UN Member States for the 2014 UN [[E-Government]] Survey. The diversity of nationalities and languages of the online volunteers<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onlinevolunteering.org/en/org/stories/2013_undesa.html|title=Home - UNV Online Volunteering service}}</ref>\u2014more than 65 languages, 15 nationalities, of which half are from developing countries\u2014mirrors perfectly the mission of the survey.\n\n== Benefits ==\n\nCivic engagement can foster [[community]] participation and government involvement.\n\nAccording to ICMA: Leaders at the Core of Better Communities, these are the benefits of civic engagement:<ref>\"How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships.\" ''How Civic Engagement Transforms Community Relationships'' 43 (2011): n.p. Web. 25 Apr. 2016.</ref>\n\n* Achieving greater buy-in to decisions with fewer backlashes such as lawsuits, special elections, or a council recall.\n* Engendering trust between citizens and government, which improves public behavior at council meetings. \n* Attaining successful outcomes on toxic issues, which helps elected officials avoid choosing between equally unappealing solutions. \n* Developing better and more creative ideas and solutions. \n* Implementing ideas, programs, and [[policies]] faster and more easily. \n* Creating involved citizens instead of demanding customers. \n* Building community within a city. \n* Making your job easier and more relaxing.\n\n== Local civic engagement ==\nWhen those who serve listen to the citizens, they become better informed of what is needed by the community and generally make better decisions.  Miriam Porter states that elected officials should communicate with their citizens to have this better understanding, \"Without this, turmoil, suspicion, and reduction of public trust ensues\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=25038780&site=eds-live&scope=site|title=EBSCOhost Login}}</ref>\n\nVolunteering personal time to community projects is widely believed to support the growth of a community as a whole. [[Community engagement]] could be found at: Food pantries, community clean-up programs and the like can bolster efforts to create a strong community bond.\n\n===Community collaboration===\nCommunity [[collaboration]] includes democratic spaces where people are open to discuss concerns for particular issues regarding [[public interest]] and means to make the changes necessary. These spaces are often resource centers, such as neighborhood associations or school boards where citizens can obtain information regarding the community (upcoming changes, proposed solutions to existing problems, etc.).\nColleges and universities are also offering more opportunities and expecting more students to engage in community volunteer work.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=Constance|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Engagement and the Transition to Adulthood|journal=The Future of Children|date=Spring 2010|volume=20|issue=1|pages=159\u201379|pmid=20364626|doi=10.1353/foc.0.0043}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a case study conducted in a U.S college on September 2014, there are pivotal leadership qualities that contribute to the development of civic engagement. The study mentions 3 main themes: active, adaptive and resilient leadership, learning for leadership and engagement for the greater good as the main reasons for the success of The Democracy Commitment (TDC) in the college. TDC is a national initiative that intend to help U.S community colleges educate their students for democracy. <ref>Clifford P. Harbour. (2016). Civic Engagement and Cosmopolitan Leadership. En Civic Learning and Democratic Engagement (51\u201359). Estados Unidos: Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</ref>\n\nPolitical participation is another key element that is practiced with regularity. Involvement in public council meeting sessions for discussions informs citizens of necessities and changes that need to be made. Casting an informed vote at the local level, can change many things that affect day-to-day life.\n\nOnline engagement gives citizens the opportunity to be involved in their [[local government]] that they would not have otherwise, by allowing them to voice themselves from the comfort of their own home. Online Engagement involves things such as online voting and public discussion forums that give citizens the opportunity to voice their opinions on topics and offer solutions as well as find others with common interests and creating the possibility of forming [[advocacy group]]s pertaining to particular interests. The use of the internet has allowed for people to have access to information easily and has resulted in a better informed public as well as creating a new sense of community for citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Engaging the Public at a Local Level to Strengthen Civic Engagement|url=http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|publisher=San Antonio Area Foundation|accessdate=4 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416191630/http://www.saafdn.org/document.doc?id=677|archive-date=16 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==In the role of state government==\nCivic engagement has an interrelated relationship within the various entities of the state. Through the values, knowledge, liberties, skills, ideas, attitudes and beliefs the population holds, civic engagement cultivates and shapes the state to be a representation of vast cultural, social, and economic identities.\n\nCivic engagement applied within the state is not possible without local civic engagement. As in a democratic society, citizens are the source to give life to a representative democracy. Application of this principle can be found within programs and laws that states have implemented based in a variety of areas concerns for that particular state. Health, education, equality, immigration are a few examples of entities that civic engagement can shape within a state.\n\n===Application in health===\nStates implement public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society. The State Child Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), for example, is the largest public investment in child health care aiding over 11 million uninsured children in the United States. \"This statewide health insurance program for low-income children was associated with improved access, utilization, and quality of care, suggesting that SCHIP has the potential to improve health care for low-income American children\".<ref>Szilagyi, Peter G., et al. \"Evaluation of a state health insurance program for low-income children: implications for state child health insurance programs.\" ''Pediatrics'' 105.2 (2000): 363\u201371</ref> States take part in the program and sculpt it to better fit the needs of that state's demographics, making their healthcare and the civic engagement process of individuals that take part in the program as well help reform and fix it apart of the state's identity.\n\n===In comparison with other countries===\nStates practicing public involvement and implementing public health programs to better benefit the needs of the society is a concept that is also shared by other countries, such as England. A study conducted by Department of Primary Care, University of Liverpool, the Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol,  the Department of Geography and Geology, McMaster Institute of Environment and Health, McMaster University, Avon Health Authority, the School of Journalism, Tom Hopkinson Centre for Media Research, Media and Cultural Studies, Cardiff University, and the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis, McMaster University stated that \"There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\">Litva, Andrea, et al. \"'The public is too subjective': public involvement at different levels of health-care decision making.\" ''Social Science & Medicine'' 54.12 (2002): 1825\u201337.</ref>\n\nTheir research included critical examination of the degree of involvement by the public in healthcare decision making. It is suggested that \"public participation in decision making can promote goals, bind individuals or groups together, impart a sense of competence and responsibility and help express political or civic identity\".<ref name=\"Litva, Andrea 2002\" /> The action of the citizens aimed at influencing decisions of representatives ultimately affects the state as a whole. Voting is a key component in civic engagement for the voice of the masses to be heard.\n\n===Importance of voter turnout===\n[[File:I voted on November 8 2016.jpg|thumb|Voter turn out sticker]]\nThe goal for state government in elections is to promote civic engagement.

In their study they sampled a small group from a metropolitan area, the difference between both generations varies as the children who were in high school which is 87.5% were stated to be civically engaged. Whereas for the parents they were not civically engaged in issues but developed \"bilcultural consciousness\" such as sending money back their original country of origin and these participants saw it as their duty in their current state of opportunity to be civically engaged.<ref>Jensen, Lene Arnett. \"Immigrants' Cultural Identities As Sources Of Civic Engagement.\" ''Applied Developmental Science'' 12.2 (2008): 74\u201383.

One of the areas the study covered was television and its effects on social and civic engagements. Shah writes that Putnam found the more TV a person watches, the less they are active in outside activities. This is shown with the rise of TV in the 60s and the fall of civic engagements. They found that though news and educational programming can actually aide in a citizen's knowledge, but the lack of engaging in outside activities and social events hurts civic engagement in general.<ref>Shah, D.

Xenos and Moy found that the internet does help civic engagement but also give \"unjustifiable euphoria, abrupt and equally unjustifiable skepticism, and gradual realization that web-based human interaction really does have unique and politically significant properties\".<ref>Xenos, M., & Moy, P.

The four different ways include upgrading and providing e-services, making information more transparent, allowing e-democracy, and a service they call co-production.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.knightfoundation.org/articles/four-ideas-on-how-tech-can-increase-civic-engagement|title=Knight Foundation|website=www.knightfoundation.org|access-date=2016-11-29}}</ref> E-services would allow digital technologies to improve the efficiency of urban services within a city. This would allow the services to become more effective as well as give the public a way to get involved. E-Democracy and Co-Production would work by allowing citizens to shape public policy by allowing them to partake in actions through technology. The Knight Foundation claims technology can make information more transparent, allowing the public to access the information and get involved.\n\nThere are countries, like Romania, where the new technologies started to influence the civic participation, in the last years. New media is becoming a factor of increasing civic mobilization for the new generations. New studies about that, at [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] from [[SNSPA]], [[Romania]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civicparticipation.ro/|title=SNSPA \u2013 Center for Civic Participation and Democracy|website=civicparticipation.ro|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-06}}</ref> [[Center for Civic Participation and Democracy]] (CPD) is a unit of research, analysis, and evaluation of citizen participation in the democratic process, both at the national and [[European Union|European]] level.Created at the [[National University of Political Studies and Public Administration|National School of Political Science and Public Administration]], CPD brings together experts in areas such as Political Science, Sociology, Administrative Sciences, Communications, International Relations and European Studies and it objectifies the SNSPA role and status of ''School of governance''.

According to Diann Cameron Kelly, \"When our young children serve their communities through volunteerism, political participation or through vocal activism, they are more likely to emerge...voting and serving all aspects of society\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Civic readiness: Preparing toddlers and young children for civic education and sustained engagement|author=Kelly, DC|journal=National Civic Review|date=Winter 2008|volume=97|issue= 4|pages=55\u201359|doi=10.1002/ncr.234}}</ref>   Kelly argues that children should be taught how their community works and who chooses the rules we live by even before they enter school.  Other voices maintain that civic education is a lifelong process, even for those who make decisions on behalf of the citizens they serve.\n\nTo answer this challenge, the incorporation of [[service-learning]] into collegiate course design has gained acceptance as a pedagogy that links curricular content with civic education. In a recent study, students who participated in service learning even one time appear to have made gains in knowledge of and commitment to civic engagement when compared to non-service learners.<ref>Prentice, M. & G.

Edwin Fogelman, author of ''Civic Engagement at the University of Minnesota,'' states that true civic engagement can only be practiced by those living within a Democracy. According to Fogelman, civic engagement is largely shaped by schools. Education institutions have the skills to foster \"civic competence, critical thinking, and Public Spirit, which empower citizens to become engaged\". Many claim that civic engagement ought to become part of the curriculum and that higher education institutions should provide opportunities to become engaged such as internships, service-learning, and community based activities. Institutions also need to provide outlets where students can have open discussions over concerns and controversial issues.<ref>Fogelman, Edwin. \"Civic Engagement At The University Of Minnesota.\" ''Journal of Public Affairs'' 6.(2002): 103.

The university strives to get students involved in the local community to become more aware and civically engaged.
