Ward managed to drive the small Mexican force away and decided to stay the night to rest his men.\n\nOn March 14, 1836, Ward and King were attacked by Urrea and more than 200 Mexican soldiers as they were about to leave. This detachment was part of Urrea's larger force of nearly 1,200 men. The same day, General Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]]. Fannin sent word to the men at Refugio to rendezvous with his command at Victoria.

The column had traveled about 6 miles when Fannin ordered a halt to rest his animals. At about 3 pm, Mexican cavalry appeared. The Texians immediately formed a [[Infantry square|hollow square]] with their wagons and cannon placed in each corner for defense as Gen. Urrea's forces attacked. After a fierce battle, the Mexicans lost about 100 to 200 killed and wounded; Texian losses were seven to nine killed and 60 wounded. Facing overwhelming odds, though, Fannin and his troops surrendered the next day, at the [[Battle of Coleto]].<ref name=hardin173>Hardin (1994), p. 173</ref>\n\n==The Goliad massacre==\n{{Main article|Goliad massacre}}\nThe Mexicans took the Texans back to Goliad, where they were held as prisoners at Fort Defiance. The Texans thought they would likely be set free in a few weeks. General Urrea left Goliad, leaving command to Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla. Urrea wrote to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texans.  Urrea wrote in his diary that he \"... wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.\" On March 26, 1836, 19:00, Santa Anna ordered Portilla to execute the prisoners.<ref name=hardin173/>\n\nThe next day, [[Palm Sunday]], March 27, 1836, Colonel Portilla had 400 Texans marched out of Fort Defiance into three columns on the Bexar Road, San Patricio Road, and Victoria Road. They were shot point blank, between two rows of Mexican soldiers, and any survivors were clubbed or knifed to death.<ref name=hardin173/>\n\nThe 40 wounded men who could not walk were executed inside the fort compound. Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded, and seated in a chair (due to his leg wound from the battle). He made three requests: he asked for his personal possessions to be sent to his family, to be shot in his heart and not his face, and to be given a Christian burial. The soldiers took his belongings, shot him in the face, and burned Fannin's body along with the other Texans who died that day.<ref name=hardin174>Hardin (1994), p. 174</ref><ref>[http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm \"Frequently Asked Questions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309031543/http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm |date=March 9, 2013 }}, Presidio La Bahia</ref>\n\nTwenty-eight Texans escaped by feigning death and other means.

Fannin sent Lieutenant Colonel [[William Ward (Texas)|William Ward]] and about 120 men to King's aid. Ward managed to drive the small Mexican force away and decided to stay the night to rest his men.\n\nOn March 14, 1836, Ward and King were attacked by Urrea and more than 200 Mexican soldiers as they were about to leave. This detachment was part of Urrea's larger force of nearly 1,200 men. The same day, General Houston ordered Fannin to retreat to [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]]. Fannin sent word to the men at Refugio to rendezvous with his command at Victoria. Other dispatches were intercepted by the Centralista forces, informing them of Fannin's plans.<ref name=Goliad>{{cite web|last1=Roell|first1=Craig H.|last2=Davenport|first2=Herbert|title=Goliad Campaign of 1836|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qdg02|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref> Fannin needed means of transport and had sent [[Albert C.

The column had traveled about 6 miles when Fannin ordered a halt to rest his animals. At about 3 pm, Mexican cavalry appeared. The Texians immediately formed a [[Infantry square|hollow square]] with their wagons and cannon placed in each corner for defense as Gen. Urrea's forces attacked. After a fierce battle, the Mexicans lost about 100 to 200 killed and wounded; Texian losses were seven to nine killed and 60 wounded. Facing overwhelming odds, though, Fannin and his troops surrendered the next day, at the [[Battle of Coleto]].<ref name=hardin173>Hardin (1994), p. 173</ref>\n\n==The Goliad massacre==\n{{Main article|Goliad massacre}}\nThe Mexicans took the Texans back to Goliad, where they were held as prisoners at Fort Defiance. The Texans thought they would likely be set free in a few weeks. General Urrea left Goliad, leaving command to Colonel Jose Nicolas de la Portilla. Urrea wrote to Santa Anna to ask for clemency for the Texans.  Urrea wrote in his diary that he \"... wished to elude these orders as far as possible without compromising my personal responsibility.\" On March 26, 1836, 19:00, Santa Anna ordered Portilla to execute the prisoners.<ref name=hardin173/>\n\nThe next day, [[Palm Sunday]], March 27, 1836, Colonel Portilla had 400 Texans marched out of Fort Defiance into three columns on the Bexar Road, San Patricio Road, and Victoria Road. They were shot point blank, between two rows of Mexican soldiers, and any survivors were clubbed or knifed to death.<ref name=hardin173/>\n\nThe 40 wounded men who could not walk were executed inside the fort compound. Fannin was the last to be executed, after seeing his men killed. He was taken by Mexican soldiers to the courtyard in front of the chapel, blindfolded, and seated in a chair (due to his leg wound from the battle). He made three requests: he asked for his personal possessions to be sent to his family, to be shot in his heart and not his face, and to be given a Christian burial. The soldiers took his belongings, shot him in the face, and burned Fannin's body along with the other Texans who died that day.<ref name=hardin174>Hardin (1994), p. 174</ref><ref>[http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm \"Frequently Asked Questions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309031543/http://www.presidiolabahia.org/frequently_asked_questions.htm |date=March 9, 2013 }}, Presidio La Bahia</ref>\n\nTwenty-eight Texans escaped by feigning death and other means. Three known survivors escaped to Houston's army, where they fought in the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. In numerous accounts of the Goliad Massacre, a Mexican woman, [[Francita Alavez]], rescued about 20 Texan soldiers; she became known as \"The Angel of Goliad\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/goliadangel.htm|title=Sons of Dewitt Colony Texas, The Angel of Goliad|publisher=Texas A&M University|accessdate=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205105032/http://www.tamu.edu/ccbn/dewitt/goliadangel.htm|archivedate=December 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other people were known to have rescued prisoners.\n\nAt Victoria, the German-Mexican officer [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Holzinger]] saved two German Texans captured among King's men and 26 of Ward's troops by claiming to need them to build boats and transport cannon across the San Antonio River.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brister|first1=Louis F.|title=Juan Jos\u00e9 Holzinger|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fhoaa|website=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=January 11, 2015}}</ref> In addition, Colonel Garay, Father Maloney (also referred as Molloy), Urrea's wife, and an unnamed girl were credited with rescuing prisoners during the [[Goliad Campaign]].\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n[[File:James W.
