In May 1983, with the growth of suburban Westchester, the Guard unit abandoned Westchester Air National Guard Base and moved to [[Stewart International Airport]], in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]].\n\nThe first scheduled airline flights were by [[American Airlines]] in late 1949 with a weekday morning flight from New York [[LaGuardia Airport]] to HPN continuing to [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] and beyond and returning in the evening. [[Mohawk Airlines]] replaced American in 1955; Mohawk and successor [[Allegheny Airlines]] served HPN until 1979. The first scheduled jet flight was a Mohawk [[BAC One-Eleven]] in 1965. Before the federal [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978, the airport was served in 1976 by Allegheny Airlines [[BAC One-Eleven]]s and by several commuter air carriers including Air Speed, [[Command Airways]] and [[Commuter Airlines]].<ref>February 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide</ref> [[Air Florida]] arrived in 1980 and [[United Airlines]] during the mid 1980s.

New start up carriers [[Air Florida]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Carnival Air Lines]] and [[Midway Airlines (1993\u20132003)|Midway Airlines]] also served the airport. [[AirTran Airways]] began service at the airport in 2006 with flights to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]] and [[West Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]. These flights ended on August 11, 2012.

Cape Air introduced service to [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]] in [[New Hampshire]] in early 2010. All Cape Air flights depart and arrive from the [[Signature Flight Support]] facility south of the Main Terminal due to a lack of ticket counter space in the main terminal building.\n\nIn June 2010, a regional airline affiliate for [[Air Canada]] announced it would cease all flights into the airport. Commuter [[code sharing]] service with [[Beechcraft]] turboprop aircraft was flown on behalf of Air Canada for several years between the airport and Toronto.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This ended international flights until service to the Bahamas began in 2011.  However, the airport currently does not have any international nonstop service.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, [[American Airlines]] ended its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional airline service to the airport and instead introduced [[American Connection]] flights operated by [[Chautauqua Airlines]] as a replacement flying smaller [[Embraer ERJ-140]] regional jet aircraft. Later, the American Connection name was dropped and American Eagle service returned.\n\nIn 2013, [[Delta Air Lines]] announced that it would begin seasonal service to [[Orlando]] starting in December of that year. This service is currently operated on a seasonal basis by regional [[code sharing]] affiliate [[Delta Connection]].\n\nIn December 2015, Tradewind Aviation began service to the [[Morrisville-Stowe State Airport|Morrisville-Stowe Airport]] in northern Vermont.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vtdigger.org/2015/09/18/passenger-service-from-morrisville-to-nyc-area-takes-flight/ | title=Passenger service from Morrisville to NYC area to take flight | publisher=VTDigger.com | date=September 18, 2015 | accessdate=September 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[American Airlines]] announced nonstop service to [[Miami International Airport]] via its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] subsidiary.

As of February 2020, the airline continues to use this aircraft for flights on the HPN-ATL route along with the [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ900]].\n\nThe airport limits the number of arriving and departing passengers to 240 per half hour or the airline is fined. Officially, this is said to improve service, but likely exists to pacify anti-airport residents in neighboring communities.<ref>https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/04/06/westchester-airport-limits/82631862/</ref>\n\nOn April 23, 2020, local authorities announced that the airport would close on April 27 and remain closed to general aviation for about a week and commercial air carriers for about a month to allow Runway 16/34 to be repaved, a project that was originally scheduled to last about four months with work proceeding only late at night. The decision was made to close down the airport completely after [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on aviation|drastic coronavirus-related air travel cuts]] reduced the number of daily commercial flights at the airport from about 40 to only one.<ref name=nyt_23Apr20/>\n\n==Noise abatement procedures==\nIn its effort to reduce aircraft noise pollution into neighboring communities, Westchester County Airport maintains six major noise abatement programs in effect daily. Its Voluntary Restraint from Flying Program (VRFF), sometimes referred to as a voluntary curfew,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westchestergov.com/airport/noise_abatement/FLYER.pdf|title=It's Not Just an Airport, it's a Neighborhood|last=Government|first=Westchester County|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012181605/http://www.westchestergov.com/airport/noise_abatement/FLYER.pdf|archivedate=October 12, 2007|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}</ref> which helped to assuage airport noise complainants by requesting that all operators refrain from flying into the airport between midnight and 6:30 a.m. daily. Those that breach the VRFF are reminded of the initiative and notified of any noise complaints that may have resulted from their operations. \n\nThe airport's Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring System (ANOMS) collects noise data from remote noise monitoring terminals, and registered aircraft and community noise levels are subsequently reported and published in the Airport Monitor. The High Range Noise Event (HRNE) Program at the airport works in conjunction with this system; ANOMS staff can identity any operator who causes a maximum noise level event of 90.0 decibels or higher at any of its remote noise monitor terminals and advise them to prevent future noise level transgressions. As of April 2020, there are no fines, penalties, or aircraft restrictions associated with this program. \n\nAdditionally, the airport prohibits intersection takeoffs from its runways and restricts maintenance runups and use of reverse thrust. It also employs Advanced Authorization for operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airport.westchestergov.com/about-us/environmental-management-system/noise-abatement|title=Noise Office|website=airport.westchestergov.com|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Local context==\nFollowing several renovations and discussions about the airport's viability,<ref>{{Cite news| first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | title= The Talk of Westchester County Airport; Airport Plan: A Travelers' Oasis or a Threat to Neighbors? | date=December 7, 1989 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D81730F934A35751C1A96F948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = January 15, 2008 | language = }}</ref> HPN is currently served by six passenger airlines with flights to sixteen destinations throughout the [[United States]].

This enables operators to report the airport's impacts on surface water, groundwater, and noise. Airport-wide environmental management practices are also continually revised with this technology, and annual objectives and targets are determined to avoid or mitigate adverse environmental impacts. In addition, airport employees receive environmental training. In 2004, HPN was the third airport in the U.S. to achieve this level of environmental performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airport.westchestergov.com/environmental-management-system?task=view |title=Environmental Management System - ISO 14001 Certified |publisher=Airport.westchestergov.com |date=April 10, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] published the \"New York Statewide Airport Economic Impact Study,\" highlighting the economic impacts of public-use airports in New York state for fiscal year 2009.

Some of the FBOs are particularly luxurious, providing [[limousine]] transportation services and deluxe surroundings.\n\nThere are three flight schools.  Performance Flight operates out of the Million Air at Hangar M, while Academy of Aviation operates out of Ross Aviation West at Hangar T. Wings Air offers helicopter flight training out of Hangar T. Additionally, the [http://www.wfc-hpn.org/ Westchester Flying Club], a private organization of pilots, is based at the airport as well as the [http://www.westchesteraviation.org/ Westchester Aviation Association], a not-for-profit organization which promotes aviation education and understanding on the part of government authorities and the public.\n\nWestchester County Airport is also the home of the [[New York Wing Civil Air Patrol]] headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).\n\nAircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews.  The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time.  The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies.  All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments.  For example, the Purchase Fire Department handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal.  EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation.

[[Mohawk Airlines]] replaced American in 1955; Mohawk and successor [[Allegheny Airlines]] served HPN until 1979. The first scheduled jet flight was a Mohawk [[BAC One-Eleven]] in 1965. Before the federal [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978, the airport was served in 1976 by Allegheny Airlines [[BAC One-Eleven]]s and by several commuter air carriers including Air Speed, [[Command Airways]] and [[Commuter Airlines]].<ref>February 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide</ref> [[Air Florida]] arrived in 1980 and [[United Airlines]] during the mid 1980s.

Cape Air introduced service to [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]] in [[New Hampshire]] in early 2010. All Cape Air flights depart and arrive from the [[Signature Flight Support]] facility south of the Main Terminal due to a lack of ticket counter space in the main terminal building.\n\nIn June 2010, a regional airline affiliate for [[Air Canada]] announced it would cease all flights into the airport. Commuter [[code sharing]] service with [[Beechcraft]] turboprop aircraft was flown on behalf of Air Canada for several years between the airport and Toronto.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This ended international flights until service to the Bahamas began in 2011.  However, the airport currently does not have any international nonstop service.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, [[American Airlines]] ended its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional airline service to the airport and instead introduced [[American Connection]] flights operated by [[Chautauqua Airlines]] as a replacement flying smaller [[Embraer ERJ-140]] regional jet aircraft. Later, the American Connection name was dropped and American Eagle service returned.\n\nIn 2013, [[Delta Air Lines]] announced that it would begin seasonal service to [[Orlando]] starting in December of that year.

As of February 2020, the airline continues to use this aircraft for flights on the HPN-ATL route along with the [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ900]].\n\nThe airport limits the number of arriving and departing passengers to 240 per half hour or the airline is fined. Officially, this is said to improve service, but likely exists to pacify anti-airport residents in neighboring communities.<ref>https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/04/06/westchester-airport-limits/82631862/</ref>\n\nOn April 23, 2020, local authorities announced that the airport would close on April 27 and remain closed to general aviation for about a week and commercial air carriers for about a month to allow Runway 16/34 to be repaved, a project that was originally scheduled to last about four months with work proceeding only late at night. The decision was made to close down the airport completely after [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on aviation|drastic coronavirus-related air travel cuts]] reduced the number of daily commercial flights at the airport from about 40 to only one.<ref name=nyt_23Apr20/>\n\n==Noise abatement procedures==\nIn its effort to reduce aircraft noise pollution into neighboring communities, Westchester County Airport maintains six major noise abatement programs in effect daily. Its Voluntary Restraint from Flying Program (VRFF), sometimes referred to as a voluntary curfew,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westchestergov.com/airport/noise_abatement/FLYER.pdf|title=It's Not Just an Airport, it's a Neighborhood|last=Government|first=Westchester County|format=PDF|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012181605/http://www.westchestergov.com/airport/noise_abatement/FLYER.pdf|archivedate=October 12, 2007|accessdate=January 15, 2008}}</ref> which helped to assuage airport noise complainants by requesting that all operators refrain from flying into the airport between midnight and 6:30 a.m. daily. Those that breach the VRFF are reminded of the initiative and notified of any noise complaints that may have resulted from their operations. \n\nThe airport's Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring System (ANOMS) collects noise data from remote noise monitoring terminals, and registered aircraft and community noise levels are subsequently reported and published in the Airport Monitor. The High Range Noise Event (HRNE) Program at the airport works in conjunction with this system; ANOMS staff can identity any operator who causes a maximum noise level event of 90.0 decibels or higher at any of its remote noise monitor terminals and advise them to prevent future noise level transgressions. As of April 2020, there are no fines, penalties, or aircraft restrictions associated with this program. \n\nAdditionally, the airport prohibits intersection takeoffs from its runways and restricts maintenance runups and use of reverse thrust. It also employs Advanced Authorization for operations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://airport.westchestergov.com/about-us/environmental-management-system/noise-abatement|title=Noise Office|website=airport.westchestergov.com|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Local context==\nFollowing several renovations and discussions about the airport's viability,<ref>{{Cite news| first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | title= The Talk of Westchester County Airport; Airport Plan: A Travelers' Oasis or a Threat to Neighbors? | date=December 7, 1989 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D81730F934A35751C1A96F948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = January 15, 2008 | language = }}</ref> HPN is currently served by six passenger airlines with flights to sixteen destinations throughout the [[United States]].

This enables operators to report the airport's impacts on surface water, groundwater, and noise. Airport-wide environmental management practices are also continually revised with this technology, and annual objectives and targets are determined to avoid or mitigate adverse environmental impacts. In addition, airport employees receive environmental training. In 2004, HPN was the third airport in the U.S. to achieve this level of environmental performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airport.westchestergov.com/environmental-management-system?task=view |title=Environmental Management System - ISO 14001 Certified |publisher=Airport.westchestergov.com |date=April 10, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2011, the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] published the \"New York Statewide Airport Economic Impact Study,\" highlighting the economic impacts of public-use airports in New York state for fiscal year 2009. The study noted that HPN was one of only three airports in the state that increased its enplanements, surpassing the U.S. benchmark. It also noted that the cumulative economic activity for the airport was approximately $736 million.<ref>https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/operating/opdm/aviation/benefits</ref>\n\n===Approaches===\nThe airport can be accessed from [[I-684]]'s Exit 2 onto [[New York State Route 120]]. More directly, the terminals are accessed by NY Route 135.\n\n==IATA code==\nThe [[IATA]] code for Westchester County Airport is '''HPN'''. There is a debate in the origins of this code: many believe it is derived from the name of the city, White Plains (IATA codes normally do not begin with W because those are reserved for radio signals), while others believe the IATA code represents the first letter of the three neighboring communities, [[Harrison, New York|Harrison]], [[Purchase, New York|Purchase]], and [[North Castle, New York|North Castle]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.directorym.com/Westchester_County_Airport-a853975.html |title=Westchester County Airport's Call Letters Dispute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110204857/http://articles.directorym.com/Westchester_County_Airport-a853975.html |archivedate=January 10, 2008  }}</ref> The full [[ICAO]] code for Westchester County Airport is KHPN.\n[[File:HPN (July 2016).jpg|thumb|Westchester County Airport (HPN), July 2016]]\n\n==Facilities and aircraft==\nWestchester County Airport covers 702 [[acre]]s (284 [[hectare|ha]]) at an [[elevation]] of 439 feet (134 m) above [[mean sea level]].

Although varied in services offered, the FBOs at Westchester County Airport provide [[Jet A]] and [[100LL]] fueling services, repairs and maintenance, aircraft tiedowns, [[de-icing]], [[US Customs|United States Customs]], and other aircraft services. Some of the FBOs are particularly luxurious, providing [[limousine]] transportation services and deluxe surroundings.\n\nThere are three flight schools.  Performance Flight operates out of the Million Air at Hangar M, while Academy of Aviation operates out of Ross Aviation West at Hangar T. Wings Air offers helicopter flight training out of Hangar T. Additionally, the [http://www.wfc-hpn.org/ Westchester Flying Club], a private organization of pilots, is based at the airport as well as the [http://www.westchesteraviation.org/ Westchester Aviation Association], a not-for-profit organization which promotes aviation education and understanding on the part of government authorities and the public.\n\nWestchester County Airport is also the home of the [[New York Wing Civil Air Patrol]] headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).\n\nAircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews.  The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time.  The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies.  All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments.  For example, the Purchase Fire Department handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal.  EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation. There are 316 aircraft, including helicopters, based out of this airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airport.westchestergov.com/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Airport.westchestergov.com |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Terminal===\n[[Image:HPN Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|The gate area in the main terminal]]\n\nWestchester County Airport has one small three-level terminal with six gates, of which only four can be used simultaneously because only four aircraft can be scheduled to use the terminal's ramp at any given time.

The project will expand the terminal by 20% and include additional check-in, screening and passenger waiting areas. The expansion will also include the addition of four new [[Jetbridges|jet bridges]].\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n{{Airport destination list\n<!-- -->\n| [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] | [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]], [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]], [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Washington\u2013National]] (all suspended until June 4, 2020)\n<!-- -->\n| [[Cape Air]] | [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon]] (suspended until May 14, 2020)<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Hyannis Airport|Hyannis]], [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]], [[Provincetown Airport|Provincetown]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Air Lines]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]] (suspended until June 2, 2020)\n<!-- -->\n| [[Delta Connection]] | [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]] (suspended April 16, 2020 through May 21, 2020), [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport|Detroit]] (suspended until May 22, 2020)\n<!-- -->\n| [[JetBlue]] | [[Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Southwest Florida International Airport|Fort Myers]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]], [[Tampa International Airport|Tampa]], [[Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]  (all suspended April 12, 2020 through June 11, 2020)<br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]]<ref>https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181113005796/en/Start-Planning-Summer-JetBlue-Service-Nantucket-Year</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[Rectrix Aviation|Rectrix Shuttle]] | '''Seasonal:''' [[Hyannis Airport|Hyannis]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]]\n<!-- -->\n| [[Tradewind Aviation]] |[[Logan International Airport|Boston]] <br />'''Seasonal:''' [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]], [[Morrisville\u2013Stowe State Airport|Stowe]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liu |first1=Jim |title=Tradewind Aviation adds Westchester County \u2013 Stowe service in W19 |url=https://www.routesonline.com/news/38/airlineroute/287008/tradewind-aviation-adds-westchester-county-stowe-service-in-w19/ |website=Routesonline |accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref>\n<!-- -->\n| [[United Express]] | [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago\u2013O'Hare]] (suspended April 27, 2020 through May 21, 2020)\n<!-- -->\n}}\n[[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]], [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] (and [[Delta Connection]]), [[JetBlue]] and [[United Express]] will not operate flights into Westchester County Airport between April 27, 2020 and May 21, 2020 due to the closure of Runway 16/34.<ref name=\"ainonline.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2020-04-08/hpn-uses-traffic-lull-accelerate-runway-rehab|title=HPN Uses Traffic Lull to Accelerate Runway Rehab|publisher=Aviation International News|date= |accessdate=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n\n===Airline market share===\n{{Bar graph\n| title = '''Carrier Shares for February 2019 \u2013 January 2020'''<ref name=\"transtats.bts.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.transtats.bts.gov/airports.asp?pn=1&Airport=HPN&Airport_Name=White%20Plains,%20NY:%20Westchester%20County&carrier=FACTS |title=OST_R &#124; BTS &#124; Transtats |publisher=Transtats.bts.gov |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref>\n| bar_width   = 45\n| width_units = em\n| label_type  = Carrier\n| data_type   = Passengers (arriving and departing)\n| data_max    = 844,000\n| label1   = [[JetBlue Airways|JetBlue]]\n| data1    = 844,000\n| comment1 = 48.45%\n| label2   = [[PSA Airlines|PSA]]\n| data2    = 244,000\n| comment2 = 14.01%\n| label3   = [[SkyWest Airlines|SkyWest]]\n| data3    = 196,000\n| comment3 = 11.25%\n| label4   = [[Endeavor Air|Endeavor]]\n| data4    = 178,000\n| comment4 = 10.24%\n| label5   = [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]]\n| data5    = 150,000\n| comment5 = 8.62%\n| label6   = Other\n| data6    = 130,000\n| comment6 = 7.43%\n}}\n\n===Top destinations===\n<!--[[File:Westchester County Airport Destinations.gif|300px|thumb|Non-stop destinations from Westchester County Airport]]-->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|+ '''Top 10 busiest domestic destinations from HPN<br />(February 2019 \u2013 January 2020)'''<ref name=\"transtats.bts.gov\"/>\n|-\n!
